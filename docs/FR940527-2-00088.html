Purpose and Substantive Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HOPE 1 program is authorized by title III of the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437aaa), which was added by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 411 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law was subsequently amended by the Housing and Community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992) (1992 Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41126), the Department published a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOFA announcing the availability of $182,047,160 in funding for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation grants for the HOPE for Public and Indian Housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Homeownership Program (HOPE 1). On September 1, 1993 (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 46209), the Department published an amendment to the NOFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the funding being made available by $24,000,000 from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $182,047,160 to $206,047,160 due to the conclusion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing of a reprogramming request. The funds were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriated by the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acts for fiscal year 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved October 28,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991) and fiscal year 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992). In its Fiscal Year 1994 appropriations bill for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Housing and Urban Development, Congress rescinded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $45,000,000 from the amounts remaining available for the HOPE 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program under the Department's fiscal year 1992 appropriation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139) and $130,000,000 from the amounts remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available under the Department's fiscal year 1993 appropriation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389) for a total rescission of $175,000,000 in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of funds made available under the previously published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOFA and amendment. After the rescission, $31,047,160 remained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fund applications pursuant to the NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17560), the Department published a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of award based on procedural error announcing the award of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $24,882,854 to the New Community Corporation in Newark, New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jersey based on a procedural error. The Department allocated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $9,692,854 of the $31,047,160 available under the NOFA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partially fund the New Community Corporation application. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remainder of the New Community Corporation application was funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using amounts appropriated in 1994. After the award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcement, $21,354,306 remained available to fund applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Notice announces that the amount of funds remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for implementation grants for the HOPE 1 under the NOFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was increased from $21,354,306 by $1,087,628 using HOPE 1 funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously awarded for planning and implementation grants in FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 that either were not obligated or were deobligated. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking all of the adjustments into account, the total amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for funding the grants announced by this Notice was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $22,441,934.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Notice also announces that HUD extended the deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for submission of responses to deficiency letters in the HOPE 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for those applicants located within the jurisdiction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD's former Region Three (since renamed the Mid-Atlantic Region)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who were adversely affected in their preparation of responses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency letters as a result of the extraordinarily severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winter weather and consequent office closings during the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 14&hyph;28, 1994. For qualified applicants, the deadline for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting responses to deficiency letters was extended from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 28 to February 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to qualify for an extension of the deadline for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting a response to a deficiency letter for Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grants under the HOPE 1 program, the following requirements had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have been met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The applicant must have submitted a certification with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its response to its deficiency letter describing the reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which justify a delayed submission pursuant to this Notice; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) HUD must have determined that the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately demonstrated that the applicant's ability to prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or submit the required response to a deficiency letter was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially impaired as a result of the extraordinarily severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winter weather and consequent office closings during the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 14&hyph;28, 1994. Once HUD approved the certification, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application would be accepted for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only one applicant requested an extension of the deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for responding to deficiency letters and complied with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements: The Housing Authority of the County of Chester in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pennsylvania. HUD accepted the Housing Authority of the County  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Chester's deficiency response and continued to process its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application in accordance with the established procedures for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HOPE 1 program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 102(a)(4)(C) of the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcement also notifies the public of funding award decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made by the Department for the HOPE 1 program.

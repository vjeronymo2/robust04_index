			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka by </F> TOKYO SHIMBUN correspondents Koichi Obata and Uichiro Oshima;  place and date not given]    [Text] [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Does the Japan New Party [JNP]  intend to form a parliamentary group with Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] by late April, as planned?    [Matsuoka] In a way, I cannot say exactly when that might  happen until the draft budget for the next fiscal year has been  finalized, but we must not delay this matter. Even if the upper  and lower house elections are not held simultaneously, we feel  that we must be prepared to contest next summer's upper house  election and the next lower house general election as a single  set of elections. We do not have very much time.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] It was Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who  originally proposed the formation of a large parliamentary group  composed of all the ruling coalition parties. How do you feel  about this?    [Matsuoka] The prime minister has clearly indicated that the  plan is geared toward the next election. The Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] still fares strongly in local districts. The battle  between the coalition alliance and the LDP is a battle between  reformists and the forces of the old system. Therefore,  reformist-minded political parties (of the coalition alliance)  must unite to carry on this battle. Because this is just about  to happen, there is no time to argue about (regrouping parties  into) a bipolar or tripolar structure.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Under the circumstances in which the Diet is  remaining idle and deliberations on the budget cannot begin,  complaints have been raised even by some members of the ruling  coalition parties against stepping up moves toward a political  realignment. How do you feel about this?    [Matsuoka] We have not thrown the "ball." Neither has the  prime minister. The proposed formation of a parliamentary group  is... well, a "ball" thrown at us by Shinseito.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What kind of new party do you envision after  the formation of a large parliamentary group?    [Matsuoka] It can be expected to take various forms, because  there will be a complex integration of beliefs about democracy,  the Constitution, and other matters. However, I doubt whether  we should rush to form a new party. What is necessary is to  first completely destroy the old system. In addition, it is  necessary for the time being to improve ways to steer the Diet,  rather than to try to form a large parliamentary group. Should  the JNP, Sakigake [Harbinger], and Shinseito unite, they would  turn into a powerful force of about 120 members. We are now  faced with difficult tasks, including a reform of the tax  system. Unless the government has centripetal force -- just as  in the days when the Tanaka faction, which consisted of over a  hundred-odd members, was formed under the LDP -- the Diet cannot  function properly.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The JNP and Sakigake have already formed a  parliamentary group. What will happen to your party's ties with  Sakigake?    [Matsuoka] Prime Minister Hosokawa has suffered very much  (in  connection with the national welfare tax and cabinet reshuffle  issues) as a result of the "ball" thrown by Sakigake's Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (head of Sakigake). If  relations between Hosokawa and Takemura are referred to as an  "engagement," Takemura should devote himself to playing the role  of a housewife and unite his heart with that of the prime  minister at their "household," which is the Prime Minister's  Official Residence. Takemura, however, failed at this.  Sakigake is more to blame for the changed situation (the  deterioration in relations) as it exists now.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it no longer possible to restore the  damaged relations with Sakigake?    [Matsuoka] Sakigake used to be a group of LDP members who  were dedicated to carrying out political reform. They also  share a common political ideology with members of the JNP.  However, what is wrong with them is that they tend to seek a  joining of hands with the LDP. The JNP will absolutely never  ally itself with the LDP. In this respect, Shinseito and the JNP  are in agreement. However, Shinseito continues to drag on the  employment of the old system's political style. The JNP can  still continue to act as a mediator between Sakigake and  Shinseito.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it possible to conceive of forming a  parliamentary group consisting of these three new political  parties?    [Matsuoka] That depends on how members of Sakigake perceive  this new political era. We would like them to look back and  think calmly.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you have any concern about the  possibility  of the JNP becoming a cut field of grass [kusakari-ba --  recruiting ground] for other parties of the ruling coalition?    [Matsuoka] The term "cut field of grass" itself is  old-fashioned and is reminiscent of the old system. The JNP  just has to further strengthen its own identity and continue  associating with other parties.</p>

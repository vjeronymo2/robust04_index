			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: US economy Yesterday's second quarter growth figures from the US are less depressing than they seem. Economic expansion may have slowed to an annualised rate of 1.4 per cent during the second quarter from 2.9 per cent in the first, but that is history. More important for the future is the news on prices. Inflation as measured by the GDP deflator fell to 1.6 per cent from 3.6 per cent. That should help keep long-term interest rates under downward pressure, at least once the forthcoming quarterly government refinancing is out of the way. The 8 per cent jump in new home sales during June also needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. It is often erratic as an indicator, but it does suggest lower long-term rates are again helping the housing market by making mortgages cheaper. UK homeowners may turn green with envy at the thought of 30-year mortgages being available in the US at a fixed rate of less than 8 per cent. But that is the stuff on which recovery feeds.</p>

The  14 members of the certification committee, which include  renowned Chinese aerodynamicists, academic committee members,  chief engineer of the China Aerospace Industrial Corp., Prof.  Zhuan Fenggan, Prof. Dai Changhui, Prof. Lin Yunpei, and other  experts believe that the high Reynolds number transonic wind  tunnel developed by the Institute of Mechanics matches leading  wind tunnels of the world in terms of technical standard and  performance.    The key simulation parameters in an aerodynamic test are the  flight Mach number and Reynolds number. A conventional transonic  wind tunnel can usually simulate the proper Mach number, but the  simulated Reynolds number is typically one or two orders of  magnitude lower than actual flight values. Therefore, some of  the aircraft designed in the 1960s based on data obtained from  conventional transonic wind tunnels developed problems. In an  effort to avoid these problems, the United States, Canada,  Europe, and Japan have invested huge sums of money since the  1970s to develop and construct high Reynolds number wind tunnels.    In the early 1980s, having developed an impulse type  aerodynamic test facility and corresponding experimental  techniques, experts of the Institute of Mechanics proposed the  idea of building a high Reynolds number tubular wind tunnel; the  initial design effort was led by Prof. Zhuan Fenggan. In 1988,  the project was approved by the CAS.    With limited funds, members of the research and development  group were determined to make this project a success. During the  construction, they found innovative approaches that were  compatible with China's limited industrial and economic  resources, and succeeded in building the wind tunnel with a  small investment and very short development cycle. The overall  design has also built-in provisions for further improving the  performance and expanding the utility of the wind tunnel. The  success of this project has paved the way for future development  of high Reynolds number transonic wind tunnels in China.</p>

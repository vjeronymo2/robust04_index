According to Aleksandr Panov, Moscow and Tokyo stand for  strengthening of the regime of nuclear non-proliferation and for  the Korean Peninsular becoming a nuclear-free zone. Both sides,  he noted, consider it necessary to maintain a constant mutual  contact, continue negotiations on the nuclear problem of North  Korea, and probably look for some other approaches as the  present ones proved to be insufficiently effective.    Asked about what joint contribution Moscow and Tokyo could  make to the ensuring of security in the Far East and in the  Asian-Pacific region as a whole, the Russian senior diplomat  said both sides had earlier expressed the coincidence of views  on this problem.    Russia and Japan consider it important, while maintaining  the  existing treaties and agreements, to move towards cooperation on  a subregional level. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that  such a subregional mechanism could be created in particular in  the basin of the Sea of Japan.</p>

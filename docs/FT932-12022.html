			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Nursing home staff to take Ernst &amp; Young to tribunal NINE NURSING home employees are taking receivers Ernst &amp; Young to an industrial tribunal in a dispute over 'laying on' money - the first week's wages which are withheld as a week in hand and paid to workers when their employment ceases. The employees of a nursing home near Darlington, Co Durham, claim the receivers should have paid them their laying on money when the home was sold. Ernst &amp; Young, which ran the home in receivership for more than 18 months after Stainford, the previous owner, went under, is contesting the claim. 'We've taken legal advice and our view is Ernst &amp; Young was never their employer,' said the firm, which is being advised by Newcastle-based solicitors Dickinson Dees. Originally, 19 employees at the 58-bed Greenacres nursing home, formerly called the Gainford nursing home, applied for a tribunal hearing, but 10 pulled out after a pre-hearing assessment. The application is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday in Middlesbrough.</p>

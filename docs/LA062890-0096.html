			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAINS MADE AT CONVENTIONAL FORCES TALKS  </P> <P> East-West talks on cutting conventional forces in Europe were given a major  boost Wednesday when the Soviet Union agreed to proposals on how to reduce the  number of tanks and armored cars in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and  the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> NATO delegates said that at a working meeting of the Conventional Forces in  Europe talks, the Soviet side dropped objections to a Franco-Polish compromise  on definitions and ceilings on how many of the arms each side can hold.  </P> <P> This leaves open the question of new ceilings for artillery, described by  Western delegates as relatively simple, and the whole issue of aircraft, seen  as a much more difficult problem.  </P> <P> "It is a significant step forward," one Western delegate said of the Soviet  decision.  </P> <P> Moscow raised last-minute objections to the compromise two weeks ago, saying it  needed more information on weapons systems.  </P> <P> This raised speculation then that Moscow was trying to slow down the talks  because of concern over German unification, although privately they were  telling Western delegates it was a bureaucratic problem only.  </P> <P> The breakthrough appeared to boost the chances of a conventional forces  agreement this year, opening the way for a summit of the 35-nation Conference  on Security and Cooperation in Europe to discuss the new situation in Europe  with Germany united.  </P> <P> The United States has made a conventional forces agreement a condition of its  participation at such a conference.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITALS CAN SUE STATES OVER MEDICAID COSTS  </P> <P> In a potentially costly defeat for state and federal governments, the Supreme  Court ruled Thursday that hospitals may sue in federal court to obtain a  "reasonable and adequate" reimbursement for treating needy patients.  </P> <P> Since 1965, the government has required hospitals to treat the poor under the  Medicaid program, and it has promised in law that they would be paid for their  services. Increasingly, however, neither state nor federal officials have lived  up to that promise.  </P> <P> Hospitals in California were paid an average of only 61% of the cost of  treating needy patients last year and were shortchanged nearly $1 billion under  MediCal, according to figures compiled by the California Assn. of Hospitals and  Health Systems.  </P> <P> On a 5-4 vote, the high court said that hospitals have a right to get a  "reasonable and adequate" reimbursement and may go to a federal court to seek  the money.  </P> <P> "This is an extremely important ruling for us," said Christine Hall, general  counsel for the state hospital association in Sacramento. "We have been giving  millions of dollars in uncompensated care. It is critical for us to be able to  go to court to challenge the reimbursement policies."  </P> <P> Faced with higher costs and inadequate reimbursements, many hospitals have cut  back services to the poor. In other instances, they have passed on the costs of  treating poor patients to patients who pay and to those patients' insurance  companies.  </P> <P> The Medicaid program is funded jointly by the federal and state governments.  The U.S. government, which pays at least 50% of the program's cost, sets  general regulations, but states devise their own reimbursement formulas for  hospitals.  </P> <P> In 1980, Congress passed legislation commonly called the Boren Amendment that  requires the states to pay hospitals a "reasonable and adequate (reimbursement)  to meet the costs, which must be incurred by efficiently and economically  operated facilities."  </P> <P> Each year, the states assure Washington that their payment levels are  reasonable -- even though the hospitals say that they are being badly  shortchanged.  </P> <P> Four years ago, the Virginia Hospital Assn. filed a lawsuit against the state,  contending that the 1980 amendment gave the hospitals a civil right that could  be enforced in federal court. Last year, an appeals court in Richmond, Va.,  agreed, but the Virginia governor filed an appeal with the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Speaking for the court Thursday, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. said the "Boren  Amendment to the Medicaid Act creates a right, enforceable in a private cause  of action" by the hospitals to seek a reasonable and adequate reimbursement  from the state.  </P> <P> Brennan's decision in the case (Wilder vs. Virginia Hospital Assn., 88-2043)  was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and  John Paul Stevens. The dissenters, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,  contended that the reimbursement policies are to be decided by state and  federal officials, not the courts.  </P> <P> Duke University law professor Walter Dellinger said that the ruling marks a  major shift in how the Medicaid program will be funded.  </P> <P> "For a quarter of a century, it has been the public policy of the United States  to provide medical treatment to the very poorest Americans," said Dellinger,  who represented the Virginia hospitals. "The court has now recognized that  Congress intended this cost to be borne by the federal and state governments,  not by the hospitals."  </P> <P> Dellinger said that Virginia hospitals were losing about $1 million a week  treating Medicaid patients. "Now they can go to court to get an adequate level  of reimbursement," he said.  </P> <P> A brief filed on behalf of the 50 states had urged the court to overturn the  Virginia ruling, arguing that their hard-pressed treasuries could be hit with  hundreds of millions of dollars in higher costs. The Bush Administration also  had urged the court to rule for the states. In 1988, the Medicaid program cost  the federal government $29 billion.  </P> <P> If federal courts were to rule that hospitals deserve reimbursement for the  full cost of treating Medicaid patients, the states could face billions of  dollars in higher costs.  </P> <P> Officials of the Department of Health Services in Sacramento refused to comment  on the high court ruling Thursday, saying that they had not yet had a chance to  read it.  </P></p>

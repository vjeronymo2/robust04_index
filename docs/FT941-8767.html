			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / US charge for asylum seekers Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, confirmed yesterday that the US would become the first nation to charge a fee to applicants for political asylum. But she added that the charge - Dollars 130 per head  - would be waived for those who clearly could not afford it. The Immigration and Naturalisation Service, under new rules that could take effect as early as October, will also delay issuing temporary work permits to asylum seekers for 150 days as part of a drive to cut the asylum backlog and to prevent abuse of the system. Permits are normally issued within 90 days pending the adjudication process, which may take years. Rather than risk eventual deportation, many applicants use work permits to create new identities and disappear into the underground economy. The income from the fees will be used to double the size of the asylum processing corps, which is currently only 150-strong. The asylum backlog already stands at 364,000.</p>

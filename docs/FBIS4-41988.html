			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>   [Text] Oslo June 29 TASS -- Russia's cooperation with NATO  is extremely important in itself but to Norway "it is of special  interest", Norwegian Defence Minister Jorgen Kosmo told  ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview on Wednesday.    The agreement, concluded on June 22, on large-scale  cooperation between Russia and NATO "opens up new possibilities  for Norway's close cooperation with its nearest neighbour --  Russia", Kosmo said.    Norway is convinced, the minister said, that "it is possible  to develop and strengthen Norwegian-Russian contacts in the  field of defence and security in the best way under the  Partnership-for-Peace programme".    "We are interested in adding specific programmes to the  Russia-NATO agreement, which could contribute to further  strengthening goodneigbourly relations between Norway and Russia.    "Russia -- a great power with a huge population -- possesses  an economic potential, nuclear weapons and military might.  Considering these factors, there is no need for Russia to ask  for a special place within the framework of cooperation with  NATO. Russia already holds it due to these circumstances.    "Your country does not need to sign a special document to  specify its special role. Without any special agreements,  Russia can exert a great influence on the development of the  Partnership-for-Peace programme and on the political situation  in Europe as a whole.    "It remains for Russia only to act as befits a great power,"  the Norwegian defence minister emphasised.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Books: With respect for the sanctity of life LIFE'S DOMINION by Ronald Dworkin HarperCollins Pounds 17.50, 272 pages LA Rochefoucauld said that death, like the sun, should not be stared at. Ronald Dworkin does not take his advice. In this outstanding book he addresses the agonized problem of death inflicted, by choice, in the form of abortion and euthanasia, his aim being to elucidate what is truly at stake in this confused and acrimonious debate that surrounds the matter, and to suggest ways of resolving the difficulties it involves. Dworkin is the world's leading philosopher of law. In this book he shows that complicated questions can be discussed with originality, profound insight and utter clarity. He takes his readers from courtrooms and hospital wards to the most abstract considerations of the sacredness of life and the exigencies of law. By the book's end one senses that the whole shape of the debate has been transformed. From now on there can be no discussion of abortion and euthanasia which does not start from here. Abortion means deliberately killing a developing human foetus, and euthanasia means giving, out of kindness, an easeful death to a sufferer. Both arouse great controversy and passion. Dworkin describes the furore currently raging over abortion in America and Europe as the modern equivalent of the 17th century's wars of religion. In Dworkin's view much of the debate's bitterness stems from a serious mistake about what is really at issue. Most participants argue as if the main dispute is about interests and rights. Their rhetoric is framed in terms of a foetus's interest in staying alive, and its right to be protected by the community in order to do so. But Dworkin argues that what actually underlies both the 'pro-life' and pro-abortion positions is a view about something different: namely, the sacredness or inviolability of life. Both parties, he says, believe that life has intrinsic value; but each takes a different view of what that implies for personal and political decisions about abortion. The same considerations apply to euthanasia. The concept of the sacredness of life is not an exclusively religious one. Atheists also regard life as sacred in Dworkin's sense. By 'sacredness' here is meant intrinsic value and importance. This is not the view that life's worth is such that the more we have of it the better, for clearly overpopulation is a disvalue. But once an individual life exists it is hugely important for its own sake. Consider a painting by Leonardo: the destruction of such a thing would be regarded as a terrible loss, not merely for the instrumental worth it has in pleasing or instructing us, but because of its own special value as a high achievement of human creativity. How much more valuable still, Dworkin says, is human existence itself. Each human life therefore commands respect for its own sake, because of what goes into its making and what its possibilities are. To end such a life is to frustrate its possibilities and to waste its value. For conservative opinion, this implies that abortion is never, or very rarely, justified. For liberal opinion, abortion is justified whenever the continuation of a pregnancy would have an especially bad effect on other lives by frustrating or wasting them, or would result in a deeply frustrated life for the child itself if it were born. But for both sides of the argument the central issue is the merit of life itself. The same thoughts apply in the case of people suffering incurable and perhaps agonizing disease or injury. Recently in Britain a doctor was found guilty of attempted murder for giving a lethal injection to a woman suffering so much pain that she screamed whenever touched. In Dworkin's view the question of life's value to the sufferer is the central concern here. In the Netherlands there is a tacit understanding that doctors can help such patients die peacefully and quickly provided certain guidelines are observed. Elsewhere, many sufferers are condemned by our scruples to lives which are terrible to live. Dworkin devotes a chapter to the problem of Alzheimer's patients, a growing population of sufferers with suffering families who, until medical science finds a rescue, undergo a long and frightening living death. Their plight throws the question of life's value into stark relief. In the book's central chapters Dworkin brilliantly applies these ideas to a careful account of the practical and legal questions at the heart of contemporary controversy. For his own part he favours the liberal line in permitting abortion and euthanasia whenever the case for them is cogent. But his expressed hope is that redefining the debate as one about the best way to respect and protect life considered as intrinsically valuable - as 'sacred' - will help to relax the ferocity of opposition between the debate's warring parties. It should, he says, help to bring both sides together to see that their disagreement is at bottom a spiritual one; for if a tolerant society can embrace differences of religious and political views, why should it not do so in regard to the question of how best to respect life's sanctity?</p>

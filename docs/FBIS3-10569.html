			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The main leaders of the national labor unions have  deemed historic the decisions adopted yesterday by the national  workers' congress that was organized by the CUT [United Workers  Trade Union Federation, the CNT [National Workers Federation],  and the CPT [Paraguayan Confederation of Workers]. It was held  at the National Sports Council stadium. Some 300 grassroots  delegates participated in the congress. One of the most  important conclusions reached was to stage a general strike on 2  May.    A national struggle committee was established, headed by the  top leaders of the labor unions. The committee will be in  charge of coordinating the strike. The leaders said the current  economic policy, as well as the government officials' "lack of  social sensitivity" are behind the call for a general strike.  The last such strike in our country was staged 36 years ago, in  1958.    The leaders who attended the congress also decided to  condition to three issues the presence of the labor unions in  the tripartite round of negotiations on the macro-social policy,  which they have been holding with the government and  entrepreneurs. The first condition calls for the immediate  release of the leaders of the transportation sector labor  unions, who were arrested on 6 March in Quiindy. The second  calls for release of the peasant leaders who are being kept at  the former Security Guard facilities. The third calls for the  automatic dismissal of all members of the Administrative Council  of the Social Welfare Institute and the end to repressive  measures against any demonstrations by workers or peasants.    The workers congress also decided to participate actively,  with all its grassroots, in the peasants' march scheduled for 15  March. The march will start with a gathering at the former  Metropolitan Seminary and parade along Eusebio Ayala Avenue to  Uruguay Square. From there, the demonstrators will try to reach  the National Congress building.    The transportation sector labor unions and some teachers'  organizations will also participate in the march. The teachers  will stage a 24-hour stoppage on that same day.    It was also decided during the congress to support the  general strike to be staged by the urban buses drivers, which  has been scheduled for 21 March. The USTT [Transportation  Sector Workers Trade Union] and the Fetrat [Transportation  Sector Workers Federation] have reported that if Roberto Medina  and Samuel Arguello, the leaders who were arrested in Quiindy,  are not released by tomorrow the transportation sector strike  will be moved forward to 15 March.    The national workers' congress decided to ask the government  to readjust by 40 percent the current minimum wage. It is  expected the government will show signs of willing to meet this  demand before 2 May. If this occurs, the official attitude will  be considered a sign of "goodwill."</p>

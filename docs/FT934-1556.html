			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Government contracts to be opened up Government contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars are to be opened to international competition for the first time following agreement on government procurement concluded this week in Geneva in parallel with the Uruguay Round talks on global trade liberalisation. The agreement, which will cover both national and state-level government contracts, as well as utilities such as water and electricity, will expand tenfold the coverage of contracts open to international bidding, according to staff at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The agreement, finalised this week, will apply to the 12 European Union member states, and 11 other countries ranging from Japan, Hong Kong and Korea to the European Free Trade Association countries, Canada and the US. It will come into force at the beginning of 1996. Under the agreement, foreign suppliers must be given no less favourable treatment in government procurement than national suppliers. This will involve clear rules on how to tender; no use of technical specifications simply to block outside bidders; clear information on how bidders qualify; proper notice of invitations to tender; providing tender documents to potential suppliers; and full information afterwards on who won a contract and on what terms. The US and the European Union have been at loggerheads over procurement contracts since early this year. A breakthrough occurred in May, when negotiators agreed to hive off the telecommunications sector from the procurement package. Talks on a separate telecommunications agreement aim to reach a deal by early 1996. The US has consistently claimed that it is more generous in the government contracts it opens to international bidding. In 1990, it says bidding opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11.3bn) were offered to EU contractors - more than twice the Dollars 7.8bn offered by EU governments in the same year. The EU has replied that new EU procurement rules linked with creation of the European single market have massively increased the contracts open to foreign bidders since 1990. They have complained about US reluctance to include state-level procurement business, much of which is protected by 'Buy America' acts, within the scope of the agreement. They have also fought to include contracts from private-sector companies, such as water and power companies, which operate as effective oligopolies. In many European countries, these are state-owned, and fall under the government procurement accord. After a long dispute over thresholds above which tenders must be open to international bidding, the agreement sets a floor of SDR 130,000 (Pounds 121,000) for central government purchases of goods and services; SDR 200,000 for state or sub-federal bodies; SDR 400,000 for utilities; and SDR 5m for construction contracts. In response to fears that aggrieved bidders would not be able to challenge an award they regarded as suspect, governments have agreed to put domestic procedures in place to mount challenges, and obtain redress.</p>

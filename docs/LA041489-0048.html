			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: A RICH VIEW THROUGH 'LIVING ROOM WINDOW'  </P> <P> Every now and then, an artist hits the bull's eye, or nearly does. Such is the  case with Kathy Shiroki's "Living Room Window," a visually rich, gently  feminist project at Installation in downtown San Diego. The artist worked with  15 other women on the project.  </P> <P> A Zen koan-like text wraps around the large central gallery and defines the  work's theme in metaphor with words made of letters formed by forks, spoons,  knives, carrot peelers, whisks, can openers, drain stoppers and measuring cups.  "When she went on walks" the text reads, "all she took with her was the living  room window. She carried it on her back and when she got tired she balanced it  on top of her head. She walked for miles with her eyes tightly closed balancing  the framed glass until her neck felt like it was sinking into her chest. Only  then would she lower the window, prop it by her feet and stare through it to  see where she was."  </P> <P> In its way, this is a beautiful lament on the usual human condition,  potentially both female and male, especially if office is substituted for  living room and he for she.  </P> <P> A second element of the piece consists of hundreds of small blue plastic slide  viewers of the type suitable for hanging on a key chain. These dangle from the  ceiling on monofilament, forming a cloud of blue rectangles waist high to  shoulder high in front of the text on the walls. A pathway leads through the  middle of the cloud, allowing easy access to the single image within each  viewer.  </P> <P> Here are photographs taken by fifteen women who are Shiroki's acquaintances and  collaborators, and whose lives are her subject. The images are variously  personal, domestic or work-oriented in character. Scenes of kitchens and their  details abound, as do pictures of children and of offices. All the photographs,  at the artist's request, were taken during a single day in these women's lives.  What we see is human life as it's lived by most people: not all that great, not  all that bad.  </P> <P> Finally, a group of framed, typewritten texts mounted near the entrance to the  exhibit offers insight into who the 15 women involved in the project are.  They're between the ages of 23 and 60; are married, single, or divorced; have  or don't have children, and work as housewives or in various private or public  sector jobs. Some of these women's comments about their experiences with the  project also appear.  </P> <P> For example, 26-year-old Megan, a bank teller who is divorced, wrote: "I'd like  to believe that I lived each day relatively organized and simple. Taking 36  slides was difficult to do because of that. It also showed me I wasn't as  organized as I believed."  </P> <P> In the context of the entire presentation, such a comment is filled with a  poignancy that demonstrates the impact art can have on people not otherwise  involved in its interests. It is this aspect of Shiroki's effort that  constitutes its greatest strength.  </P> <P> The one potential frustration with the project arises from the photographic  naivete evident in the images in the little blue viewers. Even a bit of  practice might have sufficiently developed the participants' awareness of how  to use a camera to a point where these images might have been more expressive  and communicative. As it was, however, Shiroki gave each woman a simple camera,  a roll of film and said, "Go to it." Some people might consider this naive  quality charming, even essential, but its cost to the impact of the work as a  whole seems too high.  </P> <P> Two other installations are on view concurrently with Shiroki's project. Mark  Esquierdo and Kim Grady's "Sad Song for Piano and Ears" looks more like a sad  song indeed for the eyes; a dark room encircled with dark shapes suggesting a  burnt landscape or urban scene and smelling richly of linseed oil and  turpentine.  </P> <P> In Installation's bookstore, John Kannofsky replaces several of the shelves  with new ones bearing a text that tells a story of life and death, symbiosis  and conflict. On some of these shelves are wooden cubes, with photos on the  front and assemblages of objects within, that further explore this theme as it  relates to a large fig tree. The work is overwhelmed, however, by its bookstore  context, in which business as usual is conducted. Work this sensitive deserves  its own place.  </P> <P> The exhibitions remain on view at Installation, 930 E St., through April 23,  the last day of this year's ArtWalk.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, Jun. 06 (MAP) -- The newly-appointed Moroccan  Premier Abdellatif Filali will partially reshuffle the present  cabinet, 'AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT' daily Monday reported. Such a  hypothesis is plausible, because Filali did not ask leaders of  political parties to participate in the future government,  during his consultations with these parties last week, the daily  explained.    According to the daily, Filali expressed during the  consultations some ideas on a government of national consensus,  the consolidation of dialog between the government and the  parliament and proposed a political and social truce to pave the  way for a coming phase in which the opposition can participate  in the government, the daily added. The newly-appointed premier  confirmed to political parties that he will work for the  consolidation of the role of the prime minister which means,  according to 'AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT', that Filali will actually  assume all his tasks as premier. Filali will propose the list  of the new cabinet to King Hassan II next Wednesday, the daily  said.    Leaders of opposition parties, namely those of the Istiqlal  Party and the Socialist Union of Popular Forces had told the  daily that they would not participate in the Filali government  and expressed a reserved optimism as to the possibility to open  up the channels of `a different dialog' between the government  and the opposition.    The daily said that the opposition parties will present a  joint memorandum to Filali expressing their viewpoint on the  questions raised during the consultations.</p>

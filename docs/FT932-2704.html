			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Daimler sees significant profits recovery next year DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, is on course for a significant profits recovery next year, the group's finance director said yesterday. Mr Gerhard Liener said that next year's profits could be twice as high as in the current year. This means a figure of around DM2bn (Dollars 1.25bn) for next year after an expected DM1bn for this year and DM1.45bn last year. The prediction will surprise analysts who have been whittling back their forecasts in the wake of the group's dire first-quarter figures. Last month, Daimler announced that it made net profits of just DM20m for the first quarter of the year, down from DM480m in the same period last year. Mr Liener's optimism is based primarily on high expectations for the group's Mercedes-Benz luxury car subsidiary which this week launched its new C-class smaller executive car, the long-awaited successor to the 11-year-old Mercedes-Benz 190-Series. Combined with the impact of cost-cutting measures across the Daimler-Benz group as a whole, the effect will be a 'fundamental improvement' in Daimler's profitability from 1994 onwards. The profits will feed through early enough to ensure that the group makes about DM1bn net profit for the whole of this year, he said. 'The C-class is a great success story,' Mr Liener. 'It was only this week that the model was presented to the German public and I can already predict that every C-class car we produce this year will be sold without having to grant any discount.' The production target for the new model for this year is 120,000 units, Mr Liener said, rising to 240,000 next year. He said that 40,000 units have been ordered in Germany. For next year, he said order volume could be in the region of 260,000 to 270,000, which compares to annual sales of 190,000 of the 190-Series over the past decade. Mr Liener said that by the middle of 1994, the group would have cut 40,000 jobs, approximately 10 per cent of the workforce, since the beginning of the economic downturn in Germany. The total cost of these measures will be DM3bn-DM4bn which will be booked against current year profits; the annual savings in 1994 onwards will be in the same order of magnitude. 'By next year all the costs associated with the reduction of the workforce will have been digested,' Mr Liener said, 'that is why I feel so confident that 1994 profits will be considerably increased on the 1993 figures. They could be as much as double the current year figures.' He predicted that the severity of the recession in Germany this year would have abated somewhat by next year, partly as a result of lower interest rates. This would help the group's performance, as would an expected strengthening of the US dollar versus the D-Mark which could provide an impetus to the group's export sales later this year. Scepticism about the group's profit outlook has caused the Daimler share price to fall this year to DM602.40 down from a high this year of DM628.50. Present expectations for next year's net profits range from DM1.1bn to DM1.4bn.</p>

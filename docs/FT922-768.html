			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (20): The key to the unions' strength - Divided they may be, but they are not a soft target THE DIVISIONS among Indian trade unions suggest that they should be a soft target for governments wanting to force through labour law changes. The appearance is deceptive. In a country where governments are loath to abandon the consensus tradition, union opposition has delayed the formulation of policies that would make it easier for employers to shed labour. There are about 70,000 unions in India. And instead of one or two co-ordinating forums for all unions, common in many countries, there are at least nine - the number recognised by the Ministry of Labour - and all have different political agendas. Indeed, one reason for the profusion of trade union centres is that many see themselves as the industrial arms of political parties. The ties are all the stronger, because many members of parliament remain union leaders after their election. The key to the unions' strength is the areas where they are organised. Among 316m workers, only about 25m, or 8 per cent, belong to unions, according to labour ministry figures. But while their representation is almost non-existent in many areas of the unorganised labour sector, their penetration in the organised sector is high. The organised sector is only 31.6m strong, against the unorganised sector's 285m, but it includes the public sector and the vast majority of India's large employers. Industrial action, or the threat of it, can have a powerful effect there. Unions which staged a one-day strike against the economic reforms last November claim that it was only afterwards that the government became eager to talk to them about their views on the changes. The strength of union opposition to the reforms varies. The communist-backed All India Trade Union Congress is totally opposed. Mr T. N. Siddhanta, secretary, says the previous, restricted economy 'has served us well. I do not say everything was done correctly, but we have been able to stand on our own two feet. 'Liberalisation is more and more expressing itself against the interests of the workers.' The Indian National Trade Union Congress (Intuc), which is allied to the Congress-I party and claims to be the largest grouping, takes a softer line, and did not participate in the strike last November. However, it opposes foreign companies' taking a stake of up to 51 per cent in Indian enterprises. 'They will press out Indian companies that are doing all right,' says Mr S. N. Rao, its spokesman. And Intuc is certainly against a policy of allowing the closure of sick industrial units or labour rationalisation. Mr Rao does not deny overstaffing, especially in the public sector, but he argues that that is not the fault of the workers. But perhaps the most effective argument at the unions' disposal is that India has no social security or unemployment benefit, and employment availability is not growing. 'The government has stopped recruitment for several years,' says Mr Siddhanta. 'With employment generation nil, no-one will get a job elsewhere.'</p>

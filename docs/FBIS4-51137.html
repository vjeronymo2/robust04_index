			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- A passenger car is the most  desirable product among young Beijing consumers, according to a  recent private survey.    The survey, conducted in January by Hori and Co., a  Tokyo-based business consulting firm, also showed that more than  30 percent of the respondents preferred white in color.    The survey covered 1,000 residents of Beijing aged 16-30,  nearly 80 percent of them white-collar workers.    About half of the pollees had a monthly income equivalent to  about 10,400 yen to 14,300 yen. But a car costs the equivalent  of between 650,000 yen and 2.6 million yen.    Next to a car, pollees said they wanted a condominium and a  camcorder, according to the survey.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOLS INTEGRATION  </P> <P> I am the lawyer who tried the Los Angeles city schools integration case  (Crawford vs. Board of Education) on behalf of the minority pupils before Judge  Alfred Gitelson.  </P> <P> I read with interest your article "Integration Fight -- No Victor Seen" (Part  I, April 6). I think an evaluation of what happened in the fight to integrate  the schools of the Los Angeles Unified School District required inclusion of at  least two facts.  </P> <P> First, the trial judge found, at the close of a lengthy trial, that the school  district and school officials had segregated the schools of Los Angeles not  only de facto but de jure. Judge Gitelson made specific findings to this  effect, e.g., that the district segregated minority pupils by, among other  things, deliberately drawing boundary lines, constructing new schools,  establishing attendance areas, promulgating transfer policies, etc., in a  deliberate and intentional effort to further intensify racial segregation in  our schools. The California Supreme Court affirmed that finding.  </P> <P> Second, efforts to integrate or at least desegregate our schools failed, in no  small measure, because public officials did not support the effort. In fact,  they denounced the Gitelson decision and did everything possible to stir up  public anger. Members of the school district, former Mayor Sam Yorty, and Gov.  Ronald Reagan were among the public officials who were most loud in their  condemnation.  </P> <P> The public, misled by officials over a period of 18 years, has been deluded  into believing that the Crawford decision pertained exclusively to so-called  "segregation . . . caused by changing neighborhood growth patterns," as your  reporter, Carol McGraw, put it. In fact, the trial court found, and the highest  court of our state confirmed, that school authorities had deliberately and  intentionally followed practices and policies that intensified and deepened  segregation in our schools. Los Angeles will have to live with the shame of  that decision.  </P> <P> The history of school integration since 1952 shows that efforts to successfully  and peacefully integrate or desegregate schools in various communities across  the country fail unless such efforts have the full-hearted support of school  authorities and other public officials. Needless to say that support was  lacking in Los Angeles. This is one of the lessons to be drawn from the history  of the Crawford case.  </P> <P> BAYARD BERMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

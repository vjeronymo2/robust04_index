			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Minimal (100 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Some need is evident, but it is not serious compared to other applications, or is not well documented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Project may bring most units up to standard, but not to same extent as in other applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There are serious feasibility questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Benefits a small number of persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Minimally supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Insignificant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> (0 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Very little need has been demonstrated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Project would not rehabilitate most units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There are serious feasibility questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Benefits a very small number of persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Does not support the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (ii) Creation of New Housing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . CDBG funds may be used to support the construction of new housing units, and, in certain circumstances, to finance the actual cost of constructing new units. New construction may be carried out by an eligible non-profit entity pursuant to 24 CFR 570.204, or as last resort housing. Support of new construction could include activities such as the acquisition and/or clearance of land, the provision of infrastructure, or the payment of certain planning costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the creation of new units is proposed, the application should document the need for additional units based on vacancy rates, waiting lists, and other pertinent information. The proposed project clearly must support, or result in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons. The units may result from new construction projects for which the proposed project will provide non-construction assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant must identify and document the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment for assistance may adversely affect project impact. Applicants should address issues of site control and marketability, in addition to addressing feasibility from the standpoint of market financing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of the proposed project will be based on the degree of need, the number of units to be created, overall feasibility and the nature and cost of the proposed activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scoring <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. Accordingly, it is difficult to define precisely those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial'' impact. Not all projects receiving a particular rating will match all the criteria point-by-point, in the same manner. Accordingly, the following standard will be used for rating projects supporting new housing construction:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Maximum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> (400 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Severe need for new housing affordable to low- and moderate-income persons is shown in the project area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Project would create a large number of new housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There are no feasibility questions, such as availability of other resources, marketability, or appropriateness of project design, which would hinder the timely completion of the project as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Benefits a large number of persons when compared to other new housing projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Project would affirmatively further fair housing choice by resulting in the spatial deconcentration of minorities throughout the community, or would provide spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income households if there are no areas of minority concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> Substantial (300 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Serious need for new units affordable to low- and moderate-income persons is shown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Project would create a substantial number of new housing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There are no major feasibility questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Benefits a substantial number of persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Project would affirmatively further fair housing choice through significant efforts toward the spatial deconcentration of minorities throughout the community, or would provide significant efforts toward spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income households if there are no areas of minority concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> Moderate (200 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Serious need is shown, but is not as well documented as in other applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Project would create new units but not a substantial number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There may be some minor feasibility questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Benefits a significant number of persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Project would have some effect of affirmatively furthering fair housing choice by encouraging spatial deconcentration of minorities throughout the community, or would encourage spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income households if there are no areas of minority concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Moderately supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> Minimal (100 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Some need is evident, but it is not serious compared to other applications, or is not well documented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Project will create a few new units but not as many as in other applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

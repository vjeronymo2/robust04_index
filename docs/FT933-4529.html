			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Skanska property sales net SKr1bn SKANSKA, the Swedish construction and real estate group, has concluded a series of property deals worth more than SKr2.5bn (Dollars 316m) with the Swedish National Pension Insurance Fund. The agreement will net the company a SKr1bn capital gain at a time when its performance has been hit by the downturn in the Swedish construction market and big property write-downs. Skanska is selling 20 commercial and residential properties in the Stockholm area to the fund for SKr2.2bn. It is also buying a number of industrial and office buildings in Stockholm and Malmo, and a residential area in Malmo for SKr300,000. Mr Melker Schorling, Skanska chief executive, said the deal would cut debt and create room for new investments. Proceeds will offset the substantial write-downs on foreign property engagements which the company is expected to make in the second half of the year. 'The deal is a positive indication that the real estate market in Sweden is starting to recover,' said Mr Mats Mared, Skanska vice-president with responsibility for real estate. TRYGG-HANSA, the leading Swedish insurance group, yesterday applied to the government for a charter to establish a bank. It said the move would enable it to compete more effectively in the market for individual pensions after a change in tax rules at the end of the year. The new bank, to be named Trygg-Banken, will be 51 per cent owned by Trygg-Hansa Life and 49 per cent owned by Trygg-Hansa SPP. It will acquire parts of the group's finance company, Trygg Finans, which is primarily focused on small and medium-sized companies. It will supplement this with a small securities business and by offering favourable interest rates to attract pension savings from individual customers. CULTOR, the Finnish foods group, reports eight-month profits after financial items of FM227m (Dollars 39m), against FM152m last time, Reuter reports from Helsinki. Net sales were FM4.08bn, compared to FM3.82bn. The company said operating profits for the period were FM498m. For the first eight months of 1992 they were FM427m.</p>

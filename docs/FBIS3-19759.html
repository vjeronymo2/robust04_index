			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup by Annelise </F> Bistrup; place and date not given: "The Minister Who Came In to  the Heat"]    [Text] Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup is cautiously  optimistic after this week as peace seems to be in sight in the  Balkans. He is happy about the changing of the guard in Danish  foreign policy that clearly has made defense matters popular.    The days are gone when he had to be introduced as Per and  Grete Haekkerup's oldest son.    Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup has come into his own.  Admittedly he does not have his parent's outgoing charm; he is  even somewhat shy, but on the other hand he has turned out to be  one of the Nyrup government's best cards.    Along with Minister of Justice Erling Olsen, he ranks as one  of the government's best ministers from the nonsocialist  opposition, maybe even the [best] defense minister a  nonsocialist government could hope for.    "That is very nice of them," Haekkerup says. "But that is  also the kind of compliment one would rather do without."    The 48-year-old, a bachelor of polital science, who studied  Russian during the six years he served in the military -- "no,  that does not make me a spy" -- is at present, "after the most  stressful year of my life," reading John Le Carre's romantic  thriller The Night Porter, which deals with defining  the bad guys after the fall of the wall.    As for himself, he can tell the exact moment when he  realized  that the time of the villains is not over: "The action of the  Serbs when they started the bombing of Dubrovnik was what  convinced me that the war in Bosnia was not about people simply  trying to make life secure for themselves. I know the city, and  it is an extremely beautiful city, but there is absolutely no  military reason for bombing it. The line had been crossed where  one could [meaningfully] talk about an element of self defense.  Then came ethnic cleansing, the camps, and the gross violations  of human rights."    [Haekkerup] Had we not lived through the World War II, one  would not believe that such things could happen in Europe in our  time. What we have seen in the former Yugoslavia is the worst  since the Nazis broke through the thin layer of civilization.  <H5>  It Can Still Go Wrong </H5>   That is why Haekkerup is only "cautiously optimistic" after  a  week in which peace may be coming closer in the Balkans. The  Serbs have withdrawn their heavy weapons from Sarajevo; Yeltsin  has invited [the parties] to a peace conference; a rather  fragile armistice has been established between Croats and  Muslims in Bosnia. And finally the 10 Danish Leopard tanks  reached Tuzla.    [Bistrup] To good to be true?    [Haekkerup] Yes, after everything we have seen we are of  course somewhat skeptical. But I am still more optimistic today  than I have been in the last nine months. This might be a  decisive turning point in the war. That depends on our own will  to persevere in a positive development. I cannot predict when we  will have 100-percent peace in the Balkans. I think that this  will remain a corner of unrest in Europe, and that we have to  live with conflicts and ethnic tension in this region.    Just now the pendulum is swinging the right way. But if  events move in another direction, there is the risk that the  conflict will spread to Kosovo, Macedonia and possibly Albania.  I do not think that possibility can be excluded.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Haekkerup also thinks that we must live with the fact that  nobody emerges as a winner in the Balkans:    [Haekkerup] Several hundred thousand people are dead, and  the  only thing the UN has been able to do is to try to limit the  losses. That is what is so difficult about the UN mission in the  former Yugoslavia; the fact that one does not emerge with great  and impressive results. I still think that even though it is  involved, risky, and complicated, the UN has made a clear  difference. But we still have a long way to go.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   He can also live with the fact that it was the Russians who  made it easier for the Serbs to meet the UN's demand to withdraw  from Sarajevo before NATO's ultimatum expired:    [Haekkerup] Russia is an important participant no matter  which conflict we are talking about. The Russian democrats, who  are in the minority in the Duma, have a great need to feel and  show that they are a part of our world order and that they also  will be recognized as such. There is a risk involved if one acts  for only one of the parties. But that is not only a Russian  problem. The necessary political will to agree has been missing  among the large Western powers and it took so long to find a  common attitude because we, historically and culturally, have  felt closer ties to one of the parties in the conflict than we  have to the other.  <H5>  A Bad Signal </H5>   [Bistrup] Is it not a shame and a disgrace both for the EU  [European Union], NATO, and the UN that so many should die  before one could pull oneself together and do what should have  been done a long time ago?    [Haekkerup] The conflict could have been limited, but maybe  not stopped, at an earlier time if the will to behave in unison  and apply the necessary means had been present.    But NATO's secretary general must once in a while point out  the fact that it was not NATO, the EU, or the UN that started  the war. It is a conflict which the different factions have  inflicted upon each other. The truth of the matter is that the  war is being continued by fairly small groups. But they are the  ones that are armed. There are many bandits, but there are also  some who fight, or have fought, for some ideas, some ideals.    The problem is that political and economic power has been  transferred to military factions lead by single individuals,  generals, or whatever we should call them. It is a different  political culture with different rules from those in our part of  the world.    [Bistrup] But the world society's hesitation has also  revealed that crime pays.    [Haekkerup] An incredibly bad signal has been sent in that  it  has been proven that he who seizes a weapon will be rewarded;  that he who conquers land will be in a stronger position at the  negotiating table regardless of which human rights he has  violated. And that signal has been sent.    We have also learned that the longer a conflict is allowed  to  continue, the more costly it will be to stop it. The longer one  waits, the higher the price. The UN became involved in Macedonia  at a relatively early stage when they sent in soldiers for  preventative reasons. That prevented, at least at first, the  conflict from spreading.    [Bistrup] Have we also learned that the threat of sanctions  is an empty one?    [Haekkerup] Sanctions are still an important measure, but  they are also a very simplistic measure. At first it is  bloodless compared to sending in troops, but in the long run  sanctions might have "bloody" results.    I was in Belgrade between Christmas and New Year's, and even  though there was a steady stream of cars on the street, it was  obvious that the sanctions were having an effect. More than half  of Serb industry had been destroyed, unemployment was sky-high  and inflation was raging.    I think that Serbia in the long run will pay a very high  price for this. Even at the time when sanctions are lifted,  there will be a reluctance on the part of the rest of the world  to help them get going again.  <H5>  New Danish Reality </H5>   Haekkerup has taken into consideration the fact that he is  politically and morally responsible for the possibility that  Danish soldiers might have been hit in retaliatory actions if  NATO had undertaken air strikes against the Serbs; the fact that  it would be he who would receive the coffins.    [Haekkerup] Yes, there is some risk still present even  though  we have tried to ensure the safety of Danish soldiers as much as  we can. One of the good things to come out of this affair is the  fact that we have had many debates in the Folketing in which  each member has had an opportunity to personally address the  situation. I will not shift my responsibility to others, but it  is important to have gone through this process. And for each  debate we have had concerning our participation in the UN  peacekeeping forces in Yugoslavia, the majority behind our  political line has increased.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   For Haekkerup there was a regular changing of the guard in  Danish security policy the day it was decided to send Olfert  Fischer to the Gulf -- even though he was ordered not to shoot.    [Haekkerup] It is not only the world that has changed. Even  the SF [Socialist People's Party] voted to create the  International Brigade. At present only the Progress Party is  against it.    When we lived under the peace of the Cold War, things were  simpler. The final apocalypse was a possibility, but a  theoretical possibility. Today we live with the everyday reality  of Danish soldiers being in a war zone and being shot at every  day. Danish solders are not only being sent out on peacekeeping  missions. As members of the International Brigade and as  peacemakers for the rest of the world they might participate in  real battles.    [Bistrup] Are we mentally equipped to pay the price for such  an engagement?    [Haekkerup] I think I am finding an incredible maturity in  the Danish people. There is no doubt but that public opinion has  become more robust.    Something has also happened in the development of Danish  public opinion. UN participation has contributed to giving our  defense forces a completely different profile from what they had  before.    Our defense forces have become a cooperative partner and an  instrument of our foreign policy. Previously our mission was to  deter our enemy. We have now become cooperative partners; an  instrument for foreign policy.    It is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that negotiates, but  it  is we who deliver the hardware.    We are training Baltic soldiers in Denmark and they will go  with us to Croatia to see how we conduct a peacekeeping effort.  Such is the present reality.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   In a very short time Minister of Defense Haekkerup will  travel to Sarajevo in order to meet the hardy reality there. And  John Le Carre's romantic reality must wait a little longer.</p>

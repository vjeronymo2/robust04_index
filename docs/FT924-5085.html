			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Health and safety regulations go no further than sensible Sir, Bryan Cassidy (Letters, November 24) asserts that recent health and safety regulations have gone beyond EC directives. On November 25 you reported the GMB general union as taking HSE to task ('Safety body 'undermined' EC health directive') for watering down the requirements of the same directives. Neither has got it right. The Health and Safety Commission's strategy includes proposing to ministers UK regulations to meet directives, but not to go beyond them without good cause. It is that approach already on the public record, and the internal discussions leading to it, which now stand 'revealed' by the GMB. The facts are important, because ministers have signed recently no fewer than six EC-inspired sets of regulations which will certainly, in the interests of safety and health, need to be implemented by employers who have many other worries at present. The European Framework Directive, which underlies all these new regulations was negotiated in a hurry and parts, frankly, were poorly drafted and needed interpretation. Contrary to what Mr Cassidy says, the directive specifically requires that employers be 'in possession of' a risk assessment. That requirement has been restricted in the regulations to a record of the significant risks, to be made by employers of more than five employees (all must assess the risks). The commonsense aim is to ensure that employers focus on the essentials. All employers of course are still subject to the existing UK laws about maintaining a safe workplace. Mr Cassidy is, however, right in saying that the UK regulations go beyond the directive in protecting the self-employed. They obviously must, because UK law under the Health and Safety at Work Act has always covered this category, which accounts for half more of those at work in some of the more dangerous industries; and self-employed contractors can pose risks not only to themselves but to other workers. Nor would it have made sense in terms of the Framework Directive itself to have omitted them, since the directive requires co-operation between all employers sharing a workplace. Our legal advice is that the UK regulations implement the directives. They go no further than is sensible and necessary, and will represent a real and important addition to safety and health provision.

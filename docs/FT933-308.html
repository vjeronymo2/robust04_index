			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DERIVATIVES markets continued to trade busily yesterday, with some of the interest turning towards the individual share index options. Stock index futures again led the stock market forward, and a 35 point premium against cash on the December contract opened up the opportunity for significant arbitrage trading. After a slow start, the December contract strengthened again, quickly showing the 35 point premium against the underlying market that it was to maintain virtually thoughout the day. Dealers said that the lessening in tensions in Russia, together with hopes for base rate cut at home, had brought buyers back into index futures. Salomon, the US investment bank, was an active player but was joined in arbitrage business by several UK houses. December closed with its 35 point premium intact, showing a 24 point premium over the fair value calculation which allows for dividend and financing flows. Volume, at 9,428, was a shade below the previous day. Traded options activity jumped from 23,835 contracts to 33,425, with the FT-SE contract nearly doubling turnover to 18,907. Among stock contracts, TSB traded 2,295 contracts on hopes that Hill Samuel, its merchant bank subsidiary, will shortly be sold off. The Euro FT-SE contract saw increased business to record 1,350 deals.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Technology: Banking on flexibility - Working from home has several advantages, especially when disaster strikes the office When a dumper truck of explosives shattered the 52 floors of London's NatWest tower less than two weeks ago, 1,300 employees at the bank lost their workplace. The impact was thought-provoking, to say the least, says Duncan Peel, senior executive in the UK branch banking human resources department. 'It makes you realise what you can actually do when you haven't got a desk to sit at.' For National Westminster, flexible working practices put in place throughout the 1980s meant the bank was better able to deal with the problem, believes Peel. These included staff working shorter hours and others working from home. Although the main thrust of NatWest's policy was to retain expensively-trained and high-calibre staff, many big organisations are now looking at working from home as a means of cutting overheads and even of keeping the business going in the event of a headquarters' disaster, such as a fire or a bomb. As a result, working from home, which has traditionally been seen as 'slightly cranky, eccentric and craft-based,' according to Chris Moller, managing director of the Cambridge-based consultancy Home Office Partnership, has been added to the corporate agenda. Even the terminology has shifted, from 'teleworking' to 'flexible working'. He believes that in many cases the moves are a formalisation of the 'taking work home in a briefcase scenario', which people have been doing informally for years. Most people who work outside the traditional office environment are skilled professionals who are used to working independently. And most are men. Peel believes flexible working can be introduced with as little technology as the telephone. Others believe recent developments have made home-working a much more appealing proposition. 'The confluence of technology has really made it viable,' says Richard Nissen, managing director of Business Space, which provides business services in central London. He points to three specific developments. The first is laptop computers, especially notebooks which can be taken from home to the office and plugged into 'docking stations'. Software which enables remote users to phone the corporate database and download files, or even alter data held at corporate headquarters, is widely available. Second, fax modems are now available so that facsimile messages can be sent from a notebook PC. Third, advanced phone services - mobile phones, radio pagers, voice mailboxes and call diversion facilities - have eased communications. High-speed data lines - particularly the now near-ubiquitous ISDN (integrated services digital network) services - mean that diverting a call from one city to another can be as swift as diverting one across the office. 'The thing that has made most difference for us is computer-integrated telephony,' says Neil Harris, of the Digital Equipment Corporation's flexible working group. At Digital each employee has a single phone number wherever he or she works. Once the employee logs on to the computer system - at home or in the office - they send the number of the local phone to which all calls are to be sent. To a customer calling in to the company it is impossible to tell where the recipient of the call is seated. 'It makes an enormous difference if people calling don't know if you're in your office, in a satellite office or at home,' points out Moller. Business Space bundles a similar service with secretarial back-up for small businesses from its London headquarters. Companies quick to introduce flexible working practices have been those with a knowledge of the technologies needed - such as Digital. It has become an exemplary case of how a company can substantially cut its fixed overheads by introducing teleworking. Five per cent of Digital's UK workforce - 250 people - now work outside the traditional office environment and the company hopes to extend this to 25 per cent over the next few years. So far the company has reduced its property costs by about 30 per cent, says Harris. Eventually Digital hopes to cut its building stock to just 10 per cent of what it had a few years ago. Harris believes that only by proper planning at the highest level within a company will an organisation achieve higher productivity and reduce costs. 'If it's done properly you'll get a 'win-win' situation. Both the company and individuals will benefit.' At Mercury Communications the cost of accommodation, particularly in London, has been the driving force behind new working practices. 'Over the last 18 months various disparate actions have happened. Now we're trying to tie them all together,' says Chris Ridgewell, manager of the flexible working group. In common with Harris, Ridgewell says that unless the programme has the support of management at the highest level within the company 'it doesn't happen properly, or goes off at half cock'. Mercury is set to launch a three-year programme, initially targeting sales, sales support and network support staff. Ridgewell believes that between 800 and 1,000 of Mercury's 9,000 staff, about one third of whom work in London, will have some form of flexible working by September this year. Flexible working patterns range from job-sharing to career breaks with work carried out at home, in the company's satellite offices, or in local business centres. These can be in hotels or business parks and companies can rent facilities for employees on a full-time basis or as needs require. From later this month, for example, the Deer Park Hotel in Honiton will be opening a telecentre where individuals or company employees can rent office space and equipment on an hourly or daily basis. The centre will be the headquarters for the National Association of Teleworkers. The procedure at Mercury will be for individuals to propose an arrangement to their line manager who then looks at the costs. A cost case is then made for the individual depending on the equipment they will need; the line manager then decides on the basis of this whether the proposal should go ahead. Ridgewell says there will be 'several flavours' of the programme, because of the different types of work done. But Mercury is hoping to formalise a list of 'job types', to which costs for equipment needed will be attached. In its introduction of flexible working Mercury is taking its own medicine. Since October 1991 it has been advising its customers on introducing flexible working through the use of telecommunications. Seventy large companies are already converts, with some 27,000 full-time employees involved in some kind of flexible working. A typical scenario, says Ridgewell, would be where some 250 in a company - one department, say - would be approached about flexible working and at the end of the trial period about 80 people would be involved. After the first year about half the staff are on the programme. 'The major problem is not the procedures, it's the managers' attitudes. They think they're losing control,' says Ridgewell. 'It's very much a British thing.' In spite of that, Moller thinks changes in management attitude are the biggest driver behind the new-found flexibility. He also argues that as managements believe the recession is coming to an end they are now re-considering how to retain their trained staff, an issue subsumed by recession. The management challenges are numerous: what sort of contracts people need, how to make jobs task-orientated rather than time-orientated and ensuring insurance and health and safety regulations are extended to the home. 'The key thing is to get the right balance between team dynamics and the social content and the facilities for people to work independently,' adds Harris. 'Most important is to get people involved in the way they work. It all depends on good working practice and discipline and that sort of thing doesn't happen by accident.'</p>

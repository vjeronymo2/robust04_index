			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Charged up in the Alps - The recent opening of the world's first household battery recycling plant When you switch on a torch, portable radio or alarm clock, you don't think twice about what makes it work until the power runs out. But the humble batteries that help modern life run so smoothly also pose a serious problem in this age of consumer plenty - they are notoriously hard to get rid of. Not only do dry batteries contain nasty mixtures of metals - among them zinc, iron, mercury, cadmium, manganese, lead, copper and aluminium - but these are also sealed in packages that make the various elements difficult to separate and capture. Thus the disposal or recycling of batteries is a tough environmental challenge. Until now, there has been almost no organised reprocessing of batteries. In some places, collection and disposal take place, but satisfactory disposal sites are difficult to find. One hazard is that chemical reactions continue in old batteries, especially when subjected to the weather, and mercury and other elements escape into the soil. It comes as little surprise that the environmentally conscious Swiss are among the first to insist that a more ecologically sound method be found for dealing with this increasingly acute problem. Using a Japanese-developed method, they have come up with the world's first commercial-scale facility for recycling old household batteries, with plans to market the process throughout Europe. A few weeks ago, this advanced plant, capable of processing almost all types of used dry batteries, was started up in a small village at the foot of the Bernese Alps. The plant recovers most of the metals in marketable form and treats the waste liquids and gases. Among common battery types, only those with lithium cannot be processed. The genesis of the plant was a decree passed by the Swiss government in 1986, classifying dry batteries as special waste for which there were no suitable disposal sites in Switzerland. Another decree obliged retailers, starting in 1989, to take back used batteries. Immediately Migros, the aggressive and environmentally-aware Swiss co-operative retail group, asked a group of young engineers at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (federal technology college) in Zurich to search for an ecologically sound disposal and recycling process. Roger Burri, one of the engineers, saw a couple of papers in research journals outlining the efforts of Sumitomo Heavy Industries (SHI) to develop a furnace that would separate the metals in used batteries. A visit to Japan was arranged in 1988, and the group quickly decided that the Sumitomo process, then on display in the form of a 500-tonne-per-year pilot plant, was the route to take. Its basis is an induction furnace that operates rather like an iron-making blast furnace - at very high temperature and continuously. First, however, the batteries pass through a shaft furnace where the organic components are pyrolised (decomposed by heat) and most of the mercury evaporates. The waste gases are then burnt completely in an incinerator at 1,000-1,200 deg C. Solid particles of zinc oxide, iron oxide and carbon are washed out of the hot gas, which is then cooled and the mercury condensed. Mercury is also distilled out of the wash water. Residue from the burnt batteries then drops into the induction furnace where the oxide compounds of zinc, iron and manganese are melted at temperatures between 1,450-1,500 deg C and reduced to their metallic forms. Carbon is added to that already present in some battery electrodes to act as the reduction agent. Metallic vapour is drawn off to a zinc condenser, and the remaining metals, mainly ferro-manganese, and an inert glass-like slag are tapped continuously. In 1989, a joint stock company, Batrec, was formed to build and operate a plant in Switzerland based on this process, and employing SHI as the supplier. The plant would be a straight scale-up from the pilot plant, with the capacity to process 2,000 tonnes of used batteries per year, about half of Switzerland's total consumption. The project received wide support across Switzerland. Migros is the main private sector shareholder, but other retailers and wholesalers are also involved. From the public sector, the federal government, eight cantonal governments, the city of Zurich and the principality of Liechtenstein have all subscribed for shares, and some have also provided grants. The federal government provided the site for the plant, on some vacant land in a run-down munitions manufacturing complex near the lakeside town of Thun. In a country notorious for its lengthy planning permission process, Bern managed to push through approval for the plant in only six months. The final elements in the equation were the establishment of the supply and economic bases for the plant. The Swiss government imposed an export ban on used batteries from the beginning of 1991, and a national battery collection organisation was set up later in the year. At the moment, the return rate is about 54 per cent, according to Migros. Starting in October 1991, all manufacturers and importers of batteries in Switzerland agreed to add 10 per cent to their retail prices to cover the costs of processing and recycling. The funds thus collected are turned over to Batrec at the rate of SFr 4,000 (Pounds 1,800) per tonne of used batteries consumed, the figure the company needs to make what it considers a satisfactory return. The Batrec process is not cheap. The cost of the total project was SFr35m, of which the plant accounted for SFr25m. Energy consumption is about 3,500 kilowatt hours per tonne. 'We know it is too expensive, but we want to investigate the whole process and then work on making an economical production system,' says Atsushi Naitoh, executive vice-president of SHI. Burri, now president of Batrec, believes that the ideal size, in terms of economics and the efficiency of the process, would be about 10,000 tonnes a year. At the moment, he adds, 'we have a toy here'. He also points out that a large portion of the construction cost was attributable to Switzerland's very severe standards on emission controls. Complete water and air treatment equipment has been installed. Even dioxins, a sensitive subject in Switzerland since the 1986 leakage of chemicals into the Rhine, are destroyed. Burri says the main problems encountered in operation so far have to do with balancing the charge in the furnace. For example, if the pressure in the shaft furnace is lower than in the melting furnace, the gases from the melting furnace flow up to the bottom of the shaft furnace. The zinc vapour in these gases can condense and plug the outlet of the melting furnace. Conversely, if the pressure in the shaft furnace is higher, the gases flow from it through the melting furnace into the zinc condenser and oxidise the liquid zinc, creating worthless zinc dross. Batrec believes it has solved the problem by installing a plug valve which enables it to decouple the gas streams of the two furnaces during the unstable start-up phase. Another problem is the need to stop the process frequently to reline the furnace. So far, the longest campaign has been four weeks, and relining takes about a week. Burri believes the average campaign can be raised to two months, an improvement that would raise the capacity of the plant significantly. As a result of Batrec's experience, SHI has agreed to form a partnership to market the process in Europe. 'At first we saw Batrec as just our first client, but we have changed our view. They are very good partners to promote this technology. We are quite confident of the hardware, but we do not have the operational knowhow,' Naitoh says. 'Through Batrec we have had concrete inquiries from potential customers, but we are asking them to wait. We want to be 100 per cent sure of the gas balance in the furnace.'</p>

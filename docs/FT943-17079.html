			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Bald eagle off endangered list The American bald eagle, symbol of the US, is off the critical list after nearly reaching extinction three decades ago, writes Ken Warn from Washington. The US Fish and Wildlife Service yesterday proposed an upgrade in the bird's status from 'endangered' to merely 'threatened'. The number of bald eagles outside Alaska sank to a low of 417 pairs in 1963. However, last year, over 4,000 pairs were counted. Instrumental in the bird's recovery was the banning in 1973 of the pesticide DDT. The pesticide, in wide agricultural use in the 1950s and 1960s, built up in the food chain killing many wild birds. Environmentalists hailed the recovery as a triumph for the 1973 Endangered Species Act, now before Congress for re-authorisation. However, opponents of renewal argue that the act imposes too many restrictions on owners of property where endangered species live, impeding development. The change in status, likely to become final in 90 days, means the birds will continue to be monitored by federal law, but not on an individual basis.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Proposal on public sector accounts The leading professional accountancy body for public services yesterday called for a new body to set accounting standards in the public sector, Jim Kelly writes. Mr Martin Evans, technical director of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the new board could bring together public and private practice. He told the Government Accounting Service conference at the University of Surrey that the last decade had seen a shift away from cash-based public-sector accounting towards a more commercial system. Change in the public sector had been prompted by compulsory competitive tendering, the development of the internal market in the National Health Service and the Next Steps programme for the civil service.</p>

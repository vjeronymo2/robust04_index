			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SONG SUNG BLUE: WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT BARR-MANGLED BANNER  </P> <P> Thank you, Roseanne Barr, for proving my point. For years I have been telling  friends that, instead of a talented comedienne, you are a disrespectful swine  who uses brash vulgarity to mask your own self-pity and feelings of insecurity.  To paraphrase the man, it is better to be thought a pig, than to open your  mouth, spit on hallowed ground and remove all doubt.  </P> <P> JEFF WEBER  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

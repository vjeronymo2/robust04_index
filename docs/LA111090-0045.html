			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> PEOPLES HOLDS KAPALUA LEAD BY SHOOTING 66  </P> <P> David Peoples, the leader since the opening round, maintained a three-stroke  advantage by shooting a five-under-par 66 in Friday's third round of the  Kapalua International.  </P> <P> Peoples' three-day total of 15-under 198 is three shots better than Davis Love  III, whose 63 was Friday's low round and left him at 201.  </P> <P> Nick Price, with a 66, and Tom Purtzer, 67, were tied at 202.  </P> <P> Peoples, 30, has led since shooting a first-round 63 on the par-71 Bay Course  at the Kapalua Resort on Maui. He started Friday's round with a three-shot lead  over Purtzer in a bid for his first victory as a pro and $150,000.  </P> <P> "I really played well from tee to green," Peoples said. "With only a three-shot  lead on this golf course, I'm going to have to make birdies tomorrow. I can't  sit back, I'm going to have to play aggressive."  </P> <P> Peoples had one bogey and six birdies.  </P></p>

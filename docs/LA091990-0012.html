			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Beloved Prize: American author Toni Morrison's novel "Beloved" won the  Chianti Ruffino Antico Fattore international literary prize Sunday in Florence,  Italy. Award sponsors praised the novel for "giving a voice to the experience  of suffering, survival and life of the black population of America and in  giving a voice to the feminine experience within the black population."  </P> <P> Morrison was selected from among winners of other national literary prizes.  </P> <P> * Naval Blockade: The Australian sailors in the Persian Gulf are complaining  because they do not receive pornographic videotapes sent to them. Defense  Support Minister Gordon Bilney told Parliament Monday in Sydney: "Those Middle  East countries have very strict regulations as regards the importation of  pornographic material." Australia has two frigates and a supply ship in the  gulf. A spokesman for a Canberra adult video mail order firm said Tuesday naval  bases were "some of our best clients."  </P> <P> * Back Again: Hoover-Ball, a game invented to help President Herbert Hoover  stay in shape, is returning to the nation's capital after a 57-year absence.  Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) is sponsoring a Hoover-Ball Capital Classic on  Sept. 29 in Washington, D.C. In the game, two three-player teams heave a  6-pound medicine ball over an 8-foot volleyball net.  </P> <P> * Eat It Up: Mr. Olympia Lee Haney, crowned Saturday in Chicago for the seventh  consecutive time, says he stays in shape by eating, eating, eating -- the right  foods. Haney, 30, estimates he gobbles up 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day, 65 to  70% of them carbohydrates. "But most people have bacon or sausage in the  morning, a burger for lunch, and before they know it, they have a lot of body  fat," he said. Haney's latest crown eclipsed the record of six consecutive  titles of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. YEMI TOURE  </P></p>

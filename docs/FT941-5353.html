			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Westland hits out over orders Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, yesterday claimed GKN was trying to undermine its order prospects as part of its Pounds 496m hostile takeover bid. The Yeovil-based company accused Sir David Lees, chairman of the engineering and industrial services group, of exploiting extracts from its defence document to persuade shareholders that most of its orders could be cancelled or postponed. It was responding to an open letter from Sir David, which which attempted to play down hostility between the two companies, but went on to describe the group's prospects as speculative and uncertain. Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, said: 'He knows our prospects are strong. He is raising questions over orders and wants our shareholders to sell at a discount - that's certainly hostile.' GKN, which already controls 45 per cent of Westland, has offered shareholders 290p per share - a discount of almost 12 per cent to Friday's 329p closing price. Mr Jones also dismissed an offer by GKN to alter the terms of a potential compensation package to Westland shareholders arising out of a damages claim against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation. Under its original offer last month, the engineering group promised a partial pay-out should Westland receive more than Pounds 82m in damages from the AOI, which has been ordered to pay Pounds 385m over cancelled helicopter orders. GKN has now reduced the threshold for a share-out of any damages to Pounds 65m, reflecting the Pounds 25m - some Pounds 17m after tax - which Westland has already received in partial compensation. Although GKN admitted the revised terms 'do not materially change the offer', Sir David said: 'Our offer price of 290p plus the AOI entitlement is a very fair one which properly reflects the prospects for Westland.' Sir David Lees is meeting executives from Standard Life and Scottish Widows in Scotland today. These together control 5.5 per cent of GKN and hold small stakes in Westland. His efforts, however, are expected to concentrate on M&amp;G and Schroders, which hold more than 25 per cent of the helicopter company. The two companies are also the largest institutional shareholders in GKN - together controlling 9.5 per cent. Support from either group would secure Westland for GKN.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (7): Waiting to plug in - Network management potential remains untapped NETWORK management is one of the big challenges confronting the information technology industry today. The promised land of open systems, which depends heavily on more effective network management, looks to be still a long way off. The aim is to be able to manage distributed information systems as well as the present generation of centralised mainframe or minicomputer systems. But experts say this will not happen much before the turn of the century. Mr Steve Wendler, vice-president of US market research firm Gartner Group, predicts cautiously: 'In the latter half of the decade we shall start to see these problems more comprehensively addressed.' Meanwhile systems managers remain unable to harness the full power of distributed processing for transmission of large volumes of data across multi-vendor networks to support their critical applications. Network management is a relatively new subject. Estimates of the proportion of IT budgets consumed by network management range vary from 2 per cent to 20 per cent, but it is generally agreed that as recession puts budgets under pressure, investment in network management products has been cut back. Mr Tony Miller, a consultant systems engineer at Hitachi Data Systems says: 'There is a general reluctance to invest in network management, because people don't realise that the network is the system.' The upgrading of corporate networks has been stalled - and in some cases reversed - by the recession. Meanwhile mergers and takeovers among systems suppliers have created a lot of work in rationalising their product lines. Mr Bob Broadbent, general manager of consulting and technical services for ICL says there are no off-the-shelf solutions yet, so that tasks such as configuration management and software version control, often require outside systems integrators to handle. The network management issue is bigger than most which the industry has tackled up to now because it requires the collaboration of many large companies in computing and telecommunications. Many in the industry say the situation is made worse by the plethora of consortia and standards bodies which appear to be more in conflict than in collaboration. The supreme authority is the International Standards Organisation, which is developing its open systems interconnection (OSI) framework. But there are no full specifications for network management within OSI nor are there likely to be for perhaps 10 years. The principal network management software products, such as IBM's Netview and equivalent packages from Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems are moving gradually towards OSI. No supplier now questions that OSI is the ultimate goal, but users are left wondering how to cope until OSI matures. The problem is how to avoid a strategy which results in their technology being obsolete in three years' time. For instance, many users face s choice between the OSI standard CMIP (Common Management Information protocol) and the SNMP (Simple Network Management protocol), supported by the Internet organisation. Many think CMIP will be the long-term winner, since it is seen as the cornerstone protocol of OSI, but wonder if in the short term they would be better to back the cheaper and easier, if less secure, SNMP. SNMP has been widely adopted by users who want to integrate their local area networks, while CMIP has so far only been taken on by a few large users seeking to unify their management information from a range of diverse networks. These leading users, mainly multinational corporations, will start to adopt OSI standards more widely in two or three years time. But they will probably not be able to create a full OSI network until well into the next century. There are some hopeful signs. One is that the Network Management Forum (NMF) dropped the 'OSI' from its title, signalling its willingness to adopt a more pragmatic stance. This has strengthened its position as driver of the campaign to set networking standards. It continues to support OSI as a long-term goal, but recognises that users have immediate problems which may compel them to adopt interim solutions based on less than ideal products. Omnipoint, an initiative run by the NMF, has brought out a set of standards for interoperability which appears to be gaining acceptance. Some users are looking to solve the problem by outsourcing their networks as well as the rest of their IT. The potential cost-savings from this policy are less impressive than those gained by devolving responsibility for hardware or software, but any savings are seen as worthwhile in the current economic climate. More importantly, outsourcing can secure access to scarce skills. Mr Chris Massey, IT manager for the Ticketing Group, part of Wembley, the London event organiser, says this was the motive in letting Systems Reliability take charge of his network of Compaqs and Apples. High level skills such as those required for network management remain in great demand even amid a rising tide of unemployment.</p>

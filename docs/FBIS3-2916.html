			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  Qian Qichen said here today that the principle of "one country,  two systems" will surely bear fruit in Hong Kong, all the  targets set by the basic law will be realized and Hong Kong will  become more prosperous after 1997.    Qian, also chairman of the Preliminary Work Committee of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region, made the remark at a reception in honor of Hong Kong and  Macao deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and  members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at the Diaoyutai State  Guesthouse this evening.    He said that the Chinese Government has the determination,  confidence and ability to realize smooth transfer of the  sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintain the stability and  prosperity of Hong Kong because "Hong Kong's prosperity in the  past was created by Hong Kong people mainly consisting of  Chinese" and "Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well."    At the same time, the determination and confidence rest with  that "our policy precedes from the reality of Hong Kong, and  with the fact that the mainland's reform and opening up policies  are producing positive influence on Hong Kong's economic  development," he said.    He said that on the eve of the opening of the current NPC  session, the British Hong Kong authorities tabled to the Hong  Kong Legislative Council (Legco) the remaining parts of Chris  Patten's "political reform bill" for discussion. This is  another unilateral act to sabotage Sino-British cooperation by  the British side after the Legco passed Chris Patten's partial  political reform bill and the British side first publicized the  content of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political structure  in a White Book.    Qian said though the British side talked loudly about  cooperation with China, the acts and deeds of the British  Government on the Hong Kong issue have shown the very opposite.    "We cannot hold any illusion on this issue any longer," he  said.    He said that China today is no longer what it was in the  1840's. "The day when Chinese people were subordinated to the  oppression and humiliation of foreign colonists has gone  forever."    He said that the elaboration on the Hong Kong issue in  Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report is the solemn  declaration of this firm stand of the Chinese Government and  people.    "Now, we are going to join the Hong Kong compatriots who  love  the motherland and Hong Kong and rely on our own efforts to  ensure the smooth transition of power and long-term prosperity  of Hong Kong," he said.</p>

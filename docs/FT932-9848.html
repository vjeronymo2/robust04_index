			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten wins the gentle pat of approval THE TWO gentle pats on the shoulder that Mr John Major gave the education secretary during Commons' questions yesterday were an expression of solidarity in the face of adversity, rather than of affection. Once again, the government was in trouble. Mr John Patten's emergency statement on schools' testing was the latest expression of the shock pervading Tory ranks since last Thursday's elections. Mr Patten rattled furiously through his prepared text, his voice raised almost to a rant. The government publicity machine moved to quash suggestions of panic. Mr Patten had submitted a paper to colleagues last week, Downing Street said. Yesterday's ad hoc ministerial committee on education reforms had long been in the diary. But there could be no denying that the Commons' statement had been brought forward amid speculation at Westminster that the government was to capitulate on this year's schools testing as a result of Mr Major's determination to 'listen more'. In fact, the trick was to offer concessions for 1994. Last night Mr Patten appeared to have diffused the concerns of backbench Conservative MPs. The cost had been the damage to his reputation caused by the impression of Downing Street forcing him to act swiftly to quell a brewing storm. For Mr Major the retreat added to the sense of floundering that has gripped the Conservative party this week, drowning appeals for unity. Only hours earlier the government's majority had been cut to 10 over the Budget imposition of VAT on gas and electricity. Two conflicting themes prevail: that the government has to be attuned to the aspirations and perceptions of electors, but also needs to show the smack of firm government. There is no agreement on how that should be translated on individual issues. Reaction of Tories to Mr Patten's statement suggested that some rallying around the government had started. Attacks on industrial action by teacher's unions was a point of common agreement. The education secretary's deliverly slowed as he started to win plaudits from the Conservative backbenchers, his characteristic cocky self-confidence resurfacing. Sir Malcolm Thornton, chairman of the Commons' education select committee and the most vociferous Tory critic of Mr Patten, said the package went, 'a very substantial way' towards meeting legitimate criticisms of the tests. There was 'no possible justification whatsoever' for disruption by teachers unions, he said. Privately criticism of Mr Patten by Tory MPs for boxing himself into an unnecessarily fierce confrontation with parents and teachers was tinged with some sympathy. 'It is not John Patten who has lost his nerve. Its the cowards in the party,' complained one right-wing minister. In contrast to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, there is less of a feeling that Mr Patten's credibility at Westminster had been undermined to the extent that his job is in question. But there was still talk that Mr Patten could also be moved in a July reshuffle.</p>

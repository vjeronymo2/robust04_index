			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: BMW earnings tumble 40% to DM255m HALF-YEAR net earnings at BMW, the German quality carmaker, fell almost 40 per cent to DM255m (Dollars 147.9m), the company said yesterday. Although the decline matched most expectations, the company's shares fell DM16.50 in Frankfurt, to close at DM562. While car registrations fell 16 per cent in Europe to 200,000, the company reported an 18 per cent sales surge in the US, where almost 37,000 vehicles were sold in spite of the generally sluggish state of the upper market segment. Conditions in Japan continued to worsen, and BMW sales fell 13 per cent to 12,800, while importers of European cars reported an 18 per cent overall drop in demand for quality vehicles. Turnover fell 9 per cent to DM14.74bn, while car production dropped 11.5 per cent to 277,000. Output of motorcycles increased 2 per cent to almost 22,000, although sales fell 3 per cent. Sales in Germany were down 13 per cent at DM6.2bn, compared with a decline of 18 per cent to DM4.23bn in the rest of Europe and an 11 per cent increase to DM4.3bn in other export markets. BMW continued to reduce costs by cutting its workforce. At the end of the first half the company employed 72,000, some 3,600 fewer than at the comparable point in 1992. Although BMW did not expect the world car market to recover this year, it said that the European economic downturn should bottom out soon, and that recovery in North America and the UK would lift business. BMW, which has benefited from strong sales of its new 3-Series, launched last year, plans to introduce new variants of this model and the 5-Series at the Frankfurt international motor show in September.</p>

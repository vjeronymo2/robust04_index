			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: Swiss arms group seeks partner OERLIKON-BUHRLE, the Swiss industrial and armaments group, plans a radical restructuring of capital to absorb heavy losses and open the way for an outside partner to buy into the group's troubled defence business. The company said the measures, which involve a 60 per cent capital reduction and the issue of new shares, were needed to return its defence division to profit. It said talks with several potential partners were under way. Oerlikon, which has run into losses mainly because it failed to find buyers for its Adats anti-aircraft weaponry, has been under reorganisation by a specially-appointed task force since last September, following the resignation of chairman Mr Dietrich Burle. The Adats guided missile system was developed at a cost of some SFr1bn (Dollars 704.2m). During the 1980s, Oerlikon's defence division accumulated losses of more than SFr1bn. Oerlikon announced in January it planned to sell a majority shareholding in its defence business, and that talks to this end were under way. The new shares, representing SFr300m nominal of bearer shares, will be taken up by the banks as payment for some SFr300m of group debt. Later this year the banks will offer the new shares to Oerlikon shareholders. Oerlikon in 1990 made an operating loss of SFr91.2m, up from a deficit in 1989 of SFr41.3m, which included a loss of SFr100m by the defence side. Earlier this year, Oerlikon said operating losses for 1990 would fall between SFr70m and SFr100m.</p>

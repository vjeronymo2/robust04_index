Whoever has mastered this technology possesses the  key to a multitude of product innovations.    Some materials coming from the laboratory of the  Saarbruecken Institute of New Materials (INM) GmbH [GmbH = Ltd]  seem to be coming from a witch's kitchen of modern alchemists:  From unimaginably small particles, hardly larger than molecules,  they make materials which in an almost any desirable way combine  the heretofore not concurrently attainable properties of glass,  ceramic, metals, and plastics. Novel automotive varnishes whose  color can be changed instantaneously by push-button action are  foreseen by the INM experts, as are finest filters which  automatically close their pores when they detect the presence of  certain gases.    There is more to such futuristic application concepts than  the pure joy of experimentation. "In the future new custom made  materials will play the key role in development of innovative  products and in solution of confounding problems" predicts Prof.  Helmut Schmidt, business managing director of the INM.    INM researchers are developing synthetic materials and new  processing techniques so that boundaries between glass, ceramic,  plastic, and metal become blurred.    The new wonder materials satisfy every conceivable  requirement: to be more resistant, more durable, and more  elastic than every metal; to automatically indicate invisible  defects as, for instance, in the outer skin layer of aircraft,  or to withstand temperatures of up to several thousand degrees  when used as heat shields.    The secret of the Saarbruecken researchers are so-called  nanoparticles, only a few nanometers large particles. In this  field the INM (with a staff of 150 persons) has attained the top  position globally and is pressing like a resourceful David  against the Japanese superpower in the future-oriented race for  new materials.    INM chief Helmut Schmidt says, "With their wonder materials  these Saarlanders are opening unthought-of application  possibilities which promise enormous advantages in the global  contest."    With relatively simple mixtures, the Japanese have already  in  the eighties demonstrated how decisive materials are in winning  the global contest. "With ingenious and inexpensive components  made of glass", Schmidt cites as an example, "copier equipment  manufacturers like Canon have dislodged U.S. competitors and  their costly optics."  <H5>  Success with Ormocers </H5>   With tiniest glass globules a few micrometers in diameter  embedded in the surface of video tapes, the Japanese were able  to set a new standard and conquer the world market. "At the same  time", says Schmidt, "about 75% of all high-tech products  use  materials especially developed for them."    This busy materials expert knows what he is talking about.  In  the mid- eighties he was already engaged in developing the  so-called Ormocers (Organically Modified Ceramics), to create a  sensation: inorganic ceramics and organic plastics being grown  together -- a long technological step forward in materials  research. Two heretofore not concurrently attainable properties,  hardness of ceramics and high ultimate strength of plastics, are  here realized in one material.    During the 1986-90 period Schmidt was, as director of the  Fraunhofer Institute for Silicates Research in Wuerzburg,  successfully engaged in industrial application of Ormocers. An  example is the mixture specially developed by the Wuerzburg team  and used by the Rupp &amp; Hubrach KG [Kommanditgesellschaft =  Limited Partnership] in Bamberg as an exceptionally  scratch-resistant material for coating eyeglasses. With only  12.6 kg of this material, the French have reached a sales figure  of 15 million DM in 1992 alone. Another Schmidt-Ormocer is used  by the Biberacher Basotherm GmbH as an extremely effective  additive in a novel skin creme against acne.    No wonder that in 1990 this busy materials expert and  research manager readily accepted the offer to become chairman  of the INM, which had been established in 1987. "Here we can in  a downright ideal way combine industry- related projects with  government-financed basic research". He can enumerate about 100  joint projects with companies like Daimler-Benz, Bayerische  Motor Werke (BMW), or Schering. Some of these projects pertain  to extension and further development of the Ormocer technology  along with its underlying sol-gel manufacturing process.    Still more momentous for the future appears to be  nanotechnology invented by the INM basics researcher Prof.  Herbert Gleiter. There is an unpredictable number of possible  applications for this technology in areas ranging from metals  and plastics processing to optoelectronics and bioengineering.  <H5>  Multicolor Mixture </H5>   What is being researched at the Institute of New Materials?  Color emulsions for the nanotechnology: starting material for  ultrafine powders of particles a few nanometers in diameter.  <H5>  NANOCOMPOSITE MATERIALS </H5>    Smart Materials: Intelligent materials whose properties will  change for a purpose in response to light, electric signals, or  mechanical action are nanotechnological materials. With these  materials one can build active components which do not require  external sensors and control elements.    Environment-Protecting Materials: Custom made materials  which  absorb toxic gases or harmful liquids such as, for example,  gasoline sludge.    Bioengineering Materials: Nanocomposite materials can be  adjusted more precisely than conventional materials to given  biological conditions (e.g., for more compatible implants).    Materials for Integrated Optics: With nanocomposite  materials  one can produce special effects required of optical switches in  communications, engineering, and future computer engineering.  Passage of incident light rays through a transparent material of  this kind can be either permitted or barred by appropriate  optical signals.    Graded Materials: Controlled growth of the material  structure  makes it possible to impart special properties to thin  (micrometers thick) layers.    Coatings For Metals and Plastics: Nanotechnology facilitates  improvement of surface properties of addition of new ones.  <H5>  GLASS </H5>   Glass Composites: The sol-gel process makes it possible to  produce coatings which will confer a variety of properties on a  surface. The principal aim is to convert the glass surface into  an intelligent system to be used in vehicle construction,  architecture, and display techniques, etc.    Sintered Glasses: The processes which precede sintering  (baking a mixture by heating) in glass manufacture by the powder  technology are being further developed. Not only synthesis of  novel functional coatings for glass surfaces but also joining  glasses homogeneously at temperatures below the softening point  without use of adhesive becomes feasible.  <H5>  CERAMICS </H5>   Synthesis of Nanopowders: The goal is to eventually produce  diverse nanoparticles of almost any desirable composition and  size.    Processing Technology for Nanopowders: Techniques of  processing extremely fine raw materials already adjusted for  practical use by industry indicate new ways of making ceramic  materials.    Ceramics Processing Technology: Further development of the  nanotechnology is aimed at a lower cost of making completely  nondefective homogeneous raw ceramic materials (greenware) and  at lower the sintering temperatures.    Says INM researcher Reiner Kasemann, "The new forms of  material synthesis will trigger a revolution similar to that  triggered by microelectronics."    With tiniest particles, only a few dozens of times larger  than a molecule, it is possible to properly program the  properties of a material. This is so because the synthetic  midgets, visible only under a transmission electron microscope,  exhibit entirely new properties when assembled en masse.  Granules smaller than 15 nm in diameter thus become properly  transparent. A nanocomposite material made by mixing such  plastic and ceramic particles in an intricate chemical process  becomes astonishingly a transparent material.    This leads to application possibilities one can dream of.  Electrochromic and photochromic nanocomposites are thus being  developed by the INM whose color or optical transmittance can be  changed by application of voltage pulses or exposure to sunlight  respectively. Window glass coated with such a material could be  darkened instantaneously by push-button action.    In automobile manufacture, too, there are good opportunities  for smart nanomaterials. The color of rear and side windows, for  instance, can in the future be arbitrarily varied by an electric  signal coming from a dashboard switch. The benefit this feature  offers is that it prevents excessive heating of the interior by  intense solar radiation.  <H5>  Marketable Nanomixtures </H5>   In addition, Schmidt is now developing smart fluids for new  shock absorbers which will, within fractions of a second, adjust  their stiffness to the road condition. The mechanism of this  curious change rests on the damper fluid becoming as stiff as  legs exactly when an electrically controlled sensor indicates  very deep pot holes. On this basis, much more comfortable and  also simpler spring systems could eventually be built.    Nanomixtures of plastic and ceramic material are harder and  have a higher load capacity than every metal, which makes them  eminently suitable for coatings. Their first marketable  applications have already been developed:    1. For extra highly resistant aluminum surfaces.  Conventional  coating with epoxy resins provides merely inadequate long-term  protection and, moreover, requires surface cleaning and pickling  treatments during which chloroferous sludge is being discharged.  Much more scratch and wear resistant nanocoatings can, on the  contrary, be deposited without polluting prior surface treatment.    2. Nanocomposite materials are also eminently suitable for  dirt-repellant coatings. The INM material which consists of  special ingredients containing aluminum, silicon, and fluorine  respectively is much more durable than the conventional plastic  coating material and, in addition, prevents detrimental dirt  deposition.    3. The INOPEX GmbH in Saarbruck will eventually produce  bathroom mirrors with a nanocoating designed to prevent water  vapor deposition and to last much longer than comparable  products.    For ceramic materials nanotechnology offers downright  fantastic possibilities. The shortcoming of these  extraordinarily wear-resistant and high-temperature  heat-resistant materials has until now been their attendant  fragility, owing to irregularities of the original powder mass.  With the aid of the nanoparticle technique, the INM researchers  were able to effectively avoid dreaded formation of defects in a  very promising all-around material by making it from grains  thousand times finer than before.    In addition to that, the Saarbrueck researchers want to  produce by a novel processing technique the heretofore awfully  expensive nanopowder (now costing a few thousand DM/kg) for a  price of 50-150 DM/kg. They were the first ones able to mix  perfectly uniform ceramic particles only 15 nm in diameter so as  to space them closely but allow them to move freely. Until now  nanotechnologists unfortunately tended to produce particles on  the premise that making them smaller made its easier for them to  "stick" to one another, but this led to formation of worthless  lumps.    The INM researchers have tamed these obstinate midgets, a  billion of which would fit in a pinhead, by coating them with an  ultrathin molecular monolayer sheath. This sheath ensures that  they remain spaced exactly 0.4 nm apart.    This superior processing technique makes many heralded  applications for a heretofore notoriously fragile material  realizable. A nanoceramic material may to a large extent replace  steel or aluminum in automobiles. While it is so elastic as to  be suitable for spring components, its wear resistance and  high-temperature heat resistance are also so exceptional that  costly water cooling could be dispensed with.  <H5>  Meager Assistance </H5>   Despite all the successes and magnificent prospects, Schmidt  remains altogether skeptical about German materials research.  "Materials require an especially long lead time, ten years or  more being necessary for innovation. In Germany as a rule", the  INM chief complains, "no projects lasting longer then three  years are being subsidized."    Not so in Japan: The chief guardians of technology at the  Ministry of Industry MITI are pumping 10 billion dollars into  materials research over the 1989-98 period alone. For  comparison: According to the materials expert Michael Witzel at  the Arthur Little business consulting firm, the Federal Ministry  of Research and Technology subsidized altogether 577 projects  with only 894 million DM from 1985 till the beginning of 1992  and in the future it will provide rather less.    There is an additional disadvantage which the German  industry  faces in dealing with competition from the Far East: "The  research structures in Japan are," says INM chief Schmidt, "much  more efficacious. In Germany we have many specialists, to be  sure, but nobody who would lead them as would an orchestra  conductor toward coordinated team effort. In Japan this role is  taken over by MITI."  <H5>  TOP BUSINESS INFO </H5>   Institute of New Materials (INM) GmbH,  Saarbruecken established in 1987.

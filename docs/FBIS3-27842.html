			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 30 KYODO -- One of the nine extremists  who hijacked a Japan Airlines [JAL] flight to Pyongyang in 1970  made a publicized appeal to allow his daughter to return to  Japan, a group sympathetic to the hijackers said Sunday [30  January]. The letter from Takahiro Konishi, 49, who lives in  the North Korean capital, appeared in the January 29 edition of  a newsletter put out by the group.    He wrote that he wants his 16-year-old eldest daughter, who  is without nationality, "to study together with her Japanese  friends in the land of her ancestors."    Konishi is the sixth hijacker to indicate he wants to return  to Japan. It is the first time that a letter bearing the  hijacker's actual name was sent to Japan.    Nine former Sekigun-ha (Red Army faction) extremists  hijacked  the JAL Boeing-727 airliner and its crew of seven and 122  passengers on a flight from Tokyo to Fukuoka.    The plane landed in Seoul, where the passengers were  released, and continued on to Pyongyang, where the hijackers  defected.    Konishi also thanked the sympathizers' group for their  letters and gifts, and wrote he "was able to understand the  warmness of (Japanese) relatives" at a meeting three and a half  years ago in Pyongyang.    Konishi said that the meeting clarified his feelings and he  was certain he would return to Japan.    The seven families of the hijackers include 17 children, and  the sympathizers have been campaigning to acquire Japanese  nationality and passports for them so that they can return to  Japan.    Konishi said that if it is possible, he wants to send his  oldest daughter and her 14-year-old sister to Japan this summer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Jun (NA) -- Today, state workers in  Chaco, Salta, and Catamarca Provinces pursued their pressure  measures to demand payment of their wages and salaries, thus  expanding the level of conflict in the provinces of northwestern  Argentina.    Arnoldo Anibal Nunez, Catamarca Association of State Workers  (ATE) secretary general, confirmed today that public servants  are implementing a "business slowdown" that involves the  provincial public administration. Nunez reported that the  provincial government "has still not paid May wages to public  servants in the provincial capital, or April wages to municipal  workers in the interior of the province." The ATE secretary  general also reported that the government has still not paid the  one-time 130 peso school allowance that is usually paid at the  beginning of the academic year.    Yesterday, Catamarca court employees launched a struggle  program involving partial strikes, while municipal employees in  the city of Catamarca will begin a "business slowdown" today.    Nunez reported that the state workers will carry out a  demonstration on 17 June outside the government house. The  demonstration has been called by the Argentine Workers Congress  (CTA).    The teachers, grouped under the Association of Education  Workers, which is a CTERA [Confederation of Education Workers of  the Argentine Republic] associate, will hold a 24-hour strike  tomorrow to demand payment of their June wages.    In Salta, public servants will hold a strike and a  demonstration tomorrow outside the provincial Congress building  to demand a 500 peso minimum wage. Miguel Quiroga, Salta ATE  social action secretary, pointed out that the protest "will be  held to demand the timely payment of salaries, as health workers  and retirees have still not collected theirs."    Quiroga reported that the demonstration will be held to  protest the decision to transfer the pension fund to the federal  government, and to demand education and public health budget  increases.    In Chaco, the trade unions of state workers will hold a  general strike today to reject the provincial government's goal  of transferring the pension fund to the federal government. The  pressure measure will be accompanied by a demonstration outside  the provincial Congress building, where the Chamber of Deputies  will discuss a bill on the transfer of the Provincial Social  Security Institute.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: NY exchanges prepare for merger vote Members of New York's two biggest futures exchanges vote on Monday on a proposed merger that would result in an historic alliance between an international oil market and a global gold market. 'From a global point of view, this merger would make us (both exchanges) much more competitive,' Mr Daniel Rappaport, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and a vocal supporter of the plan, said yesterday. Although New York's fractious futures exchanges have made plans before, the current talks between Nymex and the smaller New York Commodities Exchange (Comex) have gone farther than any in recent memory. The plan, which needs approval from two-thirds of the Comex members who vote, and 50 per cent of Nymex votes to pass, would make Comex a division of Nymex. Comex's 786 members are being offered Dollars 50m in cash for their exchange, and would also retain beneficial trading rights for Comex and some Nymex products after the merger.</p>

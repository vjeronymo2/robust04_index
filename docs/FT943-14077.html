			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Germany loses 'sherpa' The German government is to lose its top international financial negotiator, Mr Gert Haller, state secretary in the Finance Ministry, to the private sector next year. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said yesterday that Mr Haller - who acts as the 'sherpa' for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the preparation of the Group of Seven world economic summits, and is the German government representative on the EU monetary committee - is to join the private Wustenrot building society and banking group as joint chief executive from next January. Mr Haller, 50, has been state secretary only since August last year, when Mr Horst Kohler, his predecessor, resigned to become president of the German savings banks association. Mr Waigel said Mr Haller had taken his decision for personal reasons. He insisted there had not been 'any hint of a disagreement' with him.</p>

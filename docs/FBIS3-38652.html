			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] We begin with news from Sarajevo where the  massacre of 68 people in the market last Saturday [5 February]  has again raised the possibility for European and U.S. foreign  ministries of airstrikes in Bosnia. [Passage omitted] The  Spanish position has been voiced repeatedly by Foreign Minister  Javier Solana, who invokes new UN resolutions before moving on  to such armed reprisals. But we have Foreign Minister Solana's  latest statements made just a few minutes before he left for  Brussels. Our colleague Hector Arenas has them. Good morning.    [Arenas] Good morning. Spain will support airstrikes,  especially on Serb positions in Bosnia, if that is decided by  NATO and the United Nations, although Spain will continue to  think that there is no military solution to this war but rather  a political one, of prior negotiations, which will enable the  ending of the terrible massacres of civilians like this  weekend's and the achieving of a lasting peace. This is what  can be deduced from the statements which Foreign Minister Javier  Solana made a few minutes ago as he left by plane for Brussels  for the meeting of EEC ministers. [Passage omitted]    [Begin Solana recording] If there is an intervention of this  kind, whose main aim, I stress, must be to raise the siege of  Sarajevo, Spain would logically say...[pauses] maintain a  position that this is what must be done; but being quite clear  in all of this that there is no military solution to this war,  that the solution to this terrible war is a solution of a  political nature, which is the only thing which can make a  lasting peace in these Balkan lands possible. Therefore any  actions set in motion must have the rationale of seeking or of  exerting pressure in the direction of a political solution. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley denies closure threat to rural post offices AN expanded range of benefits available for payment by automated credit transfer was outlined by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, in the Commons last night when he denied that large numbers of post offices, particularly in rural areas, faced closure. He accused Labour MPs of mounting a 'scare campaign' about the threat that the wider use of automated credit transfer for the payment of benefits into banks and building societies posed to the post office network. His renewal of earlier assurances that the government would maintain a nationwide network of post offices failed to satisfy Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's shadow social security secretary, and other opposition MPs. Mr Lilley explained that all small post offices - in the region of 3,000 - received a fixed sum regardless of the volume of benefit business, so their remuneration would not be affected by more people switching to automated credit transfer. Girobank last night welcomed Mr Lilley's 'assurance that the government needs the post office network to deliver benefits and that many millions would still prefer payment across the counter'. During the debate Mr Lilley said pensions, child benefit and disability allowances were already available for payment by automated credit transfer, and a start had been made in phasing in unemployment, income support, invalidity and severe disability allowance. He emphasised that the delivering of benefits was the biggest single item in his department's operating costs (Pounds 650m a year). Mr Jim Cousins, in the final speech from the Labour front bench, angered Tory MPs by claiming that the government had 'chosen to make war upon the sub-post offices'. Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, said sub-post offices were an integral part of rural and urban life, and the government intended to keep them, but the network should be flexible. He added: 'That does not and cannot mean that no post office will ever close  -that would be absurd.' He reaffirmed that the government's commitment to a nationwide network would apply whether the future of the post office lay in the public or the private sector. The government won a majority of 36 (311-275) to defeat a Labour motion condemning the uncertainty caused by encouraging the use of automated credit transfers for the payment of benefits.</p>

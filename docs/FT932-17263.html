			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Total plunges to FFr2.85bn on low oil prices TOTAL, the French oil group, yesterday confirmed that it suffered a steep decline in net income to FFr2.85bn (Dollars 518m) last year from FFr5.81bn in 1991, due to low oil prices and adverse exchange rates. The fall in profits comes at a delicate time for Total, which last year staged a FFr9.5bn share sale in which the then socialist government reduced its holding from 31.6 per cent to 15 per cent. The group is a candidate for full privatisation by France's new conservative administration. Sales fell to FFr136.61bn in 1992 from FFr143.02bn in 1991, while operating profits slipped to FFr7.32bn from FFr10.33bn over the same period. Earnings per share fell from FFr27.50 to FFr13.50. The worst affected area of activity was refining, where operating profits fell sharply to FFr2.15bn from FFr4.87bn. Total said the impact of the squeeze on refining margins was mitigated by improvements in marketing. The group also suffered a steep decline in its trading and Middle Eastern business, where operating profits almost halved to FFr567m from FFr1.04bn. However, Total managed to maintain operating profits at FFr2.94bn in exploration and production. The chemicals division saw profits rise to FFr1.66bn last year from FFr1.49bn in 1991, mainly as a result of rationalisation. The reduction in operating profits contributed to a fall in cashflow to FFr9.95bn from FFr13.65bn. Gearing rose to 31 per cent from 25 per cent. Coface, the French overseas export credit guarantee agency, saw net consolidated profits rise by 11.2 per cent to FFr157.8m in 1992 from FFr141.9m in 1991. The company, which is controlled by the French government, earlier this year gained a new shareholder in Societe Commerciale de Reassurances, France's largest reinsurance group, which bought a 20 per cent stake. Mr Pierre-Yves Cosse, chairman, said that group sales rose by 39 per cent from FFr1.2bn in 1991 to FFr1.66bn last year, although on a constant structure the increase would have been significantly lower at 12.5 per cent to just FFr1.34bn.</p>

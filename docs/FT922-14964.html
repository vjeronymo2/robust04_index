			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (4): Council seeks fresh responsibilities - Local Authorities FOR a time last month it looked as if the Milton Keynes Development Corporation would end its life on a discordant note. It was involved in a row with the borough council about the takeover of certain community-related assets. Before it was wound up on March 31, the corporation had been disposing of its outstanding assets in various ways. The 3,500 acres of land still scheduled for factories, houses, offices and shops has been taken over by the Commission for New Towns. This is the government 'realisation agency' which is responsible for liquidating all the remaining assets of the 21 new towns in England and Wales. The development corporation is leaving little in the form of buildings to the CNT. There is a mixture of about 500,000 sq ft of offices and factories to be disposed of. Nearly all the other factories, offices and shops have been sold either to tenants or to institutions. The houses which were built by the development corporation until the early 1980s, and which were not sold to tenants under the government's right-to-buy scheme, have largely gone to the Milton Keynes Borough Council. There are about 13,000 tenants and shared owners. In a recent ballot, 84 per cent of these opted to be taken over by the borough council, while the remainder will go to housing trusts. The outstanding community-related assets are going in five directions - to the county council, the borough council, parish councils, the voluntary sector and various community trusts. The borough council estimates that there are 350 community assets, including playing fields, meeting places, allotments, parkland and works of art. Buckingham County Council will take over responsibility for libraries, schools and other educational establishments plus roads. Public sector housing has usually been the bailiwick of district or borough councils. Apart from the houses, the Milton Keynes Borough Council - which covers an area larger than the corporation's designated area - is inheriting, allotments, playing fields, children's centres and playgrounds, and some district parks and community centres. With these assets usually comes a balancing income package. The development corporation also hands over commercial premises, shops, public houses and factories which it owned so that recipients of the community-related assets (CRAs) have an income and the means to run them. These income packages run to several million pounds a year. The row between the council and the development corporation involved some of the last of the CRAs, the so-called linear parks, which run along watercourses such as the Loughton Valley park, the Ouzel and Ouse Valley Parks, and make up one fifth of the city area . The development corporation wanted to set up a trust board to take control of the linear parks and other spaces. Mr Frank Henshaw, the last general manager of the development corporation, says: 'The linear parks are such a unique feature of Milton Keynes we wanted to set up trusts that would be exclusively involved in maintaining them as they are.' The borough council wanted local residents to choose who would be responsible for the parks and how they should be run. The council went to court where a judge ruled that the corporation could not simply transfer the parks to the Milton Keynes Parks Trust and said it was up to Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, to decide their future. At the eleventh hour, a compromise was reached between the borough council, the county council, the development corporation and the Parks Trust. It was agreed that the freehold of the parks would be transferred to the borough council. The parks trust will be given a very long lease and a balancing package of about Pounds 2m a year to run the parks. Behind the row about the linear parks is the much larger issue of relations between local authorities and the central government. Most local authorities, but especially those of a different political persuasion to the Conservative party governments of the past 12 years, have chafed under the progressive emasculation of local councils' spending rights. In particular, many local authorities resented the fact that it became difficult to build public sector housing. In places where government quangos such as development corporations were imposed, local councils became doubly frustrated because not only funds were channelled through the quangos, but also planning rights for both housing and industrial and commercial property. In the 1970s, the development corporation built lots of houses, some of which it sold, others which it let. The corporation was a pioneer in shared ownership and low-cost social housing. By 1984, the government decreed it could build no more. The 13,000 houses which had tenants were transferred to the borough council to manage. Mr Gifford says: 'We were very pleased when in the ballot last year 84 per cent of the tenants decided they wanted us as landlords. 'Our stock is now 18,000 so we have more flexibility in dealing with the homeless and needy.' Taking over the houses is one way that the borough council sees itself increasing its responsibilities and emerging from the sidelines. It would also like to have taken over the land which has gone to the CNT. Mr Gifford says: 'Much of the land has already received planning consent anyway, and we are satisfied that the land will be developed in accordance with the masterplan under which most of Milton Keynes has already been built.' After 25 years with a development corporation standing over it, the borough council wants to emerge in its own right and run as many areas of Milton Keynes as it can.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: Montedison back to the black with L289bn pre-tax Montedison, the Italian industrial company recovering from near-collapse last year, has returned to pre-tax profits for the first time since 1991. It unexpectedly released its half-year results yesterday, showing profits before tax and minority interests of L289bn (Dollars 184.6m) for the six months to June, compared with a loss of L369bn in the first half of 1993. About 30 per cent of Montedison is controlled by Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin). Unusually for Italian companies, which normally publish results after the market closes, the announcement was made at lunchtime. The share price immediately rose by more than 5 per cent to a high of L1,452, before falling back to close at L1,390, up L11. The results demonstrate the benefits of the drastic restructuring and cost-cutting carried out by the current management since last summer. So far, Montedison has raised some L1,100bn by hiving off non-strategic businesses to concentrate on the principal activities of agro-industry, energy and chemicals. In the first six months of the year, with the help of a capital increase, the group's debt fell L4,416bn to L11,425bn, and financial charges in the first half of 1994 were L264bn lower than in the equivalent period. Profits in the first six months of last year were also undermined by the need to write off extraordinary losses of L353bn, following revelations at a dramatic shareholder meeting in June 1993 that group losses were 35 per cent higher than originally announced. The current board, headed by Mr Guido Rossi, took over immediately after that meeting, spawning a series of lawsuits and counter-suits in its attempts to recover damages from its predecessors, the Ferruzzi family, and the group's former auditor Price Waterhouse. The group's gross operating profit rose to L1,385bn in the first half of this year, from L1,296bn in the same period last year. The figure for last year was restated because of changes in accounting rules. Net operating profits grew by 10 per cent to L812bn from L739bn. Turnover was almost unchanged at L10,248bn. Montedison's parent company cut its losses to L349bn before tax in the first half, against a loss of L1,085bn last time.</p>

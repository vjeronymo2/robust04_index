			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US pork farmers await ruling US PORK producers are waiting with some anxiety for the outcome of their 'extraordinary challenge' to a US-Canadian panel whose ruling on an American anti-subsidy complaint, expected today, could remove the approximately Dollars 18 a head countervailing duty imposed on Canadian swine imports. The Americans have three times gone before such 'bi-national' panels, established under the US-Canadian Free Trade Agreement, and each time they have lost. This time, said Mr Russ Sanders, executive vice president of the National Pork Producers Council, a loss could set a precedent allowing bi-national panels to 'rewrite US trade law'. Even so, a defeat would mean only a stumble in the otherwise forward movement of US producers into a future which once seemed clouded by the fitness and nutrition crazes of the last 20 years. Clever marketing and judicious use of US trade policy are paying off, and the industry is surging ahead of its competition and past expectations. This year production could exceed last year's record-breaking 17.2bn lbs. Despite its worries about the Canadian competition and the EC Third Country Meat Directive (which has slashed exports to Europe), the industry is confident and promising to export more aggressively than ever. The Pork Producers Council attributes its turn-around to a little noticed 1985 'legislative checkoff,' which let farmers vote to contribute automatically from each sale to a Dollars 35m-Dollars 40m marketing fund. The Council's 'Pork - The Other White Meat' campaign has dramatically reshaped the product's image and boosted US consumer demand. Exports overall were up about 56 per cent in volume terms, while imports were down 17.5 per cent. In addition, the North American Free Trade Agreement promises the possibility of a young, more prosperous market, 100m consumers strong.</p>

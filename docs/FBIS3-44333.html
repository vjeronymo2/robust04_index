A survey shows that the province has invited 250 foreign  experts to work in industry and agriculture over the past three  years.    Using an agro-technique imported from Japan, Zhejiang has  harvested an additional 783.5 kg per ha on 10.88 ha of  experimental farmland. The technique is now being promoted  across the province.    With help from a German expert, the Hangzhou Steam Turbine  Plant in this provincial capital has improved technological  processes and modernized its products, which are now sold well  abroad.    To attract more foreign know-how, the provincial government  has worked out special preferential policies while encouraging  localities to take good care of foreign experts.</p>

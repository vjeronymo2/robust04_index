			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: TSD shares suspended on false data claim TSD, a Japanese biotechnology and computer software company, triggered a plunge in biotechnology-related stocks on the Tokyo stock market yesterday, following an allegation that it had presented investors with false information concerning clinical tests of its HIV vaccine. Shares in TSD, which are traded on Tokyo's over-the-counter market, were suspended on Friday by the Japan Securities Dealers Association after reports alleging that TSD was misinforming investors. On the OTC market yesterday, TSD shares did not trade due to the lack of buyers, and closed at an offered price of Y2,320, down by a daily limit of Y400 from Thursday's close. In August last year, TSD announced that clinical tests for its anti-HIV vaccine, co-developed with a professor of Yokohama City University, had begun in a Thai hos-pital on HIV positive patients. TSD's stock surged, rising to a high of Y3,650 in September 1991 from a year's low of Y730 posted in April. The rise in TSD's share price prompted a bulk of its convertible bonds worth SFr45m (Dollars 32.1m), issued in 1990, to be converted into equity. Mr Tsutomu Matsuzaki, president of TSD, last Friday admitted that the company had yet to start the clinical tests since full approval from the Thai government had not yet been obtained. However, he denied allegations of giving false information to raise TSD's stock price. After the market closed yesterday, Mr Matsuzaki announced the Thai Public Health Ministry had approved clinical tests of TSD's vaccine, and the company was waiting for approval by the National Aids Committee.</p>

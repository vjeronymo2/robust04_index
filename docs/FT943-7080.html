			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Observer: Midge too far If you bump into a building worker from Miller Group, whatever you do, don't compliment him on the sweet smells emanating from his body. For he may be involved in constructing the bridge across the Kyle of Lochalsh to Skye in Scotland, and be a mite sensitive about his current bathing habits. His pals have discovered one certain prophylactic against the dreadful biting midges which plague the site whenever the Hebridean winds abate. Thanks to cosmetic company Avon's Skin-So-Soft bath oil, they can now get on with the job in peace. And they might not be in a joking mood in the pub after the day's work is done.</p>

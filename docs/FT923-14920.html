			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Books: An elegant record of dangerous living TWO ALONE, TWO TOGETHER: LETTERS BETWEEN INDIRA GANDHI AND JAWAHARLAL NEHRU, 1940-1964 edited by Sonia Gandhi Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 30, 697 pages UNLIKE most Indians, the Nehrus were great preservers of paper. That such a large number of the pre-1947 letters have survived is indeed fortunate - some were lost in police raids on the Nehru household in Allahabad, but the bulk survived. The present volume is a sequel to Freedom's Daughter, published in 1989. In both, we get rare insights into deep family bonds and commitments. Sonia Gandhi has skilfully and lovingly put together a unique correspondence recording the public and private lives of two remarkable people. Nehru wrote elegantly and stylishly. Even when he was being didactic he was never dull or dreary. Indira Nehru (as she was till 1942) inherited from her father a profound respect for books. She was exceptionally well read. Like her father she was a lover of words and phrases, a great stickler for grammar and syntax. Her style was less introspective but more trenchant. It evolved over the years and acquired a pace, tone, rhythm and voice all its own. At the end of Freedom's Daughter we left Indira ill in a sanatorium in Switzerland, mostly confined to bed. She had pleurisy, was 22, lonely and depressed. It was war time. Mail was disrupted; letters took weeks to arrive. She greatly missed books and asked for some. Nehru, who was then out of prison, sent her books and observed 'to suffer from lack of books and papers is something that never struck me. I know well how I would feel if I had to do without books. I could bear almost anything but that.' Then we come across an amazingly candid letter from Nehru, who at this time was in one of his, to borrow Churchill's phrase, 'black dog' moods. On March 11, 1940 he wrote: 'Public and private life act and react on each other, and this sense of failure has pursued me in almost all I do. With this lack of faith in myself, how can I advise anyone? What right do I have to interfere in another's life? I have not made my own a brilliant success and all my good intentions, or so I imagined they were, have not prevented me often from making a mess of things . . .' Seven years later he was Prime Minister. Indira Gandhi recovered and returned to India; Nehru was back in prison. Their first meeting did not go well and caused Nehru much anguish. The crisis was obviously serious. Daughter to Father from the Himalayan hill station, Mussorie: 'I am in the throes of remorse and regret . . . Is it any use saying forgive me? I can only hope and pray that this will be a lesson for me to be less stubborn . . . And so the erring child asks for forgiveness, and asks too that you believe her when she says that she loves you . . . Tous les jours je t'aime davantage, aujourdhui plus qu'hier et moins que demain.' Next we have wonderful letters prior to and following Rajiv Gandhi's birth in 1944. Nehru was again in jail. Then came Independence in 1947. Inevitably this brought vast changes in the lives of the family. The rebel and the non-violent revolutionary became the ruler and the reformer, the agitator the administrator. These letters bring back the memories and turmoils of a bygone era and a lost way of life. Their tone is so civilised, the approach to life so daring at one level, so restrained at the other. And what is so appealing is that politics does not consume their entire lives. Literature, poetry, love of beauty and nature, travel, photography, a zest for life in the most adverse circumstances, mark them out as exceptional people. These are not dreary, dismal, self-pitying, one-dimensional, professional politicians, but sensitive and beautiful human beings, who like to live dangerously.</p>

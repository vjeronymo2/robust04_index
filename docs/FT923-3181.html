			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK food retailing Recession came late to Britain's food retailers. In part that reflects the power that the large supermarket groups wield. They have managed to maintain their margins by squeezing their suppliers hard, as the pain in the food manufacturing sector amply demonstrates. Good stock control and a tight grip on staff costs have also helped the giants - Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway - preserve their position at the expense of smaller firms. But there are limits to that strategy. Excluding the effects of new stores and Sunday opening, sales volumes are disappointing. Tesco, which reports interim figures next week, seems to be suffering more than Sainsbury, the market leader, or Safeway. This may partly be because it sells more goods vulnerable to price wars, such as petrol and children's clothing, and its customers may have suffered more in the recession. But in trying to control costs, Tesco has withdrawn expensive facilities such as bakeries from some stores, and that may put some high-spending customers off. Given the enormous capital expenditure programme, and the rights issue which helped fund it, investors can be forgiven for wondering whether they will see an appropriate return. This is all the more so since its expensive developments are not depreciated and are of questionable value for alternative uses. Much of that concern has been reflected in the market rating of Tesco this year. But with Sainsbury benefiting as Tesco falters, it may be right to stick with the market leader.</p>

The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant, a Massachusetts trust, is an open-end management company that may issue more than one series of shares with each series representing a separate investment portfolio. On November 25, 1985, applicant registered under the Act as an investment company and filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 to register shares for two series: the Equity Series and the U.S. Government Series (currently, the U.S. Government Capital Accumulation Series and referred to herein as the ``Accumulation Series''). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The registration statement was declared effective on September 4, 1986, and applicant's initial public offering commenced immediately thereafter. On April 30, 1990 and February 24, 1992, applicant filed post-effective amendments to register shares for two new series: the U.S. Government Adjustable Rate Series (the ``Adjustable Rate Series'') and the Oklahoma Municipal Bond, Tax Free Series (the ``Oklahoma Series''), respectively. The amendments were effective on the date of filing and the public offering for the respective series commenced immediately thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On October 26, 1990, the U.S. Government Series changed its investment objectives and name to the U.S. Government Capital Accumulation Series pursuant to majority shareholder vote. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. During the period from 1987 to 1990, the Equity Series performed poorly and, as a result, a substantial number of shareholders redeemed their shares. As of June 30, 1990, the Equity Series had only 12 shareholders. In addition, applicant's investment adviser at the time, James Baker &amp; Company (``James Baker''), determined that it would no longer subsidize the Equity Series through reimbursements of expenses as it had done in prior years. Shareholders were notified of this determination by letter dated October 3, 1990. As a result, all shareholders of Equity Series other than James Baker redeemed their shares. At a shareholder meeting held on October 26, 1990, James Baker, as sole shareholder, approved the liquidation of the Equity Series and redeemed its shares at net asset value shortly thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In December 1992, James Baker &amp; Associates (the successor to James Baker and referred to herein as ``James Baker II'') notified the Oklahoma Series board of trustees that it also would no longer subsidize the Oklahoma Series through reimbursements of expenses. Shareholders were notified of this determination by letter dated December 12, 1992. As a result, the public shareholders redeemed their shares at net asset value. As of February 28, 1993, James Baker II was the sole remaining shareholder. On March 19, 1993, James Baker II voted to liquidate the series and redeemed its shares at net asset value shortly thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The portfolio securities for both the Equity Series and the Oklahoma Series were liquidated at market value to fund the public shareholders' redemptions. Accordingly, at the time of liquidation, both series no longer maintained a portfolio of securities. No brokerage commissions were incurred with these transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. On June 29, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved termination of the Adjustable Rate Series and the Accumulation Series and the liquidation of applicant. On September 1, 1993, applicant mailed proxy materials to the shareholders of each series. At a joint meeting held on September 17, 1993, the shareholders of the series approved the termination of their respective series and the liquidation of applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Pursuant to the liquidation, the portfolio securities of the Adjustable Rate Series and the Accumulation Series, which consisted of U.S. government or agency issued securities, were sold at market value. No brokerage commissions were incurred in these transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In connection with the liquidation, the Adjustable Rate Series paid approximately $2,289,463 to its redeeming shareholders and the Accumulation Series paid approximately $14,559,895 to its redeeming shareholders. Shares were redeemed at net asset value of the respective series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. James Baker II will bear all the costs for the liquidation of applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. As of the date of the application, applicant had no assets, debts or liabilities, and was not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. On June 30, 1994, applicant filed a notice of termination with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts which terminated its existence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Applicant is neither engaged in nor proposes to engage in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

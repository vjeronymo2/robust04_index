			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The budget for the current year is the object of  special attention by the Provincial Assemblies of the People's  Government, which have held or scheduled special sessions to  analyze this matter. Journalist Gisela Bel Heredia comments on  this topic.    [Bel, live or recorded] The qualitative change in the way  the  state budget is being discussed and approved at various levels  can be considered an important part of the battle won. With  regard to the budget projections for 1994, from approval that  was almost a mere formality, approval essentially handled  internally by specialists, responsibility for rigor and  awareness of each and every figure, as well as knowledge of the  funds' destinations, are no longer theirs alone. Indeed, those  who bear responsibility for finances and for requesting or  granting more money have not been left alone. Rather, those who  manage the various spheres or organizations have been called  upon -- and, moreover, insistently -- to fully grasp the budget  in question.    Furthermore, in order to reduce the budget deficit in every  province, for example, action plans have been provided for,  plans in which the word "monitoring" is written in capital  letters.    For the delegates of the local People's Government  assemblies  and the deputies of the National Assembly, to approve the budget  or not turns into an exercise that requires a position much more  collegial and realistic, assuming the characteristics conferred  upon them by the Constitution of the Republic. We thus reach the  conclusion that, although open to important improvements, the  new stance vis-a-vis the budget is not a simple skirmish, but  rather a battle that heavily influences victory in the long run.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Beazer Homes jumps by 20% to Pounds 15.6m Pre-tax profits of Beazer Homes, the former Hanson subsidiary which was floated only two months ago, jumped by a fifth from Pounds 13m to Pounds 15.6m during the six months to March 31. The improvement had been widely expected and the shares yesterday fell 2p to 154p, against an issue price of 165p. Shares prices of housebuilders have fallen sharply since March amid fears that the next interest rate movement will be upwards, undermining housing market confidence. Mr Dennis Webb, chief executive, said yesterday that turnover during the six months had risen by 26 per cent, from Pounds 105.8m to Pounds 133.1m. Earnings per share, after a 26 per cent tax charge, were 4.6p (5.2p). The group, which is changing its year end to June 30, intends to pay a dividend of 1.8p for the nine months to the end of June. Mr Webb hoped future distributions to shareholders would be covered by earnings at least 2 to 3 times. The group completed 2,210 homes during the period - 17 per cent more than the 1,884 completed a year earlier. The average price of a home rose from Pounds 57,400 to Pounds 61,600. Operating margins, however, fell from 12.6 per cent to 11.9 per cent - as forecast in the flotation prospectus. Mr Webb said that he would expect margins to start to recover slightly. At the end of March the group had net cash of Pounds 74.7m available for land purchases and acquisitions. It plans to increase annual output to about 7,000 homes by the end of the decade, compared with about 5,000 to 5,500 currently. Mr Webb said the market for housing land was very difficult in south-east England with some buyers paying 'silly prices'. Nonetheless, it was still possible to buy some sites by private treaty at sensible prices. At the period end the group owned 16,552 plots with planning permission in its books at Pounds 9,000 a plot, compared with Pounds 8,500 a plot when the flotation prospectus was published. COMMENT Beazer Homes' shares have fallen by more than 5 per cent from the issue price reflecting general stock market concern about the potential impact of rising interest rates and land prices on housebuilders' profits. The potential for Beazer to improve its margins is less than for some of its rivals given that it has opted for 'jam today' policy by writing down land values to include a margin for profit. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m for the nine months to June and Pounds 51m for the following 12 months would put the company on 12 times earnings on 1994-95 profits. The rating is unlikely to improve in the short term with sentiment running against housebuilders and the market waiting to see how wisely the group intends to spend its cash. The jury is still out.</p>

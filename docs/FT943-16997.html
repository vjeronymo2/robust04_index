			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Property: Atlantic alliance - The outlook for the US and west European markets is positive Signs are emerging of rising investment activity by US property groups in Europe at the same time as a corresponding show of interest by their European counterparts in the American market. This intriguing cross-Atlantic activity reflects the difference in the speed at which markets are moving in America and Europe. The speed of the rise in UK commercial property values over the past 18 months, for instance, has been greater than anyone had forecast. However, the high returns that have been generated are now at risk with the present rise in long-term UK interest rates. This vulnerability is most evident in over-rented investments - where rental income is considerably in excess of today's rental value. As a consequence, there is increasing interest in so-called 'rack-rented' investments - where income is equal to present market value - currently the focus of domestic investor activity in the UK largely on the back of rising confidence in the outlook for rental growth. A strong home market - such as the UK's - is often the precursor to a move overseas by investors. This appears to have been the case for German investors recently and the same factor may underlie confidence among UK institutions' renewed engagement in European and US markets. In west Germany commercial property yields in all sectors in the big cities remain stable and are supported by the liquid German open-ended funds (dedicated property invest-ment vehicles similar to unit trusts). It is unsurprising, therefore, that German open-ended funds have been active abroad in the 24 months since they were given the freedom to invest outside of Germany. Today, there is still an advantage for these funds to invest in the UK compared with their own domestic markets because property offers a higher yield. France, in contrast, has a quiet investment market and evidence of market activity is scarce. Transfer costs associated with property purchases in France add an additional 15 per cent to the overall cost, largely because of the high level of stamp duty (in the UK total transfer costs is a relatively low 3 per cent), a deterrent to overseas groups weighing the various merits of different markets. Spain, too, is the focus of attention from UK and other international investors. After three poor years for property, values look relatively cheap and the prospects for growth are considered excellent in an economy emerging from recession. In both retail and office sectors investors expect good growth and recent changes in landlord and tenant law are regarded as helpful to investment returns. Dutch and Belgian markets appear to be missing out on overseas investor scrutiny; activity in Belgium in particular is low. Dutch institutions and property funds have nevertheless always been at the forefront of those groups active overseas, with renewed interest in the UK, US and other European markets typical of Dutch overseas forays. In the US, in all sectors of prime commercial property other than the best shopping malls, yields are in the region of 8-10 per cent, while in selected locations improved rental values are forecast within the next 12-18 months. This suggests that on the international stage the US looks to be one of the most attractive markets. The combination of good growth prospects in rental value in the medium term, the high initial yield and the ability to borrow locally at competitive rates make the US a compelling target for international investors. German, UK and Dutch investors as well as Middle Eastern and far eastern groups are all actively looking at the US market. Continental European markets all have some attraction for UK investors with Spain and France receiving particular attention. These markets are nevertheless relatively illiquid compared with the UK; in addition, with the exception of Paris which is a larger office market than London, the big cities of the continent are small by comparison with UK or US investment locations. Continental cities' capacity to absorb large international investor cash flows may therefore curb the overall level of activity. By the same token, those quickest off the mark in identifying opportunities in relatively small European markets are likely to be well rewarded. The principal US investors interested in Europe are the larger pension funds keen to diversify beyond America. US funds' interest in Europe is gathering pace at the same time as an increasing awareness of the attractions of their home market. American investors will inevitably be better placed to spot opportunities in their own backyard in the face of rising interest from European competitors. As the year unfolds, activity is likely to accelerate in markets on both sides of the Atlantic. The speed of change has already surprised market observers in the UK and it is gathering pace in the US. By contrast most leading European capitals are lagging but the attention being paid to these markets suggests that activity may soon rise there, too. Investors are motivated by the search for high yields combined with good quality growth prospects - a heady cocktail for those in economies with low growth prospects and high real interest rates. However, it is possible that there will be an insufficient number of quality properties on the market for the large pool of investment funds available; if this situation arises, it will add an extra dimension to the debate about the interplay between property prices and long-term interest rates. The present fragility of prices in the UK for over-rented investments represents the first round in this encounter. The author is chairman of Jones Lang Wootton Fund Management</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Death of banker who helped shape West Germany: The career of Hermann Josef Abs was one of the most brilliant of the century - but marred by his close links to the Third Reich Hermann Josef Abs, who died at the weekend aged 92, personified both the triumphs and some of the problems of German business during the past 60 years. During his post-war heyday as head of Deutsche Bank, the country's largest bank, Mr Abs won renown as the quintessential German banker, using his network of directorships and influence to play a significant role in rebuilding the West German economy. A man whose mild appearance belied his capacity for hard work and occasional ruthlessness, Mr Abs stood for many years at the centre of corporate Germany. Aged only 36, he became a member of the Deutsche Bank management board in 1938 - a position in which he stayed throughout the second world war. He remained Deutsche Bank's honorary chairman up to his death. Not least because of his war-time role, he ranked among the most controversial bankers of the century - as well as one of the most outstanding. Abs was the chairman of Deutsche Bank's management board between 1957 and 1967, and headed the supervisory board for a subsequent decade until 1976. The influence of Deutsche Bank and the country's other big universal banks on Germany's corporate and financial life has been modified since Abs ceased to play an active role in Deutsche Bank's affairs. In an increasingly integrated Europe, the banks' domination of the securities industry and their strong corporate links now look less pronounced than in the immediate post-war period. Deutsche Bank none the less retains a pivotal position in the German economy  -a tribute to the capacity of Abs and his contemporaries to rebuild the country's big banks after the war along the lines of traditions laid down when they were established in the 1870s. One of Germany's post-war traditions is that Deutsche Bank has periodically attracted praise and vilification in roughly equal measure. Abs, once termed by David Rockefeller 'the world's leading banker', was also labelled a 'Richelieu': he was frequently exposed to criticism that he enjoyed too much power for Germany's own good. Whatever may be said against the traditional German system of universal banks - combining roles as lenders, traders of securities and long-term share owners - it has achieved an accomplished track record stretching back more than a century. By allowing banks and industry to build up and extend long-term relationships, the system that Abs helped restore after the war allowed West Germany for a long time to overcome short-term economic vicissitudes with greater success than most of its European trading partners. That system is now being put to a crucial test as a result of the trials of German unification. Virtually throughout his career, Abs followed a steeply rising path. He was born into a comfortably-off Catholic family in Bonn on October 15 1901. After a false start on a quickly abandoned university law course, he turned to banking. His apprenticeship took him to London, Paris, Amsterdam and the Americas. In 1935, at the age of 34, he became a partner in a well-known Berlin private bank, Delbruck, Schickler &amp; Co. Within three years he joined Deutsche Bank - at the time, a frontline institution, but not yet the biggest in Germany. His more senior German colleagues recognised early Abs' capacity and judgment in international banking matters. One of his pre-war accomplishments was to help represent Germany at negotiations to freeze the banks' foreign debts. In view of his intelligence, sardonicism and Catholic background, Abs was regarded with hostility by the more rabid members of the Nazi party. He was never a party member. But throughout the war he remained close to some of the technocrats running parts of the Nazi economy. As a professional associate of Walter Funk, the Reichsbank president, he was a member until 1945 of the Reichsbank's advisory council. In spring 1945, as the war neared an end in Berlin, Abs left the German capital bound for Hamburg in a Karstadt department store delivery lorry crammed with Deutsche Bank files. After a short-lived appointment as an adviser to the British military government, he was imprisoned by the Americans for three months and was proposed in 1948 as the first head of the Bank Deutscher Lander, the nascent federal bank and the forerunner of the Bundesbank. He turned the job down - above all, it seems, because the US occupation authorities had made clear they would not have him. Abs' ambivalent war-time activities remained controversial to his death. Unlike many Germans of his generation, Abs never claimed to have resisted Hitler. A man who was not imprisoned or hanged or shot by the Nazis cannot claim to have opposed Hitler, he once said. Deutsche Bank helped the Nazis confiscate Jewish property and assets in the late 1930s and 1940s as part of the Aryanisation laws. Abs had also been on the supervisory board of IG Farben, the conglomerate with a stake in the chemicals company that developed the Zyklon B gas used to kill millions of Jews in gas chambers. After 1945, Abs helped some Jewish clients who had escaped the death camps to recover compensation from the Bonn government. But he also had to challenge in a German court assertions made in a 1970 book that he had participated in forced sales and expropriation of Jewish property. The court found none of the book's accusations valid. In 1983, as a result of criticism of his pre-1945 activities, Abs suffered the ignominy of being put on a US government watch-list of undesirable aliens, and was officially barred from entering the US. However, this did not, according to the Deutsche Bank, prevent him from making periodic US trips. Abs' real post-war career began in 1953 when, in a milestone marking West Germany's reintegration into the community of nations, he negotiated the London agreement restructuring Germany's foreign indebtedness. In a step which freed Germany from the burden of reparations that had blemished the survival chances of the Weimar Republic, Germany's debts were written down and allowed to be repaid between 1953 and 1983 - an accord that became a model for many subsequent rescheduling agreements. Abs was also appointed head of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the German reconstruction bank that channelled assistance from the Marshall Plan to West Germany's war-damaged economy. Abs went on to head the southern German group of the three banks into which the allies had split Deutsche Bank. There he engineered the reunification of the three successors, becoming head of the reconstituted Deutsche Bank's executive board in 1957. During this time, Abs build up his close relationship with Konrad Adenauer, the first West German chancellor, in office between 1949 and 1963 - a fellow Rhinelander, sharing Abs' mordant wit and his taste for power. Abs was once asked whether the rumour was true that the 'old man' had once asked him to become foreign minister. Abs' oblique reply was: 'When Adenauer really wanted something, he didn't ask you  -he told you.' Abs' was fluent in three languages and had a working knowledge of three more. He spoke the clipped, sometimes slightly archaic English of a country squire - gentle in tone, acid in content. His capacity for work was legendary. He claimed that, for weeks on end, he could work every day - habitually at a stand-up desk - from 8am until midnight. On top of this, he found time to collect French Impressionists and to head committees running Beethoven's birthplace in Bonn and Goethe's in Frankfurt. If Abs' voice was conservative, it was also that of a classic banking paternalist. One of his recurring themes was that business must serve the community. A much-repeated aphorism was that profits were no end in themselves; to conduct business for profit alone would be like living only to breathe. Society would tolerate private business only if it could prove that profits for the enterprise created benefits for society. That may be dismissed as German corporatism, yet Abs was no particular friend of the German laws giving trade unions and workers' representatives a voice in management. He thought management methods needed to change periodically to give all employees an interest in their company. As early as the 1950s he warned that currencies should not be kept strong mainly by high interest rates. He tried - and failed - to use his influence with the Bonn government in 1961 to 1969 to prevent the two 1960s D-Mark revaluations - steps that he viewed as harmful to Germany's export-oriented industry. By 1970, mindful of the requirement for durable European monetary arrangements, he was talking of the need for a European central bank. His experience of the Third Reich explained part of Abs' caution over expanding Deutsche Bank into foreign countries. He believed that co-operation with foreign banks, rather than outright takeovers, marked the most appropriate course. As memories of war receded and a new generation took over the helm, Deutsche Bank's policy became more adventurous. The most dramatic international move came at the end of 1989 when Deutsche Bank bought the UK's Morgan Grenfell for Pounds 950m, much increasing its clout in areas such as international mergers and acquisitions. The bank justified the move in the sort of under-stated terms much used by Abs: Deutsche Bank could learn much about investment banking from its new London subsidiary. At the peak during the post-war period, Abs was a member of 24 supervisory boards in Germany - so many that a law was passed in 1965 limiting bankers' board appointments. The two-tier system of management and supervisory board was and is the foundation upon which bank influence over industrial and other concerns is based. In the 1960s, Abs teamed up with Professor Karl Schiller, the Social Democratic economics minister, to use his prestige and contacts to devise a network of warranties which saved the Krupp concern from almost certain bankruptcy. He also helped to engineer the transaction in the 1970s by which Kuwait bought a stake in Daimler-Benz from the Flick family when it lost interest in controlling the star performer of German industry. In the post-Abs era even some Deutsche Bank directors have recognised that the traditional system may be a bit too cosy, forecasting that, eventually, the banks will run down their shareholdings in industry. Deutsche Bank executives still, however, are thought to hold around 140 seats on supervisory boards around the country. During his great days Abs was probably as popular as it is possible for any banker to be. Towards the end of his life, he did not, however, hold either politicians or the great majority of his compatriots in great regard. He believed the exaggerated demand for social welfare in West Germany's comfortable, consensus society was a severe hindrance to economic dynamism. As West Germany approached the challenge of unification, Abs, in crisply-delivered interviews at the end of the 1980s, liked to berate the West Germans' 'inflexibility' and voice doubt about their capacity for hard work. 'They want to work less and have more free time' was one of his complaints. In his latter years, as the world hummed around him, Abs plainly did not enjoy having an inordinate amount of time on his hands. If he was faintly disdainful of modern Germans, and sometimes appeared slightly too pleased with himself, there was (to adapt a saying of Churchill) some excuse. He had a considerable amount to be pleased about.</p>

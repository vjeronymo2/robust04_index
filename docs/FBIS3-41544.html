The sources said all 106 cities and counties of the province  have met their afforestation tasks two years ahead of the  official completion date.    In the past eight years since the launch of a ten-year  afforestation program, the province has set up thousands of  fruit, bamboo and tea plantations, plus large areas of timber  forests.    In 1987, Guangdong had accumulated more timber reserves than  it had to consume.    Successful afforestation work has also brought a boom in  industrial development in many fields. The official said the  province's annual income from fruit and other forest products  exceeds 400 million U.S. dollars.</p>

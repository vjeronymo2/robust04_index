			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENWALD SAYS HE'S SURE UAL BUYOUT CAN FLY  </P> <P> The newly named leader of the proposed union buyout of UAL Corp. said Thursday  he agreed to give up his post as Chrysler Corp.'s No. 2 executive only because  his analysis persuaded him that the takeover of United Airlines' parent could  succeed.  </P> <P> In a press conference here, former Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald said  he had conducted "my own sort of due diligence" analysis of the proposed  $4.38-billion deal, including phone calls and visits to principals in the  proposed leveraged buyout.  </P> <P> Now, "I'm absolutely convinced that the financing can be done and will be  done," said Greenwald, 54, who had been been widely expected to succeed  Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca when Iacocca retires. He said late Wednesday  that he would leave Chrysler to lead the effort to buy UAL.  </P> <P> Many outsiders believe that the choice of Greenwald, an experienced  administrator and financier, will help the buyout effort, and United's stock  jumped $4.625 to $155.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday. However,  that remains significantly below the unions' offer of $201 a share.  </P> <P> And even the most enthusiastic analysts believe that formidable obstacles  remain to the financing of the deal, which the UAL board has said must be  completed by Aug. 9.  </P> <P> Greenwald was flanked at the press conference by officials of the machinists',  airline pilots' and flight attendants' unions, which chose him for the post  after considering a list of executives.  </P> <P> Greenwald ducked all questions about the compensation contract he has signed.  </P> <P> Of UAL's present management team, he said, only Chairman Stephen M. Wolf will  have to go, Greenwald said. It is understood that if the buyout succeeds,  Greenwald would become chairman of the UAL board and chief executive.  </P> <P> He acknowledged that his own lack of airline experience is a negative factor  but said he brought a number of strengths to the job. Greenwald said he has  long experience with organized labor and was involved in a huge and difficult  financing during the early 1980s in the Chrysler bailout negotiations.  </P> <P> He was first approached by the unions only 10 days ago and said he had hardly  begun work on the next and critical phase of the effort -- lining up bank  lenders to finance the buyout. He is expected to soon begin showing major U.S.  banks UAL's cash-flow and growth projections. If he wins the support of the  domestic banks, he is expected to seek financing from Japanese and European  lenders as well.  </P> <P> Greenwald, who has recently earned $1.1 million a year at Chrysler, insisted  that he had not taken the UAL buyout job for the compensation or because he  feared that Chrysler's prospects were poor or that he would not succeed  Iacocca.  </P> <P> He said Iacocca had told him about a year ago that the top job would "be mine  unless I really screwed up. . . . He said, 'It's yours to lose.' "  </P> <P> The executive said he took the UAL buyout job only after he was assured that  the union's ownership of the airline would not interfere with management's goal  of making it profitable. The unions "will be investors but not managers,"  Greenwald said. UAL "will be run like any other company . . . for profits and  cash flow," he added.  </P> <P> Greenwald has gotten mixed reviews from union leaders during his tenure at  Chrysler, but the three union officials at Thursday's news conference said  their members were delighted to hear the news that an executive of such stature  had joined the effort.  </P></p>

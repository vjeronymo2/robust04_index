			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 5 January Zhan Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP], came to 134 Rakovski Street [headquarters  of the Union of Democratic Forces, SDS], where he met Filip  Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS National Coordinating Council.  The meeting took place at the insistence of the BSP. After the  meeting the two leaders made statements on the more important  aspects of their meeting. First the host, Filip Dimitrov:    [Begin Dimitrov recording] The first topic we discussed was  the issue of the parliamentary order and the risks involved in  violating this order if the parliament will be paralyzed until  new elections take place. This could be a period of time during  which Bulgaria would have a caretaker cabinet. It is well-known  that the SDS submitted a proposal on amending the Constitution  in this aspect.    We also discussed the issue of the Supreme Judicial Council.  The position of the SDS on this matter is very clear. We think  that the BSP position on this matter is anticonstitutional, and  I explained this to Mr. Videnov.    The third issue he invoked was related to the differences of  the two major political forces in anything related to the matter  of municipal by-elections. The possibility of eliminating the  differences was discussed. We think that not allowing parties  that are not represented in the parliament, to participate in  those elections is an illegal act. However, we will think in  the future about the specific form of resolving this problem.    Generally, I would say that the visit was an indication of  the problems that are discussed or that exist in the BSP, and I  think that the SDS could not be expected to get involved in  those problems. [end recording]    BSP leader Zhan Videnov said that he is satisfied with the  meeting because the conversation clarified the positions of the  two most important political forces in Bulgarian public life,  and this according to him means regulating political life,  imbuing it with a predictable and normal character. This is  what Zhan Videnov said:    [Begin Videnov recording] We discussed the necessity of  guaranteeing the functioning of the parliament and the  developments of the political life of the country, regardless of  the shortcomings of the constitutional and legal arrangements.  We also discussed the necessity of eliminating the existing  normative and judicial obstacles that prevent the main political  forces from fully participating in municipal by-elections.    We made our proposals in this sphere and clarified our  positions. Relevant information was exchanged between the main  political organs of the two parties. We do not plan new  meetings, but perhaps specific future parliamentary and  political actions will emerge as a result of our meeting today.  [end recording]</p>

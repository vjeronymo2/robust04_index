			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (5): Prize contributions to science HUNGARIANS draw on an illustrious tradition in computers. A Hungarian-American, John von Neumann, virtually invented the computer with his work on binary arithmetic. Per head, Hungarians have won more Nobel prizes for scientific discovery than any other nation. Even now, Hungarian schoolchildren regularly score better in comparative tests than their western European counterparts. Hungary's inhabitants may only number 10m but they like to think of their country as a 'maths superpower'. It appeared until the start of the 1990s as if computer ventures would lead Hungary's trek to capitalism. Companies such as Novotrade, Kontrax, Controll and Microsystem grew explosively to dominate the top ranks of the Hungarian private sector. But Hungarian technical genius alone has proved insufficient. Private computer companies have fallen, or wobbled at least, like ninepins. Novotrade has had to shrink to survive. Kontrax has restructured its operations and rescheduled its debts to stave off dissolution. Controll was less lucky: the company is in liquidation. And Peter Vadasz, chairman of Microsystem, has left the company he founded under a cloud of losses and liquidity problems. Hungary's infant market has offered many opportunities for quick profit. But the companies that have given in to temptation have risked becoming jacks of all trades and masters of none. The Kontrax group, at its most diffuse, owned businesses in computer distribution, office equipment distribution, telecommunications development, property, newspapers and finance. So Graphisoft's success is an exception rather than the rule in Hungary's computer sector. And even Graphisoft made an unprofitable detour into sales of Apple computers before selling its distribution subsidiary last month to refocus on software development.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has  reiterated that the nuclear capability will never be rolled back  and no stone will be left unturned to make the country's defense  impregnable. The prime minister was addressing a meeting of the  formation commanders at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi  today. The prime minister said indigenous production will get  due priority and we shall either induct additional F-16's or  make alternate arrangements. The concerned agencies are  exploring the market for induction of new tanks and we also  intend to induct new submarines.    About foreign policy, the prime minister said what happened  at Geneva proves beyond doubt the hollowness of the human rights  crisis raised by the West. It also leaves no ambiguity that in  the prevalent global climate strategic alliances are reshaped  for better economic gains. She said we have to face this  challenge and make our foreign policy more vibrant.    Spelling out the main achievements in respect of foreign  policy, the prime minister said the Kashmir dispute has been  revived as a live international issue in the United Nations and  other international forums. This has been evidenced by  statements of President Clinton and the UN secretary general.  The International Committee of the Red Cross and foreign  diplomats visiting the held valley had confirmed perpetration of  continuing human rights violations in the wake of claimed  transparency. Pakistan she said, is taking necessary steps to  bring desired stability in the Afghanistan situation. The key  to solution of the problems lies with the Afghan people. Ms.  Benazir Bhutto said her government is endeavoring for the  promotion of a new perception of Pakistan as an enlightened  democratic Islamic and just state.    She made special reference to the revival of relations with  the United States with particular reference to the depiction of  Kashmir as a disputed territory by the United States and  expression of concern about violation of human rights there and  efforts by the Clinton Administration to maintain relations with  Pakistan despite the Pressler Amendment.    About the promotion of relations with the Central Asian  Republics, the Middle East and the neighboring countries, the  prime minister said a solid breakthrough has been achieved.    Elaborating the economic achievements, she said foreign  exchange reserves have improved from a precarious level of $300  million to $1.9 billion showing an unprecedented six-time  increase. The prime minister said the government will miss no  opportunity to seek rapprochement with the opposition to obtain  a consensus on basic national issues like nuclear, Kashmir,  long-term development projects like Kalabagh Dam and  constitutional reforms. The prime minister expressed the hope  that a sense of realization will soon prevail and the government  will get the desired cooperation from the opposition in the best  interest of the country.

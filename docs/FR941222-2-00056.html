These would include hormones with fewer side effects than those associated with the currently available estrogens, ethynylestradiol and its 3-methyl ether (mestranol), notably nausea, vomiting, alterations in liver function, and histopathology and clotting disorders. Some clinicians have suggested that the presence of the 17-ethynyl moiety, which protects the steroid from rapid metabolism by the liver (so-called ``first-pass'' effect) and thus confers oral activity, is also responsible for many of the side effects observed with these drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In an effort to develop nonethynylated estrogens, NICHD has synthesized several estradiol nitrate esters which exhibit potent estrogenic activity in rats and rhesus monkeys following both oral, subcutaneous, and percutaneous administration. Using an increase in the uterine weight of immature rats (rat uterotropic test) as an endpoint, two of these esters were more than five times as potent as ethynylestradiol following oral administration. They also induce estrogen withdrawal bleeding in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys following both oral and percutaneous administration. They are very potent postcoital agents following oral administration to rats on days 0&hyph;4 of gestation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The superiority of these esters to ethynylestradiol or its methyl ether as the estrogenic component of oral contraceptive tablets will depend upon clinical and histopathological findings from toxicity studies in animals and/or clinical observations in Phase I and II human studies. The estradiol nitrate esters also have considerable potential clinical utility as replacement estrogens in menopausal women. The most widely used therapeutic regimens involve oral administration of ethynylestradiol, estradiol or conjugated estrogens (principally estrone sulfate) either continuously or cyclically, with or without addition of a progestin, much of which depends on the presence or absence of the uterus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compounds of this series have been studied for estrogenic potency following oral, subcutaneous and topical administration and pharmacokinetic data are available on several analogs utilizing radioimmunoassays developed by the Government. Relative binding affinities to the rat and rabbit uterine estrogen receptor are currently being studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: DANCE / EILEEN SONDAK;  </P> <P> LEWITZKY, DOYENNE OF DANCE, GIVEN ROLE IN ARTS FESTIVAL  </P> <P> UC San Diego's annual Undergraduate Arts Festival features prominent figures in  literature and the arts. But it has yet to name someone from the world of dance  to the prestigious post of Regents Lecturer -- at least not until this year.  </P> <P> "The committee decided to dedicate the festival to Danah Fayman (founder of the  San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts and patron saint of dance in San  Diego) for her contributions to the community and the university," said  Patricia Rincon of the festival committee. "That sparked our interest in  getting a dance artist."  </P> <P> Without hesitation, they selected Los Angeles-based Bella Lewitzky, the most  respected dancemaker in the country without a New York address. A trailblazer  in modern dance for five decades, Lewitzky has earned a litany of honors for  choreographic achievement. Her residency on campus, today through Saturday,  will include intensive workshop sessions and a free public lecture Wednesday at  8 p.m. at Peterson Hall.  </P> <P> "Bella is a wonderful spokesperson to bring here," said Rincon. "She has the  knowledge in choreography and dance to share with other university artists. She  has done a lot of experimental work in the field, and she has the ability to  explain things very well, which is quite rare. She's also an excellent  instructor, and she'll spend a lot of time lecturing and teaching classes  here."  </P> <P> Lewitzky is ecstatic about "penetrating the citadel of the university," she  said by phone from Phoenix. "You don't get a lot of interchange among  departments in other residencies, and I think the opportunity to be a scholar  in residence -- where I can address my favorite subject without (departmental)  barriers -- is wonderful. I've never done it before, and I don't know of any  other program like this anywhere.  </P> <P> "My mission is to help dance receive recognition for its value as a serious  subject. People still think of it as entertainment or athleticism. They don't  accept it as a form of communication, like a novel or a symphony. There's a  limit to how much you can do in a short period of time, but this is a lever,  and without question it should help local dance."  </P> <P> Lewitzky's lecture on Wednesday, titled "Why the Arts?" is free, and as Rincon  noted, "we're really trying to open these events to the public."  </P> <P> Typically, dance companies are reflections of their directors, in more ways  than one. If you take a close look at all the local troupes, just about every  one is anchored to the choreography as well as the artistic vision of its head  honcho. The one glaring exception is Stage Seven Dance Theater, led by Kathryn  Irey.  </P> <P> Irey not only maintains the lowest public profile of any company captain, but  she also exerts the least stylistic influence on her dancers. In fact, not one  work in the company's repertory bears her choreographic stamp.  </P> <P> "I tend to stay in the background," she acknowledged in a recent break from  teaching company class. "Many times, egos get in the way of art, and some day  my ego may loom large as well. But for now, I'm just happy to leave a lingering  image in the audience's mind and to foster the development of my dancers. I  have no desire to choreograph for them."  </P> <P> Irey credits an eclectic dance background for her focus and notes, "It's very  stimulating to work with different choreographers. It's my job to create an  atmosphere where people are comfortable enough to create. And it's my  experience that offering audiences variety can fill houses."  </P> <P> So far, the formula has worked well enough for Irey and her company of 12. They  have survived on little more than a shoestring budget for years. And they  manage to attract respectable houses, despite a penchant for scheduling their  infrequent appearances in direct competition with other dance groups.  </P> <P> Good Timing: It's just a coincidence, but the Lewitzky residency at UC San  Diego dovetails with the Dance Program's annual faculty concert. The  performance takes place at Mandeville Auditorium at 8 p.m. on June 3. Lewitzky  won't be contributing any dance designs, but as Rincon noted, "She'll be very  much involved with the dancers, so she should have a lot of influence on the  concert."  </P> <P> Although Jean Isaacs was listed among the contributing choreographers to the  San Diego Area Dance Alliance's Performing Arts Lab on May 21, her work never  made it to the stage.  </P> <P> "I wanted to show a new piece so I could get some feedback on it before we take  it to Europe," said Isaacs. "But after the New York trip and everything else, I  was too wiped out to get it ready in time. I guess we'll just have to wait  until we get back and do it at one of our own low-techs."  </P> <P> Isaacs and a few of her Three's Company dancers will depart on June 9 for three  weeks of performances and workshops throughout Switzerland.  </P> <P>  Ken Herman is on vacation. His regular Spotlight column will resume upon his  return.  </P> <P> </P></p>

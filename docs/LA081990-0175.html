			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: MINIMALIST AT MID-LIFE;  </P> <P> NATURAL SELECTION BY FREDERICK BARTHELME (VIKING: $18.95; 208 PP.)  </P> <P> Our minimalist fiction writers, chroniclers of the young urban and suburban  middle classes, use deflection to write of their fears and passions. Often  ingeniously -- some of our best writers are minimalists -- they suggest the  emotions by muting them: heat by coolness; outcry by silence. It is the silence  of Sherlock Holmes' celebrated dog that does not bark.  </P> <P> What would a minimalist dog sound like if it did bark? Frederick Barthelme,  whose collection of short stories, "Moon Deluxe," was a nearly perfect  minimalist work, has made a fascinating and often moving attempt to find out.  </P> <P> "Natural Selection" is rich in the oblique ironies and the broken-field talking  and thinking that we have come to expect of Barthelme, Ann Beattie, Mary  Robison, the late Raymond Carver and so many others, but there is a rupture  right down the middle. The skin of control is broken. Awkwardly -- Barthelme  himself can be awkward attempting it -- his characters are turned to stare  their anguish in the face instead of in smoked and angled mirrors.  </P> <P> A dozen years ago, Peter and Lily were singles. They lived outside Houston in  rented poolside apartments with shag rugs and flimsy plasterboard ceilings.  They drove to malls and fern bars and went at 11 p.m. for waffles or beer. Now  they are married, have good jobs, an 11-year-old son, Charles -- as knowing and  rueful-witty as his parents -- and a suburban house.  </P> <P> It is a tract house, with barbecue, garden shed and wood deck. But as Peter,  the narrator, tells us: "The yard has worn patches you recognize. . . . And the  deck looks as old as you are, you don't mind sitting on it."  </P> <P> It is, right at the start, one of those seeded sentences that hint at the  transition the book is set in, and the transformations that lie ahead.  Minimalist couple glimpse middle-age, and beyond that, growing old and dying.  </P> <P> There are no minimalist deaths; they are all the same size. The recognition and  acceptance of time passing requires a wrenching alteration of the language we  use for our lives. "Natural Selection" is about Peter's painful struggle to  learn that alteration.  </P> <P> The book takes place in Peter's early mid-life crisis, with excursions into the  past when life and love were easily taken on, and disposed of. Peter is  restless, bored, rebellious. Lily and Charles are too precious to be disposed  of; realizing this, he realizes he cannot dispose of himself; he feels  imprisoned and desperate.  </P> <P> The desperation sways in a balance of acute detail and comedy that sometimes  recalls Updike in his suburban period, and sometimes, when Peter's comic  soliloquy goes wild, Peter De Vries. The narrator jokes blackly with Lily and  Charles and they gamely joke back, but something serious is going on.  </P> <P> The husband and father keeps up a litany of gallows-humor rant about the state  of the world and the foolishnesses and conformities of American living. When a  man does that, at some point his wife and child will get a different message:  Are you angry at us? Fed up? Leaving?  </P> <P> Peter, in fact, is on the borderline of a breakdown, signaled when his  intellectual rough-and-tumble with Charles edges past joking into a moment or  two of real cruelty. He is not a cruel man; he is a decent man riding on the  edge of trouble.  </P> <P> He moves tentatively out of the house, returning every day. To have taken that  bit of action clarifies things for him; he is freer to own attachment to his  life and to his family. He moves back, not quite as tentatively as he moved  out; he may be OK. And then life, perhaps fed up with being learned so tardily  and for such low, easy tuition, takes a tragic swipe at him.  </P> <P> It is tempting to spell out the tragedy. It would allow me to give an idea of  the distance Barthelme is covering in his own evolution. I will only say that  the last 20 pages of this brief but spacious book contain a tautly building  horror, followed by a cry of despair and regret as powerful as it is  astonishing.  </P> <P> I have stressed theme and form at the expense of detail; if Barthelme is  breaking his own new ground with the first two, he is on beautifully cultivated  home ground with the last.  </P> <P> Peter's and Lily's first date, in flashback, is a comical minimalist tour de  force. Each pokes a tentative turtle head out of a protective shell; each says  zingy things and apologizes for them. He suggests a movie: "I probably can't be  boring in a movie." She hates people who say they're boring, she tells him, and  soon she is floundering too. "I do this. I need a verbal skill. Just one.  Jesus."  </P> <P> Somehow they get to his apartment; she has cleverly arranged for each to take a  car so it will work out. Somehow they not only have sex but, without quite  admitting it, they make love. The moment of truth comes in the morning when she  has carefully arranged breakfast and is self-conscious about it.  </P> <P> "It was delicious," he says. Turtle head retracts: Has he sounded patronizing?  "I mean, I meant it was delicious but I didn't mean the other part -- you know  what I'm talking about?" "The repellent part?" she asks. He knows they must  grow old together.  </P> <P> That is no ending, of course, but a beginning; and it is the battle to grow old  that Peter is fighting with himself 10 years later. Barthelme's comedy of  detail rarely wavers, but it goes deep until, without apparent transition, we  are touched.  </P> <P> He manages to suggest, subtly but without deflections, the pain that Peter's  life-crisis is causing. His portrait of the 10-year-old Charles gamely trying  to play along with his father's moods while keeping his own independence are  funny and moving. Even more remarkable is what he does with Lily.  </P> <P> Wonderfully well-voiced, she is fighting not altogether consciously to bring  Peter into life. She will try anything: irony, sympathy, argument. She will  even become him; at one point, she takes up his angry commentary on the state  of the world and out-despairs him.  </P> <P> She will even dream for him; it is one of the best fictional dreams in a long  time. It is a gathering of philosophers who argue by changing their pants. One  dons a green pair; another studies it, reflects, and counters by putting on  plaid. It is a rejoinder to Peter's despairing vision of entropy. Lily's  vision: "The possibility of good fortune."  </P> <P> Not quite everything works. The last 20 pages are breathtaking, but it is not  quite the same breath we have been breathing up to then. Thematically, the  shift is justified, but fictionally, though not unprepared, it makes the gears  complain.  </P> <P> The main difficulty occurs, now and then, with Peter. His reflections about the  state of the world and his own state represent, of course, the minimalist's  breakthrough. He is confronting, not evading. But these soliloquies are  exceedingly rounded and complete. They can suggest Layman's Sunday in church.  The sermon, worked on so hard, is more brilliant than the minister's own  average effort, but it fights the occasion a little.  </P> <P> Barthelme's battle with his own literary occasion has these roughnesses. No  battle is ever tidy. Some, such as this one, are supremely worthwhile.  </P></p>

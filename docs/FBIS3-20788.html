"We do not know that such gold exists at all in our main  branch for Serbia, but we will seek an answer and will inform  you about it," was the response.    Answering the question whether, with the adoption of the new  law on the National Bank of Yugoslavia and the transformation of  republic national banks into its branches, the former banks of  Serbia and Montenegro had merged all their foreign exchange  reserves with those of the country, Gazivoda answered tersely:  "They have not, in spite of our demands. We will persist with  them."    Otherwise, the value of the 251 kilograms of gold that  Dafina  Milanovic deposited at the beginning of 1993 as security for  credit at the National Bank of Serbia -- which still existed at  that time -- and on the basis of which she received a 450  billion dinar short-term credit, calculated at the average price  of gold at the London stock market, is a little less than 5  million German marks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] DIPLOMATS OF GERMANY...    Germany does not share the opinion stating that the new  composition of the Russian Government means "an end to reform  policy," press secretary of the German Embassy to Moscow Enno  Barker declared in his interview with INTERFAX Friday.    "We do not think that reforms in Russia are in danger due to  the fact that their supporters have left the government," he  said.    According to the diplomat, Germany "counts on the tandem  Yeltsin- Chernomyrdin which embodies the Russian reformatory  course." "It is up to them to decide on which key figures in the  government to rely upon. It would be a short-sighted approach  to think that the process of reformation of the Russian  political and economic system would stop after Gaydar's  resignation," he said.    Barker expressed the opinion that "the Russian political  elite still maintains its principal consent regarding  continuation of the reforms, which means that they will not be  overthrown."    He was remindful that Germany maintains the closest economic  ties with Russia compared with all other western countries, and  that is why it is greatly concerned over the situation in the  Russian economy. The diplomat expressed hope that both  countries would continue their cooperation.    He also pointed out that despite different messages, Germany  "is convinced that Russia has not concluded the real process of  the new Russian government's formation."  <H5>  OF JAPAN... </H5>   The reshuffle in the Russian Government should not affect  Japanese-Russian relations, said a senior official at the  Japanese Embassy in Moscow, who asked not to be identified.    He told INTERFAX on Friday that Japan wished to "expand" its  relations with Russia "in a balanced way" on the basis of  agreements reached during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Tokyo. "This means that a solution to the territorial problem in  Japanese-Russian relations (the Kuril Islands issue) should be  based on historical facts and the principles of law and  justice," he said.    The official said that, with Yegor Gaidar's resignation and  the reorganization of the government, "extremely close  attention should be paid to the conduct and composition of the  secretariat of the Russian president." "The importance of that  body is growing extremely fast under the present circumstances.  One has the impression that the secretariat of the Russian  president is beginning to fulfill the functions of departments  in the former Central Committee of the Communist Party, that is  it stands above the government," the official said.  <H5>  AND GREAT BRITAIN. </H5>   Britain will support Russian President Boris Yeltsin as long  as he remains loyal to his policy of reform, said a senior  official at the British Embassy in Moscow.    In an interview with INTERFAX, the official, who asked not  to  be named, said it was an alarming fact that the reformists have  left the government.    "The reforms may slow down and inflation may increase," he  said.    But the changes in the government might have positive  effects, too, the diplomat said. "The Russian Government has up  until now been heterogeneous. Maybe now that it consists of  people having the same views, its policy will be more  effective," he said.</p>

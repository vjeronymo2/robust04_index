			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese rare earth producers form cartel China has allowed rare earth exporters to end a price war by forming a cartel and fixing prices, according to the Xinhua news agency, reports Reuter from Beijing. Producers and exporters set up the cartel at a recent meeting and 'agreed to adopt uniform prices for exports" starting in 1994, the official news agency said. China is the largest producer of rare earth, which contains a group of 15 chemically-similar elements used in items such as x-ray screens and colour television tubes, and in alloys to store hydrogen in fuel cells. They also have potential uses in super-conducting materials. Its main export markets are in the US, Japan and Europe. The announcement appeared to conflict with the Communist Party's formal decision this month to make competition in free markets the cornerstone of economic development. The Xinhua agency said China's rare earth producers could not handle the rigours of market pricing and had descended into an increasingly bitter price war over the last few years. 'Producers and exporters have drastically lowered prices to win foreign orders in the past few years, making the trade barely profitable,' it said.</p>

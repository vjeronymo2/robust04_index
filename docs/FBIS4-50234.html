			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] Two former senior government officials were named  yesterday to offer their expertise on government affairs to  China's working panel overseeing Hong Kong's 1997 transfer.  Arthur Garcia, the first ombudsman in Hong Kong, and Wilfred  Wong Ying-wai, former deputy secretary for civil service, are  among a group of 13 appointed by the National People's Congress  Standing Committee to join the 57-member Preliminary Working  Committee (PWC).    The new members include eight from Hong Kong and five from  the mainland. The total membership of the PWC has been boosted  to 70, minus Liu Yiu-chu, who had earlier quit. Officials  earlier promised to increase the membership of the PWC amid  fierce criticism over its lack of credibility and dearth of  dissenting views. The new batch of the think-tank, however,  remains dominated by mainland officials and pro-China figures.    The five mainland members come from the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, the local headquarters of Xinhua (the New China  News Agency) and the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG),  which falls under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Ministry.  Mainland officials admitted that the expertise of senior  government officials was desperately needed in their work. "We  always hope that more former government officials will take  part. But there are practical difficulties for some," one said.    The appointment of Wilfred Wong, who has helped arrange  private dialogue between serving colleagues in the bureaucracy  and local officials from Xinhua, is significant. Mr Wong said  last night that his previous service in the Government would  help him to give constructive advice to the Chinese Government.  Mr Garcia, a retired High Court judge who was later named as  the Commissioner for Administrative Complaints, will offer legal  advice to the working panel, which has suffered from the  shortage of legal experts.    Although the Hong Kong Government does not allow any civil  servants to brief PWC members, an Executive Councillor said they  would not object to Chinese JLG members briefing the panel or  even letting them read the documents as long as they could be  kept confidential.    Another local legal expert appointed to the panel is Ambrose  Lau Hon-chuen, who is also convenor of the preparatory committee  for the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, a political party to be  launched by the end of next month. Mr Lau said he would  definitely join the PWC's legal sub-group to help in  scrutinising existing Hong Kong laws and to bring them in line  with the Basic Law.    Two academics -- Ng Ching-fai, dean of the science faculty  at  Baptist College, and Woo Chia-wei, a vice-chancellor of the Hong  Kong University of Science and Technology -- were also  appointed. Also included were two businessmen; Paul Cheng  Ming-fun, an executive committee member of the influential  Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, and Philip  Wong Yu-hong, who represents the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in  the Legislative Council and is also a member of the New Hong  Kong Alliance.    The publisher of the pro-China Hong Kong Commercial Daily,  Lee Cho-jat, was also named to sit on the panel.    Topping the list of the five mainland members are two  high-flyers in the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office Zhang Liangdong and Xu Ze -- who were recently promoted  to head the office's Hong Kong administration department and  economic department respectively. Mr Zhang and Mr Xu have been  serving in the secretariat of the PWC since its inception last  July.    Two more local Xinhua officials were also appointed:  Ulanmulun, a vice-director focusing on economic affairs in Hong  Kong; and Weng Xinqiao, director of the department of education.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION'S GHOST TOWN  </P> <P> Two decades ago the major television stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and  San Diego maintained full-time news bureaus in Sacramento to cover California  government. Today not a single TV station outside Sacramento itself has a  resident correspondent assigned to monitor the governmental affairs of the  nation's largest state. San Francisco's KRON-TV closed the last out-of-town  bureau late last year.  </P> <P> In past, simpler times a newspaper might be tempted to gloat that a  considerable segment of its media competition had decided to leave a broad area  of coverage primarily to print journalism. But that cannot be the case today.  The need for an informed public is too important, and many of California's 28  million residents rely on television as their primary source of news. Too much  is at stake. Television provides a dimension and an impact that print  journalism cannot. As Harry Snider of Consumers Union told The Times' Dennis  McDougal, public officials from the governor on down "know that they can ride  out a print story or a radio sound bite . . . . But none of them want to be  caught giving away the farm on the 6 o'clock news in Los Angeles or San  Francisco."  </P> <P> TV has an impact not just in times of big stories or scandal. In the past, such  big network-owned stations as KNBC-TV, KABC-TV and KCBS-TV assigned excellent  correspondents like Warren Olney, Bob Simmons and Howard Gingold to Sacramento.  Their presence and expertise on a variety of state issues represented a source  of competition within the Sacramento press corps that now is lacking. Everyone  suffers.  </P> <P> KNBC News Director Tom Capra said that cost and the demands of local news  coverage brought about his station's closure of its Sacramento bureau six years  ago. He said that KNBC gets all the Sacramento news that it needs from wire  services and free-lancers while dispatching its own reporters from Los Angeles  on big-story days. But that is no substitute for having a savvy correspondent  on the scene who is able to follow the evolution of complicated stories on a  day-to-day basis.  </P> <P> Economics cannot be ignored, but the television stations also bear a public  responsibility in exchange for their licenses to use the air waves. The  networks still manage to maintain bureaus of more than 100 people each in  Washington, but their local offspring decline to spend enough to keep a single  correspondent in Sacramento. That's the way it is. And that's too bad.  </P></p>

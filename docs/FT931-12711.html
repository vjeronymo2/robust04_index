			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Yeltsin redefines relations with India: An old debt that is stunting a mutually beneficial relationship RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin arrives in India tonight for a three-day visit that will define Russia's future relationship with India. At the top of his agenda will be the resolution of a long-standing dispute over India's Rs380bn (Pounds 8.5bn) debt to the former Soviet Union. Neither country has been able to arrive at an acceptable settlement after the rouble's rapid collapse from its previously fixed rate. However, Russia needs the money, and would like to retain its biggest customer for military equipment, and India wants to ensure an uninterrupted supply of arms, including the sensitive high-technology weapons it cannot secure from the west. Mr Yeltsin, who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation, assured India on Monday that Russia would respect a 1991 contract for the sale of three cryogenic rocket engines, despite concerns expressed by the US. 'If some agreement is signed we should follow it, we cannot stop it,' Mr Yeltsin said. For more than 40 years India has been dependent on the former Soviet Union for its defence equipment. It was one of the largest beneficiaries of the former Kremlin policy of supplying arms to developing countries with little means of paying for them. The country also enjoyed a special trade arrangement with Moscow which allowed military equipment to be procured on soft credit and against payment in rupees - which are not convertible currency. 'In the changed scenario, India and Russia have a chance to forge a new, more equal relationship,' a senior Indian diplomat said. 'It seems absurd that an old debt can be allowed to stand in the way.' Realising the potential for trade in India, Russia has shown interest in a joint venture co-producing spares for MiG-21 fighter aircraft. These would be marketed to countries flying 6,800 of the Russian-made aircraft. At least 10 bilateral agreements - including a new treaty of friendship and co-operation to update the existing one signed 20 years ago - are to be signed during the forthcoming summit. However, the planned exclusion of clauses on military aid, in the event of an armed attack on either country, has drawn criticism from Indian Foreign Ministry officials. 'These are the clauses that made the 1971 pact meaningful,' one diplomat said. 'A friendship treaty makes no sense with India and Russia no longer sharing the same geopolitical and strategic perceptions.' In addition, a hefty defence package including proposals for the co-production of military hardware, the joint development of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) and the updating of MiG-21Ms, is due to be agreed. A Dollars 400m (Pounds 263.1m) Indo-Russian arms deal was also signed after Defence Minister Sharad Pawar's visit to Moscow last September. Reports yesterday suggested that Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, Russian first deputy prime minister, and Mr Manmohan Singh, Indian finance minister, might have worked out a deal on the debt issue. Indian Commerce Ministry officials said it was for Mr Yeltsin and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to announce the details of the compromise, but the Russian news agency Tass reported that the maximum concession Moscow could make on India's dues was up to 28 per cent of an amount pegged by Russian officials at Dollars 15bn. India agreed last week to pay 45 per cent of its debt pegged at Rs380bn, amounting to about Rs180bn. Mr Shumeiko, who ranks number two in the Russian cabinet and is co-chairman of the joint Indo-Russian commission on trade and economic co-operation, returned to Moscow yesterday after preparing the ground for Mr Yeltsin's visit. The abundance of skilled manpower, management expertise and cost effective technology in India, together with Russia's vast industrial base, offered huge potential for the two countries to set up joint ventures, he said.</p>

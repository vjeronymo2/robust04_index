			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Double trouble, toil and struggle: Ukraine's nuclear weapons and its collapsing economy are worrying for the west In the latest of a series of attempts to convince Russia and the west of its good faith, Ukraine announced on Monday that 17 of the 46 SS-24 strategic nuclear missiles on its territory had been deactivated, by moving the warheads away from the launchers. The move may go some way towards allaying anxieties in the west about the prospect of a Russo-Ukrainian conflict, heightened by the electoral success of Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who wants to restore Russian rule throughout the former Soviet Union. One Ukrainian parliamentarian has argued that Ukraine should try to secure operational control of the nuclear missiles on its territory, 'to confront the threat to its security posed by Zhirinovsky's new-found strength'. Russia has conducted a vigorous diplomatic campaign on the nuclear issue, claiming that the weapons based in Ukraine are not being properly serviced or maintained, and that there is a grave risk of an accident if they are not handed over soon. 'Ukraine is deceiving us all . . . and we are so helpless that we cannot deal with this evil,' President Boris Yeltsin was quoted as telling US Vice-President Al Gore last week. Western policymakers have grown increasingly worried about Ukraine's apparent reluctance to implement the Lisbon protocol, signed last year, under which it pledged to transfer the remaining nuclear weapons on its territory to Russia, and to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned recently that Ukraine would get little or no US aid until it dismantled the weapons, while Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister and current president of the EU Council, said it was 'unthinkable' for Ukraine to join Nato's planned Partnership for Peace so long as it had not fulfilled its disarmament commitments. But while some Ukrainian deputies have talked loosely of the weapons' value as a deterrent against Russian aggression, defence experts realise that any Ukrainian nuclear force would be vulnerable to a Russian pre-emptive strike. Nor do they believe it would be easy for Ukraine to gain operational command and control from Russia. 'The specialists who maintain and service the weapons are Ukrainian,' says Serhiy Pirozhkov, director of Ukraine's National Institute of Strategic Studies, 'but the black or red suitcase - whichever it is - remains in Moscow.' Anton Bouteiko, foreign policy adviser to President Leonid Kravchuk, insists that full compliance with the Lisbon protocol depends on three conditions: technical and financial help with dismantling the missiles; compensation for their value; and guarantees that Ukraine's security would not be jeopardised by its non-nuclear status. The west has been trying to meet Ukraine's concerns on all three points. Several well-placed western observers in Kiev are convinced that the importance of the nuclear issue has been exaggerated, and that the true danger to Ukraine's independence lies in its own government's mismanagement of the economy. Industrial output fell by 20 per cent in 1992, and probably as much again in 1993. Inflation is running at about 70 per cent a month - or, as economy minister Roman Shpek prefers to put it: 'The total price index this year is 37.8 times higher than last.' The long-promised national currency, the hryvnia, has yet to be introduced; meanwhile Ukrainian workers are paid in coupons which last week were trading at more than 30,000 to the US dollar - or, even more tellingly, at 27 to the Russian rouble, with which it started at par two years ago. Despite monthly increases in wages and pensions, incomes cannot keep pace with prices, and few Ukrainians can afford more than the barest necessities unless they have access to hard currency. Most families survive on fruit and vegetables from their dachas (country cottages), having gone out after work every evening last summer to pick the beetles off their potatoes by hand; and many, even in large towns, keep a goat for milk and cheese. Thus a sophisticated industrial economy, which once manufactured many of the components and guidance systems for the very missiles now in dispute, has all but reverted to subsistence farming under the impact of hyperinflation, aggravated by energy shortages. Ukraine imports virtually all its energy from Russia, which has gradually raised the price of its oil and gas exports to world market levels. Ukraine has failed either to prepare for or adjust to the change. Its oil refineries, which used to re-export refined products to Russia, are closing down for lack of input, while gasoline is smuggled across the frontier in trucks. Ukraine no longer has surplus electricity, and has therefore had drastically to cut its exports to central Europe, potentially a precious source of foreign exchange. Conservation measures are haphazard and panicky - many Kiev apartments were virtually unheated during November's severe cold spell, and universities have been told to extend their Christmas holiday until early February. President Kravchuk recently called in foreign ambassadors and tried to convince them that his latest 'economic reform', involving cuts in industrial and energy subsidies and credit creation, with faster privatisation, is more serious than its seven predecessors. All previous attempts have been sabotaged by increases in wages and pensions to compensate for price rises, and by credits to help companies stave off bankruptcy and unemployment. 'We have a law on bankruptcy, but unfortunately we don't have a single bankrupt,' says Mr Shpek. Ironically, many Ukrainians voted for independence in 1991 not out of any firm sense of national identity - though 11m of the 52m inhabitants define themselves as Russian - but in the belief that they would be economically better off. Mr Kravchuk's avoidance of painful economic measures which might shatter this fragile consensus has resulted in a situation in which, by every economic indicator, Ukraine is now worse off than Russia. Not surprisingly, a lobby of politicians and industrialists has emerged in the mainly Russian-speaking east of the country, advocating closer economic ties with Russia, with which Ukraine still does 90 per cent of its trade. At the same time, groups in various regions have started calling for greater local autonomy. Politically most sensitive is the Crimea, which was only made part of Ukraine in 1956, and which many Russians regard as rightfully part of Russia. So far Ukraine has been remarkably free of the ethnic violence which has plagued other ex-Soviet republics. But while some Ukrainian nationalists proclaim their willingness to 'eat grass' for the sake of independence, it seems unlikely that many Russians are ready for that degree of self-sacrifice. If the economy continues to deteriorate, different ethnic groups will see their interests as divergent; and if violence does break out, a local Russian leader, in Crimea or elsewhere, will sooner or later call on Russia for help. After the 1917 revolution, Ukraine, like the states of Transcaucasia, had a brief fling of independence followed by reabsorption into the Russian empire under the new guise of a Soviet republic. This time round a similar pattern has been set, notably in Georgia and Azerbaijan: local conflicts have been exploited by locally based Russian forces to reimpose de facto Russian control while maintaining formal independence. Should the same happen in Ukraine - a country that includes Europe's geographical centre, and shares borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania - it would, in the words of Markian Bilynskyj, the British-born research director at a Ukrainian think-tank, be the result of 'a succession of bad policy choices which look inevitable to the analyst after the fact; a case of self-destruction or suicide, with Russia only too eager to play the role of Dr Kevorkian (the US practitioner of euthanasia)'. Ukrainian nationalists advocate greater economic independence from Russia and closer ties with western Europe. Yet few grasp that only much bolder reforms would make that orientation realistic.</p>

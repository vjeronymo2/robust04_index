			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)-- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher has announced that the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho are making progress  and that the two sides are closer to reaching an agreement.    The secretary of state said: I want to affirm our wish to  complete this stage so that we can embark on implementing the  agreement and then administer daily affairs in Gaza and Jericho  for the first time. This can be compared with what is happening  in South Africa.    These remarks came during a joint news conference  Christopher  and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat held following their  meeting with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today.    Christopher stated that those who wanted to hamper and ruin  the peace march had no better alternatives. During my meeting  with Chairman 'Arafat, I found common ground for moving ahead,  he said.    Noting the talks' progress, Christopher said that this was  manifested with the arrival of the first group of vehicles  donated by his country to the Palestinian police force. He  pointed out that this is only part of what the donor states have  promised to offer.    I congratulate Chairman 'Arafat and the negotiating  Palestinian delegation on what they have achieved on the basic  points. This demonstrates their determination to get over the  tragic incidents and shows the need to implement the agreement,  Christopher said.    He added: We want to emphasize again the need to move ahead.  The reports I have received from the concerned parties over the  past six months have encouraged me.    Christopher reiterated the U.S. determination to encourage  the parties to proceed to the next stage. We want to be here  and to do what we can to get closer to the implementation stage,  he said.    Speaking at the news conference, 'Arafat expressed the hope  of reaching an agreement within the framework of the  comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis on the  various tracks. We hope we will overcome the obstacles that  still hinder a Palestinian-Israeli agreement, 'Arafat said.    'Arafat expressed his appreciation of the role President  Mubarak and Egypt played to support the peace process. He also  thanked U.S. President Bill Clinton for assisting in the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles and aiding the  Palestinian police.    At the end of the joint news conference, 'Arafat affirmed  that the Palestinians will be fully prepared to sign an  agreement on implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement once the  obstacles hindering it are eliminated. He added that it is the  other side that is responsible for placing these obstacles.</p>

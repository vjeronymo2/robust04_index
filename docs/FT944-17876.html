			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Bacteria 'present in up to 60% of chickens' Only two in five raw chickens are free of bacteria which cause food poisoning, according to a survey published today by the Consumers' Association. Salmonella was found in 36 per cent of 160 raw chicken samples tested in the UK, while 41 per cent contained the bacteria campylobacter, the association said in a report in Which? magazine. Campylobacter can cause diarrhoea, vomiting, pain and fever, and in rare cases can result in death. Britain had one of the worst scores for poultry cleanliness in a survey of 14 European countries by consumer organisations, the association said. Only Denmark and Portugal scored worse for salmonella, while the UK was fifth-worst for campylobacter. Norway had the cleanest chicken, with none of its samples carrying salmonella and only 1 per cent infected with campylobacter. The association said this showed that better results could be achieved and called on the British government to clean up chicken production. Problems included contaminated feed, poor hygiene and cramped housing, it said. Ms Charlotte Gann, senior editor of Which? magazine, said: 'There is absolutely no way a shopper can tell if chicken is contaminated, so all chicken must be treated as suspect. This clearly isn't good enough.' The association said some magazines were still publishing recipes using raw eggs with no warning of the dangers of salmonella. It said that one or two eggs in every 1,000 were likely to be contaminated.  ---------------------------------------------------------                   BATERIA IN CHICKEN  --------------------------------------------------------- Percentage of chicken samples found to contrain bacteria  --------------------------------------------------------- SALMONELLA                       CAMPYLOBACTER  --------------------------------------------------------- Denmark             51           Portugal            60 Portugal            48           France              53 UK                  36           Slovenia            47 Germany             26           Netherlands         45 France              25           UK                  41 Italy               24           Denmark             36 Netherlands         23           Ireland             29 Belgium             16           Spain               26 Ireland             13           Germany             22 Slovenia            11           Italy               13 Spain                8           Sweden              10 Greece               4           Belgium              4 Norway               0           Norway               1 Sweden               0           Greece               0  --------------------------------------------------------- Source: Which magazine  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

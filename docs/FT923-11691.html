			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Baker praises Israeli settlement reductions ISRAEL has indicated to the US that it will make a 'severe and substantial reduction in settlement activity' in the occupied territories, Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, said yesterday. Speaking after a meeting with Mr Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president, Mr Baker gave an upbeat assessment of steps taken by the new Israeli government towards Arab demands for a settlement freeze pending a resumption of peace talks. 'I am really very satisfied with the philosophy and the orientation of this new government of Israel towards the question of settlements and I am satisfied that you are going to see severe and substantial reduction in settlement activity,' Mr Baker told reporters. Mr Baker's remarks were his most positive yet about efforts by the new Israeli administration to rein in settlement activity, and indicate that Israel has virtually assured itself of receiving US loan guarantees to help it absorb a flood of Soviet Jewish immigrants. The Bush administration had withheld some Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in guarantees because of the refusal of the previous government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir to halt settlements. The secretary of state was also clearly using his Cairo press conference to signal to Arab states and the Palestinians that Washington expected reciprocal goodwill gestures once peace talks resume, possibly as soon as next month. 'The results and the momentum are only going to be produced by the parties themselves sitting down at the table. But I am very optimistic that we have an opportunity to see that happens,' Mr Baker said. Israel and its Arab neighbours, including Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian-Palestinian team, have conducted five rounds of desultory negotiations since the latest US-sponsored peace effort was launched in Madrid last October. Mr Mubarak, while calling for more concrete steps by Israel to persuade the Arabs that it was sincere about halting settlement activity, also praised efforts by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the new Israeli premier. 'Do you expect the man to do miracles in one week?' he asked. 'We should not be in a hurry. One week is not enough . . . please give him time.' Mr Rabin visited Cairo yesterday for the first summit between Israel and Egypt for six years in an effort to warm relations and advance peace efforts. Egypt is the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel. Mr Baker flew to northern Syria late yesterday for a meeting with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. Mr Assad is the key to US and Egyptian efforts to introduce a spirit of compromise to the negotiations. Syria, which fears that attention will focus on the Palestinian issue at the expense of its own demands for the early return of the Golan Heights captured in the 1967 war, has warned its fellow Arabs to treat warily Israeli peace overtures. The Syrians have summoned Arab foreign ministers to Damascus this weekend to try to ensure solidarity before the resumption of peace talks.</p>

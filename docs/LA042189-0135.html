			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEWS OF TODAY'S AFI FILM FEST  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'The Absent'  </P> <P> Argentina, 1988, 85 minutes  </P> <P> 6:20 p.m.  </P> <P> Argentine director Rafael Filippelli's look at the days before his country's  1976 coup d'etat operates on a classic movie "clock" -- that is, the shift in  power that will lead (we're told at the beginning of the film) to the  "disappearance" of its union leader protagonist. This film's doomed agitators  of the left seem oddly passionless outside of their politics (a last-minute  love affair is more like a last meal for the condemned), which might be part of  Filippelli's point but is a sticking point for involvement in his characters'  inevitable fate.

At a tele-conference today, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua urged  the  strengthening and improvement of control over pricing in order  to curb excessive price rises.    Zou said that to create an environment favorable for  implementing various reform policies, it is necessary to keep an  overall economic balance and a reasonable economic structure.    Redoubled efforts should be made to increase market supply,  especially production and supply for residents' daily  necessities, he said.    He stressed that any price reform program to be put into  effect must be approved and arranged by the State Council and no  arbitrary price rise should be allowed.    He said that the pace of establishing a sound price control  system should be quickened and the supervision and  administration over the prices of daily necessities and services  should be strengthened.    He called for efforts to guide residents' consumption and  ease the fear of inflation.    Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning  Commission, said at the conference that the check will cover all  enterprises, and individual households engaging in industry and  commerce as well as government institutions and the illegal and  arbitrary charges since the latter half of 1993.    Serious violations will be traced back to the latter half of  1992, Chen said.    The check will be conducted mainly on the prices of daily  necessities as well as service charges, the minister said.    The check will be started later this month.</p>

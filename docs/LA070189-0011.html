			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF I.F. STONE, 'CONSCIENCE OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM'  </P> <P> There is poignancy in Conrad's carton of June 21, showing I.F. Stone drinking  "To truth . . . " with Socrates. That is, until one recalls Stone's book "The  Trial of Socrates," where he has meticulously documented that philosopher's  propensity to befuddle his opponents by deliberate distortions in the service  of his pro-totalitarian, anti-democratic, and even anti-free speech convictions  (so anxious was Stone to avoid error by relying upon possibly incorrect  translations that, in his 70s, he took the trouble to learn Greek, a stupendous  task).  </P> <P> I suspect the journalist is more amused than angry, but Conrad should brace  himself for some embarrassment when he meets Stone (but not Socrates) in the  Elysian Fields. The cartoon is also inaccurate in depicting Socrates as much  taller, slimmer and handsomer (and, by insinuation, nobler) than Stone: he was  short, fat and snub-nosed, well below Golden Age standards.  </P> <P> A.

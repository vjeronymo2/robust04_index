			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Germans sign China contracts worth DM3bn GERMAN industrialists accompanying Chancellor Helmut Kohl on a visit to China yesterday signed some 20 contracts and letters of intent worth approximately DM3bn (Pounds 1.1bn), David Waller reports from Frankfurt. The contracts, signed in Beijing in the presence of Mr Kohl and Mr Li Peng, Chinese premier (pictured above), are the fruits of intensive efforts by German industry and government to cultivate China as the growth market of the future for exports of capital goods. Among the deals signed yesterday was China's purchase of six A340 airbuses worth DM1.2bn. In addition, a consortium consisting of Siemens and AEG signed a DM628m letter of intent to build a new 18km stretch of underground railway in Guangzhou in the southern province of Canton, which is due to start running at the end of 1998. German companies will also build three power stations and German shipyards will supply eight ships, contracts worth DM450m and DM500m respectively. Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, will be building telecommunications satellites. Deutsche Waggonbau, a state-owned company in the east of Germany, signed a contract to supply DM165m of railway wagons for the Chinese railway system. Other contracts were for the building of a fork-lift truck factory, and potash and machine-tool deliveries. Mr Kohl is accompanied on his week-long tour of China by 40 of Germany's most senior industrialists, including Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive of Daimler-Benz, Mr Heinrich von Pierer of Siemens and Mr Ferdinand Piech of Volkswagen, an indication of the importance that Germany places on China's market.</p>

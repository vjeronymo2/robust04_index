			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pakistan restarts state disposals - Success could spark sales of the top utilities The Pakistan government's current offer to sell up to 15 state-owned factories, part of a plan to sell up to 31 factories in the coming months, is the first serious effort to put life back into the country's privatisation programme, which came to a virtual halt early last year. The government delayed the programme amid fears that investors would be put off by the deadlock in government which ended only with fresh national elections last October. The businesses being offered now include four cement factories and another eight factories which manufacture ghee, a blend of oils for cooking. If they are sold, only 20 of the 118 factories selected for privatisation more than three years ago would be left waiting to go on the block. The 67 sold so far have realised almost Rs9bn (Dollars 308m). Although some of Pakistan's foreign donors have urged Islamabad to opt for a broad-based ownership through public flotations on the stock market, the current batch of 31 factories are all designed to be sold in open auction to either local or foreign investors. Senior privatisation officials say that more than half of these factories have been running at a loss, making it difficult for any public offer to attract large numbers of investors. But if the government succeeds in selling them, many officials responsible for running the privatisation programme hope that the sale of some of the country's largest and most lucrative utilities will get under way. These utilities include Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation (PTC) which could be worth up to Dollars 9bn, and the thermal power generation units of the largest power company, Water and Power Generation Authority, which could be worth up to Dollars 5bn. The government also wants to privatise Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation, Pakistan's second largest power generation company, serving the city of Karachi. Another two large gas companies, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines and Southern are also being prepared for sale. However, many critics say that the privatisation programme, which is now in its fourth year, has lost momentum through bureaucratic resistance to change. There have also been objections from some of Pakistan's four provincial governments, which say they should receive a share of the money raised by privatisations. Yet more objections have come from the armed forces, who have objected to the sale of the PTC on the grounds that transfer of the telephone company's ownership into private hands would jeopardise the country's security interests. Those objections were resolved recently when the government agreed to spend part of the money raised from the phone company to set up a new phone network for the exclusive use of the armed services. The government also wants to remove fears of nationalists who are worried over the implications of transfer of ownership to foreign investors. 'We have come to a point in the world where it has become one big global market and the old nationalistic concerns cannot become a hindrance any more in development of economies', says Mr Naveed Qamar, chairman of the National Privatisation Committee. Other officials say that safeguards under consideration include the appointment of new consumer protection authorities, which would monitor issues such as tariffs to prevent any immediate price rises. Other proposals include those of requiring new owners to appoint only Pakistani nationals as chief executive officers in the case of selective utilities such as the PTC, even if the ownership is transferred into foreign hands. Despite such preparations, some businessmen are worried over the pace of the programme. Some officials agree privately that the largest utilities could take between three to five years for detailed assessment of their real worth, and finalising terms of the sale, before they are offered. 'If the programme is slow . . . it would be quite easy for investors to look elsewhere. After all, there are other countries which are giving good incentives too,' warns leading Karachi businessman. chi.</p>

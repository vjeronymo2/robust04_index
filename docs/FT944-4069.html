			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (8): Improvement is patchy and slow - Industrial Properties / Most regions report steady increases in both sales and lettings and also 'general confidence'. But industrial rents are still falling Reflecting the economy in general, the industrial property market has shown signs of increased activity this year. However, again as with the economy, improvement is patchy and slow. Reports from most regions indicate steady increases in both sales and lettings and also 'general confidence'. But industrial rents are still falling. Figures from surveyor Richard Ellis show a monthly decline of 0.4 per cent for October. And capital values have again been knocked back as a result of the softening investment yields which have affected all property sectors. In the south-east, where heavy industry has been declining for the past 15 years, this year has seen greater activity among light industrial companies. A key feature has been the mopping up of the considerable amount of second-hand space. Now, in some locations - for example Guildford and several towns round the M25 - most of this space has been taken up, leaving only limited choice. Richard Storey of surveyor Richard Ellis notes that second-hand space has let well for several reasons. Firstly, occupiers have been able to negotiate better deals with hard-pressed landlords. In addition, while confidence remains fragile, industrialists tentatively expanding have been able to secure shorter, flexible leases, minimising longer-term commitments. Even where confidence is stronger, companies have often preferred to take cheaper, second-hand space for 'image' reasons. Surveyor Healey &amp; Baker confirms the trend to shorter leases. In an analysis of industrial transactions completed by the firm over the past three months it found that 43 per cent had been struck on the basis of 10-year terms and 35 per cent on five-year terms. This compares with 11 per cent each for the more conventional 'institutional' 15- and 25-year leases. As a caveat, however, Healey &amp; Baker says that landlords are still likely to resist shorter leases for tenants with poor covenants. Institutional investors began 1994 in a welter of enthusiasm for industrial property in view of its comparatively attractive yields compared with those of gilts - yields on high coupon 15-year gilts had fallen to close to 6.5 per cent - bonds and office and retail property. In a hurry to increase their holdings, and with few good standing investments on the market, some decided to create their own through development. Several projects were undertaken in selected locations on a speculative basis by parties including Axa Equity &amp; Law, AMP Asset management, Hill Samuel and BZW. Now, however, with long-term gilts closer to 9 per cent following the increase in interest rates, industrial property looks less appealing. Most of the institutions have lost their appetite for speculative funding and gone away. But not all of them. James Thornton of surveyor Jones Lang Wootton cites a recent transaction in West Bromwich where a pension fund client is putting up the cash for a speculative 152,000 sq ft industrial project by a local developer. Terms reflect a yield of 8.25 per cent on a rent of Pounds 4 a sq ft with rental cover for three years. Almost in isolation, one segment of the industrial market flourished throughout the recession - high bay warehouses: buildings which defined roughly have a minimum floor area of 100,000 sq ft, eaves height of 30 ft-plus and site cover of 45 per cent or less. The growth of the development of this type of building is a result of the revolution in distribution led by, but not confined to, the food retailing sector. The use of bar-coding and its allied computer-driven stock control has meant that retailers have been able to switch from supply-led to demand-led distribution systems - meaning larger warehouses, less storage and more selling space at retail outlets. These new methods have enabled retailers to cut costs dramatically. Guy Frampton of surveyor Hillier Parker estimates that food retailers have halved their distribution costs to 6 per cent of turnover over the past five years by operating from these specialist buildings. Location is another important side to the distribution equation. Development began in the 'Midlands Triangle' - the area within 30 minutes' lorry drive of the M1-M6 junction. The most high-profile pioneer was the Gaseley-Church Commissioners Magna Park in Lutterworth. Now Warrington and Wakefield are also popular with, according to Hillier Parker, some 11 per cent of the high bay warehouse stock (by floor space). Investment yields at Magna Park in April were as low as 5.75 per cent. They have now eased back and the latest transaction at the park is going through at around 6.5 per cent. Clear support for predictions that we shall see rising rents and a new burst of industrial development in 1995 comes with evidence of rising land prices. From a peak of Pounds 1m an acre at the height of the boom, prices in the prime area west of London fell to a low of Pounds 400,000 an acre. Now, according to Richard Ellis's Storey, deals have been done at Pounds 600,000  -and there are others in the pipeline in excess of that figure. Healey &amp; Baker's John Organ puts Heathrow prices even higher at Pounds 750,000 an acre. And, looking at the regions, Organ's current figures for industrial land in Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds are Pounds 350,000, Pounds 200,000, Pounds 170,000, Pounds 70,000 and Pounds 175,000 an acre respectively - all above the bottom-of-the-market prices in 1992. Owner-occupiers are coming back into the market, adds Organ, particularly where developers are prepared to sell land and not look for extra profit from design-and-build work. It could soon also become feasible to develop inner city traditional industrial areas again. London's Park Royal, for instance, has been given Assisted Area status and with improvements to the North Circular Road Park Royal could feature on developers' and funds' shopping lists again - 'sooner rather than later' says Storey. Organ, however, reckons that the government should do more. Most occupiers operating on the UK's traditional estates, he argues, are small businesses which depend on supplying and servicing the few larger occupiers and the wider local business community. When these larger occupiers move out to more efficient premises on 'green-field' sites with better environments and infrastructure, many of the remaining small business find it difficult to survive. Not only are jobs lost but there is the likelihood that the former larger factory site will be sold to a retail park developer. In order to regenerate our inner city industrial areas, Organ suggests, the government should offer 100 per cent building allowances. Such an incentive would encourage developers, funds and present occupiers to redevelop to modern acceptable standards. Inner city economies and communities still need local industry, maintains Organ.</p>

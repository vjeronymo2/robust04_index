			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Stena joins curb on live animals Stena Sealink became the last big ferry company to impose a ban on the transport of live animals on its cross-channel routes yesterday. The ban, which comes into effect today, applies to animals which are exported for fattening and subsequent slaughter in continental abattoirs. Sealink's decision followed earlier moves by P&amp;O and Brittany Ferries to stop carrying live animals destined for slaughter after a high-profile campaign orchestrated by animal welfare groups such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The Ministry of Agriculture is trying to work out an acceptable code of practice with the ferry companies, livestock exporters and welfare groups. Stena said that until a code of practice is adopted its ban will remain in place. But Mr Roger Gale, the Conservative MP and chairman of the Commons all-party animal-welfare group, called yesterday for a end to the transport of live animals throughout the European Union and from its member states. Mr Gale said: 'It is abundantly plain that mainland European authorities are quite simply not interested in enforcing transport regulations.' Welfare groups are pushing for an improvement in conditions for animals in transit, including a reduction in the 24-hour time limit during which they can travel without food or water. However, EU governments have found difficulty in agreeing changes to existing regulations. Sealink carries about 10 per cent of the live animals exported, compared with 60 per cent for P&amp;O and 10 per cent for Brittany Ferries.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / 'Ring of steel' relies on plastic bollards: Jimmy Burns finds few obstacles as he ventures into the cordoned-off City IN THE BOOT of my car I carried a personal computer and a document bag, the kind of luggage that when packed with Semtex explosive can shatter buildings. The police advice yesterday was to leave the car at home as London's so-called ring of steel came into force. But out of necessity this City worker had to take the risk. In Belfast, a driver stopped at a checkpoint is automatically required to produce some form of identification. An armed policeman or soldier conducts the inquiry, while a back-up team of armed security personnel look on. There, it is normal practice for the police or military to examine the passenger seat and the boot, if the vehicle has been stopped in or near an area identified as at high risk of terrorist attack. London's version of street security proved slightly different. Starting off from Wandsworth in south London at 8.30am, I took a route across the Thames at Westminster and along the embankment into the Square Mile through one of the permitted entry points in Cannon Street. At the junction of Change Street and Cannon Street at 8.50am two policemen stood by one of several entry points, a line of plastic bollards, waving traffic on. Parked in one of the nearby sidestreets, closed now to through traffic, a police squad car looked on discreetly. The traffic flowed smoothlyon until it reached London Bridge. Again no armed guards, just a couple of policemen flanked by photographers and cameramen and a small group of protesters from an anti-militarist movement. A very unmilitary looking City bobby somewhat self-consciously checked a large van transporting stationery. His colleague questioned the driver of a smaller van which was found to be empty. The checks caused the kind of brief traffic snarl-up the City experiences on any working day and which in Belfast has long been a fact of life. Across the bridge thousands of commuters were marching unchallenged to work, carrying briefcases and bags. The policemen had their eyes focused exclusively on the vehicles. It was now 9.10am. I had allowed the extra 30 minutes recommended by the police and motoring organisations to get to work in time. With no real congestion to speak of, I had arrived thirty minutes early, and with enough time to put the effectiveness of the ring of steel further to the test. The warning from the police was that nobody should attempt to drive around or through the temporary barriers. Any irregular driving could set off a security alert. I drove back across London Bridge, past the same police squad car, and the same police checkpoints. I drove up to a road barrier (unmanned), tried to get round it, then backed away. I turned off Cannon Street, negotiating the back streets which lie behind the Lloyd's building. Here there were no policemen to be seen and someone had parked unchallenged. Just by Leadenhall Street, I stopped my own car, surveying the local buildings, taking notes again. Nobody seemed remotely interested. I was within a few city blocks of the site of the last big IRA bomb. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Cathay will operate flights from Heathrow CATHAY PACIFIC will on May 1 become the second international airline to offer its first services from London's Heathrow airport. The move follows the government's decision to open Heathrow, the world's busiest international passenger airport, to all carriers. The start of Cathay's daily non-stop service between Heathrow and Hong Kong will increase competition for British Airways at its home base of Heathrow. Mr John Dance, Cathay's UK manager, said it was important for the airline to operate from Heathrow as well as Gatwick to match BA's services. Heathrow would give Cathay access to about 50 per cent of the UK market. BA is already in competition with United Airlines for transatlantic services. United started flights to Heathrow this month after winning approval to take over Pan Am's London services. A total of 10 international airlines, barred up to now from operating from Heathrow, have successfully applied for rights to start services at London's leading airport. Royal Brunei will launch a twice-weekly service on May 7 from Heathrow to Bandar Seri Begawan stopping at Dubai and Singapore. Virgin Atlantic, Korean Airlines and All Nippon Airways are among airlines planning new Heathrow services this summer. These services are expected to lead to a fierce war on fares and promotions between airlines vying for passengers in a depressed air-travel market. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, warned that the airline's passenger volume was not expected to recover to levels reached before the Gulf war until September or October. BA's traffic fell 13.2 per cent in March compared with March 1990. Mr Dance said Cathay intended to match all the promotions and lower fares offered by BA, but added: 'I hope when we get to the peak season, there will be a bit more sense seen by carriers.'</p>

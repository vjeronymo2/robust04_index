			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that NATO  member countries, through the communique issued at the end of  the Brussels summit, have not only confirmed their cooperation  on the issues of democracy and human rights but on the struggle  against terror as well. She added that this outcome was  achieved through the competent defense of a just cause.    Ciller concluded her visit to Brussels and has returned to  Ankara. Prior to her return, Ciller visited a Turkish quarter  in Brussels. [passage omitted]    At Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Ciller was received by various  ministers, deputies, and many citizens. Speaking at a news  conference at the airport, Ciller gave information on the issues  taken up at the summit and on her contacts. She noted that the  stand to be adopted and strategy pursued by NATO regarding the  restructuring of Europe were discussed in Brussels. Pointing  out that within this framework the concept of a partnership for  peace was adopted, Ciller said: A strategy that extends its  defense wing to countries that were once Warsaw Pact members but  that currently want to be part of Europe has been adopted.  Ciller continued:    [Begin recording] Now a door has been opened to former  Warsaw Pact members. This door is the NATO membership door.  One should not, however, interpret this as though the former  Warsaw Pact members have been accepted into NATO. According to  this concept this door has been opened to all of Eastern Europe  and the eastern bloc, including Russia, without disrupting the  principle of equality but at the same time taking into  consideration the differences among these countries and their  respective peace plans. This process has also been extended  over a certain period. [end recording]    Ciller stated that an agreement has been reached on the  defense of the countries within the eastern bloc and on their  joining the alliance within a certain period of time. She added  that in time a program and a plan will emerge on the issue.  Ciller stated that while this was agreed upon, a strategy that  will prevent placing Russia against NATO was also put forward.  She said:    [Begin recording] We have, once again, found the opportunity  to defend the view that, given the changing world conditions  both from east to west and north to south, Turkey is no longer  only a flank country but also a central one. Within this  framework, I am glad to state that significant steps have been  taken in the struggle to get NATO to adopt Western values as  well as the values of other worlds. [end recording]    Ciller stressed that member countries confirming at the  summit that they will cooperate on the struggle against terror  is a significant step for Turkey.    She said the following on the issue:    [Begin recording] We can now say that this organization, a  member of which we have been for the last 42 years, has decided  to back up the struggle against terror in the world. This has  been achieved through the competent defense of a just cause.  This was not all we managed to achieve. A series of agreements  and views concerning Azerbaijan and the unjust developments in  that country were included in the communique.    A struggle was also waged for the just cause of our Muslim  brethren in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A step further than the  original text of the communique was attained. The opening of  Tuzla, the rescue of Sarajevo, and the promise that efforts will  be exerted to distribute humanitarian aid were also included in  the communique. [end recording]    She noted that despite all this world public opinion did not  use the explicit expressions Turkey desired, adding that the  political determination on the issue should be further  consolidated. Stressing that Turkey views this as another stage  in the human rights struggle, Ciller referred to the need for  more cooperation with world countries in a bid to achieve more  concrete work on the issue. She said that at the summit she  observed that Europe is waging a struggle for self-identity,  adding that a plan that introduces the flexibility of acting  outside NATO, without being independent from the alliance, has  been adopted. She noted that from now on the Western European  Union will have the opportunity to benefit from NATO forces with  the approval of the alliance. Pointing out that the other  friendly countries agreed that Turkey's status within NATO  should be raised, Ciller described this as an auspicious  development.    Ciller said that during her contacts the issue of the  European Union was also discussed. She added that the member  countries agreed that joint new steps should be taken with the  EU and that a financial protocol should be realized within the  framework of the Customs Union. Pointing out that the execution  phase will begin in the next few months, Ciller recalled that  Turkey will be part of the Customs Union in 1995. Stressing  that Turkey is a key country in the region, Ciller concluded as  follows:    [Begin recording] The developments in Europe and the world  and the disintegration of the Soviet Union have not decreased  Turkey's importance. On the contrary the developments on the  east-west and north-south axes have made Turkey a key country.  We share the same problems. As a country that has made an  equal contribution to the solution of these shared problems --  and not as a country that follows suit -- I hope that this  summit will contribute to peace in Turkey and the world. [end  recording]    Ciller later, cheered by the public, left Esenboga Airport  for the city.</p>

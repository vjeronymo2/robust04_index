			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: SMH sees modest improvement SMH, the leading watchmaking group, is looking for only modest profit growth again this year, but has renewed confidence in the long-term prospects of its core business. Questions have been raised in recent months about the once fast-growing group, known best for its Swatch plastic watches, following the stagnation of sales last year and mixed reports about its diversification attempts into telephones and a Swatch car. Its bearer shares have lost a third of their value since last July. Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman, said the modest 7 per cent growth in net income to SFr441m (Dollars 315m) last year after two years of double digit rises was due mainly to a decision not to raise Swatch prices in countries whose currencies fell against the Swiss franc. The strength of the franc was a problem as the group did not want Swatch to lose its low price identity, he said. He dismissed suggestions that demand for Swatches was reaching saturation point. US sales had been disappointing last year, but were improving. In Germany, first-quarter unit sales were up 8.5 per cent. Mr Hayek insisted that wrist watches would remain the group's core business, and Swatch, with a third generation of models on the way, would play a vital role in the volume sector. The slow developing diversification into telephones was taking a new direction into cordless sets. Mr Hayek said the group might acquire the telephone set division of a leading telecoms manufacturer. The joint venture with Daimler-Benz to develop an environmentally friendly Swatch city car would not require any more than 30 per cent of SMH's cash flow in the the next three or four years. The car would reach break-even point three years after sales began, at the latest.</p>

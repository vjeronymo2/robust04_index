			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Builders cautious despite 14% surge in orders last year Construction orders won by contractors last year rose for the first time since 1990, the Department of the Environment said yesterday. The value of orders in 1993 increased by almost 14 per cent compared with the previous year to Pounds 19.93bn, the department's figures show. It was also the highest total value of contracts since 1990, when the industry won work worth Pounds 22.49bn. The performance was welcomed by Mr Tony Baldry, the construction minister. He said: 'The fall in output has halted, with the overall volume of work still about one-sixth higher than it was in the mid-1980s.' Order books peaked in 1989 when the industry won contracts worth Pounds 27.14bn, more than a third higher than last year's improved total. Contractors remained concerned, however, about the low prices at which contracts are being awarded, leaving little or no margin for profit. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, warned last month that too many companies were charging suicidal prices. Recent rises in building material prices mean that contracts won on wafer-thin margins could become lossmaking. There is also concern that reductions in public spending, announced in the November Budget, could slow future increases in orders. Housebuilders are worried that tax increases scheduled to take effect in April could damage prospects for further recovery in the housing market. The latest figures indicate that there was no slackening in the pace of recovery in the final three months of last year. The department said total orders, after allowing for seasonal variations and at constant 1985 prices, were 12 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 34 per cent up on the the fourth quarter of 1992. Investment in construction slumped badly at the end of 1992 after Britain's decision to quit the European exchange rate mechanism. Private housing orders in the final three months of last year were 12 per cent higher than the previous three months and 45 per cent higher than the corresponding period in 1992. Infrastructure orders were 72 per cent and 43 per cent higher respectively. Private industrial orders were 8 per cent and 33 per cent higher while private commercial orders, although 6 per cent lower than the previous three months, were 28 per cent higher than the corresponding period in 1992. Mr Baldry said: 'In the medium term at least, the (economic) climate has rarely looked better and construction will benefit from that.'</p>

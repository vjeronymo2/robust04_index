			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / ITV in row over football timings The ITV companies plan to seek an injunction against the Football League over the timing of the broadcast of Coca Cola Cup semi-finals this month, Raymond Snoddy writes. The row has arisen because of rules adopted by Uefa, the Union of European Football Associations, which try to ban live televised games between noon and 4pm at weekends in order to protect attendances. Because of opposition by the Scottish Football Association, the Football League has been insisting that either the semi-finals are not shown in Scotland or the kick-off is delayed until 4pm. Broadcasters have decided not to challenge the Football League on this Sunday's semi-final between Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday when the kick-off will be delayed to 4pm.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Europe hails gear dispute victory EUROPEAN gear manufacturers were celebrating victory yesterday in a two-year trade battle with the US that ended this week when the Commerce Department decided that gear imports do not threaten national security. Eurotrans, the umbrella organisation for nine large European industrial countries, said the decision had averted the introduction of crippling import levies. It had prevented the loss to Britain alone of around Pounds 100m of gear exports a year. Mr Michael Opperman, Eurotrans president and chairman of Birmingham-based Cross &amp; Morse, said: 'The success of these negotiations was critical to the European gear industry. Exports to the US are essential to our industry, particularly at present because of the recession in our home markets.' Gears, toothed parts which transmits an engine's power to its work, are integral to both the construction and performance of nearly all weapon systems and the Gulf war focused attention on the US defence industry's increasing reliance on foreign-made parts. Last October the American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) filed a '232 petition' claiming imports were causing a decline in the US gear industry and impairing the US ability to go to war. Eurotrans maintains the US spends too little on research and development and manufacturing technology, and does not operate to international standards. Mr Joe Franklin, AGMA's executive director, said yesterday he was not pleased by the result, but stressed that the association had never intended the petition to produce broad-based tariffs or quotas across the gear industry.</p>

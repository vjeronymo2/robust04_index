			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin, Jan 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea have agreed on the basic  principle of a one-time restricted inspection, and the IAEA is  expecting an official answer on the sites Pyongyang will open  for inspection next week, IAEA Spokesman David Kyd said Friday.    One-time restricted inspection is neither a regular  inspection nor a full-fledged inspection, Kyd told YONHAP by  telephone. The IAEA totally understands the situation and so it  is not demanding a full scope safeguard inspection.    Both sides agree that the purpose of their working-level  talks is to try to agree on a one-time inspection to see if  there have been any abnormal changes in the status of North  Korea's nuclear facilities, but there is a problem on the scope  of the inspection, Kyd said.    The IAEA insists that it should inspect all the facilities,  and North Korea disagrees.    Remarks by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman  berating  the IAEA were just an attempt to shift the blame in case the  contacts fail to reach an agreement, Kyd said.    He said he believed that North Korea would give an official  answer at a diplomatic level next week, and he is waiting for  the answer.    Making announcements to the outside world and trying to  reach  agreement through patient discussions are totally different  activities, he said, adding that he did not think North Korea  would break off contact with the IAEA.    North Korea may want to say that the IAEA is trying to  resume  regular inspections, which had been carried out until last  year's suspension of nuclear inspection, but that is not true,  he said.    The IAEA has an understanding that the resumption of regular  inspections should be discussed more.    There is no change in the IAEA's position that it will not  send an inspection team until it has a clear agreement with  Pyongyang on the scope of the inspection, he added.    Also reached by telephone, Yi Si-yong, the South Korean  ambassador to Vienna, said that there was no change in the  IAEA's position that North Korea should open all seven declared  nuclear sites for inspection according to nuclear safeguards  regulations.    Securing continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea and  carrying out a full-fledged inspection are required by  resolutions of the IAEA Board of Directors and general meeting,  and the IAEA Secretariat is not in a position to make  concessions freely, Yi said.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Wellcome book-building meets with good demand: FT writers report on the varied progress of newly launched issues in an uncertain market INITIAL indications about the progress of the Wellcome share sale suggest good demand is being found, particularly from UK institutions. The global book-building process began on Monday and runs until July 24. Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, aims to sell around 330m shares in the drugs company, headed by Mr John Robb, reducing its stake from 73.5 per cent to 38 per cent. So far bidders have indicated an interest in buying more than 40 per cent of the shares on offer at prices of around a 5 per cent discount to the market price. Wellcome shares were down 6p to 894p yesterday, although they had risen last week and earlier this week. One manager involved said it was early days yet, with the US roadshows only starting this week, for instance. But he said: 'There is a good feeling about this, there is a solid base of demand for the shares. It feels totally different to the GPA Group sale.' The flotation of GPA was abandoned last month when insufficient demand for the shares was found. The US portion of the Wellcome sale - about 80m of the total 330m shares on offer - is considered problematic. Among several factors that could dampen investor interest is the sheer size of the investment being sought from the US - more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) worth of Wellcome shares. At present it is estimated that only 2 per cent or 3 per cent of outstanding Wellcome shares is in US hands. If the full number of shares on offer were sold in the US, this would increase to about 12 per cent or 13 per cent. Wellcome is seeking a big leap in the number of shares held in the US in one go. In addition, Wellcome is relatively unknown in the US investment community, in spite of roughly half of its earnings coming from the US, including income from the AZT drug for Aids treatment. Mr Sam Isaly, a drugs industry analyst at Mehta and Isaly in New York, said another problem facing the Wellcome offer is that US drug stocks have seriously underperformed Wall Street this year. The drug stock index compiled by Mehta and Isaly was down by 17.5 per cent in the first six months of this year, compared with a decline of less than 1 per cent in the Standard &amp; Poor's market-wide index. 'The US is probably the swing market to make the whole offer a success or failure.  It is a tough sell,' Mr Isaly said. Wellcome is seeking to meet this US challenge with an intensive road show and with the help of leading Wall Street firms in its underwriting syndicate, which is led by Morgan Stanley and includes Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, Wertheim Schroder and Alex Brown. In all some 1,000 investors will listen to the Wellcome pitch, at meetings between now and July 16 in cities such as Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City and Orlando.</p>

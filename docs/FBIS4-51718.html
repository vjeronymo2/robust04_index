			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ta Phraya, Sa Kaeo -- More than 25 stray  artillery shells landed on Thai soil yesterday during heavy  fighting in Cambodia between government forces and Khmer Rouge  guerrillas.    The latest round of fighting is centred about two kilometres  from the Thai border opposite Ta Phraya District.    A few shells fired by 122 mm artillery pieces landed near  border checkpoint No 26 at Ban Non Mak Mun in Ta Phraya District  but caused no casualties.    The checkpoint is manned by about 150 rangers of the 12th  Ranger Regiment and Ta Phraya Task Force.    At 10 a.m. about 200 Khmer Rouge soldiers of the 519th  Division under Mit Sau launched an attack on Ban Yaeng Dangkum,  a government position, which was protected by about 300  government soldiers under Gen Lai Veera.    The stronghold was overrun by Khmer Rouge shortly  afterwards.    Thai military sources said 12 Cambodian government soldiers  were killed and many others wounded.    The Khmer Rouge soldiers set fire to the weapons and supply  dumps at Ban Yeang Dangkum. Billowing columns of thick black  smoke were clearly seen from the Thai border at checkpoint No 26.    The sound of gunfire could also be clearly heard around the  position, indicating heavy fighting in the area.    Cambodian government gunners at Ban Nimit artillery base at  kilometre 12 on Route 5 opened fire in support of their ground  troops at about 1 p.m.    More than 25 rounds landed on the Thai side of the border  but  caused no casualties or damage to property.    A Thai L-19 reconnaissance aircraft and a helicopter of the  Burapha Force flew over the border to observe the fighting but  did not fire any warning shots.

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Burst of activity in BP Recent suggestions in the stock market that a split had opened up in the BP boardroom over the group's dividend policy burst into the open yesterday, triggering a sharp decline in BP shares. BP moved quickly to deny the stories emphatically. At their worst yesterday, BP shares had fallen to 276p, but they later steadied to close a net 5 1/2 off at 278 1/2 p. Turnover in BP reached 10m, around double the usual level of activity in the stock. BP is scheduled to report preliminary results next Thursday. There have been worries in the City for many months that a maintained dividend in real terms would not be covered by earnings. Stories yesterday highlighted the steep decline in the BP share price since last November which has seen the stock decline by some 16 per cent. Analysts expect BP to increase the fourth quarter dividend, with most plumping for 4.3p but some expecting 4.4p, compared with last time's 4.2p. One leading oil analyst described the boardroom rift stories as 'pure mischief' adding: 'Obviously there has been a serious debate about the dividend at BP, but then there should always be a serious debate about the level of dividends.' He said the chances of BP cutting its dividend were 'zero'. Another specialist said the press revelations 'illustrate the level of concern surrounding the dividend policy and indicate that the group is in a corner and may need more cost cutting and asset sales.' Reuters deal Late selling in Reuters Holdings, yesterday, applied the brakes to the rapid rise the company's shares have seen over the past few months. Reuters shares had been holding up strongly at around the 1125 level against a weak London market for most of the day. However, shortly before the close of trading one UK investment bank took on a line of 1.1m shares at 1085p and sought to place them at at 1095p, some 20p below the market price. The effect of offering such a massive line of stock - worth around Pounds 12m and equivalent to the normal turnover for a whole day - was that the shares tumbled sharply to close 28 off on the day at 1098p. Later, the Seaq electronic network showed an unusually heavy turnover of 3.1m, indicating that the shares had been successfully placed. The move is the first significant check to a rise which began in mid-November, when the shares stood at 860p. The rise was given further momentum recently from optimism over the company's new trading system Dealing 2000-2. The shares have also been strong ahead of the company's full-year results, to be announced next Wednesday. Properties reel Leading property shares reeled as the market took fright at news of the depth of the fall in office values, reported yesterday. This suggested that the fall in the City was an unexpectedly large 32.5 per cent and would lead to revisions in net asset valuations by at least one leading securities house. There was also a degree of profit-taking after some strong buying by one house on Tuesday. Busy turnover of 2.5m in MEPC left it 10 off at 370p, Land Securities fell 11 to 462p, Hammerson 'A' slipped 12 to 472p, while British Land was off 14 at 253p. Motor distributors were lifted by a favourable Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the car retail trade. Investment enthusiasm was encouraged by a positive note to institutions by Albert E. Sharpe, the Birmingham-based broker which prophesied 'far-reaching changes in motor retailing.' Among Sharpe's recommendations, Pendragon jumped 19 to 193p and Evans Halshaw firmed 6 to 275p. Lex Service added 3 to 220p while Dagenham Motor jumped 3 to 118p. A recommendation in the same report that the voluntary 11 per cent ceiling placed on the import of Japanese cars be lifted drove Inchcape, the sole importer of Toyota vehicles into the UK, sharply forward. The shares jumped 12 to 432p. EC commissioner Mr Leon Brittan's proposal for a new inquiry over the Pounds 44.4m British Aerospace 'sweeteners' row, left it off 4 at 286p. Nervous trading in British Airways ahead of KLM's results today saw the share dip 6 to 234p. An announcement on talks about a merger between the two airlines is expected later today. Siebe bounced 7 to 562p after Kleinwort Benson recommended the stock. The bear story on BP upset the other oil stocks with Shell 2 easier at 474p on keen turnover of 4.7m. Lasmo came under pressure with a couple of institutional sellers said to have been responsible for lowering the share price 7 to 238p. Burmah Castrol dropped 12 to 499p, responding to suggestions in the market that the group had sold its abrasives and diamond products division for a disappointing price. Among brewers, Allied Lyons and Grand Metropolitan remained particularly weak, reflecting fears of a squeeze on profits. Both companies have been hit by profit downgrades from brokers. Allied fell 10 to 620p as County NatWest followed the recent reassessment by Warburg Securities of the likely profit figures for the next two years. County expects Allied to produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 635m this year, against a previous estimate of Pounds 662m, and Pounds 730m in 1993 compared with an earlier forecast of Pounds 760m. Grand Metropolitan lost 14 to 912p after UBS Phillips and Drew cut its profits forecast for the company by Pounds 25m to Pounds 1.06bn for the year ending September 1992 and by Pounds 30m to Pounds 1.19bn for the following year. Pension fund surpluses, which have been a major source of profit growth over the last three years, are likely to be static in 1992, according to the broker. A Warburg Securities buy recommendation, the first document issued by Warburg on BT since its involvement as global co-ordinator to the flotation of part of the government's remaining stake in the telecoms, helped sustain both classes of BT stock. The 'new' improved 1 3/4 to 122 1/2 p on 12m traded, making the stock the second heaviest traded in the market yesterday, while the 'old' held at 331p on turnover of 4.7m. Racal Electronics initially edged up to 52p before coming back to close a fraction easier on the session at 50p with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to have carried out the lion's share of trading yesterday, when 9.6m traded, and on Tuesday when turnover topped 31m. Analysts attending Forte's day of presentations to the City quoted the hotel group as saying that January occupancy figures were up on the same month last year although no details were forthcoming. A speech last night by chief executive Mr Rocco Forte was expected to flesh out the group's current performance. The market is waiting to see if the shares will stay above 226p since it is at this level at which a warrant is exercisable on 10 March. If the price falls below that level, the bonds will have to be redeemed by Forte at a cost of around Pounds 93m. The shares eased a penny yesterday to 224p. SmithKline Beecham was up 20 in early dealing on hopes for its prostate drug. The enthusiasm followed approval by a US Food and Drug Administration committee of US company Merck's Proscar drug for non-cancerous prostate disease. However, a number of analysts pointed out that it would be at least three years before SmithKline's drug was on the market and the shares eased later to close 13 better at 968p. Another company to benefit from the strength in Merck was Glaxo, gaining 10 to 847p. Medeva lifted 10 to 283p, ahead of a presentation by Mr Bernard Taylor, the chairman, at the company's US joint broker Merrill Lynch today. Profit-taking was said to have prompted Wellcome to tumble 32 to 1126p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (103).

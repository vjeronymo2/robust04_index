			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] Vietnam's prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, says he is  ready to establish full diplomatic relations with the United  States immediately. In a rare interview, Mr. Kiet told Radio  Australia's Hanoi correspondent, Christopher Kramer, that  disputes between the two sides over property and assets left  over from the Vietnman War presented no hurdles to normal ties.  And the 71-year old Vietnamese leader indicated his willingness  to stay at the helm of government for another couple of years,  despite being past retirement age. From Hanoi, Christoper Kramer  filed this report:    [Begin recording] [Kramer] In his first interview since the  lifting of the U.S. trade embargo in February, Mr. Kiet spoke  for almost an hour about regional issues and relations with  Australia and the United States. He said the recent visit of  Prime Minister Paul Keating had seen a frank exchange of views  based on friendship, leading to agreement on bilateral and  regional issues.    Regarding the U.S., Mr. Kiet said the lifting of the embargo  had improved the conditions for the continuing search for  American MIA's and the disputes over property and assets left  over from the Vietnam War presented no obstacles to full  normalization of relations with Washington.    [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Vietnam  intends that the normalized relations between the United States  and Vietnam inevitably will come. We are ready at any point of  time for that because the normalized relations between the two  countries are not only in the interests of the two countries but  also in the interests of the region and the world over.    [Kramer] On the domestic situation, Mr. Kiet said the  elimination of poverty was his government's main priority. But  asked whether Vietnam wanted to move toward some form of  multiparty democracy, he said maintenance of political stability  was more important.    [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Looking  around as well as looking at the situation in Eastern Europe, we  could see that there is such a lesson.    [Kramer] Mr. Kiet did, however, commit the communist party  to continued political as well as economic reforms.    [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] We  clearly see the interrelationship and the mutually supporting  relationship between the economic reform and the political  reform -- these two areas are closely linked with each other and  one gives [word indistinct] for the other.    [Kramer] Since Mr. Kiet came to office in 1992, he has  presided over Vietnam's spectacular return to the world  community, but on the domestic front he faces a widening gap  between rich and poor and the daunting task of managing the  country's transition from communism to free market economy.    Along with the president and communist party leader, he is  widely expected to step down at around the time of the next  communist party congress late next year or in early 1996. But  having seen him in action on the tennis court, I can report that  the prime minister is fighting fit and in no mood to step down.    [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] If I am  be able to contribute to the development of the country in line  with the already identified projects, and if my personal health  permits me, and if there is a need expressed by the people, then  I try my best.

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / People: Broughton becomes BAT's heir apparent For the first time in its 90-year history, BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. Martin Broughton, 45, the non-smoking head of the financial services division, has been appointed group chief executive and deputy chairman. He will be accountable to Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, for the management of the group's operations and the development of business and financial strategy. Sir Patrick, 62, who has held both posts since 1982, says: 'Dividing the roles of chairman and chief executive is very much a new and untried development. The board will review its appropriateness in two or three years' time when I intend to retire.' Broughton, who takes up his new post on April 1, was the City's tip to succeed Sir Patrick and the appointment was welcomed yesterday. Said one: 'It is an evolutionary move, maintaining the commitment to the core businesses.' Broughton confirms that there would be no change of direction. 'Both tobacco and financial services are now growth businesses. There are lots of opportunities to be seized.' Broughton joined BAT in 1971, shortly after qualifying as a chartered accountant, and spent the next three years working in four continents as a travelling auditor for its tobacco operations. He held a variety of financial positions before moving to Souza Cruz, the Brazilian tobacco subsidiary, in 1980, becoming finance director in 1984. A year later he transferred to the group's insurance business as first finance director of Eagle Star. But he left in 1988 to join BAT Industries main board as finance director before the insurance business began to run into problems. He joined the chairman's policy committee, the board's key executive body, in January 1990, and later he assumed responsibility for group personnel and was appointed senior finance director. Eight months ago, he was appointed group managing director, financial services, and chairman of Eagle Star. Broughton has been a member of the CBI's economic affairs committee, and of the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board since 1991. He will head an executive management team whose other members will be Ulrich Herter, managing director of the tobacco operations, and David Allvey, group finance director. Observer, Page 23</p>

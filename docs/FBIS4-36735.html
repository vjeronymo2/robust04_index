			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri emphasized in Sidon  this afternoon that the continuing Israeli aggression against  Lebanon's territory, sovereignty, and dignity, whether involving  villages, individuals, or groups, will not force Lebanon to  conclude a separate peace deal with Israel or even to discuss  it. They will not succeed in putting on a collision course the  logic of the state and the logic of the honest, rational, and  objective resistance, which complements the work of the state  for liberation by its steadfastness, he added.    The prime minister added that we will not give Israel the  satisfaction of seeing any crack in the unity of the Lebanese,  who on the contrary are tending toward more strength, cohesion,  and firmness. Prime Minister al-Hariri reiterated that Lebanon  joined the negotiations in collaboration and consultation with  Syria and with a well-known objective--namely, to liberate every  inch in the south, the Western al-Biqa', and the Golan.    Prime Minister al-Hariri made these remarks after  inaugurating the municipality offices in Sidon.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Observer: Hard stuff Democracy has its costs, as Russians are discovering. According to the Russian daily newspaper Izvestia, the typical Russian male now consumes more than 80 litres of vodka annually. The latest figures, from 1992, indicate that alcohol consumption has returned to the levels of 1984, the bad old days before former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev launched his anti-booze drive. More alarmingly, life expectancy for men has dropped from 65 years - in 1987, at the peak of Gorbachev's crusade - to 59. Anyone for lemonade?</p>

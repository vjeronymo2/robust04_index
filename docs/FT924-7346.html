			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: BOC resilient to slowdown ALTHOUGH BOC's pre-tax profits of Pounds 341.9m were at the lower end of analysts' expectations, they nevertheless demonstrated the resilience of the group's operations to the slowdown in the world economy. Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, expressed pleasure at the figures. 'Our results show our ability to ride out difficult economic conditions,' he said. The gases business demonstrated modest growth thanks to relentless efforts to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs, said Mr Rich. Turnover increased from Pounds 1.96bn to Pounds 2bn, while operating profits rose from Pounds 261.5m to Pounds 287.4m. Adverse exchange rates reduced profits by Pounds 6m. At constant exchange rates, turnover would have increased 4 per cent and operating profit 12 per cent. Sales volumes of gases in the US and Australia were flat. A slowdown of the rapid growth in the north Pacific region, particularly Japan, affected results. Demand for healthcare products had been less directly affected by economic conditions, although some hospitals had delayed purchasing conditions, said Mr Rich. Healthcare turnover increased from Pounds 493m to Pounds 513m, but operating profits fell 9 per cent to Pounds 98.9m. This was partly caused by additional research and development costs for Delta Biotechnology The pharmaceuticals operations enjoyed a particularly successful year because of improved volumes and prices in the anaesthetics business Vacuum and distribution operations, mostly related to clean-room technology in the semi-conductor business, were badly hit by depressed capital investment. It had been a difficult year said Mr Rich. Turnover was constant at Pounds 282m, but operating profits declined 40 per cent to Pounds 19.7m. Mr Rich said next year promised to be better, even without an improvement in general economic activity. BOC's European turnover increased from Pounds 826.2m to Pounds 866m, while operating profits fell from Pounds 141.6m to Pounds 135.4m. Mr Rich said the Edwards vacuum subsidiary and additional R&amp;D spend at Delta biotechnology had reduced profitability. Industrial gas results had improved. Mr Rich warned any recovery would be slow. However, the group had planned accordingly. 'We are far from the end of cost-cutting,' he said.</p>

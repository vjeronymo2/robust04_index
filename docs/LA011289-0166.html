			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines, seeking to raise cash, has sold six A-300 wide-body jets to  sister carrier Continental Airlines, the company announced. Eastern will  receive $103 million in cash and a $67-million note at 17.5% interest for the  sale, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said in Miami. The planes had been  leased earlier to Continental and therefore will have no effect on the size of  Eastern's fleet, she said. Ceremsak said the sale was unconnected to the  breakdown Monday of federally mediated talks between Eastern and its machinists  union.  </P></p>

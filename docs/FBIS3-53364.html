Therefore, the diplomat says, Libya can withstand international  sanctions for another seven years, even if it were to face an  oil embargo. The diplomat notes that there are 4 million people  living in Libya whose basic--subsidized--needs of such goods as  sugar, oil, and tomato puree amount to about $1.5 billion  annually.</p>

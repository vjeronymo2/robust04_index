			<p>BFN     [Text] Manuel Tome, Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo]  secretary for mobilization and propaganda, said in Lisbon that  his party believes that the formation of a government of  national unity should only be considered after the multiparty  elections scheduled for October of this year.    Manuel Tome is responsible for Frelimo's electoral campaign.  Speaking in that capacity, Tome said that Frelimo's posture  after the elections will follow internationally acceptable  standards. He added that the winning party should not be forced  to form a government of national unity, even after elections  have been held.    Lately, many Mozambican opposition parties -- including the  Mozambique National Resistance -- have defended the formation of  a government of national unity, but the Mozambican Government  has rejected those views.</p>

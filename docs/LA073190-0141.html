			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK: CHAPMAN HIRES FULLERTON COACH BILL BROWN TO TAKE  OVER WATER POLO  </P> <P> Bill Brown, Fullerton College's water polo and swimming coach, has been hired  as the water polo coach at Chapman College, the school announced Monday.  </P> <P> Brown, who has coached aquatics at Troy and La Habra high schools, has 1 1/2  months before the Panthers open their season Sept. 12 against Whittier College.  </P> <P> "The main emphasis right now is to recruit new kids for the team that are  already attending Chapman," Brown said. "Last year, Chapman only had eight or  nine players, and it takes seven to field a team."  </P> <P> Brown earned his teaching credential at Chapman in 1970.  </P> <P> Jackie Blake, a pitcher on Chapman's softball team, was named to the GTE  Academic All-American first team. Blake, who will be a senior this fall, was a  first-team all-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. selection with an 18-5  record and an 0.39 earned-run average. She also batted .369.  </P> <P> The Chapman baseball team lost the left side of its infield and its entire  outfield from last year's team, but Coach Mike Weathers has signed 10 players.  </P> <P> They are: Robert Parga, a pitcher from Los Angeles Harbor; Steve McKowen, an  outfielder from Golden West; Jim Henderson, an outfielder from L.A. Harbor;  Clifford Anderson from Southwestern College in Chula Vista; Chris Sauritch, an  infielder from El Toro High; Shawn Nugent, an infielder from Cerritos College;  Kevin Monson, an outfielder from Fullerton College; Marvin Mack, an outfielder  from Long Beach College; James Gore, an outfielder from Rancho Buena Vista High  in San Diego, and Gus Munguray, a catcher from L.A. Harbor.  </P> <P> New Vanguards: They aren't household names, but Southern California College  Coach Bill Reynolds has added five players to his men's basketball team, which  advanced to the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics tournament last  season.  </P> <P> They are: Darren Kramer, a 6-foot-7 post player from Long Beach College; Mike  West, a 6-3 sophomore from Point Loma Nazarene who was an all-San Diego Section  player from Fallbrook High; Kyle Campanelli, a 6-3 all-Camino Norte Conference  forward from Santa Rosa College who is the son of California basketball coach  Lou Campanelli; Ron Scipio, a 5-10 point guard who played at Grand Canyon  College and L.A. City College in '84 and '85 and has been an assistant coach at  Manual Arts High; and Brad Dorais, a 5-8 point guard from Eastern Wyoming  Junior College.  </P> <P> Better late than . . . : Corey Smith, a 6-2 guard from Southern Section 4-AA  champion Glendora High School, has signed a letter of intent to play basketball  at Christ College Irvine, the college announced Tuesday. Smith, who averaged 14  points and four assists a game and was the Baseline League's most valuable  player, is the first player signed by Greg Marshall, Christ College's new men's  basketball coach.  </P> <P> Marshall got a late start recruiting because he was hired May 16, five weeks  after the first day high school students could sign letters of intent.  </P> <P> "It's not frustrating, but because it was late when I got the job, there were a  lot of players that had already signed," Marshall said. "I'll probably be  recruiting right up to the start of school."  </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> The Chapman women's volleyball team has signed three players to letters of  intent: Heather McKinley, a middle blocker and outside hitter from El Modena  High School; Tara Christensen, a middle blocker from Santa Rosa College, and  Diana French, a setter from Petaluma High. . . . Christ College Irvine will  open its women's volleyball season by playing host to a 14-team tournament Aug.  31 and Sept. 1. Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State Los Angeles, Southern California  College, UC San Diego and Alaska Fairbanks are among the teams entered.  </P></p>

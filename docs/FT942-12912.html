			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Japan banks to report losses on securities Tokai Bank, a Japanese commercial bank, and Mitsui Trust Bank announced they will report evaluation losses on their securities portfolios as of March 31. Japanese companies and financial institutions have been reporting unrealised losses on their securities holdings over the past two weeks, due to the sluggish stock market and weak earnings. Under Tokyo stock exchange rules, companies must report unrealised securities valuation losses if they total 30 per cent or more of the previous year's pre-tax or after-tax profits. The losses will not affect earlier earnings forecasts, as they had been included into the projections. Tokai reported unrealised losses on its securities portfolio of Y16.23bn (Dollars 149m), or 77.8 per cent of its after-tax profit for the previous year. Mitsui Trust said it would post an Y8.5bn evaluation loss on its securities holdings. Last week, a total of 14 commercial, long-term credit and trust banks reported losses, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank with losses of Y25.6bn, Sumitomo Bank with Y24.8bn, and Sakura Bank with Y23.2bn. Nomura Securities, the largest broker, reported an evaluation loss of Y19.7bn, while Daiwa Securities announced Y9.89bn loss on its securities portfolio.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / BNL loans case judge criticises White House THE judge presiding over the case of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) has made a blistering attack on the Bush administration's handling of the scandal, accusing officials of interfering in the prosecution. Judge Marvin Shoob, in an unusual judicial ruling that sets the stage for a full trial of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta manager, said there were 'grave questions as to how the prosecutors made their decisions in this case'. The judge's order came after prosecutors last week stopped a hearing aimed at sentencing Mr Drogoul and agreed he should be allowed to change his plea from guilty to innocent. 'It is apparent that decisions were made at the top levels of the United States Justice Department, State Department, Agriculture Department and within the intelligence community to shape this case and that information may have been withheld from local prosecutors seeking to investigate the case,' the judge wrote in a court order released yesterday. Judge Shoob, who disqualified himself from further handling of the case because he had already formed opinions, also called for the formal BNL trial to be postponed to allow a special prosecutor to be named. He said the refusal last summer by Mr William Barr, attorney-general, to name an independent prosecutor 'itself raises concerns for the court about the government's impartiality in handling this case'. The judge said a special prosecutor needed to obtain the facts rather than continue to accept the administration's claim that Mr Drogoul was the sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans. This premise was dismissed by the judge as a way 'to avoid embarrassing a foreign government or to contain criticism of a failed foreign policy'. Separately, in his first comment on the case, Mr Bill Clinton said on national television that a special prosecutor should investigate the administration's dealings with Iraq before the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Judge Shoob concluded in his ruling that officials at BNL's head office in Rome 'were aware of and approved Mr Drogoul's activities' on behalf of Iraq. He also said 'it is likely that the United States intelligence agencies were aware of BNL-Atlanta's relationship with Iraq'. He added that Washington stopped US investigators from conducting a serious investigation of the BNL head office's involvement in the scandal, which he said was 'coupled with or provoked by the involvement of other departments of the US government' in the scandal.</p>

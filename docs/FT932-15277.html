			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Merrill shares lifted by record first quarter SHARES in Merrill Lynch, the largest securities house in the US, rose sharply yesterday after the company reported record first-quarter profits of Dollars 342m, up 57 per cent from a year earlier. The results included a one-off pre-tax lease charge of Dollars 103m for offering vacated office space to other companies at Merrill's World Financial Center headquarters in Manhattan. Merrill's strong performance delighted investors, who bid up the company's stock Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 in early trading on the New York stock exchange. There were revenue records in Merrill's four main business lines - commissions, principal transactions, investment banking and asset management and custodial fees. This was an indication that the Wall Street earnings juggernaut, powered for the past two years by low domestic interest rates and good demand from investors and corporations for securities broking and underwriting services, is not slowing down. Revenues at Merrill reached a quarterly record of Dollars 3.96bn. The biggest chunk came from principal transactions, the business of trading securities for clients and for the company, which earned Dollars 755m. Commission revenues rose 4 per cent to Dollars 714m, surpassing the previous record set in the first quarter of 1987. Investment banking revenues were also strong, up 23 per cent at Dollars 455m, as Merrill once again topped the debt and equity underwriting tables in US and global capital markets. Fees from asset management and custodial services rose 7 per cent to Dollars 236m, buoyed by a 12 per cent increase in client assets under management to Dollars 145bn. Higher levels of interest earning assets, and favourable interest rates spreads lifted net interest and dividend profit 29 per cent to Dollars 256m. Non-interest expenses rose 10 per cent to Dollars 1,923m, excluding the one-off lease charge.</p>

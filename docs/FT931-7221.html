			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Wickes stages recovery with turnround to Pounds 6.6m WICKES, the DIY and timber retailer which almost sunk two years ago, returned to the black in 1992 but is again passing its dividend. Pre-tax profit for the year was Pounds 6.57m, including exceptional Pounds 786,000 property profits and Pounds 1.98m reorganisation costs at Malden Timber, one of its two ill-fated timber subsidiaries. The pre-tax loss for 1991 was Pounds 6.72m. The results reflected a sharp fall in interest charges following a Pounds 42.6m rights issue in 1991. Net interest payments were down to Pounds 13m (Pounds 16.9m), with group debt down by Pounds 35.8m to Pounds 73.2m. Gearing at the year end stood at 92 per cent (232 per cent). Operating profit more than doubled to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 10.1m). Turnover was slightly up at Pounds 548.4m (Pounds 542.6m). Earnings per share were 1.9p (losses of 2.1p). The results were in line with City expectations, but the shares shed 4p to 93p amid continuing concern about the future of the timber business. Wickes operates 102 DIY stores in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and France. It plans to open another 15 in the UK and five on the Continent this year. The company has launched an expansion of Builders Mate, its UK chain of low-cost timber outlets. Seven Builders Mate stores are already trading; another 14 will be launched this year after two years' work on repositioning the timber side. They will offer a range of 2,000 core products - construction timber, sheet materials and branded products - at up to 10 per cent below the 'headline' prices of typical timber merchants. Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said Builders Mate was 'a great market opportunity. It applies our tried-and-tested sales approach to the traditional timber merchant trade.' The passing of the dividend, he said, was in order 'to continue to reduce borrowings and finance the capital expenditure necessary for expansion.' The payment of a dividend for 1993 is 'a priority'. COMMENT Wickes is not out of the woods yet. The DIY side is in sound shape, with sales and margins continuing to outperform the sector average. Though ambitious, its planned expansion applies a proven formula when sites and building costs are cheap. Timber remains the problem. With only two of its 'pilot' stores trading for more than a year, Builders Mate is practically a leap in the dark. Most trade customers are credit-dependent and tied to traditional suppliers. A construction upturn may supply the credit; luring the customers is another matter. Analysts are forecasting profits this year of about Pounds 17m, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 23. A recovery stock.</p>

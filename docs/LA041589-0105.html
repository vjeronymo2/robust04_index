			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues  at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from  today's and Sunday's program follow.  </P> <P> TODAY  </P> <P> 'Rouge'  </P> <P> Hong Kong, 1988, 99 minutes  </P> <P>  8:40 p.m.  </P> <P>  Stanley Kwan's sophisticated ghost story begins with perfumed scenes of 1936  passion between a performer-courtesan and her wealthy lover. Then we're in the  present as the courtesan's ghost wanders through cold, neon-lit streets in  search of her lover -- who has yet to show in the afterlife. Kwan ("Love Unto  Waste") manipulates the dialectics of past and present, modernity and  tradition, love and death obviously, but with irony and intelligence; the  climax is a stunner. RECOMMENDED. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Taiwan revives its privatisation programme THE Taiwanese government is to revive its scarred privatisation programme by offering majority stakes in two state companies in the next fortnight. Shares will be auctioned to avoid the problems that beset recent privatisations of China Steel and BES Engineering. The TDollars 108bn (USDollars 4.13bn) domestic tranche of last year's China Steel share offer was only 38 per cent subscribed. The attempted TDollars 6.1bn sale of 60 per cent of BES in December fared worse, forcing the government to arrange this second attempt at selling the shares. However, Taiwan Machinery may be an even greater test. The industrial company has been a substantial loss-maker in recent years, but it has 100,000 sq metres of prime vacant land, and the government is expecting some interest from property developers. The ministry of economic affairs plans to offer 385m shares, or 60 per cent, of Taiwan Machinery, raising in the region of TDollars 10bn. A base price will be set, and investors will put in offers for a minimum 10 per cent stake at, or above, that price. The ministry claims the primary incentive for its privatisations is to achieve greater autonomy for the company, thereby improving management efficiency. But so far it has failed to sell a controlling stake in any of its public companies. A more fundamental rationale for the government's privatisation programme is to alleviate the huge debt burden created by its proposed USDollars 300bn six-year development plan. Brokers remain cynical about whether these privatisations can be successful. There is no co-ordination between the various ministries that control Taiwan's public enterprises, and there is an archaic public share offering system. Under the current mechanism, a company has to fix the issue price more than one month before investors have to pay up for its stock; usually, if the stock market falls, the issue is not subscribed, as was the fate for both China Steel and BES. Taiwan Machinery and BES will be the first share offers to take place by auction, and the ministry has looked at a number of other ways of streamlining the issue process. It has a strong incentive to do so. It is due to offer a tranche of China Petrochemical during 1992. The finance ministry is also scheduled to raise more than TDollars 50bn this year through the privatisations of Chiao Tung Bank, Farmers Bank and Chung Kuo Insurance.</p>

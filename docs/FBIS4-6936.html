			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikkei reporter Ryushiro Kodaira] </F>   [Text] The foundation below the Japanese capital markets is  disintegrating. Chinese businesses in need of capital are being  listed on the New York Stock Exchange, while the Foreign  Department of the Tokyo Stock Exchange witnesses a continuing  withdrawal of European and U.S. listings. Fiscal year 1994  issues of yen-denominated foreign bonds (Samurai) bonds are  expected to drop in half. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is now  suffering from the combined impact of belated action on  deregulation and lack of adequate fundamental rules on investor  risks. The Japanese stock market now stands at a crucial point,  where it may continue as one wing of principal world markets or  decay into the status of a regional market.    President Minoru Nagaoka of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, whose  term of office will expire in one month on 25 May, spoke quietly  as he said, "I should have foreseen changes in the Asian  continent earlier. That is my one point of disappointment."    Asian businesses are now in the midst of privatizing and  undergoing a boom in initial public offerings. Twenty-two  Chinese businesses are expected to list on foreign markets and  four firms, including Huanai International Electrical Power  Development Company, will list on the New York Stock Exchange by  the end of this year. China Securities Surveillance and Control  Commission President Liu Hongru declares, "European and U.S.  stock markets will play an important role in the growth of the  Chinese economy." He even suggests a substantial affiliation  with European and U.S. securities surveillance authorities and  securities exchanges to include the exchange of information. He  does not mention "Japan" or "Tokyo" in his statements.    As far as the Tokyo Stock Exchange is concerned, two teams  composed of two persons each were dispatched in March 1994 for  about 20 days, but this represented only an initial approach to  Asian markets. The exchange has just recently begun to consider  relaxation in listing standards such as net asset requirements  for admission of small capital Asian firms, a measure already  implemented in Europe and the United States. A source with Nikko  Securities' International Planning Department laments, "We would  like to handle Asian firms but the system for such accommodation  is yet to be established."    Eastman Kodak's Japan specialist whose firm applied for  delisting from the Foreign Division of the Tokyo Stock Exchange  in March of this year says, "We came to the conclusion that  listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was too costly relative to  benefits gained, amidst the worldwide restructuring of the  firm." Eastman Kodak's annual cost for maintaining its listing  on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 13 million yen. This was below  the average cost of listing with the Foreign Department of 20  million yen per year because it was translating its annual  report in summary format. Even then, with only 1,483 Japanese  shareholders, continued listing could not be justified.    The Securities Transactions Law requires that foreign firms  whose stocks are publicly traded in Japan must submit securities  reports and annual reports in Japanese. Since charges include  translation costs, fees to maintain listings are about eight  times those charged at other foreign exchanges. Financings, such  as secondary offerings, require the submission of a prospectus  in Japanese.    The complexity of the system is shunned and secondary  offerings after initial listing have been limited to five cases  and a total value of 82.9 billion yen. In the 1990's, only one  case was handled. When four firms including Kodak delist at the  end of June, the total number of foreign firms listed with the  Tokyo Stock Exchange's Foreign Department will be 98, less than  100.    Withdrawals from Japan are not limited to firms listed with  the Foreign Department.    In March, Republic of Turkey bonds were downgraded to a BB  rating by Moody's, bringing them into violation of Japanese bond  listing standards of "BBB or higher." In fiscal year 1993,  Turkey issued 215 billion yen of Samurai bonds in six phases,  but faces a high probability that it will not be able to issue  bonds in fiscal year 1994. The Greek central bank issued 10  billion yen in bonds in two phases, but its ratings are  currently under review and they now face difficulty in issuing  additional Samurai bonds.    The Samurai bond market has been ridiculed as a "junk  market"  because of the prevalence of BBB-rated bonds, but even then  disappointment is being expressed concerning the departure of  preferred clients of that market place. The flip side of this  situation according to sources at a major securities firm is  that "the Samurai market will wither" if the likes of Turkey  cease to issue such bonds. Already, issuers of AAA-rated bonds  have shunned the poor marketability of bonds in the Samurai  market and are shifting to an emphasis on global and Eurobonds  in raising new capital. There is a strong probability that  Samurai bond issues in fiscal year 1994 will fall to about 600  billion yen, one-half of last year's level.    Underwriters at Credit Suisse First Boston brag, "Businesses  of any kind or size can raise capital in U.S. capital markets."  Initially, super-long-term 50-year bonds or special-feature  bonds are issued for private placement with such parties as  institutions. Next, companies issue publicly subscribed bonds or  issue stock for listing on the NASDAQ where listings are  accepted even from firms that are not profitable. And, finally  they list on the New York Stock Exchange. Such an approach is  feasible in U.S. markets where a high degree of flexibility is  allowed, compared to issuing bonds and listing on the Tokyo  Stock Exchange.    Such a system is backed up by thorough disclosure rules. The  prospectus of Shanghai Petrochemical Industries, which issued  American Depository Receipts in July 1993, under "Factors To Be  Considered in Investing," listed 11 items such as "price of  crude oil," "insurance coverage for accidents" and "GATT  restrictions."    Since 1992, the London Stock Exchange began to exercise  flexibility in applying standards concerning total market  valuation at time of listing. The aim was to accelerate the  listing of stocks of companies which specialize in biotechnology  research which is considered "Britain's last unlisted industry."  A special committee was established in the stock exchange which  was composed of institutional investors and industry  representatives. According to sources at the Listing Department  of the London Stock Exchange, the biotechnology-related  businesses are "a very important sector for Britain," and if  they cannot raise capital domestically, there is the risk that  the industry will relocate to other countries. It appears that  such concerns led to the actions being taken.    In its survey report titled, "Market 2000," concerning the  structure and regulation of the U.S. stock markets, issued in  January 1994, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  wrote, "If the SEC is to maintain strict standards, it must make  market participants understand that the standards will bring  appeal and benefits to the markets."    On 20 April, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji during meetings with a  delegation from the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of  Corporate Executives] said, "Eventually, we would like to list  state-owned company stocks on Japanese stock exchanges."  Although the foundation under Japanese stock exchanges is said  to be disintegrating, strongly rooted hope still exists in  relation to Japan. I would venture to say that there is a need  for Japan to create "appeal and benefits" for its stock markets,  before hopeful words of the foregoing nature disappear  completely.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Aquascutum wins cash injection from Renown RENOWN, Japan's biggest clothing maker, is injecting Pounds 8m (Dollars 15.28m) into Aquascutum, its upmarket British fashion retailer. The UK business has been dragged into losses by the effect of recession on luxury goods sales. The move comes two years after Renown paid Pounds 74m to take over the company. It is the latest case of a celebrated brand name requiring further cash infusions by a new foreign owner. The sum, although modest, is being paid at a time when the parent is itself in the red. Aquascutum's pre - tax losses for the 1991 calendar year reached Pounds 13.47m on sales of just Pounds 42.30m, and Renown expects the offshoot will stay in loss this year. Of the extra funding, Pounds 4m was paid in May and the rest would be provided next January, Renown said. The capital injection will help meet Aquascutum's commitments in projects such as refurbishing its Regent Street flagship store in London and opening an outlet in North America. Renown, a producer of mid-market ready-to-wear apparel, is to begin selling Aquascutum lines in Japan from next month, spending Y2bn (Dollars 16m) on a specialist store for the brand. This had not been possible until the recent unwinding of a licensing arrangement between Aquascutum and Mitsubishi Corp, which had given the latter distribution rights for the country. Aquascutum says its sales in Japan should reach Y10bn in Renown's accounting year, which begins in February. However, such a performance would come in the face of the country's own economic downturn, which has quelled the enthusiasm of metropolitan Japanese for foreign designer labels. Indeed, some retail sector analysts had thought the change might prompt shoppers to trade down to the more affordable lines mass-produced by Renown. However, any such trend remains unreflected in the parent company's performance. Renown said its pre-tax loss for a seven-month interim period which ends in 10 days would exceed the Y11bn it had previously forecast. It blamed the setback on poor sales, particularly at the department stores it supplies.</p>

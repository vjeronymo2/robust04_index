			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GIVES TENTATIVE OK TO ANTI-SLUMLORD LAW  </P> <P> An anti-slumlord ordinance authorizing the city to reduce rent payments until  repairs are made to such things as clogged sewers and faulty wiring was  tentatively approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> The measure would give renters a chance to fight for repairs without fear of  eviction, said Barbara Zeidman, the city's rent control coordinator.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Basic Problems  </P> <P> The ordinance is the latest city measure aimed at landlords who fail to correct  basic problems in their apartment buildings. Last November, the city enacted a  law allowing tenants of certain dilapidated apartment buildings to place their  rents into a special escrow account until repairs are made.  </P> <P> Zeidman said the new ordinance will result in quicker action than the escrow  measure.  </P> <P> Under the new measure, a tenant may complain to the city's Building and Safety  Department if defects are present in eight specific areas: 1) roofs, windows,  walls and doors; 2) plumbing and gas lines; 3) hot and cold running water and  sewer lines; 4) heating; 5) electric lighting; 6) trash cans; 7) floors,  stairways and ceilings, and 8) the provision of a clean apartment when a tenant  moves in.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Citation  </P> <P> A city building inspector investigating a complaint could cite a landlord, who  in turn would have 60 days to either make repairs or appeal. Zeidman said that  if a landlord could show that a tenant was responsible for a defect, no rent  reduction would be ordered.  </P> <P> She added that a landlord could begin eviction proceedings if a defect was  tenant-caused.  </P> <P> A special panel, called the Rent Adjustment Commission, would be able to reduce  the rents of all affected tenants. A landlord may restore the rent to its  original amount once repairs are made, after giving the tenant at least 30  days' notice.  </P></p>

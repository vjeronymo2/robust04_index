			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Bundesbank attack on Emu plans A LEADING member of the Bundesbank policy-making council last night criticised as 'much too ambitious' the timetable for European economic and monetary union. Mr Reimut Jochimsen, president of the North Rhine-Westphalia central bank and a favourite to take over as Bundesbank vice-president later this year, said he favoured ratification of the Maastricht treaty but attacked the plan for monetary union by the end of the century. He also said he opposed the idea that movement to a single currency would be irreversible and automatic. Speaking at Nuffield College, Oxford, he said Germany and its EC partners decided to speed up European union after the breach of the Berlin Wall in November, 1989 because of 'the idea that Germany would want to escape from its obligations of European integration'. He admitted that recession-hit European countries were facing difficulties in meeting the public debt and deficit targets laid down in the treaty. This was because 'the Maastricht treaty was never subjected to a test of how it would be fitted in to medium-term cyclical developments'. Although long-term German interest rates were not particularly high, he conceded the Bundesbank's monetary policies - the result of 'persistent imbalances in the German policy mix' - were causing difficulties abroad. 'Germany in year three (after re-unification) is putting a burden on Europe. This has to be dealt with - it has to be solved. But we are tied up with the political issue of whether the Maastricht treaty will be ratified (by all 12 EC countries) or not. This is taking far too much time - time we do not have.' Commenting on the devaluation of the Irish punt, he said realignments in the European Monetary System should be made less dramatic, so that they were no longer 'the end of the world'. He added: 'This would help get the EMS off the ground again, and avoid turning it into an ever more political process, where heads of state and government announce what is happening.' On Germany's domestic economic problems, he said the country was in recession but was not entering a 'cumulative downturn'. Since Germany was likely to run a current account deficit for 'some years', monetary policy had to remain cautious. He warned that the German government's deficit reduction package announced last month was based on forecasts of 2.9 per cent annual economic growth after 1994 which could turn out to be over optimistic.</p>

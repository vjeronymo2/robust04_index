			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Costain seeks Pounds 84m to cut debt COSTAIN Group yesterday made the latest in a series of moves to curb its high gearing with a 5-for-4 rights issue to raise Pounds 83.9m. The UK construction and mining group's share price, which peaked at 366p in 1987, closed up 4p at 37p on news of the issue, priced at 30p. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said the proceeds would be used to reduce debt and underpin the US coal mining business. The issue reduces gearing from 132 per cent to 51 per cent pro forma at the end of the first half. On the same basis, net debt of Pounds 204.7m falls to Pounds 121m. The figures exclude borrowings of Pounds 15m held off-balance sheet in a joint venture. The company's assets include Pounds 63m reflecting both the potential of the company's one-third share in the Spitalfield's central London development site and an Pounds 18m premium to be paid to the City of London over three years. Costain also has a loss-making Spanish house building joint venture on its books at Pounds 18m. The cash call brings the total generated from five years of fund raising through disposals and share issues to roughly Pounds 470m. At the time of its last rights issue, for Pounds 77m, Costain planned to maintain its dividend at 12.25p for 1991, but managed only the 4.75p interim payment and has not paid a dividend since. It said yesterday it did not plan a dividend before 1995. The company this year sold its Australian coal mining business for Pounds 157m to Peabody Coal, a Hanson subsidiary. The disposal helped lift the company's interim pre-tax profits by Pounds 68.5m, from a restated Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 69.4m. Turnover rose to Pounds 622.6m from Pounds 614.3m. Operating profits of Pounds 14m - including a Pounds 6.1m contribution from discontinued operations - just covered interest charges of Pounds 13.1m. Engineering and construction increased operating profits almost 50 per cent to Pounds 6.7m. 'The trading performance was good in a very tough market, which represents in part the fact that we are moving activities into higher margin areas, particularly overseas,' said Mr Costain. The company lost on three 'small' Middle East contracts, but hoped to recover them on two. Operating profits in US coal mining were a static Pounds 5m, held back by unexpected delays in obtaining a permit for one contract and failure to renegotiate a second. Earnings per share, including the disposal gains, were 28.5p compared with losses of 1.3p. The rights issue is fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. Joint brokers are Hoare Govett and NatWest Wood Mackenzie.

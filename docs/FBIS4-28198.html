			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Can NAM Stay Relevant?"] </F>   [Text] At least the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) has been  spared the jibe of being "a bureaucracy in search of a pension"  that was bevelled at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and  the Commonwealth. Not that this guarantees a meaningful future.  Lacking a self-perpetuating administrative structure, NAM  appears to face an even more uncertain destiny, its fate being  in the hands of its members, now numbering 109 after South  Africa's admission at the ministerial meeting in Cairo recently.  But, in the ultimate analysis, its ability to survive may owe  more to the political perceptions of the leaders of these mainly  developing nations of Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania  than any rational factor. Nor may the end of the Cold War  present NAM with its defining moment. Though global  polarisation provided the movement's raison d'etre, its heyday  came with the decolonisation process of the '60s.    Non-alignment has tried to justify its existence since then  by claiming to be more than just neutrality between the  superpowers. It represented, so ran the thesis, a positive  option for peace that permitted developing countries to pursue  their own aim of economic reconstruction without becoming bogged  down in global rivalry. It can be argued that one set of  challenges has now replaced another. The objective of growth  without forfeiting political sovereignty retains its validity at  a time when many nations of what used to be called the Third  World are being pressured by the West, with human rights or the  environment as the fig-leaf, to make internal changes that will  have the effect of negating the comparative economic advantage  they might now enjoy. Recognising that the economic agenda is  the most important to confront its members, NAM is preparing to  set up a coordinating committee in conjunction with the Group of  77 to negotiate with the developed nations on trade issues.    But whether NAM provides the best platform for fighting what  Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar calls "political  conditionalities", and whether the exercise is even relevant, is  another matter. In practice, NAM has always been noted for its  political posturing and a tendency to pronounce on virtually  every subject under the sun. Often, this seems to be an end in  itself, more satisfying than trying to put an end to wars and  violence, which was, in any case, beyond the mandate of a  movement that had only an "exhorting effect", according to  Professor Jayakumar, and not an "enforcing mechanism". However,  the need for consensus decisions often meant bargains to sweep  bilateral disputes under the carpet while pandering to the  national susceptibilities of members. And this has not always  added to NAM's credibility. For instance, while it is  understandable that the outrageous conduct of the Serbs should  arouse repugnance, the Cairo meeting's decision to allow Bosnia  to attend as a guest of the host government, while ignoring  Serbia's request to be represented, looked like prejudging the  succession to the vacant Yugoslav seat.    More than ever now, because it is at the crossroads, NAM  cannot afford to be seen as lacking in objectivity. The global  situation has altered vastly since Nehru, Tito and Nasser laid  the foundations of the non-alignment in Belgrade. Perhaps more  to the point, as NAM looks around for an additional  supplementary role, a number of economic organisations and  regional groupings have sprung up. Being smaller and honed to a  specific task, associations like ASEAN and APEC are likely to be  far more effective than a large umbrella organisation that still  tries, judging by the Cairo declaration, to be all things to all  men. But their greater effectiveness may not necessarily make  NAM redundant in the eyes of most members: many Third World  politicians find the non-aligned forum, more intimate than the  United Nations, both necessary and deeply fulfilling.</p>

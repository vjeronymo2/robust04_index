			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: News Corporation The 5 per cent rise in News Corporation's shares in response to perky interim results will help restore the company's reputation, which took something of a bashing following its plans to issue super voting shares. Ansett and BSkyB made particularly strong contributions to the results. Only the self-induced pain of the newspaper price-cutting campaign in the UK blotted News's progress. The withdrawal of the super share proposals has seemingly stymied any grand strategic ambitions that Mr Rupert Murdoch may have entertained. The company has an understandable aversion to bank debt to fund expansion. Its ability to issue straight equity is restricted by the desire not to dilute the Murdoch holding below 32 per cent. Still, News has plenty left to chew on at present. Star TV, which is likely to lose Dollars 20m in the full year, should absorb much of Mr Murdoch's energies as he attempts to transform it into a subscription service. Fox Network will also have to work hard to justify the high price it paid for its American football rights. News's existing investments are therefore likely to take time to deliver. Australian industrial stocks should certainly post a faster rate of earnings growth for the foreseeable future. But towards the end of the decade, that picture could change fast. If BSkyB blossoms, Star comes good, and the American football contract starts delivering fat advertising revenue then News should be printing money. The strength of that revenue stream could even be sufficient to fund the bigger strategic moves.</p>

These were the words spoken by Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa at an informal gathering held at the Prime  Minister's Official Residence on the afternoon of 28 December,  the closing day of official business, as he reflected deeply on  the past five months since the establishment of the coalition  government.  <H5>  Successive Late Night Decisions </H5>   Nevertheless, during that particular week in mid-December,  there occurred a succession of "late night dramas" that  symbolized the coalition government's suddenly facing a crisis,  as the favorable winds which supported the prime minister lost  the power they once had.    The coalition government hoped to make a decision on partial  opening of the rice market on 13 December. The prime minister  remained in his office from that evening, anxiously waiting for  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to make its decision  on the rice issue. He ate a mouthful of donuts his eldest  daughter brought him. From the open windows, he could hear the  shouting of demonstrators protesting partial opening of the rice  market.    It was nearly 0200 hours the next day when the SDPJ finally  arrived at a decision, saying that it "is opposed to partial  rice market opening, but understands the prime minister's  decision." The prime minister then began his news conference at  0400 hours.    Two days later, a decision to extend the current Diet  session  for 45 days to have political reform bills enacted during the  current session was finally made at the lower house plenary  session a little after 2300 hours. However, the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] boycotted the session. Consequently, the  outlook on the fate of the political reform bills became more  uncertain.    Finally, 17 December arrived. This time, it took until the  very late hours of the night to decide on whether to work on  drafting the budget for the next fiscal year by the year-end or  carry over the work to next year. Prime Minister Hosokawa was  busy in his office, calling senior officials of coalition  parties to coordinate opinions. That night, the prime minister  revealed his feelings through his facial expressions --  something unusual for him -- as he replied to a correspondent's  question, saying: "The ruling coalition parties are ever so  divided over this issue."    Political reform, the rice issue, action that needs to be  taken against serious and unprecedented economic deterioration,  and tax reforms including consumption tax hikes -- in  considering the significance of each of these tasks, it is  natural that the prime minister is having difficulties. Even  since the days when the LDP was in power, it has been considered  that trying to solve any one of these tasks would "require  determination on the part of the prime minister with a readiness  to sacrifice the cabinet" (as stated by a close aide to the  prime minister).    Prime Minister Hosokawa himself had that kind of  determination. On 20 November, leaders of various nations  participating in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  meeting in Seattle, Washington successively congratulated  Hosokawa, saying: "Congratulations on the success of your  political reform efforts." The prime minister replied: "No, no.  It will be much more difficult with the upper house of the  Diet." Thus, it was Hosokawa himself who actually made what  seemed to be an overly cautious remark.    However, it is questionable whether he could have predicted  that deliberations at the upper house on the political reform  bills were yet to start one month thereafter. Meanwhile, as  political reform remained stalled, other pending issues began to  pile up.    "Endurance is the only way." Recently, the prime minister  has often spoken these words at the Prime Minister's Office and  at his official residence. Since he is well aware of attacks  from the LDP and moves by dissident SDPJ members, the term  "endurance" probably applies to the fact that his power to keep  the coalition government together seems to have begun fading  away.    "The Prime Minister's Office has not been doing its job  properly." These were words spoken by an angry Ichiro Ozawa,  secretary general of the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], on the  night before a decision was made on carrying over the work on  drafting the fiscal year 1994 budget to next year. Seeing Ozawa  in such anger, Hosokawa was unable to even bring up discussion  to seek his advice on the all-important budget issue. Ozawa's  complaints were primarily aimed at Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura, who tried to make various decisions while  frequently consulting with senior LDP officials. Ever since the  inauguration of the coalition government, the split between  Ozawa and Takemura, rather than narrowing, has come to the verge  of shaking the very foundations of the coalition government.  <H3>  Bureaucrats Start Shying Away From Supporting Coalition  Government </H3>   Seeing the coalition government wavering, it seems that  bureaucrats, too, are beginning to shy away from supporting it.  Recently, Prime Minister Hosokawa has taken the most pains with  working out policy adjustments with the Ministry of Finance  concerning tax cuts which will serve as the pillars of  anticyclical measures. The following dialogue between Hosokawa  and Jiro Saito, administrative vice-minister of finance,  illustrates this situation.    Hosokawa: "Since keeping tax cuts and consumption tax hikes  as a single package has a negative effect on economic recovery,  can it be arranged so that the two can be treated separately?"    Saito: "Such a request is unacceptable."    The Finance Ministry refuses to concede, insisting that  "fiscal matters have priority." For example, it has asserted:  "Previous prime ministers have all followed our plans."    The leaders of various coalition parties and bureaucrats who  are expected to support the prime minister in the coalition  government are fighting among each other, as they all have their  own opinions and stances that they must uphold. For a certain  length of time following the inauguration of the coalition  government, things seemed to proceed smoothly somehow with  favorable winds blowing. Suddenly, however, a situation has  emerged where the prime minister must exercise leadership to get  things moving.  <H5>  Giving Up on Skiing and Hot Spring Baths </H5>   Indecision on the part of the prime minister would directly  lead to his being bombarded by criticism that he "lacks  leadership" or is pursuing a "wait-and-see politics." At the 21  December meeting of the Expanded Policy Committee of the  Sakigake [Harbinger]-Japan New Party [JNP] parliamentary group,  even members of the prime minister's own party successively  complained that "the Prime Minister's Office has failed to  exercise leadership."    Hosokawa spent New Year holidays in 1993 at his villa in  Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture quietly working out his plans on  the lower house general election and on removing the LDP from  power.    It was a bewildering year for Hosokawa. The plan to oust the  LDP from power succeeded, and Hosokawa himself became prime  minister. Then passed the brilliant period when the new  coalition government firmly stood up, advocating "reform." As  soon as the New Year holidays are over, Hosokawa will  immediately face a truly crucial moment when the existence of  the coalition government will be at stake.    The prime minister will be spending most of his time during  the end of the year and the New Year holidays at his official  residence, giving up on skiing and resting at hot springs -- the  way he originally hoped to spend the holidays -- because "there  are so many things that must be taken care of."</p>

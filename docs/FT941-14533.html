			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Renault to help after accidents Renault UK is launching a fresh weapon in the UK new car sales war - accident management on each car sold. It has formed a venture with Accident Management Company, part of a northern-based fleet management group, to take over administration of the entire aftermath of an accident, from contact with insurers to overseeing repairs, at no cost to the motorist. The scheme, available for fleet and private buyers, already covers 31,000 Renault vehicles in the UK and is expected to be extended to more than 130,000 by the end of this year.</p>

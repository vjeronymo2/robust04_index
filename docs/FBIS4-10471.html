			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Mario Enriquez Morales said  yesterday: "The Army is ready to go into the streets to support  civilian security forces and to fight the wave of violence  Guatemala is experiencing."    He made these statements during his speech to Congress and  affirmed them as the special session concluded. He stressed this  plan is part of the new project drafted by the government's  security cabinet to face the current situation.    He added the military institution is constitutionally  empowered to support civilian security forces by using its  47,000 agents; we must follow President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's  instructions, because we are part of the executive branch, he  said.    Government Minister Danilo Parinello Blanco also talked  about  the joint project, which could become effective in the next few  hours. He added the security cabinet has planned the creation of  assault, elite, and investigative police units.    The first police unit will initially have 300 men and 600  men  after 90 days, while 200 men will be assigned to the elite  police unit. The investigative police unit will have military  support. All these plans will be implemented despite the  Government Ministry's current economic status.  <H5>  Deficiencies </H5>   At the deputies' insistence, Parinello Blanco said his  institution, especially the National Police (PN), has a number  of deficiencies. Among the shortcomings, he mentioned the lack  of economic resources and technology and the shortage in staff  to work in all the regions.    The official cited the fact that 1,027 agents are at the  service of diplomatic institutions and individuals. He added a  policeman must buy his uniform and shoes, and should he use his  weapon he must use his 750-quetzal salary to buy ammunition.    Among the projects to be implemented, he said there is the  possibility of establishing an emergency telephone number,  similar to the U.S. 911 emergency phone number.  <H5>  Historical Plenary Session </H5>   Deputies interrogated the two officials at a historic  plenary  session. The main topics addressed were the murders of Jorge  Carpio Nicolle and Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas  Gonzalez, as well as the recent attack on Legislator Obdulio  Chinchilla Vega and other violent actions throughout many  regions.  <H5>  Fernandez's Testimony </H5>   Colonel Jose Fernandez Ligorria, chief of staff of the  Defense Ministry, testified yesterday he has no links with the  Chinchilla attack; on the contrary, he learned of the anonymous  letter on 5 April and offered the deputy protection.</p>

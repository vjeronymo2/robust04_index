			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tomorrows Leisure in the red TOMORROWS LEISURE, the USM-quoted hotels and leisure company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.8m for the year to March 31 compared with restated profits of Pounds 775,000. Turnover rose to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 7.5m). The group also announced that a revaluation of many of its main assets had resulted in the value of Pleasure Island, its indoor leisure park in Liverpool, dropping from Pounds 24.5m to Pounds 7m. Overall, group net assets have fallen from Pounds 30.4m to Pounds 4.8m. The pre-tax loss includes Pounds 3.1m in asset value write-downs, as well as Pleasure Island's start up and initial trading losses. The group said a policy of writing-off all revenue expenditure on the opening of new developments in the year it was incurred had added to losses. Last year's results have been similarly restated. Losses per share were 45.5p (6.9p earnings) and no final dividend (1.375p) is proposed. The company is negotiating with Barclays, its bankers, to secure their continuing support. Mr John Sanderson, chairman and founder, said the Pounds 375,000 loan he made to Tomorrows Leisure this summer, to secure Barclays' continuing support, indicated his confidence in the company. Debt stands at about Pounds 15m. The current year, he said, would be one of consolidation and rationalisation, with disposal of non-core businesses.</p>

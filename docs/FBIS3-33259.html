			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Orozco] </F>   [Excerpts] After analyzing the counterproposal from the  3-80 Northern Front, the government yesterday agreed to hold a  meeting on Monday [21 February] in Ciudad Antigua, Nueva Segovia  Department. As Army spokesmen disclosed, the meeting will be  held in the morning. Colonel Javier Carrion, second in command  of the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] General Staff, will be  among those attending the meeting.    This will mark the first time the military will sit down for  talks with an armed group after the demobilization of the  Nicaraguan resistance in 1990. This morning during a ceremony  to turn over the Region 3 Military Command Building, EPS Chief  General Humberto Ortega said government troops are withdrawing  from the conflict zone to the area suggested by the OAS-CIAV  [International Commission of Support and Verification] and  Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission.    Yesterday, the government reviewed the counterproposal sent  by the 3-80 Northern Front in the main offices of the Government  Ministry with Carrion present. Carrion arrived at the  Government Ministry after CIAV Director Sergio Caramagna and  Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission representative  delivered the armed group's new proposals to the government at  1100.    Those proposals, according to "Estaban," the 3-80 Northern  Front's political chief, "are not outlandish." In order for the  meeting to be held, the 3-80 Northern Front is basically  demanding the physical security of all of its guerrillas and an  EPS withdrawal from the conflict zone.    Last Tuesday, following a meeting with the OAS-CIAV and  Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission in El Rosario,  35 km northeast of Murra, the rearmed group claimed that special  EPS troops equipped with rifles with silencers and supported by  heavy artillery "are putting a military cordon around us."    During that same meeting, "Esteban" termed as "positive" the  letter from Gen. Ortega, which informed the rebels on behalf of  the EPS General Staff and the Military Council that "I guarantee  you respect and protection for the lives and assests of all  those who disarm immediately." [passage omitted]    Jose Angel Talavera Alaniz, a.k.a. "El Chacal," answered  Gen.  Ortega's letter yesterday. In a letter dated 15 February, the  day of the meeting between the 3-80 Northern Front and the CIAV,  "El Chacal" reaffirmed his willigness, as well as the  willingness of the 3-80 Northern Front's Board of Commanders, to  contribute to the peace process.    "On behalf of the 3-80 Northern Front, I am reiterating that  the demands submitted to the OAS-CIAV at the 15 Febuary meeting  in El Rosario have my full support," "El Chacal" wrote.    "We hope and trust that you (Gen. Ortega) and the EPS  General  Staff will contribute as soon as possible to giving us the  minimum guarantees to begin to bring our troops together and  immediately begin negotiations leading to the incorporation of  our command members into the mainstream of society, within the  context of the proposals made," the letter from "El Chacal"  concluded.    The demands the 3-80 Northern Front basically refer to the  personal safety of the rebels and their incorporation into the  national police, as well as to some economic projects that the  government must begin in the northern zone.</p>

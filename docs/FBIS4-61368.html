			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Tajik "Islamic opposition leader" </F> Akbar Turadzhonzoda by Rodrigo Fernandez in Moscow; date not  given: "Akbar Turadzhonzoda: `Regime Survives Only Through  Russian Support'"]    [Text] Moscow -- A civil war has been under way in  Tajikistan -- a central Asian country of strategic importance to  Russia -- for almost two years now. According to information  from KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the Russian Army newspaper, the opposition  has almost 15,000 men under arms. This month the first step was  taken toward a solution of the conflict, when representatives of  the opposition and the government were persuaded to sit down to  negotiate.    Akbar Turadzhonzoda, who lives in Iran, did not attend the  talks, but he has had meetings with senior Russian diplomats and  ministers. Turadzhonzoda received EL PAIS in a building  belonging to the Foreign Ministry, guarded by soldiers of the  Russian Army -- the same army that is fighting his own men in  Tajikistan.    "The present regime is illegitimate, because it acceded to  power thanks to the intervention of other countries (that is,  Russia -- EL PAIS editor's note), and not as the result of a  democratic election. This government survives only thanks to  Russia's military and economic support," Turadzhonzoda said.  However, he gave assurances that the opposition respects  Russian interests in Tajikistan.    The Muslim leader is in favor of a peaceful solution. To  this end the present government must resign and be replaced by a  government of national reconciliation, "comprising neutral and  competent individuals." The return of the thousands of Tajiks  who fled the country because of the civil war must be  guaranteed, and free and democratic elections must be held.    "We reject all proposals leading to coexistence with the  present regime. There has been too much bloodshed and too much  hatred. Everything depends on Russia. The Russians defend the  borders, help to maintain internal order, and provide economic  support. Russia must put pressure on the present government.  If it does not do so, we will sink further and further into  this dirty war, which can only end in one way -- with a shameful  withdrawal, as happened in Afghanistan," he explained.    The opposition's proposal, its leader said, would permit  Russia to protect its interests "at less expense" and at the  same time "to improve its relations with all parts of the Tajik  people."    The opposition is willing to disarm, but demands that this  be  done also by "all government structures, apart from the police."  The functions of these structures will be taken over by peace-  keeping forces, "comprising troops from other CIS countries."  Russian officialdom in Tajikistan -- which has combated the  opposition -- must be replaced.    Turadzhonzoda said that he understands "the anxiety on the  part of Russia and the Central Asian republics concerning our  possible responses in the event of our winning the free  elections that must be held after a two-year transition period."  The Muslim leader was of course referring to "the bugbear with  which they frighten themselves and others -- Islamic  fundamentalism."    In order to dispel these fears, Turadzhonzoda says he is  willing to negotiate certain basic articles of the future  constitution that will define the "nonconfessional and  democratic character of the Tajik state."    The opposition leader is also aware of the importance of the  uranium deposits in Tajikistan and says that Russia will have  priority in exploiting them. "I stress that no country of the  West or of the Islamic world can take Russia's place at  present," Turadzhonzoda said.    "We are not demanding the withdrawal of the Russian Army,  because that would be a disaster. There are too many enmities  among the Tajiks, and the experience of Afghanistan frightens  us. If Russia leaves, it will support part of the population,  and the other part will be supported by Uzbekistan -- there are  over a million Uzbeks in Tajikistan. As a result, we could lose  our country and suffer a national tragedy in which the Tajiks  will kill one another," he concluded.</p>

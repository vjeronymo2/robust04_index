			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Row over oil tax set to widen A tax dispute between the Inland Revenue and some UK oil companies could widen this week as additional companies review whether to join Elf Enterprise and Lasmo in issuing writs against the Revenue. The dispute is over interpretations of provisions in the 1990 Finance Act on interest payments on tax rebates in previous years. The Revenue said the act capped the amount of release a company could offset against past profits. The heart of the dispute is the Revenue's claim that total relief should not exceed a company's current loss. Lasmo, the independent explorer, issued a writ on Friday for Pounds 33m. Earlier Elf Enterprise, the joint venture between Elf Acquitaine of France and Enterprise Oil, the UK's largest independent, issued one for Pounds 70m.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tony O'Brien, environment correspondent: "New </F> Bid To Curb Chemical Pollution"]    [Text] Tough new controls on the country's chemical  industry are to be introduced by Environmental Protection  Minister John Browne.    Other areas of industry will also be targeted.    This will be done through the new Wexford-based  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) which will issue a series of detailed  licences covering a range of industrial operations from the  middle of next month.    Although the licensing system will not initially cover the  pharmaceutical industry, it is known that Mr Browne is anxious  to bring this into place as quickly as possible, particularly  because of accidents at Cork plants last summer.    Cork Co Council had been asked to review the licence for the  Hickson plant at Ringaskiddy, where a major fire took place last  year, but has failed to do so. The EPA will now have the job.    The new regulations, which come into force on May 16, mean  the EPA will be responsible for licensing various operations  which have pollution potential.    These include chemicals, food and drink, minerals and other  materials, energy, wood, paper, textiles and leather, cement and  waste.    Other activities will be phased into the licensing system  and  Mr Browne has said that large-scale manufacture of pesticides,  pharmaceutical or veterinary products and the incineration of  waste will come into the EPA's scope from September 1.    Mr Browne said: "I am determined that large-scale, complex  and specialised activities should come within the EPA's control  as rapidly as possible and I will be keeping a watch on the  level of new activity in the various categories and how the  system works."</p>

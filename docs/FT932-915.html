			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tour firms hit The impending inquiry by the Office of Fair Trading into the links between the three largest UK tour operators and the country's biggest travel agents sent tour company shares on a downward journey. The move, which was announced after the market closed on Wednesday, led to a fall of 15 to 324p for Airtours, and left Owners Abroad 4 cheaper at 97p after 1.2m shares traded. Analysts greeted the OFT's investigation with a mixture of dismay and puzzlement. 'In a sector in which there is already a lot of uncertainty, this will lead to short-term dullness,' said one, who recognised that 'the OFT is not at all happy about the industry'. Another wondered what punch the OFT could actually pack and suggested that the practice under scrutiny - vertical integration - was the natural way forward for the travel business. 'I am not convinced that consumer choice is under threat at the moment,' he said. Airtours last night was rumoured to be interested in acquiring another package holiday company - the Cardiff-based Aspro. Close Brothers, the merchant bank, eased 2 more to 342p after it was revealed that Refuge Group, the life assurance company, had sold a block of 800,000 shares, 1.82 per cent of the issued capital, reducing its holding to 2.46m shares, or 5.6 per cent. The shares were sold on Wednesday when an agency cross was transacted in the market at 331p, well below the then ruling price. TSB dipped 3 1/2 to 194p on hefty turnover of 9.4m shares, the biggest since the end of April, following marginal disappointment with the preliminary results. The bumper profits - well in excess of the most optimistic forecasts - from Smith New Court, the highly rated UK securities house, triggered a 35 jump in Smith shares to a record 285p. The market took Smith's Pounds 41.2m rights issue at 210p a share in its stride. Farnell Electronics forged ahead 13 1/2 to an all-time peak of 417 1/2 p after the chairman said at the annual meeting that sales in the company's first quarter, from February 1, were up 10 per cent, and that since then they were up around 15 per cent. Electronics analysts said they were confident that the news would trigger earnings upgrades of 10 per cent in the near term. The pharmaceutical issues continued on their downward path, still affected by the current round of profits downgrades, which began last week with US analysts chopping their earnings estimates. Glaxo dipped 6 more to 573p on turnover of 3.2m shares, with London analysts following their US brethren in lowering their earnings projections. Courtaulds was one of the few stocks in the chemicals sector to make progress, with a number of institutions said to be switching out of ICI and into the former. Courtaulds shares jumped 13 to 565p, albeit on unspectacular turnover of 729,000 shares. The sparring between Boots and Kingfisher saw the former winning points after Strauss Turnbull recommended switching to it from Kingfisher. Boots moved ahead 7 1/2 to 444 1/2 p with 1.5m traded while Kingfisher fell 9 to 604p. Further recognition for good results pushed up Courts, the furnishing group, 15 to 628p. Optimism over John Menzies' results - due on July 12 - moved up the share price 6 to 497p. Profit-taking was said to be behind a decline of 3 by Forte to 223p in buoyant volume of 6.9m. 'It comes after a very strong performance,' said one leisure analyst. Pict Petroleum was the pick of the smaller oil stocks, the shares climbing rapidly to close a net 7 higher at 122p, their highest level since December 1990, following highly encouraging drilling news. Pict said it had made a potentially commercial gas find in its 47/2-1 discovery well in the North Sea. After the previous day's flurry in the breweries group, Greenalls Group took another tumble following comment on its bid for JA Devenish. In spite of a buy note from Nikko it gave up 3 to close at 355p. Devenish held at 367p, while Boddington, a key part of the takeover moves through its stake in Devenish, shed 3 to 283p. Allied-Lyons managed to escape virtually unscathed after an announcement of job cuts warnings over tough competition in the industry from Mr Don Marshall, managing director of Carlsberg-Tetley - the joint venture between Allied-Lyons and Tetley. Allied closed a fraction off at 539 1/2 p. The rally of Kwik Save continued with a move up of 11 to 739p, while Geest rallied to outperform the market with an increase of 11 to 350p. The psychological effect of paying up time in a cash-call weary sector was blamed for a generally poor performance in property and the particular slide of British Land, which announced a successful take-up of its recent rights issue. The rights was 95.96 per cent taken up, with the remainder placed yesterday morning, but the shares retreated 4 to 319p.</p>

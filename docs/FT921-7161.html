			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / CBI queries value of Maastricht opt-out THE Confederation of British Industry has expressed doubts about the economic value of Britain's 'opt-out' from an extension of European Community competence in the social and employment field. A paper approved by the CBI's governing council last month continues in principle to support the opt-out from the EC's so-called Social Chapter, negotiated at the European Council summit in Maastricht in December. However, the paper states: 'There is unlikely to be any lasting advantage to UK businesses if the rest of the EC is handicapped by a labour and social affairs regime characterised by a centralised approach to determining employment conditions.' This assessment seems to challenge government claims that the 'opt-out' would benefit Britain's economy by attracting foreign investors. The CBI says that if the 11 EC members, minus the UK, decide to establish new employment directives, British business will still be affected. 'All directives would bear immediately on the operations of UK companies elsewhere in the EC, and perhaps one day on their activities at home.' That view reflects the feelings of some personnel directors in UK multinationals who regret that Britain will have no influence over employment policy drawn up by the 11. They fear that political or legal pressure will eventually nullify the opt-out. A personnel director of a leading UK industrial group, whose chairman publicly supported the opt-out in December, said: 'The UK multinationals get it in the neck with this agreement. We would rather have seen Britain stay with the other 11 and fight its corner on employment matters, and I know my chairman agrees with me.' Nonetheless, the CBI paper says the opt-out has prevented some problems from 'becoming more acute'. It also draws some comfort from the controversial agreement between the European employers federation, UNICE, and the European Trades Union Congress (ETUC), which allows the two bodies to scrutinise and propose employment legislation. That agreement, included in the 'protocol' on employment policy signed by the 11, was dismissed as 'Euro-corporatism' by some UK ministers. But the CBI says: 'The agreement will at least provide EC employers with some ability to protect themselves from burdensome regulation now that the UK government's vote in the Council is no longer there.' Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, who was angered by the agreement between UNICE and the ETUC, last week sharply criticised the EC employers' organisations in general and UNICE in particular. He told the American Chamber of Commerce in London: 'Dialogue between employers in Europe is inadequate and UNICE is too Brussels-oriented and spends too much time trying to lobby the Commission, which is not a fruitful exercise.' He said he wanted to see employers lobby their own governments more on EC employment policy.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Teething problems to be cleared this week LONG HELLO: the teething troubles of Europe's longest escalators, which opened last week at the Angel underground station in north London, should be cured this week, Bethan Hutton writes. The station has been closed since Friday because of continuing trouble with the three 60-metre escalators, made in France, which started operating last Wednesday. The much-publicised new machinery ground to a halt after two days as large numbers of passengers tried to use the escalators. Tests at the weekend traced the problem to the control electronics, rather than the power supply which was originally suspected. Different technical problems which delayed the opening of the escalators from Monday to Wednesday last week have already been solved. London Underground said yesterday the escalators could be back in operation as early as today. Passengers, who had to use an emergency bus service, may be entitled to refunds under the Passenger's Charter. The escalators were installed as part of a Pounds 70m reconstruction programme, started in 1989, due to be completed in March with the opening of a south-bound platform.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, June 14 -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel voiced his support on Tuesday [14 June] for Poland's  motion to join the European Union (EU).    During his talk with Chairman of the Social Democracy of the  Republic of Poland (SDRP) Aleksander Kwasniewski, now on a visit  to Germany at the invitation from the German Association for  Foreign Policy (DGAP), Kinkel stressed that Poland had to  fulfill particular economic conditions.    The German foreign minister also emphasized the necessity to  improve "membership abilities" in key fields and added that this  also concerned other candidates. Kinkel promised Germany would  deal with this problem during its chairmanship in the union, to  start on July 1, 1994.    Kinkel approved of Poland's "fast and open" attitude towards  the Partnership for Peace programme, saying that the partnership  would change relations between the countries participating in  the initiative and NATO.    Next, the foreign minister stressed Germany's readiness to  support Poland in building market economy and pluralistic  structures.    Also on Tuesday, Kwasniewski met with former German Foreign  Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, President of the Bundestag Rita  Suessmuth, Minister of Defence Volker Ruehe, Minister of  Economics Guenter Rexrodt, head of the Free Democratic Party  (FDP) faction Herman Otto Solms and deputies of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and of the Christian  Democratic Party (CDU) Markus Meckel and Friedbert Pflueger,  respectively.    The SDRP leader briefed the German politicians on the  political and economic situation in Poland, emphasizing the  consistency in implementing reforms. He also added that a  greater stress on the social aspects did not mean the easing of  the budget requirements and the weakening of anti-inflationary  measures. Kwasniewski also said EU markets should open to  Polish products.    The German defence minister confirmed his support for  Poland's membership of NATO around the year 2000. He also  stressed the significance of contacts between the German and the  Polish armies for bringing Poland closer to Western defence  structures.</p>

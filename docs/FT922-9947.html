			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Gilts: Calm reaction to rate cut signals INDICATIONS that a UK base rate cut is likely later today were received with equanimity by the gilt-edged securities market at the end of last week. The reduction by up to half a percentage point was signalled by Bank of England money-market operations and by the announcement on Friday of a Pounds 800m tranche of short-dated gilts, available for trading from today. Given the pricing of these bonds, they are unlikely to find buyers unless the Bank cuts its short-term dealing rates, an action which would be followed by a cut in bank base rates. Signs of an imminent cut in borrowing rates, now at 10.5 per cent, might have been expected to lead to a softening in prices for long-dated gilts, on the grounds that it indicates a relaxing in monetary policy. But with the economy still becalmed there seems little risk of any significant inflationary surge. Also, with the pound anchored in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) the chances of prices and wages moving up substantially over the next 18 months appear small. The hints of the first base rate cut since September came at the end of a week in which gilts continued their solid performance since the election. Yields dropped by about one tenth of a percentage point along the yield curve, with a corresponding rise in prices. The 10 per cent Treasury bond payable in 1994 moved up  3/16 to 101, while the longer dated 9 per cent Treasury gilt due in 2008 rose  7/8 to 100 1/8 . The price rise occured in spite of the absorption by the market of Pounds 2.5bn worth of long-dated gilts - in the form of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due in 2017 - in the Bank's biggest gilt auction yet. The auction sold on a yield of 9.02 per cent, with a cover of 1.82 times, indicating healthy demand both from overseas and domestic institutions. With the successful auction, the Bank has found buyers for some Pounds 8.5bn worth of gilts in the first month of the 1992-1993 financial year. That is nearly a third of the Pounds 30bn total of gilts issues which it is likely to have to sell during the year, to fund the rising public borrowing requirement. The pace of funding is being continued with the Pounds 800m tranche of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bonds maturing in 1997, priced at 8.98.25 and with a gross redemption yield of 9.18 per cent. Also available from the Bank today is Pounds 200m of 2 1/2 per cent index linked stock payable in 2013, at a price of 109.04. The attractiveness of gilts to many investors since the election - in the past month 10-year yields have fallen by nearly 1 percentage point to just over 9 per cent - has been partly due to a reappraisal of sterling securities by overseas institutions. It has its roots partly in a stronger sterling. But not all of the extra demand for gilts from non-UK financial groups was triggered by the election result. In March - a poor month for gilts generally in which yields increased sharply - overseas institutions bought Pounds 844m worth of the securities, according to Bank figures. Including purchases in February, that brought overseas buying of gilts in the two months to Pounds 1.7bn - the largest two-month total since gilt funding restarted last year. But in March non-bank UK investors were much less enthusiastic. They sold Pounds 413m of the bonds, leaving the net purchases of gilts in the month at a low Pounds 447m.</p>

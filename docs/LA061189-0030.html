			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS AND ETHICS  </P> <P> Now that the national inquiry into the decade's unusually high incidence of  real and alleged moral turpitude on the part of high-profile government and  business figures has claimed two more victims (Wright and Coelho), we would do  well to examine a theme touched on by Jack Beatty ("People's Party Sold to High  Rollers," Op-Ed Page, June 2) -- namely that our present ethical framework is  too narrow, and should be expanded to include those of our collective behaviors  and attitudes that are profoundly harmful, but are not, as yet, considered  "unethical."  </P> <P> Beatty's contrast between Wright lining his pockets with relatively small  change, and congressional funding of the unnecessary and brutal killing of  Nicaraguan peasants is a case in point.  </P> <P> So is the 1981 decision of Alyeska Pipeline's managers (with the tacit assent  of the oil industry) to scrap their emergency oil spill cleanup operation. If  and when it happened, and regardless of its size, big oil's helmsmen clearly  preferred the results of the recent spill in Alaska's Prince William sound to  all other outcomes of their corporate stewardship (Exxon President W.D.  Stevens' June 1 letter notwithstanding).  </P> <P> The same can be said for General Motors' and Ford's efforts to reduce gasoline  mileage standards, even as we face suffocation under the increasing greenhouse  effect.  </P> <P> It is time to analyze such behavior in ethical terms, as well as the usual  "political" and "economic" euphemizing. As welcome and needed as the current  focus on "obeying the rules" may be, our ethical maturity requires that we go  beyond it, and look more deeply into our use of violence, and our relationship  to future generations.  </P> <P> BILL BECKER  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

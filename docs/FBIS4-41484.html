			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 Jun (TASS) -- Cuba could become the  strategic base launching Russian high technology onto Latin  American markets. This was Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets's proposal to Cuban Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Soto  [title as received], with whom he had a working meeting today.    Oleg Soskovets said Russia was interested in selling a large  batch of military helicopters to Colombia to fight the drug  mafia. In a deal like this Russia could offer Colombia very  competitive conditions. As is known, Colombia today is facing a  need for this type of aviation technology. Cuba for its part  has very close links with Latin American countries and also  knows the situation on the local market and could offer  considerable support to Russian firms trying to export their  products to Latin America. Russians have so far had to try to  operate on their own on the Latin American continent and often  suffered losses as a result, Soskovets said.    The interstate company RosCuba, set up recently, is playing  an important role in promoting cooperation between Cuba and  Russia in bringing Russian goods and technology into Latin  America, Oleg Soskovets and his colleague Lionel Soto believe.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Solvay seeks to close Austrian offshoot SOLVAY, the Belgian chemi-cals group, will today seek agreement to close down Halvic, the Austrian plastics company in which it has an 82 per cent stake. The request will come at an extraordinary meeting of Halvic's shareholders, the group confirmed yesterday. The remaining 18 per cent of the company, which makes PVC products, is held by Creditanstalt Bankverein, the Austrian bank with diversified manufacturing interests. Halvic has made losses of BFr600m (Dollars 16.6m) in the past three years in spite of efforts to reduce costs. The recession in western Europe, 'unbridled' competition from east European producers, and high production costs had made the Austrian company uncompetitive, Solvay said. Halvic's lack of size - it employs 136 workers - and a narrow domestic market for PVC products were additional handicaps. Halvic produces 60,000 tonnes of PVC annually, representing about 5 per cent of the Solvay group's 1.2m tonnes PVC production capacity. 'Halvic's closure will contribute to bring about a better balance between PVC supply and demand in Europe,' Solvay said. A senior executive vice-president at Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, said there were signs of improvement in chemicals prices. However, a rise in volumes was still not in sight, Reuter reports from Paris. This meant Rhone-Poulenc's operating profit may improve a little in 1994, he said.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Credit Suisse falls 27% to SFr1.8bn Credit Suisse, flagship bank of the CS Holding financial services group, has kicked off the big Swiss banks' interim result season with a disappointing 27 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to SFr1.76bn (Dollars 1.3bn). A 35 per cent decline in income from trading to SFr949m was accompanied by a 15 per cent drop in net interest income to SFr1.29bn. Of the bank's three main sources of earnings, only commission business showed growth, advancing 10 per cent to SFr1.35bn. The group gave no figure for net income, but said it was slightly down on the result in the comparative period dueto a less acute need for provisions for bad loans. Of the big three Swiss banks, Credit Suisse is known as the most dependent on trading of foreign exchange, precious metals, interest rate instruments and securities. Last year, with all markets rising, this was the group's largest source of income, accounting for 37 per cent of total receipts. The bank said income from foreign exchange, precious metal and banknote trading in the first half remained only slightly below last year's level, but the slump in international stock and bond markets hit hard. The decline in net interest income was attributed to narrower interest rate margins, especially in the Swiss market, and to stagnant lending volumes. Credit Suisse said interest margins were extraordinarily high in the first half of 1993. The June 30 balance sheet showed a SFr3.6bn decline in lendings to SFr120.3bn since the end of 1993, but the bank said this was due to the weakness of the US dollar. The contribution from Credit Suisse Financial Products, the bank's 50 per cent-owned derivatives house, 'matched last year's extremely good results'. But earnings of Swiss Volksbank, acquired last year by CS Holding and now consolidated with Credit Suisse, 'are not yet satisfactory'. Vontobel, the Zurich-based private banking and asset management group, reporting interim figures for the first time, posted net income of SFr19.8m in the first six months of 1994. No comparative figures were given. In the full year 1993, the group had net income of SFr40.1m. The group said it suffered a loss of SFr5.7m on trading of its own securities holdings in the first half.</p>

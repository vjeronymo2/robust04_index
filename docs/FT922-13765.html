			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally as dealers cover short positions GILT prices rallied  3/8 point as dealers rushed to cover short positions ahead of today's general election. The market was boosted by buying interest from foreign investors, suggesting that fears about sterling weakness may be subsiding. Many dealers have been running short positions ahead of the election, and so were caught short of bonds by the rally. However, some traders have been flattening their positions on the grounds that a Labour victory in the election has been largely discounted. The short end led the way, with the short sterling future on Liffe up 1/4 point, suggesting that fears of interest rate rises after the election may be subsiding. The market was also boosted by rumours of a new poll showing the Tories three points ahead of Labour. The short end of the market outperformed long-dated government bonds in France and Germany, in choppy trading conditions. French and German 10-year government bond future contracts failed to break through key resistance levels, and dealers reported some profit-taking. The OAT future on the Matif, the French futures exchange, ended down 0.10 point at 107.90, while the Bund future on Liffe in London closed a touch lower at 87.90. A speech by France's new prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, underlining a stronger emphasis on economic growth, had been largely discounted by the market, according to dealers. Improved retail demand for short-dated paper should help the market absorb this month's auction of two- and five-year bonds, dealers added. US Treasury prices edged lower yesterday on the back of the Treasury's seven-year note auction and a sharp drop in the US equity market. In late trading, the bellwether 30-year bond was  7/16 lower at 1001 7/8 , yielding 7.92 per cent, while the two-year note slid  1/32 to yield 5.28 per cent The Federal Reserve refrained from intervening in the open market, and in late trading Fed funds were changing hands at 3 3/4 per cent. Trading was dominated by the poor results of the afternoon's auction of Dollars 9.75bn in seven-year notes. Players were unsettled by the 1.93 per cent bid;cover ratio and the average yield of 7.11 per cent with a three-point tail. The short end received some support from renewed speculation that weak money supply growth and a sluggish recovery might prompt the Fed to ease monetary policy. IN the German market, the yield curve steepened further, as the Euromark contract rallied by  1/8 point. Dealers said the view that inflation had peaked and an interest cut may come sooner than had been thought, helped buoy the short end. There were further rumours, again denied, of a public sector wage settlement. JAPANESE government bond prices stabilised, helped by the stock market, which ended off its lows. The market remained nervous, though, with rumours of further problems in the banking sector. However, there was also some speculation that the Bank of Japan may speed up the process of easing interest rates.</p>

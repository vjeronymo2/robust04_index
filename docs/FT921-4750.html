			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: SIB life rule changes - Read the small print THOSE WHO want to shop around for life insurance will need to read a lot of fine print and be adept with a calculator, thanks to plans which the Securities and Investments Board will announce this week. SIB raised the hopes of the consumer lobby last autumn when it suggested that each company would have to give prospective customers an estimate of its charges over the term of a life insurance policy. It suggested that the final policy cost should be spelled out clearly in pounds. The new proposals, however, deliver much less. Lobbying by life insurers has convinced the SIB it should not insist on company specific charges. Companies will be able to project charges based on the average of charges across the industry. Thus, if you are looking for a low-cost producer, the new rules are not going to help you much. However, you may be able to glean some information about your charges by reading the table of surrender values. The new rules will require sales agents to give this to you before you sign anything. You will be entitled to know the percentage of premiums you will be refunded if you cancel during the first five years. You will also be told the 'crossover' point, which is the length of time before your return will be equal to the amount of premiums you have paid in. On a typical 25-year endowment policy, the crossover point is about 12 years. Using a calculator, you may glean more information. The SIB may require life companies to say how much charges will reduce your investment return, expressed as a percentage of cost per Pounds 100. Again, these charges will be industry-wide. But this will allow you to calculate that on a projected return of, say, Pounds 50,000 on a 25-year endowment policy, a rate of Pounds 14 per Pounds 100 means you will have paid Pounds 7,000 in charges.</p>

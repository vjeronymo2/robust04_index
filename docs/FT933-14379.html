			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation news fails to lift equity sentiment Wall Street GOOD NEWS on inflation failed to lift stock market sentiment yesterday, and prices ended little changed in thin summer trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.94 down at 3,515.44. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.89 to 448.09, while the Nasdaq composite firmed 0.80 to 708.47. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 237m shares. Although the morning's news on inflation - the June producer prices index fell by 0.3 per cent - was bullish for equities, investors appeared uninterested in the data. Dealers attributed the lack of a more positive reaction to two factors: firstly, that the markets had expected a good PPI number, so it was already priced into stocks; secondly, that investors and dealers may have been slightly disappointed at the 0.1 per cent decline in the 'core' PPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy components of the headline PPI. Analysts had been looking for a bigger decline in the core measure. Share markets may also have been disappointed by the lack of a move upwards in bond prices. By early afternoon the Treasury market had shrugged off the PPI data, and the benchmark 30-year bond was down slightly, yielding 6.625 per cent. The first batch of second-quarter corporate earnings began to arrive in earnest yesterday. Among the busiest sectors was the brokerage stocks. Merrill Lynch reported record quarterly profits of 345m, which temporarily lifted the shares to an all-time high of Dollars 86 1/8 . Profit-takers then moved in and the selling pushed Merrill's stock to an early afternoon low of Dollars 84 5/8 , at which it closed, down Dollars 1 on the day. PaineWebber, another big Wall Street securities house, also met profit-taking, losing Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 29 in spite of another strong quarter, with profits climbing 30 per cent to Dollars 59.3m. Finally, Bear Stearns firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 on news that Mr James Cayne, its president, has been appointed to the additional post of chief executive. Home Shopping Network was the market's most heavily traded stock for the second day running, rising Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 in volume of 3.9m shares as investors continued to react favourably to news of a merger offer from rival QVC Network. QVC, traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped a further Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 71 1/2 . Motorola climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 89 1/4 following the company's announcement, late on Monday, of a 57 per cent increase in second-quarter profits to Dollars 224m. Hilton Hotels retreated Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 3/4 after reporting a 17 per cent decline in second-quarter profits to Dollars 26.8m and warning that the remainder of the year would be 'challenging' for the company. Canada TORONTO stocks also traded within a narrow range and closed with mixed movements, although turnover was fairly heavy. The TSE 300 index was finally up 1.2 at 3,951.7, while declining issues held a slight edge over rises by 365 to 354. Volume totalled 59.1m shares valued at CDollars 664m. Among the sub-indices, golds lost 0.92 per cent as the New York gold bullion price eased 25 US cents an ounce.</p>

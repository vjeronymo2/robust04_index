			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: So serious about comedy - Alastair Macaulay reviews 'Huge' about Warren and Clark, two young men trying hard to become comedians. They are so serious, and Huge exposes their seriousness so well, that it is astonishing that one laughs too. For what Huge shows is the ludicrous, ruthless, world-conquering ambition that keeps Warren and Clark working on their unsuccessful little sketches in their wretched Hendon bedsit. 'I want Roy Hudd stuffed on the floor of my library . . . The day will come when, if they want 'funny', they'll have to get down on their knees to us and beg for it.' Warren and Clark are Ben Miller and Simon Godley, who co-wrote Huge with Jez Butterworth. The show, which comes to the King's Head, Islington, from the Edinburgh Fringe, is in two acts, showing the various stages of collaboration and break-up between this great comedy duo that never was. The big joke, the joke that never goes away, is their dreadful seriousness. After their first row, Warren starts to lay plans for their overwhelming assault on comedy: 'What are we gonna do? We're gonna to take 'funny', drug it, put it on the table, and have a good look at it.' This image - laying comedy out on the slab and anatomising it in its lifeless condition - says it all. I hardly like to say that Huge would be more huge - funnier and more telling  -if it were performed by more experienced comic players. Despite a doting audience on press night, Miller and Godley showed a few signs of tenseness. I also think Huge would be yet funnier if it were in yet more deadly earnest about Warren and Clark themselves and gave them more wretchedly human dimension. We know their ambition all right, but we do not know them well. But I talk of flaws only because the core of Huge is haunting. The plight of those who want, terribly, to be funny; the horror of those who long to take comedy prisoner and lock it up in solitary confinement; the misery of those who want so to conquer the world with comedy that they will cry because there will be no comedy left to conquer . . . Ye Gods. When Huge is good - most of the time - it is as chilling as it is funny. It is a joke about the huge ambitions that delude little minds - about a fantasy of comedy as power. At the King's Head, Islington, until October 31</p>

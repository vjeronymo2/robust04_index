			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Arts: Santa Fe Opera NOW 35 years old, the Santa Fe Opera long ago established traditions for its short summer seasons: a strong company of young and youngish American singers, a repertory including at least one brave new work each year - and plastic raincoats to shield those in the uncovered part of the theatre from the desert storms of New Mexico. This year the new piece was Hans-Jurgen von Bose's The Sorrows of Young Werther, which makes a fitting choice for a festival that has already given five Henze operas their American premieres. Born in 1953, von Bose belongs to the generation of German young Romantics who have looked more to Henze than to Stockhausen as a model, and The Sorrows of Young Werther is very much a German young Romantic piece. Von Bose wrote it when he was just past 30 - it had its first performance at Schwetzingen in 1986 - and it evinces a young man's ready identification with the subject of Goethe's novel. Just as Werther is so preoccupied with his feelings that he excludes events from his mind (finally to the point of suicide, the ultimate exclusion of events), so von Bose seems concerned above all with his responses to the book, which becomes, in his words, 'a strange, remote idyll, something partly nostalgic, partly threatening and always very fragile, on the verge of vanishing, and with a touch of dreamlike escapism'. The opera is an idealised landscape of the mind, a German romantic landscape featuring Holderlin and Lenz along with Goethe in the libretto, Schubert, Schumann and Mahler further back than Henze in the chain of musical antecedents, and treasuring of youthful sentiment and feeling for nature. More specifically, von Bose's identification is with the hero, who is on-stage almost throughout the two acts, nearly always as the focus of attention. The opera begins from him, from his voice unaccompanied, then gradually joined by a 'madrigal quintet' of unseen singers who echo his thoughts and feelings, and by a solo oboe as the piece starts to lift off. It is with him, too, that the music feels. When his suddenly-beloved Lotte tells him she's engaged, high woodwinds and brass yelp and scowl in agony; when she gives him leave to visit her the next day, the pit wells up with jubilant bell sounds. The language is one of emotional endorsement, of coursing sympathy. It follows that the piece needs a Werther who will compel belief and never let the precious fabric tear. In Kurt Ollman, Santa Fe has just the man: a baritone of radiant candour and ease, using his natural talents with all a lieder artist's care to weld word and tone into the singleness of lyrical declamation. Nobody else has much of an opportunity: Werther is not interested in other people except as analogues of himself, and von Bose goes further than Goethe in diminishing the lesser characters. Albert, Lotte's fiance and later husband, becomes a bogeyman who pops up to curtail any dalliance with Werther. Even Lotte herself is just a vivacious tease: all we can see and hear is Werther's image of her, though projected with agility and brightness here by Charlotte Hellekant. The characters who come more fully alive are those in whom Werther discerns some shape of himself: the mad Heinrich (a high tenor part, made into graceful flight by Jeffrey Reynolds), and Peasant who kills for love (Mark Thomsen, a necessarily stouter tenor, but still light and fresh, in the nature of the work). George Manahan was the conductor, Francesca Zambello the director, and Bruno Schwngal the designer. A blue wall, right across the stage, provided a near, wide space in which Werther and his imaginings could wander, while a central pair of doors opened out occasionally on other scenes: the music room of Lotte, Albert and domestic contentment, or emblematic exteriors of summer trees and winter snow. The work's fluidity - its succession to two dozen scenes in little more that an hour and half was well matched. So too its self-sustaining energy. The season's other new productions were a broad, unsurprising Don Giovanni, lit only by some of the singers (Stanfords Olsen unashamedly big in Ottavio's arias, Ann Panagulais a nicely precise and fresh, lively Zerlina), and a rather more alarming version of the The Beggar's Opera. Paul Steinberg's set for The Beggar's Opera confines the action within a long, narrowing space between two high, windowless walls of brick, luridly painted in cream and crimson. It has the atmosphere of an underground station, or a public lavatory: an appropriate place in which the black creatures of Christopher Alden's production can gather and gloat. These people, dressed in a hybrid of 18th century and modern costume recalling some of Richard Jones's productions, take nothing seriously. At almost every moment, there is the risk that the whole thing could run away into mocking laughter. This is deeply untrustworthy theatre, though lucky in Timothy Nolen's Peachum as its presiding genius. He smiles or snarls at anyone's effort to interpose a moral value, and yet his good humour, like James Michael McGuire's rude heroic health as Macheath, gives the sign of a benevolence somewhere down there in the murk. Sante Fe's less disturbing comedies were two revivals, Der Rosenkavalier and Die Fledermaus, both conducted by the company's director, John Crosby. Die Fledermaus was provincial, but Der Rosenkavalier had the glamour of an outstanding Oktavian from Susanne Mentzer. She does not have much the look of a lad, but, with a vocal accuracy that seals richness to brilliance, she projects a musical character of sunny confidence. It is also clear that words and meaning are as important to her as glorious melody. Ashley Putnam makes a sweet Marschallin, restrained to sweetness by the care she needs to control her vibrato. Eric Halfvarson is Ochs to a tee, every phrase, every gesture smartly tuned, a dog for opportunism and the ability to bounce back. Otherwise this company's reputation for Richard Strauss needs polishing.</p>

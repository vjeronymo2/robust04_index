			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Rules for Determining Country of Origin of Goods"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Appendix </H5>   Approved by a resolution of the Council of Chiefs of  States of the Commonwealth of Independent States on Rules for  Determining the Country of Origin of Commodities of 24 December  1993    Rules for Determining the Country of Origin of Commodities    The present rules shall be in effect with respect to  commodities originating from the CIS states and being circulated  in trade among these states.    For purposes of the present rules:    a) the term "CIS state" shall be understood to mean CIS  states that have signed the Agreement on Cooperation in the Area  of Foreign Economic Activity (15 May 1992, Tashkent);    b) the term "country of origin of commodities" shall mean  the  CIS state in which the commodity was completely produced or  subjected to sufficient processing. For application of the  criterion of sufficient processing it shall be possible to apply  the cumulative principle of origin, that is, when there is  sequential processing of commodities in the CIS states these  states shall be regarded as a single whole for purposes of  determining origin;    c) the term "criterion of sufficient processing" shall mean  the term according to which the commodity in whose production  two or more countries participate shall be considered to  originate from the country in which it was subjected to the last  essential processing sufficient for imparting to the commodity  its typical feature;    d) the term "customs control" shall mean the totality of  measures taken by national customs organs for purposes of  ensuring observance of national legislation in customs matters  and also national legislation and international agreements,  control over whose implementation is the responsibility of  customs organs;    e) the term "commodities" shall mean any mobile property  including thermal, electric, and other kinds of energy  transported across the customs border;    f) the term "commodity classification" shall mean the  Commodity Classification of Foreign Economic Activity (TN VED)  used in the CIS states based on the Harmonized System of  Description and Codification of Commodities and the combined  tariff-statistical classification of the EC.    The procedure for determining the country of origin of  commodities shipped onto the customs territory of the CIS states  from third countries and shipped to third countries from the  states shall be regulated by national legislation of the CIS  states.    1. The country of origin of a commodity shall be considered  to be the state where the commodity was completely produced or  subjected to sufficient processing.    2. The following commodities shall be considered to have  been  fully produced in the given country:    a) minerals extracted on its territory or in its territorial  waters, on its continental shelf and in the seas if the country  has exclusive rights to the development of these minerals;    b) vegetable products raised and harvested on its territory;    c) living animals born and raised in it;    d) products obtained in this country from raising animals  there;    e) products of hunting, fishing, and sea fishing;    f) products of sea fishing caught and/or produced in the  world ocean by ships of the given country or ships leased  (chartered) by it;    g) secondary raw material and wastes which are the result of  production and other operations conducted in the given country;    h) high technology products obtained in open space on space  ships belonging to the given country or leased by it;    i) commodities produced in the given country exclusively  from  products mentioned in subpoints "a"-"h" of point 2.    3. When two or more countries participate in the production  of a commodity, the origin of the commodity shall be determined  according to the criterion of "sufficient processing."    4. The criterion of "sufficient processing" may be  reflected:    a) by a rule that requires a change in the tariff position  of  the corresponding commodity classification with a list of  exceptions: (Footnote 1) (The list of exceptions may include: a)  a list of production or technological operations which, although  they lead to a change in the commodity position, are not  considered a sign of sufficient processing or are considered  such only with observance of certain conditions;    b) a list of production or technological operations which,  although they do not lead to a change in the tariff position,  are considered a sign of sufficient processing with the  observance of certain conditions.    The conditions mentioned in subpoints "a" and "b" may  pertain  both to operations conducted with the commodity and to the rule  of "ad valorem share.")    b) a list of production or technological processes either  adequate or inadequate for the commodity to be considered as  originating from the country where these processes took place;    c) the rule of "ad valorem share" when the percentage share  of the value of the utilized materials or added value reaches a  fixed level in the price of the franco-plant delivered commodity.    5. In the event that the criterion of origin of the  commodity  is not especially stipulated with respect to specific  commodities or a specific country (countries), the general rule  shall be applied whereby a commodity is considered to have been  subjected to sufficient processing if there has been a change in  the commodity position (classification code of the commodity) on  the Commodity Classification at the level of any of the first  four indicators.    The following shall be regarded as not meeting the criterion  of sufficient processing:    a) operations for providing for preservation of the  commodities during storage or transportation;    b) operations for preparing the commodities for sale and  transportation (breaking down batches, forming shipments,  sorting, repackaging);    c) simple assembly operations;    d) switching of commodities (components) without imparting  to  the product obtained characteristics that are significantly  different from its initial ones;    e) a combination of two or more of the aforementioned  operations;    f) slaughter of livestock.    6. In the event that the criterion of "sufficient  processing"  is reflected through the ad valorem share, the value indicators  shall be calculated:    a) for imported materials--according to the customs value,  that is, the value subject to customs duties when shipped in (on  the basis of the SIF [expansion not indicated]) or in the event  that their origin is unknown--at the price established for the  first sale on the territory of the country where the production  is being carried out;    b) for finished commodities--at the price franco-plant or  export price of the seller.    7. Objects in disassembled or unassembled form shipped in  several batches when because of production or transportation  conditions it is impossible to ship them as one batch (Footnote  2) (This rule shall also be applied in cases where the batch has  been broken down into several by mistake or because of incorrect  addressing.) must be regarded, at the request of the importer,  as a single object from the standpoint of determining origin.  (Footnote 3) (The conditions for the application of this rule  shall be: preliminary notification of the customs office where  it is shipped in of the breakdown of a disassembled or  unassembled commodity into several branches with an indication  of the reasons for this breakdown, a detailed specification of  the contents of each batch referring to the TN VED, the value,  and the country of origin of the commodities included in each  batch; the delivery of all batches from one country and by one  exporter; the shipment of all batches through one customs  office; the delivery of all batches of commodities by a date not  exceeding six months from the date of the first dispatch.)    8. For purposes of determining the origin of commodities,  the  origin of thermal and electric energy, machines, equipment, and  instruments used for their production shall not be taken into  account.    9. A commodity is considered to have originated from the  country of export only if this commodity not only meets the  criterion of origin and other conditions established by the  present Rules but also is purchased directly from an enterprise  or firm registered in keeping with the established procedure in  the exporting country and is imported through direct dispatch  from this country to the importing country.    The requirement of direct shipment shall also be met by  commodities transported through the territory of one or several  of the countries as a result of geographical, transportation,  technical, or economic factors and also when they are  temporarily shipped into or warehoused on the territory of these  countries under the condition that the commodities remain the  whole time under the customs control of the country of transit.    Additionally, the rules of direct dispatch are complied with  by commodities purchased by an importer at exhibits or trade  fairs under the condition that these commodities were not used  for purposes other than exhibits after dispatch to the  exhibition or trade fair and remained under customs control  during the course of the exhibition or trade fair.    10. When certifying the origin of the commodity in the given  CIS state it is necessary to submit to the customs organs of the  country into which it is shipped a declaration-certificate  (hereinafter referred to as certificate) concerning the origin  of the commodity.    11. When commodities are exported from the CIS states the  certificate of origin shall be issued by an organ of the country  of origin of the commodity authorized in compliance with  national legislation.    The CIS states shall exchange samples of stamps of organs  and  signatures of individuals authorized to endorse the  certificates. The certificates shall be considered invalid  without the aforementioned samples and the preferences  envisioned by agreements on trading conditions shall not apply.    12. The certificate must contain the following necessary  information about the commodity for which it is issued:    a) name and address of exporter;    b) name and address of importer;    c) means of transportation and route of travel (to the  extent  that this is known);    d) the number of places and kinds of packaging and a  description of the commodity containing all the information  necessary to identify the commodity;    e) weight brutto and netto. (Footnote 4) (These indicators  may be replaced by others such, for example, as the number of  units or volume when the weight of the commodity changes  significantly during transportation or when these units are  regularly applied to the given type of commodity.)    13. The certificate of origin must clearly state that the  given commodity originates in the corresponding country, that  is, it must contain:    a) a written declaration from the exporter to the effect  that  the commodity meets the corresponding criterion of origin;    b) a written certification from the authorized organ that  issued the certificate to the effect that the information  presented by the exporter on the certificate is accurate.    14. The certificate of origin shall be submitted to customs  organs in typed form without corrections in the Russian language.    15. The certificate of origin shall be submitted along with  the freight customs declaration and other documents necessary  when filling out customs documentation.    16. In the event of the loss of the certificate of origin an  officially notarized duplicate (copy) shall be accepted.    17. On a certificate of origin for small batches of  commodities (valued at up to $5,000) the exporter may declare  the country of origin of the commodity on the shipping invoice  or other accompanying documents attached to the commodity.    18. If there are doubts about the accuracy of the  certificate  of origin or the information contained in it the customs organs  shall apply to the authorized organizations that endorse the  certificate or other authorized organs of the country indicated  as the country of origin of the commodities with a justified  request to provide additional or clarifying information.    19. The commodity shall not be regarded as having originated  in a given country until the proper confirmation of origin or  the requested information is provided.    20. As a general rule, failure to provide the properly  filled  out certificate of origin or information about the origin shall  not be considered grounds for refusing to let the freight pass.    The customs office may refuse to let freight pass only if  there are sufficient grounds to assume that it originated in a  country whose commodities must not be allowed into the country  in compliance with international agreements in effect for this  state and/or its national legislation.    Taking into account the provisions of the second paragraph  of  the present point, commodities whose origin has not been  reliably established are allowed to be shipped into the country  with the payment of customs duties at the maximum rates of the  customs tariff of the country into which they are being shipped.    21. Most favored nation or preferential conditions may be  applied to commodities indicated in the third paragraph of point  20 upon receipt of the proper certification of their origin no  later than a year after the delivery (output) of the commodity.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-066-08A>      Figure </FIG>     [box, p 17]  <H5>  Resolution on Changing Points 9 and 10 of the Rules for </H5> Determining the Country of Origin of Commodities    In connection with the conclusion of the Agreement on the  Creation of a Free Trade Zone and the need to change Points 9  and 10 of the Rules for Determining the Country of Origin of  Commodities of 24 September 1993, the heads of the governments  of the states participating in the Commonwealth of Independent  States    have resolved:    1. Points 9 and 10 shall be worded as follows:    "9. A commodity shall be considered have originated on the  customs territory of a state participating in the Agreement on  the Creation of a Free Trade Zone if it meets the criteria for  origin established by the present Rules and is acquired by a  resident of one of the states participating in the Agreement on  the Creation of a Free Trade Zone.    "10. As certification of the origin of a commodity on the  customs territory of a state participating in the Agreement on  the Creation of a Free Trade Zone it is necessary to submit to  the customs organs of the state to which it is shipped a  declaration-certificate of the origin of the commodity (form  ST-1 is attached) issued by an authorized organ of the country  of origin participating in the Agreement on the Creation of a  Free Trade Zone."    2. The rules for determining the country of origin of a  commodity, taking into account the changes that have been made,  shall be applied only for participants in the Agreement on the  Creation of a Free Trade Zone.

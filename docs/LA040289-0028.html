			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH STYLE: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> THE AT&amp;T LOGO  </P> <P> EVIDENTLY, THE magistrate fancied himself an art director. After the breakup of  AT&amp;T in 1983, in which the portion of the conglomerate that kept the  AT&amp;T name separated from the regional telephone companies, U.S. District  Judge Harold Green ordered the new, smaller AT&amp;T to stop using the familiar  bell-in-a-circle logo. In stepped designer Saul Bass, of Los Angeles-based Saul  Bass/Herb Yeager Associates, with a new company logo. Bass had previously  created symbols for corporate giants such as Warner Communications (the  blobby-looking "W"), Quaker Oats and Coca-Cola.  </P> <P> In 1969, Bass had spruced up the old bell-in-circle trademark (nearly as  ancient as Alexander Graham Bell's invention itself) with a cleaner, crisper  bell symbol. Intended to counter a public perception of old Ma Bell as stodgy  and stuffy, his redesign was a stunning success. Though the existing logo had  boasted an enviable public recognition rating of 79%, Bass' redesign, two years  later, rated an astonishing 93%. Bass put that figure in perspective in a 1985  interview: "United Airlines, whose symbol we also designed, is very pleased  with 46% public awareness."  </P> <P> The pre-divestiture Bell logo was a tough act to follow, but Bass' lightning,  it seems, has struck twice. The new AT&amp;T logo comprises a blue sphere with  white striations of differing width and curvature, seemingly pulsating on the  printed page. The logo resembles a globe with lines of latitude -- or are they  telephone cables? No matter, it makes an apt image for a firm that transmits  electronic information around the world.  </P> <P> Beyond such literal connotations, Bass' symbol shrewdly plays on our  subconscious associations. For, as graphic designer Veronica Napoles writes in  Corporate Identity Design, consumers associate round or oval symbols with  organic, nurturing qualities. Bass' AT&amp;T logo didn't lose a Ma Bell, it  gained an earth mother.  </P></p>

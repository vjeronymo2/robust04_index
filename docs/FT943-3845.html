			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Profits ahead at Pacific Dunlop Pacific Dunlop, the Melbourne-based industrial conglomerate, has reported a 16.8 per cent rise in profits after tax and abnormal items to ADollars 303.5m (USDollars 226m) for the year to June. The result was scored on sales up by 9 per cent, to ADollars 7.07bn, and included a pre-tax abnormal item of ADollars 4.88m, down from ADollars 9.53m previous-ly. Earnings per share, before abnormal items, were up by 13.6 per cent to 28.4 cents. The final dividend is 11.5 cents a share against 11 cents, making a total for the year of 22.5 cents compared with 21.5 cents. All five main industrial divisions - ranging from automotive products to healthcare - showed advances but the largest group, building and construction, only saw a marginal increase in operating profits, from ADollars 148m to ADollars 149m. Pacific Dunlop said the results were 'creditable in very competitive markets'. On a geographical basis, Australia accounted for ADollars 333m of operating profits, compared with ADollars 330m, and south-east Asia and New Zealand chipped in ADollars 96m, largely unchanged from the previous year's ADollars 94m. A bigger advance came in the US, contributing ADollars 133m against ADollars 103m, and Europe, with ADollars 25m against ADollars 16m. Shell Australia is to go ahead with the flotation of its gold and other mineral assets as a separate company. A prospectus is to be lodged by the end of this month. It expects to raise ADollars 400m from the float. The new unit will take in a 30 per cent interest in the Boddington gold mine in Western Australia, full ownership of the Union Reefs gold mine and the Sunrise Dam gold project, and 40 per cent of the Central Desert joint venture.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eurobanana poses threat to Gatt talks THE EUROBANANA is threatening to emerge as the agricultural commodity which puts the definitive skids under the already very shaky Uruguay Round world trade talks. On Wednesday, the European Commission will attempt to decide whether to make bananas grown in the Community's outlying territories and former colonies subject to growing competition from much cheaper bananas from Central and South America. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is supervising the five year-old Uruguay Round, requires all farm products to have import tariffs, which would then be reduced during the next six years if a deal on trade liberalisation is reached by the Easter deadline Gatt has set. The EC has not set a tariff for the so-called 'dollar bananas'. The Community limits the entry of these predominantly Central American and Colombian bananas, and in addition charges a 20 per cent quota on them except in Germany. That is to protect high cost producers in the West Indies, and overseas territories like Guadeloupe and Martinique belonging to France, or Spain's Canary Islands. The Commission - and the Council of Ministers (of the 12) - is divided between those who want a derogation, or temporary exemption, from the Gatt rules, and those who want to set a very high tariff on dollar bananas, to allow protected banana producers time to adjust. The tariff advocates are calling for a duty of Ecu353 per tonne - the difference between the highest import price from EC banana zones and the lowest import price from the dollar zone in 1986-88 - on top of the standard 20 per cent duty. So far, however, only about one third of the 17-strong Commission appears ready to agree. France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece seem certain to oppose the proposal. Of the 3.3m tonnes of bananas the EC consumed in 1990, 2m tonnes came from the dollar zone, with the rest split evenly between EC output and imports from former colonies. Two of every three bananas eaten in the UK come from the Windward Islands. The EC faces a genuine conflict of obligations. Under a banana protocol to the Lome convention through which the Community assists mainly African and Caribbean countries, it has treaty obligations to preserve the advantages enjoyed by their banana exports. It is also obliged by next year to introduce a single market in the fruit under the '1992 programme'.</p>

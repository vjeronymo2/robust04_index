			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Greenspan takes up cudgels for the Fed: Central bank chief's defence of monetary policy MR Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, took to the barricades yesterday to defend his monetary policy against several US senators who say interest rates were cut too late. He told the Senate banking committee that the Fed's recent reductions in interest rates 'should help to shore up the economy and, coming in the context of a solid trend toward lower inflation, have contributed to laying a foundation for a sustained expansion of the US economy.' Structural problems in the economy have been 'more severe and more enduring than many had previously thought,' he said. Nevertheless, the Fed's monetary policy had succeeded in 'fending off the classic 'bust' phase that seemed invariably to follow speculate booms in pre-second world war economic history. 'More rapid or more forceful easing actions more than likely would have been interpreted by market participants as risking a resurgence of inflation. That would have led to higher, rather than lower, long-term interest rates.' Mr Greenspan had to endure strong criticism from Senator Donald Riegle, the banking committee's Democratic chairman, who attacked the Fed's inability to meet its monetary growth targets. 'I think the time has come for the Fed to admit that monetary policy alone is not sufficient to deal with our economic problems,' Senator Riegle said. But Republican senators, as well as some Democrats, argued the Fed had cut interest rates as low as it could, and that what was needed was a serious effort to cut the federal budget deficit. Senator Jake Garn of Utah, the banking committee's senior Republican, said: 'While you might have done some of the things you did in terms of interest rates sooner, you can't hardly come down any lower with the discount rate.' Mr Greenspan said structural improvements in the US economy - the rebuilding of banks' capital, the strengthening of household finances, the restructuring of business balance sheets - would be helped if the federal government made significant progress towards bringing its budget into balance. This would, he said, release savings for productive private investment and brighten further the prospects for continued improvement in living standards. Mr Greenspan said a large majority of his fellow board members expected economic expansion to strengthen moderately, from a range of 2 1/4 -2 3/4 per cent this year to a range of 2 3/4 -3 per cent in 1993. This should help bring the unemployment rate down to between 7 1/4 and 7 1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, and 6 1/2 and 7 per cent at the end of 1993. He warned that the necessary structural adjustments after the overbuilding, overbuying and overleveraging of the 1980s would continue to hamper growth, although the situation had improved. 'Last year I characterised this process as the economy struggling against a 50 mile an hour headwind. Today its speed is decidedly less, but still appreciable,' he said. Mr Greenspan said the Fed was making progress in understanding changes in financial behaviour that have contributed to the slow growth of the M2 and M3 broad monetary aggregates. He said households had been restructuring balance sheets, channelling cash flow away from monetary deposits and into other assets, or paying off debts. This process, although it had powerfully depressed the growth of the money supply, had exerted a less powerful constraint on spending. Instead, the velocity of circulation of the monetary aggregates, especially M2, had increased. If this continued, Mr Greenspan said, the Fed would have to reassess its target ranges for monetary growth. In the meantime the Fed had decided to maintain its current ranges of 2 1/2 -6 1/2 per cent for M2, 1-5 per cent for M3 and 4 1/2 -8 1/2 per cent for debt.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: HALLOWEEN A YEARLY TREAT FOR OINGO BOINGO IN O.C.;  </P> <P> PREVIEW: AS ALWAYS, IRVINE MEADOWS WILL BE PACKED FOR THE LOS ANGELES-BASED  BAND'S ANNUAL APPEARANCE.  </P> <P> Just as Halloween is a time for kids to indulge their fantasies and become  Presidents, Transformer robots and such, so it is that the reasonably  successful members of Oingo Boingo get to become megastars for a brief span  each witching season. The long-lived Los Angeles-based group rarely hits the  charts and typically plays mid-size concert halls even in its home town, yet  many more-famous acts would be hard pressed to sell the 30,000 seats Boingo has  for this year's annual two-night Halloween bash at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> "Oh yeah, it's personally my favorite holiday of the year," said Boingo bassist  John Avila. "I think we are one of the perfect Halloween bands, and Irvine is  the biggest night of the year for us."  </P> <P> While he largely credits the sold-out shows Friday and Saturday to the group's  years of building up a county following, Avila said the Halloween lure of  Boingo's comically macabre dance music isn't limited to the local geography.  </P> <P> "Orange County has always been a big Boingo area, but we've found that a lot of  people come from out of town. It's become a real tradition. In San Francisco we  had people telling us, 'We'll see you in Irvine.' We just heard the same thing  in Salt Lake City, 'See you in Irvine. We're flying in for that show.' "  </P> <P> If the shift between the band's everyday level of success and the Olympian  status bestowed on it yearly at Halloween weren't enough, Avila and drummer  Johnny (Vatos) Hernandez have yet another identity to contend with. Along with  non-Boingo guitarist Michael Tovar, the pair make up Food for Feet, a band that  has been causing its own ruckus this year on the Southland club scene. The  group's self-titled EP, released recently on Orange County's Dr. Dream Records,  has been garnering airplay on KROQ and more than 100 other stations nationwide.  The trio will appear on Nov. 9 at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> The 32-year-old bassist describes Food for Feet's music as "very aggressive,  loud and hard. You'll hear influences from all different parts of the world:  King Sunny Ade would be the main one on the African side, and there are Latin  influences too, along with the obvious love for rock. And it is music for feet.  Food for Feet is really what the music is all about."  </P> <P> Guitarist Tovar has worked with performers from Otis Blackwell (composer of  several Elvis hits) to the German progressive band Triumvirat. Avila's credits  include work with that band and with East-L.A.'s El Chicano, while Hernandez's  pre-Boingo credits range from be-bop jazz to Helen Reddy.  </P> <P> Although Boingo front-man Danny Elfman's busy schedule scoring films (his  recent work includes "Batman," "Midnight Run" and "Scrooged" and he is  presently scoring a Clive Barker film) has allowed Avila and Hernandez the time  to get Food for Feet moving this year, it is far from a new band.  </P> <P> "Johnny, Michael and I have known each other from way before Boingo, from when  we were all growing up in San Gabriel. The three of us all liked to get  together to play, and we started out jamming in each other's garages. We  started working as a group in 1983, playing underground clubs on the eastside  and Hollywood."  </P> <P> Along with Elfman's recent film projects allowing them more time, Avila also  feels 1989 was fated to be Food for Feet's year.  </P> <P> "I think in the first two years we played as a band, we made $85 each, total,  and we're talking about some 50 gigs to make that amount. The way we looked at  it, we were playing for free. That was the exciting part, the attitude of 'If  you're not going to pay us anything, then we're going to play anything we  want.'  </P> <P> "At that time, when we'd be packing up to leave a club at 2:30 in the morning,  our little joke was to always say, 'Well, it could be a hit in '89.' 'How much  money did we make? $5? Well, it could still be a hit in '89.'  </P> <P> "Then '89 actually comes around. The band had gotten a lot more focused, and  was sounding a lot better. We'd played almost a whole decade, and we thought it  was finally time to document it. That became the EP."  </P> <P> Avila doesn't feel that Oingo Boingo's Orange County popularity had any bearing  on Food for Feet signing with a county label.  </P> <P> Avila admits that his and Hernandez's being in both groups has caused some  confusion. "Because we're doing Food for Feet there's this rumor that Boingo is  breaking up, and that couldn't be further from the truth. Both bands are alive  and well."  </P> <P> It remains to be seen how alive and well Avila and Hernandez will be after this  coming year, when both band's schedules promise to heat up. Boingo has an album  due out early next year (new songs "Lights Go Out," "Peel Away the Skin" and  "Breakdown" will probably be featured in this weekend's shows) and is planning  video projects and a large tour to follow.  </P> <P>  Oingo Boingo will play Friday and Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre,  8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Friday's show is sold out. Lawn seating for  Saturday's performance (at 8 p.m.) is still available for $19.50. Parking: $5.  Information: (714) 855-6111.  </P> <P> </P></p>

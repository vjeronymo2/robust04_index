Shprygin, director of the Center for Studying </F> the Price and Market Situation ("Tsenakor" EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN)  and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Economic  Sciences: "Price and Finance Ratios: Economic Regulation Is  Required"]    [Text] The steps recently taken by the government to  improve the economic situation and strengthen the social  orientation of the reforms inspire hope that they will finally  begin to work. However, one must take into consideration the  fact that the actual state of affairs in the national economy is  an extremely complicated one -- if not to say, becoming worse.  During the last two years or more, the reforms have raised more  questions than they have provided answers and positive solutions.    As before, the main question is: When will a change for the  better finally arrive -- what must be done to overcome the  drawn-out crisis? Its solution is directly connected with  eliminating the disproportions that have recently intensified in  the national economy, lowering inflation rates and strengthening  the reforms' social orientation.    Estimates of the future show that if appropriate adjustments  are not made in the reforms, the decline in production during  1994 will be at least 10 percent with an inflation of 1000-1200  percent. Taking into consideration the impending revaluation of  capital stock and the increase in transportation costs and  prices in the raw-material branches and fuel and energy complex,  inflation could increase:    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Inflation, %                                                               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Consumer basket c-|December 1993     |January 1994      |February 1994 (fo-|  |alculated for:    |                  |                  |recast)           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |19 goods and serv-|18                |20                |23                |  |ices              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |72 goods and serv-|23                |25                |28                |  |ices              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The fact that the growth in prices, which has been  accompanied by a reduction in investments in industry,  significantly -- approximately 1.6-fold --outstrips the  increases in prices in agriculture evokes special alarm. This  creates the threat not only of a protracted decline in  production but also of a further intensification of price and  exchange disproportions between these two very important sectors  of the national economy. The situation in this area really  resembles the celebrated 1922-1923 price discrepancy. Whereas  the gap between the prices of industrial and agricultural  products was 340 percent in favor of industry during 1922 and  1923, which cheapened the labor of the peasants and was one of  the main reasons leading later on to a food dearth and the  unwillingness of peasants to sell their products, the gap has  reached 400 percent during the two years of these reforms  (1992-1993). Thus, the gap in the price discrepancy between  these branches has become even larger than it was during the  crisis year of 1923. It could reach a full 500 percent in 1994.  Today, for a peasant to be able to acquire the same amount of  industrial products that he did in 1991, he must sell fivefold  more crops than in 1991; to acquire tractors and grain  harvesting equipment -- 20-fold more.    A forecast[.sup]1[/] of prices for the most important  goods, which the Center for Studying the Price and Market  Situation ("Tsenakor" EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN) made, reveals the  following price index changes during the second quarter of 1994  without considering the increase in expenditures connected with  the rise in costs of the capital stock in industry as a result  of its revaluation:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gasoline                              |1.5-1.7                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bar rolled stock                      |1.4-1.6                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Steel pipes                           |1.7-1.8                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mineral fertilizers                   |1.6-1.9                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tires of all brands                   |1.3-1.8                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Row-crop tractors                     |1.2-1.4                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Grain loaders                         |1.2-1.4                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Animal feed                           |1.5-1.8                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rye bread                             |1.3-1.6                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sunflower-seed oil                    |1.4-1.5                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cereals of all types                  |1.3-1.5                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Meat of all types                     |1.4-1.7                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The revaluation of capital stock will cause an increase in  costs in industry and, consequently, the price gap with  agriculture will increase even more.    Today, agriculture is losing approximately 45 percent of the  national income created in it because of the price discrepancy.  It is not surprising that many farms in such oblasts as  Vladimir, Orel, Voronezh, Tambov, Kursk, and Bryansk did not  acquire a single tractor during 1992-1993 as a result of this  economic policy. On the whole, the agricultural capital-worker  ratio has decreased by 36 percent and labor productivity by  almost 20 percent during these years. Thus, the disproportions  in exchange relations between industry and agriculture have  reached their critical limit. Steady production cuts in many  food items and their supplanting with imported food have begun.    The saturation of the Russian market with domestic food was  approximately 82 percent in 1993, including 75 percent of the  1991 level for animal husbandry products. This means that at  least a fifth of the domestic market has given way to foreign  commodity producers and we are expanding the economies of other  states by curtailing our production. In order to prevent a  further worsening of the state of affairs in agriculture, the  state should intervene in the economic relations between  agriculture and other sectors of the national economy and move  to their regulation. However, this does not mean that one must  without fail move to increasing purchase prices everywhere in  order to eliminate the price disproportions arising between  industry and agriculture. Under the conditions that have been  created, any price increase for one product leads to inflation  throughout the price system. It is advisable to eliminate the  price disproportions between these sectors of the national  economy not only by increasing purchase prices but also by  reducing the prices for industrial products going to  agriculture. For many industrial commodities, this can be done  without pain to their producers since their profitability varies  from 25 to 100 percent and more. In this case, the overall level  of purchase prices can be increased by not more than 10 percent  and subsidies to agriculture reduced to the minimum. They should  be retained only for the production of a limited number of basic  agricultural products.    Large disproportions in exchange relations have also arisen  within industry itself between the processing and raw-material  branches. The discrepancy in prices between these branches  reached 180 percent in favor of the processing branches during  the two years of reforms. As a result, coal and oil-extracting  industry enterprises, for example, must today sell 1.8-fold more  of their products than they sold in 1991 in order to acquire the  same amount of equipment that they got in 1991. It is not  surprising that labor productivity is falling in these branches  and that many enterprises have not modernized for a long time  and are on the verge of bankruptcy. Raw-material branch  enterprises themselves are not interested in acquiring domestic  equipment, preferring to sell their products abroad and purchase  equipment there.    Serious disproportions have arisen in the fuel and energy  complex branches. As is known, our industry, especially power  engineering, has been mainly oriented for a long time toward the  use of coal. All the major price and exchange ratios in the  national economy have been built on the relationship to the  price of coal. However, the liberalization of prices at one fell  swoop led to upsetting the price ratios, which were keeping  their balance, and the production processes, which were formed  considering this. All coal-using enterprises -- and they  represent approximately 70 percent of the total number of  enterprises -- were placed in a difficult financial situation  and forced to feverishly switch their production processes over  to the use of other energy sources or shut down.    Thus, the question of equalizing price ratios on the basis  of  regulating exchange relations between branches should be the  pivot for all the states' future economic policy. When  consistently following a policy of economic liberalization and  expansion of the branch's use of market relations, the state  should be concerned about their long-term economic interests.  That is why it is necessary to move toward regulating (including  primarily economic regulation) the most important price ratios  for the purposes of balancing economic growth and adjusting the  equivalent exchange of work results between branches and  producers. This can be done on the basis of price agreements  concluded through the mediation and under the control of state  bodies between enterprises (branches) participating in the  output of end products. These agreements can be fully concluded  for technological chains: TEK [fuel and energy complex] -  transportation - TEK, TEK - metallurgy - machine building - TEK,  etc. In this case, the low prices for services, for example,  transport for the fuel and energy complex, can be compensated  for by the distribution of fuel and energy to transport at low  prices.    Financial policy also needs changes. The strict monetarist  financial policy, on whose basis rests the idea of balancing the  budget by systematic delays in paying wages, all-embracing price  liberalization and high taxes, is already incapable of improving  the financial and monetary system. It is losing its economic  sense more and more, acquiring a narrow departmental nature and,  like any departmental policy in the final analysis, is beginning  to be at variance with the interests of expanding the national  economy.    Without a doubt, one cannot improve the economy without a  balanced budget. However, one should not reduce financial policy  only to the achievement of this goal because the budget can also  be balanced by organizing the disproportions which are hurling  the national economy back dozens of years and worsening the  population's social condition. That is why the problem of  balancing the budget cannot be solved by any means -- by a  landslide curtailment of production and the bankruptcy of an  enormous number of enterprises -- since physical production is  the main source for the receipt of the state's financial assets.  However, the financial policy, which has been recently followed,  has also contributed a great deal to this. Thus, the country's  industrial potential decreased by 34 percent during the two  years of the reforms and approximately 40,000 enterprises were  chronically insolvent during 1993. As a result of the strict  monetarist financial policy, which is limiting the issuing of  credits, and the establishment of high taxes, which have led to  a production curtailment, the sources for replenishing the  budget have been reduced by almost 20 percent. The country has  thereby been deprived of significant financial assets and the  financial and monetary system itself has been destabilized even  more.    Calculations show that with the further conducting of the  selected financial policy in 1994, approximately 20 percent of  all coal mines and metallurgical complex enterprises, 28 percent  of machine building enterprises, 16 percent of the timber  industry, 22 percent of printing plants, 32 percent of light  industry, and 21 percent of the food industry could become  bankrupt. This once again testifies that the financial policy  should be changed. Its meaning should consist not of limiting  the issuing of credits in every way possible and searching for  additional taxes but of stimulating the expansion of production  by the sensible use of existing financial assets, thereby  contributing to expanding the base for new financial revenue for  the budget. Entrepreneurs, who have invested their assets in  expanding production facilities that are most profitable for  them, have understood this for a long time. Unfortunately, the  state is not doing this. The massive denationalization of  enterprises and their transfer to private property without  appropriate guarantees for their stable functioning and the  insuring of tax receipts for the budget from their activity are  occurring. As a result, tax receipts for the budget from  privatized enterprises are being constantly reduced. They  decreased by 17 percent during 1993.    It is necessary to introduce certain adjustments in order to  expand the reforms successfully. First of all, we must  strengthen the social orientation of the reforms so that the  individual's interests occupy the central place in them, the  expansion of production and the balancing of national economic  priorities are done on this basis, credit emissions are carried  out, and the financial and monetary system strengthened in the  final analysis. All necessary conditions for this exist today.

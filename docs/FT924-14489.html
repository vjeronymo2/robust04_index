			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK electricity Mr Stephen Littlechild, the electricity watchdog, is struggling with some knotty issues. His paper on future supply regulation invites submissions on alternatives to the price control RPI-X formula. But in the same breath it appears to dismiss the main possibilities, such as rate of return regulation. Perhaps this is not surprising. Mr Littlechild has been closely identified with the development of the RPI-X regime and might be expected to defend it. Price control does indeed provide efficiency incentives which other systems lack. Yet a rate of return is implicit in assumptions made about any price cap and the reasonable efficiency gains a company can make. Thus the price control ought to be pitched at a level to make the implied rate of return comparable to that of similar businesses. Rate of return cannot simply be ignored. The RPI-X system functions well enough for the business of transmitting power down the wires: a natural monopoly from which the regional electricity companies earn almost 95 per cent of their profits. Supply - the buying and selling of electricity - is not naturally a monopoly. With more competition, price regulation could be abandoned for all but domestic customers. Unfortunately supply is a low margin business, so to lure new entrants Mr Littlechild may be tempted to sweeten supply returns at the expense of distribution. British Gas must be watching keenly. The issues of acceptable rate of return and the balance of distribution and supply are at the heart of its Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Act does not permit the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegate the authority to impose a civil money penalty on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare participating facility to the State. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(2) of the Act charges the Secretary, upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation of the State, with the authority to impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies. HCFA's decision to monitor a State's performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not hinge on the imposition of civil money penalties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, any civil money penalties collected under Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be returned to the Medicare Trust Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters are concerned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed definition of deficiency will make any failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply, no matter how small, subject to a fine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with the commenters' concern that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as described in the proposed rule, very minimal deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be subject to civil money penalties. As a result, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised the rule and developed enforcement action categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which correspond to the seriousness of the deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These enforcement action categories are described at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.408, Selection of remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, as discussed previously in this preamble, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepting the commenters' implicit suggestion to incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concept of substantial compliance as a standard SNFs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NFs must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. Using the standard of performance of substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance for these providers ensures virtual compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b), (c), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) of the Act because the type of deficiency tolerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under a substantial compliance standard is very limited. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are defining substantial compliance at &sect;488.301. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider substantial compliance to satisfy a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation to meet requirements. Therefore, facilities in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance adequately protect the health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of nursing home residents and will not be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a civil money penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.430&blank;Basis for Imposing Penalty <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters were confused and requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that we clarify the number of days of noncompliance between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two certifications of compliance at proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.230(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We revised this paragraph of the rule and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated it as &sect;488.430(b). It now provides that HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the State may impose a civil money penalty for the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of days of past noncompliance since the last standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey, including the days of immediate jeopardy. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that this revision implements sections 1819(h) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h) of the Act, which state that if a facility meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), but as of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous period did not meet such requirements, a civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty could be imposed for the days in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility was not in compliance with the requirements. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe this statutory provision permits a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty to be imposed whenever there is past noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the participation requirements between standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys. The following example illustrates one application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this provision: A facility had a survey on July 1, 1993,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and it was in substantial compliance with all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation requirements. During the orientation tour at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next survey, June 15, 1994, surveyors observed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questionable infection control procedures. This observation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prompted the surveyors to further examine records and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's infection control program. This examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that the facility was out of compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infection control requirements (&sect;483.65) from October 15 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 30, 1993. However, at the time of the June 15,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, survey, the facility was again in substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with participation requirements. The number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of noncompliance would be 16, which is the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days between (and including) October 15 and October 30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This noncompliance existed for 16 days, but it did not exist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time of either survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although we may have discretion with respect to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection of remedies to address noncompliance that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrected by the time of a survey, it is likely that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would give serious consideration to civil money penalties in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such cases. The Act, at sections 1819(h)(1) and 1919(h) (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3), expressly authorizes the impositions of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctions even if, at the time of the survey, the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is in substantial compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Another commenter suggested incorporating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language which says, ``HCFA or the State may impose a civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty for the number of days of noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between two certifications of compliance if the deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was at a severity level of 4 and the facility could have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevented it.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not accept this suggestion. Adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this language narrows the authority of the Secretary and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State. Limiting this enforcement authority could allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance to go unsanctioned. We see no justification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for narrowing this authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A consumer organization specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended we clarify proposed &sect;488.230(a)(2) to say, ``the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty accrues as of the first day that noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existed in a previous period.'' Resident records or resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witnesses with corroboration would be sufficient evidence to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In this final rule, we are revising this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph to provide that HCFA or the State may impose a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty for the number of days of past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance since the last standard survey, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of days of immediate jeopardy. It is evident in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation the civil money penalty could be imposed for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the days of noncompliance. We do not accept the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion to incorporate into the regulation what specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence must be used to determine noncompliance, as each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation of noncompliance is unique.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters recommended that the word  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``impose'' be changed to ``collect'' at proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.230(a)(2), since the Act authorizes the use of civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties for past noncompliance that has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  While it is true that the Act specifies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a civil money penalty may be imposed for past noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that has been corrected, it is not necessarily true that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty will be collected in every case. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instance, if a facility prevails at a hearing, a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty will not be collected. Accordingly, we are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopting this recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A provider organization suggested that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand proposed &sect;488.230(b) by adding, ``(2) HCFA will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the State may not impose a civil money penalty on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility that is being terminated or is under temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management or a denial of payment for all new admissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except for a denial of payment under paragraph (a)(1) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [proposed] &sect;488.217.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

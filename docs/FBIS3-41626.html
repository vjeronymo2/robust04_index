			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bayduzhiy: ``The Army and VPK Enterprises </F> Exploited Nature over the Decades Without Control: The Situation  Might Change after Approval of the Edict of the President of  Russia on the Establishment of Ministry of Defense Ecological  Subunits'']    [Text] The recent discharge of liquid radioactive wastes  into the Sea of Japan by a tanker of the Russian Navy attracted  keen attention, it seems, only because of the foreign policy  complications that the Russian authorities caused themselves.  Against the background of Russia's dumping radioactive wastes  with an activity of 55.2 Curies just last year, the sensation  raised by about 900 cubic liters of radioactive water with a  strength of ``a total'' of one Curie looks at the very least  greatly exaggerated. There are 394 reactors on 228 nuclear  vessels of the country's Navy, and contamination of seas and  oceans by radioactive wastes is inevitable at least for several  more years, until such time as technical and financial problems  of their utilization are resolved.    Meanwhile, if the international aspect is dismissed, the  latest incident is a good reason to examine more attentively an  entire complex of questions associated with the effect of the  activity of the Armed Forces on the ecological situation in the  country. Especially because this is already not the first case  when the Russian MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], and before  this the Soviet MFA, had to take the rap for the actions of its  military, whose attitude toward nature was traditionally based  on the well-known principle ``after us the deluge.'' It is  enough to mention at least the multibillion sums of damage  caused by the Soviet Army in the countries of Eastern Europe, as  compensation for which the USSR and Russia had to abandon the  right to real estate of hundreds of military facilities in this  region. Even if a correction is made to the vested interest of  the governments of East European countries in increasing the  sums of ecological damage, it is still measured in astronomical  figures, and one can only guess the scale of similar damage to  the environment on the territory of the ex-USSR itself, where  the Army operated in an incomparably more free and easy manner.    Today in Russia alone 12.8 million hectares of land are used  by the Ministry of Defense, of which 1.3 million is assigned to  test ranges. According to expert assessments, the level of the  aggregate anthropogenic load on the environment as a result of  the activity of the VPK [military-industrial complex] is  comparable to the negative effects on it of all of the other  branches. The existing curtain of secrecy around the Army and  defense enterprises for decades guaranteed them practically  uncontrolled exploitation of the natural complex and, when the  curtain was finally raised, the time came to harvest the bitter  fruit. Standing in the same rank as the already mentioned  contamination of seacoasts with radioactive wastes is the  problem of the negative consequences of the tests of space and  rocket technology. According to data of the Ministry of  Environment and Natural Resources of Russia, the production of  the rocket-space branches emits 75,000 tonnes of toxic compounds  annually, and another 55,000 tonnes are poured into various  reservoirs. The general field area for dropping spent  rockets/booster stages (OChR) allocated to the Ministry of  Defense totals 9 million square kilometers, and 250 areas were  taken out of economic use specifically for these purposes. Some  of them, especially in Arkhangelsk Oblast and Yakutia, are  contaminated with the unburnt residue of the highly toxic rocket  fuel heptyl, whose period of decay under permafrost conditions  and low temperatures extends several thousand years. Accidents,  against which the rocket-space industry is also not guaranteed,  represent a significant threat to the environment. For example,  in 1985 the Tsyklon space-launch vehicle with a weather  satellite on board fell into the Northern Dvina as a result of a  catastrophe and, breaking through the ice, sank to the  bottom--heptyl was also a part of its two-component fuel. All  this in the end was supposed to cause a negative reaction, and  today the administrations of the Republic of Altay and Omsk,  Tomsk, and Arkhangelsk Oblasts have prohibited the launch of  rockets and space vehicles until there is an expert ecological  analysis of areas for dropping OChR.    The accelerating rates of the processes of disarmament are  also creating their own ecological problems. Just with  implementation of the START 1 and START 2 treaties it will be  necessary for Russia by the year 2000 to withdraw from Strategic  Missile Troops units about 100,000 tonnes of highly toxic  substances, to which another 30,000 tonnes should be added that  have been accumulated by the Air Defense Troops. The enormous  reserves of chemical weapons of the former USSR, whose  destruction is envisioned in international treaties, constitutes  a separate problem.    Besides ecological damage, by contaminating the environment  the Armed Forces also cause purely economic losses. Thus,  because of the poor technical condition and improper operation  of fuel storage on military airfields, a majority of which were  constructed as far back as the 1950's and 1960's, tens of  thousands of tonnes of petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) are  lost annually. This problem is especially acute in Mozdok,  Engels, and Yeysk, although it is urgent not only for Russia.  Not long ago the program ``Vesti'' showed a report from  Ukraine, where local ecologists demonstrated samples of subsoil  water from one of the air bases that flared up when a match was  brought to it. In Germany, zealous Germans announced plans to  begin the industrial extraction of kerosene from an underground  cavity under a former Soviet troop airfield where a man-made  lake formed over several decades. The ground in many garrisons  is saturated with this same kind of kerosene that was discarded  by aircraft in the form of unexpended fuel during a landing  approach. All told, 5,000 hectares of land in Russia alone are  contaminated with the Army's oil products and wastes.    However, there are indications today that the attitude, if  not of the Army toward nature, then, in any case, of society  toward the Army's disgraceful ecological practices, is beginning  to change more and more. The economic factors of wildlife  management that are being introduced are making themselves felt.  In 1992 the total fines imposed on military units for  contaminating the environment totalled 43.5 million rubles [R],  and it is already clear that this year it will be several orders  of magnitude more. For example, local authorities submitted a  bill of R24 billion to the aviation garrison of the city of  Engels alone. Nonetheless, if you take into account that the  Army is on budget financing, similar economic sanctions resemble  taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another.  Therefore, in the opinion of specialists, a different way is  more productive. The recently established Interdepartmental  Commission on Ecological Safety of the Security Council examined  the ecological aspects of the activity of the Armed Forces at a  meeting in October. The result of its work was a draft edict of  the president ``On the Establishment of Ecological Subunits of  the Ministry of Defense of Russia.'' It should be noted here  that the administration of ecology and special means of  protection, numbering 240 employees, began to operate in the  structure of the Russian defense department last year; however,  as it became clear, it evidently does not have enough forces to  influence the situation at least in some way. In comparison, the  ecological subunits in a majority of the NATO countries have  already existed for many years, and number 1,700 persons even in  little Norway. In the United States, $5 billion has been  allocated for 1994 for environmental protection work, which is 2  percent of the entire military budget.    The prepared draft of the edict of the president of Russia  proposes that Army environmental protection services also be  formed in our country. The concept of ecological support of the  Armed Forces that was approved by the chief of the General Staff  envisions the formation of ecological subunits in groups and  arms of service in 1993-1994, and each military district will  have them in the following two years. If these plans are fated  to take place, there is a hope that the Army not only will be  able to indemnify the damage to the environment that its own  activity causes, but also solve ecological problems that  confront the whole state.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: LIZ TAYLOR IS MAKING SCENTS, 'WHITE DIAMONDS'  </P> <P> IT'S BEEN all quiet on the Elizabeth Taylor front recently, but not to worry --  the actress has almost completely recovered from the ravages of that near-fatal  bout with pneumonia. She and her rough-hewn construction worker love, Larry  Fortensky, have rented a house in Malibu for the summer, in the exclusive  Paradise Cove area, near such other biggies as Barry Diller and Jerry  Weintraub.  </P> <P> The star has been throwing little barbecues and get-togethers for old and new  friends, playing the gracious hostess and astounding everybody with her renewed  health, high spirits and raucous, bawdy good humor. Those who have seen the  actress recently say she looks absolutely marvelous, plump and radiant. (Some  longtime Taylor watchers mournfully doubt she will ever again sport the size  six figure she miraculously maintained for 4 1/2 years. I say, so what!? --  just so long as she doesn't run her weight up to the unhealthy level it was  prior to her illness. Elizabeth has battled poundage her entire adult life --  let's give her a rest on this one.)  </P> <P> Taylor is expected to make no "official" public appearances until the fall when  she emerges for a round of AIDS fund-raisers. There are also plans for a  dazzling new perfume launch, late this year or early in 1991. It is to be  entirely different from her spectacularly successful Passion, the most  profitable celebrity fragrance ever. Although Taylor's formidable press rep  Chen Sam says nothing "definite" has happened in this area, I have it on good  authority that Miz Liz's new scent is to be called "White Diamonds."  </P> <P> TYNE DALY, fresh (if that is the word) from her long, Tony-winning stage run  with "Gypsy," returns to the small screen medium that made her a household name  in "Cagney and Lacey." Tyne will go before the cameras Sept. 5 for an ABC-TV  movie "The Last To Go," about a couple who are divorcing after 25 years of  marriage. This is probably not the most pleasant acting chore Tyne has ever  faced, as her own 20-year-plus marriage to actor Georg Stanford Brown just  collapsed.  </P> <P> On the other hand, with the subject so close to the bone, it may provide Tyne  with a lot of fine scenery chewing and even a catharsis of sorts.  </P> <P> CAROL KANE can claim the distinction of appearing in the first Miramax movie to  be released this summer that hasn't received an "X" rating. It's "The Lemon  Sisters," also starring Diane Keaton, which opens at the end of the month. The  big guys at Miramax are so impressed with Kane, they plan to build her up and  develop scripts and projects for her a la Disney's top lady, Bette Midler.  </P></p>

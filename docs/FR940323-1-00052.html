The only known habitat for the species is on a single rockslide near Tucson, Arizona, in an area of limestone talus about 15 by 30 m (50 by 100 ft) near a dirt road. The habitat is located downslope from a dirt road, making it vulnerable to infiltration of rocks and soil or other material. The species is so restricted in range that it is threatened by even limited removal of cover through vandalism or by individuals curious about the presence of a rare species. Removal of cover, including both rocks and vegetation, harms snails by exposing them to the drying effects of the sun and periods of low ambient humidity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the San Xavier talussnail as endangered. The species has a highly restricted range, is located in an area of growing urban development and active mining, and is easily accessible by road. Although the San Xavier talussnail is on private land, Federal actions may occur as the area continues to develop. Endangered status is most appropriate because the single known population could be destroyed by one action. Because of the vulnerability of the population, threatened status does not appear appropriate for the San Xavier talussnail. A decision to take no action would exclude this species from needed protection available under the Act, and the species would likely decline. The decision not to propose critical habitat for the San Xavier talussnail is explained in the following section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at the time a species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for the San Xavier talussnail at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The extremely restricted habitat of the species makes it vulnerable to collection and isolated acts of vandalism. Although there are relatively few amateur collectors of land snails, a single collection effort under advantageous conditions could severely deplete the species' population. The population could, however, withstand some limited, regulated scientific collection. Of greater concern than collection is the potential for acts of vandalism that directly kill the snails by crushing or by habitat disturbances that cause desiccation of the snails. These acts may sometimes be purposeful, but may also be caused by well-intentioned persons who are curious about the presence of an endangered species. The likelihood of these potential threats occurring would be greatly increased by designation of critical habitat, because the publication of critical habitat maps and descriptions would allow unauthorized persons to precisely identify the locality of this species. Identification of critical habitat would therefore increase the degree of threat to this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat designation would also not provide additional benefit to the species. The range and major ecological requirements of this species are sufficiently known to provide adequate protection through the Act's take prohibitions and application of the section 7 jeopardy standard. The Service will continue to communicate the conservation needs of the species to the involved landowner, as well as inform the landowner of the status of legal protection and conservation planning for the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

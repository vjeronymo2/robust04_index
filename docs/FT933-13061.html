			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Fed stresses real interest rates as monetary guide THE US Federal Reserve is putting increased emphasis on real interest rates as a guide to monetary policy, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday in a generally upbeat assessment of US economic trends. He warned Congress, however, that financial markets were likely to react negatively and push up long-term rates if budget negotiations this month failed to achieve the Clinton administration's goal of Dollars 500bn (Pounds 334bn)in deficit reduction over the next five years. Mr Greenspan said the US economic recovery appeared to have regained momentum after a series of setbacks earlier in the year and predicted growth at an annual rate of close to 3 per cent in the second quarter, after only 0.7 per cent growth in the first quarter. During the year as a whole the economy was likely to grow by about 2.5 per cent, he said. Delivering his twice yearly monetary report on Capitol Hill, Mr Greenspan said the relationships between money and national income and prices had largely broken down, depriving the monetary aggregates of their usefulness as guides to policy. The Fed had thus decided to put increased weight on the level of real interest rates as a monetary guide-post because of their 'key bearing on longer-run spending decisions and inflation prospects'. It was important to prevent real rates moving too far from a long-term 'equilibrium rate' - the rate consistent with steady non-inflationary growth. If interest rates were held below this level for too long, inflationary pressures would grow, leading eventually to another economic contraction, Mr Greenspan warned. In a strong hint that the next move in short-term rates would be up, he noted that real short rates had been 'in the neighbourhood of zero' for nine months. Long-term real rates were appreciably higher, indicating that financial markets expected a rise in short rates. Mr Greenspan said the Fed had revised down its growth forecasts to a 'central tendency' of 2.25-2.5 per cent this year compared with a projection of 3-3.25 per cent in February. The Fed has also grown more pessimistic on inflation, following sharp price increases early in the year. The latest forecast is for an increase in the consumer price index of 3-3.25 per cent this year against a projection of 2.5-2.75 per cent in February.

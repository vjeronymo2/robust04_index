			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Former Pro Bowl running back Tony Collins, 31, signed a one-year contract with  the Miami Dolphins, a few days after the NFL lifted his suspension for drug  abuse.  </P> <P> "I want to thank Coach (Don) Shula for sticking his neck out for me, and I'm  not going to cut it off," Collins said.  </P> <P> Collins said he has not used drugs for a year and a half. His worst binge came  after the NFL ban when a cocaine overdose sent him to an Indianapolis hospital.  </P> <P> Collins spent seven seasons with New England, rushing for 4,647 yards, catching  passes for 2,356 yards and scoring 44 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Shula decided those numbers made the 184-pound Collins worth a gamble. Collins  said at least five other teams rejected his request for a tryout.  </P></p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: The Barber of Seville - Opera Why is it that The Barber of Seville, with its strong plot, brilliant music and several hit numbers, seldom delights in the theatre? The problem lies in the plot, which almost completely lacks pathos, and which therefore requires a robust comic sense that is surprisingly rare. The characters may be commedia dell'arte archetypes, but they must be vivid, individual, excitable, spontaneous, Mediterranean. And Seville itself - or a slice of it  -must become real. In English National Opera's staging, however, all the cartoon detail in Tanya McCallin's sets announces 'Not for real' to us. Jonathan Miller's 1987 staging tells the story as if it were a creaky period curio. And the way that, in John Abulafia's current revival, extraneous comic business has been inserted to jolly things along can be held up as an object-lesson on how not to stage comedy. Who could believe that the street in the first scene is a real street? And why, since this long scene shows us little but Count Almaviva and Figaro, does the production do nothing to flesh them out as winning, three-dimensional characters and endear them to us? Well, there is always the music to keep us going, and the current revival is of a decent if undistinguished order. A virus kept Della Jones - whose singing of Rossini's mezzo-soprano roles has been one of ENO's house tressures for 15 years - from returning to the role of Rosina on Saturday. The Australian mezzo Fiona Janes, who replaced her, was making her London debut. She has a warm voice, and is a competent stage performer. But, like Michael Lewis's Figaro, her Rosina is just a bright-eyed stereotype; and, by strictest standards, both her and Lewis's coloratura is approximate. The Barber can be wonderful comedy even when imperfectly voiced. But it needs brio. Mark Shanahan, conducting, came nearer to supplying this from the pit than anyone onstage, though there is more elegance and more fizz to this score than he disclosed. Peter Bronder is not really a Count Almaviva - with his Billy Bunter face, he is most at ease in the surefire disguise scenes - but his energetic involvement in the situation is welcome. And there is an unusual blend of virility and refinement to his singing that did more to realise the potential of Rossini's score than anyone else onstage. Arwel Huw Morgan's voice is well placed to give the right 'speaking' emphasis to Bartolo's music - the nearer to speech Rossini's recitatives become, the better - but something seems to hold him back from taking charge of the character or the household. Richard Angas sang Don Basilio in big but wretchedly throaty tones: a voice with less meat than gristle. Many in the audience took more pleasure in the jokes and the singing than I could; no wonder, since Rossini's score is so irresistible. This is, however, in no way a Barber lit up from within. In repertory at English National Opera until May 27</p>

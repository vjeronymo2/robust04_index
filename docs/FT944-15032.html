			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / People: Plumb to chair UK agricultural lender The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, the biggest long-term lender to Britain's farmers, has just acquired its third chairman in the last 18 months. Lord Plumb, 69, leader of the Tory MEPs in Strasbourg, has taken the helm of Britain's only specialised agricultural lender. Lord Plumb, right, a former president of the National Farmers Union, takes over from Sir David Walker, following the latter's announcement that he is resigning as a deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank to become chairman of Morgan Stanley's European operations. Sir David had replaced Henry Lambert as chairman, following last year's acquisition of the AMC by Lloyds Bank. The AMC, set up in 1928, had been owned by the Bank of England and the big London clearing banks prior to its acquisition by Lloyds. The bank is intent on expanding its new acquisition and has been strengthening its ties with the farming community. Lord Plumb, who had been a director of Lloyds for 15 years, went on the board following last year's acquisition, joining Sir Simon Gourlay, another ex-president of the NFU, and Lord Selborne, who farms 2,500 acres in Hampshire and is the government's chief adviser on nature conservation. Lord Selborne, 54, managing director of the Blackmoor Estate and a trustee of the Royal Agricultural Society, joined the AMC board in 1990 as the nominee of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales. He was appointed a non-executive director of Lloyds Bank last July. In the wake of Sir David's departure, Lord Selborne has been appointed deputy chairman of AMC, and Michael Thompson, a former deputy chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has also joined the board.</p>

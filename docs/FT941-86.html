			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Fittings returns to black with Pounds 1.4m British Fittings Group emerged from two years of losses with 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m. There were restated losses of Pounds 3.4m in 1992 and Pounds 3.56m in 1991 when evidence of stock thefts and accounting errors came to light just before the finals were announced. The West Midlands pipeline equipment, water products and non-ferrous metals distribution group has completed the installation of new financial controls. 'It is now a question of getting our market share and increasing it,' said Mr Cecil Buckett, finance director. After stripping out figures for the discontinued non-ferrous metals business, turnover on continuing operations was Pounds 69.3m compared with Pounds 71.1m. The fall came largely because low levels of capital expenditure hurt demand for water products. More than 70 per cent of turnover came from pipeline equipment distribution, which was the only profitable division. It raised operating profits by 39 per cent. Group operating profits on continuing operations were Pounds 2.45m, compared with Pounds 1.54m. Over the last two years, British Fittings has reduced its non-ferrous metals activities and Mr Brian Stanton, the chief executive, said these operations were no longer a core business: 'we will not build on it but we're not going to panic-sell it.' With market prospects this year remaining uncertain, the group expects to lift profits by winning greater market share through a widened base of materials suppliers and further geographical and product diversification. Earnings per share were 3.19p (losses 13.59p). The final dividend is 1.25p (1p) making 2p (1.5p) for the year.</p>

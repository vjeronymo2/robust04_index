			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>   [Text] New tactical military moves are under way in Angola.  Government military sources report major troop and military  equipment movements by the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuito and other parts of the  country. Reginaldo Silva, the BBC correspondent in Luanda,  reports:    [Begin Silva recording] Government sources today reiterated  their accusation that UNITA is preparing a major attack on the  city of Cuito. They expect such an attack to occur soon and  their views seem to be backed by the media in Luanda, notably  IMPARCIAL FAX, the most recent independent publication to have  emerged in the Angolan capital. (?According to that) source,  UNITA is strengthening all its positions in the area of Cuito.  It has been providing logistical supplies to its forces in the  area of Chitundo, some 15 km from Cuito. UNITA troops have been  seen moving from Cuanza Commune and heading in the direction of  the outskirts of Cuito. ZU- 23 artillery weapons have been set  up at the local hospital and at a temporary school. Another two  long-range artillery weapons are reported to have been set up  north of Chambanda Village. UNITA's (?L-50) Battalion is also  reported to have been moving from Andulo District to positions  near the hospital area in Cuito's Cantinflas Ward.    In Cuito, an alleged UNITA soldier by the name of Antonio  Domingos was today presented to the public. He is said to have  recently deserted from the UNITA ranks and his statements  confirmed that UNITA troops have been moving in the vicinity of  the capital of Bie Province.    The Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, chief of General Staff has  also issued a communique reporting constant ambushes by the  UNITA forces. That communique adds that UNITA has been planting  mines in the roads to Malange, Saurimo, Lucapa, Dundo, Ambriz,  Caxito, and Dondo. It confirms that UNITA attacked Cunge  Commune, 7 km from Cuito, on 23 February, and lost more than 30  men. What seems to be of greater concern to the government  forces at this stage is the presence of UNITA troops along the  road linking Luanda and Porto Amboim. That was one of the few  roads where there were no reports of military activity. That  road is used for many people and goods to travel between Cuanza  Sul and Luanda Provinces. It is noteworthy that a large  percentage of Angolan-made food products currently reaching  Luanda come from Cuanza Sul Province.    UNITA sources have kept their silence concerning those  developments. Today, they only provided detailed reports about  government military operations against their positions in Huila  Province and the government's continuing recruitment of South  African mercenaries. Those men are said to be assembling at the  coastal town of Cabo Ledo, slightly more than 100 km south of  Luanda. [end recording]</p>

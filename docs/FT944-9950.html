			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: Love on wheels - Television There are 20,000 of them on the roads, they are built like little tanks, they do 'nought to 60 in a fortnight', their batteries weigh about a ton, and their drivers will not have a word said against them. They are, of course, the electric milk floats which hum around our streets at dawn, providing Britain's unique - though steadily shrinking - doorstep delivery service. They were the subject of last night's Perpetual Motion on BBC2, one of those quiet little documentary series on quirky subjects which pass by many of us most of the time, but give disproportionate satisfaction to enthusiasts. It is this sort of programme which so often achieves a 'Reaction Index' (the degree of enthusiasm expressed to pollsters) way beyond those of more glitzy programmes with bigger audiences. In this six-part series, produced by Emma Willis at BBC Bristol, we have already seen programmes on the Ford Transit van, the American Airstream caravan, and Concorde, as well as the milk float. Next week's subject is the Ferguson TE 20 tractor, known as 'Little Grey Fergie', and the series ends with 30 minutes on the Douglas DC-3, better known as the Dakota, an aeroplane which inspires among its keener supporters panegyrics which come close to declarations of love. That is the key to these programmes. They work best when the producers find enthusiasts whose fanatic dedication pours from them uncontrollably. Conversely they are least successful, or anyway least fun to watch, when they are closest to the conventional documentary formula of history/statistics/newsreel extract and so on. Thus the least entertaining so far was last week's Concorde programme, which felt a bit like a schools' broadcast on transport. There was talk about Anglo-French co-operation in the design and manufacture, and stories from the test pilots, all of which seemed familiar from other programmes. There was a hint of Perpetual Motion's characteristic tang when the air hostess explained the difficulty of getting meals served in the early days, with passengers so busy having their photographs taken beside the 'Mach 2' digital read-out on the cabin bulkhead. But there was all too little of that. What we needed were besotted passengers: the reminiscences of David Frost or that pencil manufacturer who is in the Guiness Book Of Records as the greatest user of Concorde. Nobody described what it felt like to overtake the sun. On the other hand people of all kinds described their love affairs with (of all things) the Ford Transit van, which was, consequently, the subject of the most successful programme so far. The Transit won equal plaudits from policemen and bank robbers, one of whom explained that, as robberies got bigger in the 1960s, a Jaguar was no longer any good. You could not cram four or five crooks and four or five bags of swag in a Jag, whereas a Transit did very nicely - and concealed you from the law, too. On similar grounds a policeman reckoned Transits made ideal surveillance vehicles, arguing that there were so many around that nobody noticed those concealing police observers. The bank robber grinned and claimed you could always see them rocking on their springs as the coppers moved about inside. Abiding affection is an attractive emotion which makes for pleasant viewing, even when it is being bestowed upon some ancient vehicle - and few things in life seem to inspire quite such depths of affection as old vehicles. The Ferguson tractor went out of production 40 years ago and yet next week's programme - one of the best - tracks down a farmer and his two sons who have one each and use them all the time. Perpetual Motion is really a series of love stories.</p>

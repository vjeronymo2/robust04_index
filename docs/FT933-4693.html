			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Reinventing government is not easy: George Graham looks at Vice-President Al Gore's plans to overhaul US bureaucracy, and the obstacles ahead VICE-PRESIDENT Al Gore is not the first person to set about overhauling the US federal bureaucracy, and scepticism about the results of reports such as his National Performance Review is now deeply ingrained. Mr Gore says he reviewed 500 previous studies purporting to be comprehensive reviews of what needs to be changed in the federal government, and that his review will be different. The review, which promises Dollars 108bn (Pounds 71.5bn) of savings over five years and a 12 per cent reduction in the size of the federal workforce, seeks to defuse the conflicts with Congress that have hampered implementation of previous recommendations by arguing that it would change not what government does, but how it does it. It also claims to be different because it is based on the ideas of government employees themselves, not on outside nostrums. The National Performance Review offers a list of specific recommendations aimed at cutting wasteful spending, streamlining bureaucracy, improving customer service, overhauling federal procurement rules and rebuilding the federal personnel code. Suggestions include: Consolidate the Agriculture Department's 42 agencies into 30 and close one in 10 of its 12,000 field offices. Close all the regional offices of the Housing and Urban Development Department and pare down its 80 field offices. Fold the Drug Enforcement Agency into the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Allow government agencies, including the Internal Revenue, to use private debt collectors and accept payments by credit card. Eliminate the 10,000-page Federal Personnel Manual by September next year and replace it with general principles which would allow managers to hire, fire and reward excellence. Lift the level below which agencies can make purchases without special authorisation from Dollars 25,000 to Dollars 100,000. Budget over two years instead of one. Reduce the ratio of managers to one for every 15 employees, instead of one for every seven employees. But Washington sceptics say that even if the Gore report is different from President Richard Nixon's Ash Council or President Ronald Reagan's Grace Commission - and it is certainly better written than those were - it is likely to suffer the same fate as they did. Others believe, however, that public opinion, stoked by Mr Ross Perot's presidential campaign last year, is so eager for an attack on waste in government that Congress will be forced to take up Mr Gore's challenge. Many of the recommendations can be implemented at least in part by presidential order, and President Bill Clinton promised yesterday that he would do his part. 'There are a lot of places in this report where it says the president should. . . the president should. . . the president should. . . Well I have read the report and where it says the president should, the president will,' he said yesterday at a White House ceremony to unveil the report. Other elements, however, would require legislation in Congress; some of them have been recommended many times before, and large political interests have prevented their implementation. Even though Mr Gore avoids attacking some of the politically sensitive subsidy programmes that the Grace Commission included in its recommendations, a report that would cut 252,000 jobs is sure to run into opposition, at least from the civil service trade unions. White House officials were quick yesterday to emphasise that some of these jobs are not even filled at the moment, and that most of the cuts could be achieved through attrition. Many of Mr Gore's other suggestions will rub against Congress's insistance that it should have close oversight of the operations of the administration; he urges, for example, that Congress give agencies broader authority to spend the money allotted to them, instead of putting in line-by-line restrictions on their spending, and also asks Congress to reduce the number of reports it demands from agencies. Although Senator George Mitchell, the leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, yesterday said he supported the proposed two-year budget cycle, the idea is a red rag to congressional bulls such as Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the chairman of the appropriations committee which controls spending. Mr Mitchell acknowledged that other reports had come and gone, but said that 'doesn't mean we should stop trying'. 'The reality is this is a very large enterprise, growing larger, and it has to be constantly reviewed,' he said yesterday. On the other side of the political aisle, Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, gave a cautious welcome to the Gore report, while complaining that his party had not been involved in its preparation. 'We'd like to take a look at it and see how much smoke and mirrors there are, how much real change there is. And if it's a good change, he'll have a lot of Republican support,' Mr Dole said in a television interview.</p>

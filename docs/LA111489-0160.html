			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BAHAMAS SEAPLANE LINE TO END  </P> <P> Chalk's International Airlines, which has ferried tourists and gamblers between  Miami and the Bahamas in its fat-bellied seaplanes for 70 years, will end  service Dec. 15 unless a buyer is found.  </P> <P> Merv Griffin's Resorts International, the financially strapped owner, said it  can no longer afford to operate the seaplane service. "Chalk's losses are very,  very substantial and have been for a long time," said the airline's attorney,  Harold Rifas.  </P> <P> Described as the world's oldest airline, Chalk's stopped flying to Paradise  Island, off Nassau, on Oct. 29. Its remaining service, primarily three flights  a day between Miami and Bimini, will end in a month unless a buyer comes  forward before then.  </P> <P> The low-flying amphibious planes have a sentimental hold on longtime residents,  who call the planes "Chalkies."  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: IPounds 29m cash call from Irish Continental A 3-for-7 rights issue to raise IPounds 29.2m (Pounds 28.1m) has been announced by the Irish Continental Group, which operates ferry and shipping services from Ireland to the UK and the continent. The issue price of 400p on the 7.57m new shares represents a 13 per cent discount on yesterday's average trading price of 460p. The issue is being underwritten by AIB Capital Markets. Proceeds will be used to finance the building of a new ferry to operate on the Dublin-Holyhead route, which will replace a chartered vessel with one with more than twice the capacity. The company said that capacity constraints on the route had created opportunities for expansion to 'capture a significant portion of the freight transport originating in the Republic of Ireland currently being routed through Northern Ireland ports'. The annual financing costs of the new ferry would be no greater than the chartering costs of the existing chartered ferry, the company said. The Irish Sea routes have become increasingly competitive. The port of Larne, north of Belfast, with its short sea crossing to Britain and frequent sailings schedule, has posed a challenge to operators out of ports in the Republic. Larne handles an estimated 20 per cent of all roll-on roll-off vehicle traffic for the Republic crossing the Irish Sea. Stena Sealink, is one of ICG's main competitors, and is planning its own expansion on the Dublin-Holyhead route this summer, upgrading its catamaran ferry service in June to be followed by the introduction on the route of the world's largest high-speed ferry in spring 1995. The new ICG ferry, and Stena Sealink's new high-speed vessel, will have capacity to carry 100 and 50 trucks respectively. However, government plans to alleviate traffic congestion in Dublin are unlikely to materialise until towards the end of the decade.</p>

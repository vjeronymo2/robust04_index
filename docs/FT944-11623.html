			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Bosnian Serbs mobilise forces after military defeats The Bosnian Serbs, smarting under their first serious defeats in 31 months of war, served conscription orders on tens of thousands of civilians and students yesterday but stopped short of declaring immediate martial law. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said a 'general mobilisation' of men in his self-styled republic had begun. 'We are entering the final battle,' he said. Mr Karadzic has masterminded the Bosnian Serbs' hitherto successful defiance of the republic's mainly Moslem leaders, who declared independence in April 1992. The mobilisation is a sign that Bosnian Serb resources are being strained to breaking point as growing Moslem firepower and a desperate shortage of fuel take their toll. However, a meeting between Mr Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs' political and military leadership failed, unexpectedly, to produce any immediate decision to declare a state of war, or suspend civil rights. The session followed military reverses at the hands of a Moslem-Croat alliance, including the loss of the strategic town of Kupres in central Bosnia. Officials in Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold where the meeting took place, said a decision on an all-out state of war would probably be taken next week. The postponement of this move fuelled speculation among western observers of possible divisions in the Bosnian Serb leadership, which has been isolated by its former Serbian protectors in Belgrade. Reports from Bosnian Serb-controlled territory, which amounts to nearly 70 per cent of the Bosnian republic, said security police loyal to Mr Karadzic were questioning hundreds of local officials and citizens. The apparent purpose of the questioning is to root out supporters of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, who has accepted the latest international peace plan and has become a bitter rival of Mr Karadzic. Meanwhile, UN officials denounced as 'terrorism' a Serb rocket attack on Bihac, in which seven people were wounded. The sharp reaction raised the possibility that the UN might order air strikes if the Serbs reacted to the latest setback by bombing civilian targets. Bihac is one of six enclaves under UN protection. Officials from the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - the five nations which make up the 'contact group' on Bosnia - are due to meet in Zagreb this weekend. The fact that the meeting is taking place was seen as a signal of continued determination to work together on a settlement.</p>

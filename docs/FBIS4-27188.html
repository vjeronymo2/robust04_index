			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The government Tuesday [31  May] decided to extend the peacekeeping duties of scores of  Self- Defense Forces' members in Mozambique until early next  year, government officials said.    The decision follows the overall extension of the UN  peacekeeping mission in Mozambique until November due to the  delay in disarming antigovernment guerrilla forces there, the  officials said.    The Japanese will stay until Feb. 15, 1995 in the second  extension of their dispatch. The first extension was granted in  November last year.    The group, who currently serve in the headquarters of the UN  mission in the African nation, left Japan on May 18 to replace  another group of five SDF members who returned on Sunday after  serving a year there.    In addition to the five, 48 SDF members are serving in two  provices in Mozambique.</p>

Lebedev at Russian Academy of Sciences,  Moscow; PACS 42.55.Gp;42.60.By;41.75.Fr]    [Abstract] Electron-beam pumping of the wide-aperture  excimer laser ``GARPUN'' [HARPOON] is being studied in search of  a scheme which will ensure most efficient and nearly uniform  excitation of the active medium. This laser, inside a 144 cm  long chamber with a 22x22 cm[.sup]2[/] large square  cross-section and a 18x20 cm[.sup]2[/] wide aperture, is  pulse- pumped by two relativistic electron beams entering  laterally from opposite sides through vacuum-sealed windows made  of 20 m thick titanium foil, which separates the gaseous  working medium inside from the beam accelerating vacuum diodes  outside. The high-voltage beam accelerators consist each of four  duplex shaping lines on deionized water which are electrically  charged by a generator of voltage pulses. A pair of solenoids  produces a pulsed magnetic field of about 1 kG intensity  parallel to the counterpropagating electron beams which  stabilizes the beams and minimizes diffusion of electrons from  the active medium. This arrangement makes it feasible to form  electron beams 12x100 cm[.sup]2[/] in cross-section carrying  a uniformly distributed current of 60 kA behind the windows and  delivering it in square pulses of 100 ns duration. The  accelerating voltage is regulated by varying either the voltage  of pulse generator or the geometry of interelectode gap in the  vacuum diodes. The experimental apparatus includes a graphite  calorimeter measuring the energy of both electron beams at the  entrance to the laser chamber and a DMI-1 magnetic inductive  instrument recording the pressure pulses in the active medium  through an 8ANCh-23 strain-gage transducer on an S8-14  oscillograph, the time constant of this set being 0.3 ms and  thus much shorter than the about 200 ms long pressure transient  inside the laser chamber. Tests were performed with  Ar*[.sub]2[/] and Kr*[.sub]2[/] molecules, 0.1-0.6%  CO[.sub]2[/] being added for effective quenching of the  excitation states. The theoretical model of electron transfer in  the one-particle approximation disregards collective effects and  plasma instabilities, all being negligible under conditions of  the experiment. Only pairwise collisions of electrons with atoms  of the noble gas are thus assumed to take places during electron  beam and active medium interaction, in the course of which  either the atoms become ionized (excited) by the electrons or  electrons are being scattered by the atoms. Radiation losses  attending elastic scattering are in this case also negligible.  Analysis of this process requires calculating the trajectories  of individual electrons between successive collisions with atoms  by solving the equations of motion dP/dt = e[vB] and dS/dt = v  (momentum P= m[.sub]e[/]v/[1-  (v/c)[.sup]2[/]][.sup]1/2[/], S- distance traveled by  electron, e- electron charge, B- magnetic induction,  m[.sub]e[/]- electron mass, v- velocity of electron, c- speed  of light, t- time). This system of equations has been solved  numerically by the universally applicable and most precise of  all Monte Carlo method. The results of the experiment and of the  numerical simulation indicate the optimum conditions for pumping  an energy of as much as 2.1 kJ and correspondingly a power of  about 0.8 MW/cm[.sup]3[/] density into a ``Garpun'' Ar-laser  with an about 60% efficiency, with the energy  distribution over  the aperture deviating less than 20% from a uniform one  and the  overall pump efficiency reaching about 16%.

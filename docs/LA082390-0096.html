			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: BRADBURY;  </P> <P> COUNCIL WEIGHS PICKUP FEES  </P> <P> Whether the city will accept a new, costlier, contract with Riverside-based  National Environmental Waste Co. for pickup and disposal of the city's refuse  won't be decided until November.  </P> <P> The company has asked for a 19% increase in rates, which range from $7.35 a  month for collection of one curbside garbage can to as much as $220 a  collection for large dumpsters on ranches of up to 20 acres.  </P> <P> The City Council decided to extend a decision to allow time for members Audrey  Chamberlain and Thomas Melbourn to accompany the collection vehicles on a  pickup day in the city. Chamberlain and Melbourn will report back to the  council, and members will attend a workshop with representatives of NEWCO.  </P> <P> Many of the streets and roads of Bradbury, a two-square-mile city with many  ranches and stables tucked into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, are  narrow and winding. The disposal company contends that its vehicles encounter  unusual logistical problems in the city.  </P> <P> The contract includes collection of garbage and manure.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SILVER SCREEN HANDICAP;  </P> <P> SADDLE SORE: COREY BLACK WINS ABOARD 37-1 SHOT  </P> <P> Perhaps Corey Black should get into jockeys' room scuffles more often. The  20-year-old rider mixed it up with another jockey, Amir Cedeno, after the  second race at Hollywood Park Sunday, and has been riding as though the  stewards' fine would be thousands, not only $100.  </P> <P> Black was sore in the neck from his second-race spill, and sore at Cedeno for  shutting him off at the three-eighths pole. But Black came back and won both  the third and fourth races Sunday, finished second with Fitzwilliam Place in  the Beverly Hills Handicap and then on Monday rode Raise a Stanza, a 37-1 shot,  to a half-length victory in the $169,700 Silver Screen Handicap.  </P> <P> Both Black and Raise a Stanza had been recently known more for their turf  accomplishments than anything they had done on dirt, but the Silver Screen  changed that.  </P> <P> Going into the 1 1/8-mile main-track race, Raise a Stanza's only stakes win  this year had been on grass -- and on a disqualification -- in his last start.  And although Black had been winning with a good 13% of his mounts in grass  races this season, his percentage on dirt was only half that.  </P> <P> The Silver Screen was reduced to 12 3-year-olds after Notorious Pleasure, the  colt who finished ahead of Raise a Stanza in the roughly run Cinema Handicap on  June 11, was scratched because trainer Hector Palma didn't want to run from the  outside post.  </P> <P> Notorious Pleasure was the morning-line favorite, but his 7-2 price was  indicative of what a handicappers' nightmare the Silver Screen was. The crowd  of 20,546 made Prized, one of only three starters who had won last time, and  Endow, the California Derby winner, the slight favorites.  </P> <P> Endow loomed in contention, on the outside and in fourth place, coming out of  the far turn, but he settled for seventh. Broke the Mold, who ran as an entry  with Exemplary Leader and went off at 14-1, finished second, 1 3/4 lengths  ahead of Prized, who stumbled out of the gate and had a wide trip while making  his first start in four months.  </P> <P> Raise a Stanza, running 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 2/5, paid $76.60, $27.80 and $11.20  to become the highest-priced winner of the 11-year-old Silver Screen. The Raise  a Man-Short Stanza colt earned $102,200 for his owner, Jack Kent Cooke. Broke  the Mold paid $11 and $5, and Prized returned $3.80.  </P> <P> Raise a Stanza carried 115 pounds, five pounds less than Endow, who was the  high weight. Black was never on Raise a Stanza's back until he worked the horse  for trainer Jay Robbins Monday morning. Gary Stevens, who had ridden Raise a  Stanza in two of his last three races, told Robbins he might be making a  mistake, but elected to ride Endow in the Silver Screen.  </P> <P> Bruho might have been Black's Silver Screen mount, but trainer Julio Canani,  unhappy with the weights, didn't run and Black felt an obligation to Robbins,  who had used him to ride Flying Continental to a 12th-place finish in the  Kentucky Derby.  </P> <P> When they were younger horses, Robbins worked them in company and first thought  that Raise a Stanza was better. Even with the Silver Screen going to Raise a  Stanza, Robbins said Monday that he still thinks Flying Continental, second to  Sunday Silence in the Santa Anita Derby, is better.  </P> <P> "But this horse is improving," Robbins said of Raise a Stanza. "He doesn't like  dirt hitting him in the face, and we were able to avoid that today."  </P> <P> Advocate Training set the pace, running respectable early fractions through the  first half-mile, with Raise a Stanza close behind at all times. On the turn for  home, Advocate Training dropped out of contention, with Broke the Mold making  his move.  </P> <P> Broke the Mold, under Martin Pedroza, held a one-length lead in mid-stretch,  but Raise a Stanza kept coming.  </P> <P> "When I got my horse in gear, he finished the whole way down the lane," Black  said. "He feels like a route horse, and he wasn't getting late today. He's kind  of lazy, but he has a big stride and he's strong. I can't believe he's by Raise  a Man (who sires mostly sprinters)."  </P> <P> The next logical race would be the Swaps at 1 1/4 miles on July 23, except that  trainer Charlie Whittingham has announced that his Kentucky Derby-Preakness  winner, Sunday Silence, is going to run.  </P> <P> "I can't see any reason why we shouldn't go for it," said Black, still flush  with Monday's victory.  </P> <P> Robbins took a less forceful perspective.  </P> <P> "Maybe Charlie will give his horse a little longer rest," the trainer said.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> A stewards' hearing for Dean Bailey, the mutuel clerk who was involved in the  alleged Pick Nine scam at Hollywood Park, will be held Saturday. The clerk has  been suspended indefinitely and there is a chance that the stewards could issue  a ruling against him. A Pick Nine ticket for about $4,600 was cancelled by  Bailey, then sold by the bettor to several patrons. They thought they held the  only ticket on a $1.3-million payoff until the track told them that the bet had  been voided at the request of the original bettor.  </P> <P> "Jockeys Across America" day at tracks around the country accounted for an  estimated $80,000 for the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund. Many jockeys  contributed the equivalent of one mount fee to the fund, which aids injured  riders who have hospital bills. At Hollywood Park, fans spent $5,000 Saturday  on T-shirts sold on behalf of the fund, which is named after the jockey who  died of cancer. Marje Everett, Hollywood Park's chief operating officer,  reportedly made a personal contribution of $10,000.  </P> <P> Bill Shoemaker, who will be honored at Hollywood Park during a night program on  July 21, won two races Monday in Stockholm on his retirement tour, raising his  record total to 8,807. . . . Trainer Julio Canani said he would not run Putting  in the Sunset Handicap on July 21, because the horse has a tendency to jump  shadows. . . . Amir Cedeno wasn't fined for his role in the altercation with  Corey Black on Sunday, but the stewards handed him a five-day suspension for  not having better control of his horse. . . . Black will be at River Downs near  Cincinnati today to ride Annoconnor.  </P></p>

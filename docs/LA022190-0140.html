			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOCCER PLAYOFF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DOLEMAN A STANDOUT IN LEADING EL TORO PAST SANTA ANA  </P> <P> It is hard to miss El Toro High School's Ian Doleman when he's on the soccer  field.  </P> <P> First, there is his uniform, obscured by dirt and grass stains.  </P> <P> Second, there is his voice -- it may be the only thing louder than the soccer  uniforms.  </P> <P> But Tuesday, Doleman made his mark with two goals, leading El Toro to a 2-1  victory over visiting Santa Ana in a second-round Southern Section 3-A boys'  soccer match.  </P> <P> Doleman gave El Toro (12-3-2) a 1-0 lead 10 minutes into the game when he took  a cross-pass from Grant Schick and popped the ball under goalie Hector Ramos'  left hand.  </P> <P> Doleman was on the left side of the goal, just inside the box, and caught the  Santa Ana defense out of position.  </P> <P> Doleman put El Toro ahead, 2-0, eight minutes in the second half. Ali Akjol had  broken away to the right of the goal and his initial shot bounced back to him  off the left post. His second shot was deflected by Ramos in front of the goal  where Doleman was waiting to score his uncontested shot.  </P> <P> Santa Ana (15-4-6) scored when Robert Sanchez converted a direct free-kick 16  minutes into the second half.  </P> <P> El Toro advances to the quarterfinal where it will play Dominguez, a 2-1 winner  over Santa Barbara. But the Chargers will be be without Schick, who received a  red card from the referee for an aggressive shot in the second half. ARA  NAJARIAN  </P></p>

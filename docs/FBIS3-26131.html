The measures include:    -- More overseas financial organizations will be allowed to  set up branches in Shenzhen and foreign investment in such  sectors as banks, trust, foundations, securities and insurance  companies will be encouraged.    -- The business scope of foreign-funded financial  organizations will be admitted into such areas as savings, loans  and accounting in RMB [renminbi], the Chinese currency.    -- Locally-funded financial organizations are encouraged to  set up branches overseas and transnational banks.    At present, there are 41 foreign-funded financial  organizations in Shenzhen, including banks, securities companies  and insurance companies. Over the past decade or so, they have  introduced more than one billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds  into Shenzhen.    Shenzhen plans to increase its savings by 18 billion yuan  this year, an increase of 36 percent over last year, according  to today's conference.    In 1993, the banking industry of Shenzhen maintained healthy  momentum. At the end of last year, it reported a savings  balance of 65.7 billion yuan, an increase of 10.2 billion yuan  over the beginning of 1993, up 18.4 percent; a loan balance of  50.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12.6 billion yuan and up 33.6  percent; and a foreign currency loan balance of 3.66 billion  U.S. dollars, an increase of 800 million U.S. dollars and up  16.1 percent.</p>

The  newspaper's parent, Hearst Corp., said it has hired New York investment banker  Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to approach potential buyers.  </P> <P> Hearst has been privately pursuing a sale for months. Millionaire Marvin Davis  and the Toronto Sun Publishing Co. of Canada have already considered and  rejected a purchase of the paper. Herald Examiner management also is  considering an employee buyout plan.  </P> <P> Robert Danzig, vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers, said  the Herald Examiner does not fit with the company's "strategic direction."  </P> <P> The Herald Examiner, founded 86 years ago by William Randolph Hearst, has been  losing money for at least a decade. There has been speculation in the newspaper  industry that the Herald Examiner might be closed if a buyer isn't found.  </P></p>

Chester, M.D., of Albuquerque, New Mexico, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration, AC3247738, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner. 21 U.S.C. 823(f) (1992). The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Chester lacked authority to handle controlled substances in the State of New Mexico, 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), and that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, as the term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Chester's registered location in Albuquerque, New Mexico by registered mail on March 11, 1994, and a signed receipt was returned to DEA indicating a delivery date of March 19, 1994. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was delivered to Dr. Chester's registered address. The DEA has received no response from Dr. Chester or anyone purporting to represent him. Therefore, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Chester has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter and enters his final order based on the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator finds that on December 2, 1992, the New Mexico Board of Medical Examiners (Medical Board) revoked Dr. Chester's medical license. The Medical Board found that Dr. Chester had committed fraud or misrepresentation in applying for and procuring a license to practice medicine in the State of New Mexico in that he failed to disclose a prior conviction by military court-martial. The Medical Board also found that he had engaged in grossly negligent practice of medicine and unwise and injudicious prescribing practices, both of which included inappropriate use of Schedule II and IV controlled substances. The Medical Board concluded that the cumulative pattern of Dr. Chester's medical practice demonstrated his incapacity or incompetence to practice medicine. On June 8, 1993, the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy (Pharmacy Board) revoked Dr. Chester's controlled substance registration because the Medical Board had revoked his practitioner's license and because he had failed to notify the Pharmacy Board of that action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator has consistently held that DEA cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is without State authority to handle controlled substances.

Arakaky, M.D.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 42074 (1994);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see also Elliot Monroe, M.D., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  57 FR 23246 (1992) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bobby Watts, M.D., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  53 FR 11920 (1987). Dr. Chester is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances in the State of New Mexico wherein he is registered with the DEA. In light of this, the Deputy Administrator concludes that it is not necessary to address whether Dr. Chester's continued registration is otherwise consistent with the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that Dr. Chester's DEA registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration AC3247738, previously issued to Alvin A. Chester, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective on October 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Securities houses reinforce revival SALOMON and Morgan Stanley, two of the largest securities houses in the US, provided fresh evidence of the revival in Wall Street's fortunes yesterday when they unveiled big increases in first-quarter profits. Salomon reported record net income of Dollars 273m, or Dollars 2.30 a share, more than double the Dollars 119m earned a year earlier on revenues of Dollars 690m. Total net revenues were Dollars 1.18bn, against Dollars 690m in 1990. Morgan Stanley posted a 46 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 120.1m, or Dollars 3.07 a share, based on net revenues of Dollars 747.8m, up from Dollars 578.2m in 1990. A string of Wall Street firms has reported dramatically-improved profits for the quarter, a result of the boom in New York share prices, the big rise in trading activity, and the recovery in the underwriting of new stock and bond issues. For Salomon and Morgan Stanley, the main factor behind the improvement was the large rise in revenues from principal trading activities, especially stocks and bonds. At Salomon, income from principal transactions rose nearly 50 per cent to Dollars 968m on the back of strong earnings from proprietary trading and market-making in equities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and government issues. Overseas earnings were also healthy, especially on European fixed-income securities and Asian equities. Investment banking revenues rose by Dollars 15m to Dollars 99m at Salomon, primarily due to a doubling in business from new issues of corporate stocks and bonds, high-yield debt and mortgage-backed securities. The two areas where Salomon performed less impressively were real estate and Phibro Energy, the company's oil trading subsidiary, which posted pre-tax earnings of Dollars 5m, against Dollars 7m a year earlier. The cost of moving to a new headquarters in Manhattan, and an increase in benefits and bonuses paid out alongside higher profits, pushed Salomon's non-interest expenses up to Dollars 696m, against Dollars 489m a year earlier. The earnings picture was similar at Morgan Stanley, where a strong performance from global sales and trading activities, particularly in fixed income, equities, foreign exchange and commodities, lifted revenues from principal transactions to Dollars 392.6m, up from Dollars 277.7m in 1990. Income from investment banking business rose 14.5 per cent, with increased debt and equity underwriting volume offsetting a decline in financial advisory activity. A 33 per cent rise in compensation and benefits expenses to Dollars 373.9m accounted for the bulk of the increase in total outgoings at Morgan Stanley, which totalled Dollars 544.2m in the quarter, up from Dollars 436.6m at the same stage a year ago.</p>

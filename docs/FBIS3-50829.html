			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Commenting on President Alberto Fujimori's calls for  national dialogue, Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont has said that all  talks intended to revive the country's economy would be  positive. He also said that he will submit to Congress a bill on  the basic municipalities law in order to give them more autonomy.    [Begin Belmont recording] Mayors have the right to submit  proposals. We are proposing a much more modern and more  expeditious basic law to grant local governments what they have  been wanting for years: an opportunity to depoliticize their  actions and assume more executive powers, implementing public  works programs with their properties and income to benefit  neighborhoods.    I think that, as the government stated, anything that favors  national consensus, such as the government proposal, is an  excellent idea, because Peru needs to focus on those things that  unite it, not on the few things that divide it.

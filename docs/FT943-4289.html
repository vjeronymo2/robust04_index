			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Market shows relief over Enterprise Oil results Shares in Enterprise Oil rose 13p yesterday to 400p, revealing the market's relief over slightly better-than-expected interim results in spite of record lows in the oil price. A 17 per cent reduction in operating costs, lower exploration expenses and higher production all helped to offset the effects of an 18 per cent fall in average oil prices to Pounds 10.10. Operating profits were 4 per cent higher at Pounds 68.4m on turnover 3 per cent ahead to Pounds 299m. Net profits fell from Pounds 80.6m to Pounds 8.5m. This sharp fall was due to the Pounds 24m costs of the failed bid for Lasmo, interest costs of Pounds 15m (gains of Pounds 5.2m), and the absence of a Pounds 27m tax credit. Last year, the government abolished relief on exploration and appraisal costs which has resulted in higher tax charges this year. The Pounds 24m deficit form the bid covered printing costs, lawyers' fees and due diligence costs. Elf Enterprise, the joint venture with Elf Aquitaine, incurred losses of Pounds 2.2m, against gains of Pounds 9.2m last time. Enterprise increased its production by 25 per cent to 196,450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The dividend was maintained at 6.5p. Earnings fell from 15.8p to 0.1p per share. However, cash flow per share - which is often considered a more appropriate measure for valuing oil companies - was 33p.</p>

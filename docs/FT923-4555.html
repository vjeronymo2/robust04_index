			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Brundtland fires third of cabinet amid jobs crisis MRS Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, yesterday purged a third of her cabinet in a move designed to emphasise unemployment as the government's priority, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo. Most significant is the appointment of Mr Gunnar Berge as local government minister in charge of labour issues, which was formerly the responsibility of the ministry of labour and administration. Mr Berge is Mrs Brundtland's closest party political ally and has also strongly backed her strategy to lead Norway into the European Community. Norway's unemployment, at 7.6 per cent including those on government training schemes, is at a post-war high and has been the single biggest issue undermining Labour support. A general election is due next year.</p>

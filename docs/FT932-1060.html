			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Pounds 208m spent on commercial property INSTITUTIONAL investors spent a net Pounds 208m on commercial property in the first quarter of this year, says the Department of Trade and Industry, Vanessa Houlder writes. The figures show a marked upturn on the final quarter of last year, when institutions sold Pounds 65m more property than they bought. The first quarter figure, however, is down on the Pounds 366m that was invested in the same period last year. Analysts expect a strong increase in the second-quarter investment figures, reflecting a surge in activity in the commercial property market. Some institutions have been attracted back into property by the belief that prices have stopped falling and that property is good value compared with gilts and equities.</p>

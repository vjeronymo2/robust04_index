			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today said  that President Glavkos Kliridhis wants an agreement on the  confidence-building measures, because he firmly believes such an  agreement would break the impasse on the Cyprus issue and open  the way for a Cyprus solution. He added, however, that this  agreement must meet the 21 March deadline of the UN document.    Kasoulidhis said it is important to defend Cypriot  Hellenism's interests, adding that these are valued above all  else. He called on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to  accept the 21 March document if he wants an agreement.    The government spokesman said the continuing delay in  submitting the UN secretary general's report to the Security  Council prompted the Greek Cypriot side to protest vigorously,  but also gave it an opportunity to clarify its position. He  said: It is important for the United Nations, the United  States, Britain, and anyone else who is interested to know that  we will not accept any changes to the 21 March UN document.    Asked if the government considers the Vienna talks to be a  deviation from the procedure, the spokesman said that if the  outcome of the talks is the amending of the 21 March document  then it certainly would be a deviation. He added, however, that  if the outcome is that the Turkish Cypriot side is persuaded to  accept the document as is, then it would not be a deviation.    Kasoulidhis said the Greek Cypriot side will not accept the  presence of Turkish troops in the area stretching from the  Dherynia road to the sea. The spokesman said the United Nations  clarified to the Cypriot Government that no promises were given,  contrary to what the Turkish Cypriot press had reported. He  added: As Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate  special representative in Cyprus, admitted, efforts are being  made on the issues of access and the Famagusta map.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Cliffhanger in Uruguayan poll Uruguayan exit polls pointed to a virtual three-way tie between the main presidential contenders, leaving voters waiting early today for definitive results of the closest election in years. The polling group Equipos Consultores, in common with other polling organisations, put Mr Tabare Vazquez, candidate of the left-wing Encuentro Progresista, marginally ahead of rivals from the Blanco and Colorado parties, with a projected 27 per cent of the national vote. Encuentro was seen as winning easily in Montevideo, the capital. Equipos put the governing Blanco party, which has two presidential candidates - Mr Alberto Volonte and Mr Juan Andres Ramrez - on 23 per cent and Colorado, whose main candidate is former president Julio Maria Sanguinetti, on 21 per cent. Under Uruguay's electoral system, the president must come from the winning party and is not necessarily the candidate who collects the most votes. However, Equipos director Mr Agustin Canzani stressed that a very high 24 per cent of those questioned in exit polls refused to say which way they had voted. Mr Canzani said supporters of the more traditional Blanco and Colorado parties were less likely to divulge their voting preference, rendering Encuentro's apparent lead less conclusive. Other polling organisations, including the statistics department of the University of the Republic, projected less than three percentage points between the first and third-placed candidate. 'At this stage, it would be irresponsible for me to predict who is going to win,' said Mr Canzani, but 'Encuentro's results are looking better as time wears on.' Other analysts agreed that it was too early to make predictions, saying the result could be defined by as few as 15,000 votes. The results of elections will determine whether Uruguay pushes ahead with the free-market reforms cautiously introduced by President Luis Alberto Lacalle. Both Blanco candidates would try to revive the privatisation process and to cut social security costs, while Mr Vazquez and, to some extent Mr Sanguinetti, would probably put a break on the liberalisation process. Whoever becomes president will have to deal with a Congress - whose members were also being elected yesterday - almost certain to be split three ways between the main political blocs. Mr Sanguinetti said last night that Uruguay's electoral system almost inevitably produced 'political fragmentation' and made 'governability a difficult matter'.</p>

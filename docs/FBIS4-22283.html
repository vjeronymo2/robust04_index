Kruglikov, First Deputy Chairman of the  Russian  Federation State Customs Committee  <H5>  Statute on Customs Procedure for Re-Imports </H5>   1. General Provisions    1.1. The re-import of goods is a customs procedure in which  Russian goods which are taken out of the customs territory of  the Russian Federation in accordance with the export customs  procedure are then brought back into this territory within the  deadline set by this statute without the collection of customs  duties, value-added tax, or excise taxes, and without the  application of economic policy restrictions (quotas, licenses,  etc.).    1.2. Foreign goods may not qualify for re-import status, and  neither may Russian goods exported from the customs territory of  the Russian Federation in line with other customs procedures  (requisitions for temporary use, requisitions for agencies  representing the Russian Federation abroad, processing outside  the customs territory, and transit shipments in the event of  transferal through the territory of a foreign state).    The customs procedure for re-imports will not apply to goods  prohibited for import to the Russian Federation and export from  the Russian Federation.    2. Conditions of Qualification for Re-Import Status    2.1. To meet the requirements of the customs procedure for  re-imports, the goods must satisfy the following conditions:    a) they must be goods which were taken out of the territory  of the former USSR (prior to 31 December 1991) or out of the  territory of the Russian Federation (starting on 1 January 1992)  in accordance with the export procedure;    b) they must have been Russian goods until they were  exported--i.e., goods of Russian origin (or originating in the  former USSR prior to 31 December 1991) or goods of foreign  origin which were freely circulated within the territory of the  Russian Federation (or within the territory of the former USSR  prior to 31 December 1991) after the full payment of all customs  fees;    c) they must have been brought back into the customs  territory of the Russian Federation within 10 years after the  date of export.    The date of importation is the date of the acceptance of the  last document required for customs purposes.    The time of export is the date of the acceptance of the  customs export declaration or, in its absence, the date the  goods crossed the border of the former USSR (prior to 31  December 1991) or the border of the Russian Federation (starting  on 1 January 1992);    d) they must be in the same state as at the time of export,  with the exception of changes resulting from natural wear or  shrinkage under normal conditions of shipping and storage and  other cases stipulated in subsections 2.5 and 2.6 of this  statute.    Natural wear or shrinkage and normal conditions of shipping  and storage will be defined by standards and other legislative  instruments in effect in the Russian Federation and pertaining  to this category of goods.    2.2. The fact that the goods qualifying as re-imports are  identical to the goods taken out of the country in line with the  export procedure, the fact that they did leave the country, the  date of export, and the fact that the goods are Russian are to  be established (or confirmed) by a method deemed credible and  legitimate by customs officials. Proving these facts will be the  responsibility of the concerned party.    In the absence of a customs declaration, or if the date the  goods crossed the border cannot be confirmed by a satisfactory  method, the date of export of the goods of Russian origin (or of  former USSR origin prior to 31 December 1991) will be the date  of their manufacture (if only the month of manufacture is known,  the date will be the first of that month, and if only the year  is known, the date will be 1 January of that year). In the  absence of documents listing the date of manufacture, an expert  appraisal may be conducted.    2.3. The use of the goods for production or other commercial  purposes outside the Russian Federation will not preclude the  qualification of these goods as re-imports.    2.4. The application for re-import status may be submitted  by  any person, irrespective of the exporting party.    2.5. If the goods have been damaged or depreciated in some  other sense as a result of an accident or circumstances beyond  human control, these goods may be qualified as re-imports on the  condition that the occurrence of the accident or circumstances  can be confirmed by a method deemed credible and legitimate by  customs officials.    2.6. The goods may have undergone maintenance operations,  minor repairs, including adjustments, and other such operations  while they were outside the Russian Federation on the condition  that the declared value of these goods at the time of export was  not increased as a result of these operations.    The relationship between value at the time of export and  value at the time of importation will be calculated on the basis  of the U.S. dollar. If prices in contracts or other documents  are listed in other currencies, the calculations will be based  on the exchange rate of these currencies in relation to the U.S.  dollar at the time of export or import.    3. Collection of Customs Duties, Taxes, and Other Fees  and Payments    3.1. If the goods are re-imported within three years of the  time of export, the customs agency will refund the export duties  and export taxes paid.    3.2. They will be refunded on the following conditions:    --if the goods were exported and imported by the same person  who paid the export duties or export taxes or on whose behalf  the payments were made;    --if the customs agency is presented with a copy of the  customs declaration used as the basis for the calculation and  payment of export duties or export taxes and written  confirmation from the customs agency to which the payments were  made or from its successor in interest on the actual deposit of  the fees in the account of the customs agency or directly in the  budget. The written confirmation must meet the requirements of  financial documents;    --if the export tax was paid to customs agencies located  within the territory of the Russian Federation;    --if the person mentioned in the second paragraph of this  subsection submits a written request for a refund of the sums  paid to the customs agency. This request may be written in any  format. The request for a refund must be submitted to the  customs agency within one year after the date of acceptance of  the customs declaration qualifying the goods as re-imports.    If even one of these conditions is not met, the paid sums of  export duties and export taxes will not be refunded.    3.3. Only the paid sum of customs duties and export taxes  will be refundable.    Penalties, overdue fines, and other such payments will not  be  refundable.    The refunded sums will not be adjusted for inflation, and no  interest will be paid on these sums.    The refund will be made in the currency of the Russian  Federation, irrespective of the currency in which the customs  duties and export taxes were paid. If the payment was made in a  foreign currency with an exchange rate quoted by the Central  Bank of the Russian Federation, conversion into the currency of  the Russian Federation will be based on the Russian Federation  Central Bank exchange rate on the date of acceptance of the  customs declaration claiming re-import status. If the payment  was made in another foreign currency, its conversion to rubles  will be based on the rate of exchange on the payment date.    3.4. Refunds will be the responsibility of the customs  agency  registering the goods qualifying as re-imports.    3.5. When part of a shipment of exported goods is to be  qualified as re-imports, the refund amount will be based on the  quantitative relationship of this part to the whole shipment of  exported goods.    3.6. The customs official making the refund will note the  return of the paid sums, including partial refunds, on the copy  of the export declaration submitted by the person, and on the  confirmation mentioned in Subsection 3.2. of this statute, by  filling in the amount of the refund (in numbers and words) and  the date of the refund. The notation will be endorsed by the  official's signature and personal number stamp.    A copy of the confirmation noting the refund will be sent to  the customs agency issuing the confirmation. This copy will be  kept with the customs agency's copy of the customs declaration  qualifying the goods as exports.    3.7. Import duties will not be collected on re-imported  goods  when they enter the customs territory of the Russian Federation.    3.8. In the case of re-imports which were exported from the  territory of the Russian Federation after 1 January 1992, the  person making the declaration will pay the customs agency the  value-added tax which was refunded at the time of export or from  which the goods were exempt at the time of export.    The amount subject to payment will be calculated according  to  the rates in effect at the time the goods entered the country.    The basis for calculating the payment amount will depend on  the date of acceptance of the customs declaration qualifying the  goods as re-imports.    The value-added tax privileges granted solely for goods  brought into the customs territory of the Russian Federation  will not apply.    3.9. At the time of the re-import of goods exported from the  territory of the Russian Federation after 1 January 1992, the  person making the declaration will pay excise taxes at the rates  that were in effect at the time of export for goods produced in  the Russian Federation.    The customs value used in the calculation of payment amounts  will be determined on the date of acceptance of the customs  declaration qualifying the goods as re-imports.    4. Customs Registration of Goods Qualifying as  Re-Imports    4.1. The customs registration of re-imported goods will be  conducted in the customs agency whose zone of operations  includes the location of the consignee or a structural  subdivision of the consignee.    4.2. When the goods are to be qualified as re-imports, the  person making the declaration will submit the following  documents to the customs agency:    --a customs freight declaration filled out in accordance  with  the addendum to this statute;    --authorization from other state agencies if the re-imported  goods are subject to control by these agencies;    --a copy of the customs freight declaration qualifying the  re-imported goods as exports, or other documents confirming the  fact and time of the export of these goods from the territory of  the USSR (prior to 31 December 1991) or the territory of the  Russian Federation (starting on 1 January 1992)--bills of  lading, and so forth;    --other documents stipulated or implied by this statute as  necessary for customs registration.    4.3. The decision to qualify the goods as re-imports will be  made by the head of the structural subdivision of the customs  agency or the person authorized to perform his duties in his  absence.    4.4. In the absence of reliable information, confirmed by  the  appropriate documents, on the satisfaction of the requirements  of this statute, the goods may not be qualified as re-imports.    4.5. The customs fees for the customs registration of  re-imported goods will be 0.1 percent of the declared value of  the goods in the currency of the Russian Federation and 0.05  percent of the declared value in a foreign currency with an  exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation.  <H5>  Addendum to Statute on Customs Procedure for Re-Imports </H5> <H5>  Procedure For Filling Out Customs Freight Declaration When </H5> Goods Are To Be Reclassified as Re-Imports    When goods are to be reclassified as re-imports, the person  making the declaration will fill in the following sections of  the customs freight declaration:    Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 15a, 16, 18, 19,  20,  21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42,  44, 46, 47, 50, 54, A, and B.

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television Comedy programmes had been accumulating on Fridays to the point where there were rather too many of them. You had to use the video recorder at 9.00 either for Rory Bremner, now much our best impressionist, on BBC2, or for Cheers on Channel 4, though admittedly this series set in a Boston singles bar currently consists of repeats. At 10.00 came one of the week's funniest programmes, the game show based on recent news stories, Have I Got News For You (BBC2), followed promptly by Clive Anderson Talks Back on C4 at 10.30. All that is still the case, and now what have they done? Added a new series on BBC1, Joker In The Pack, in which Marti Caine introduces 'ordinary people with a natural joke-telling talent'. This, too, takes the form of a game show, with competing teams in the studio and the audience joining in with favourite jokes. However, the most remarkable of Friday's funny programmes are usually Made In The USA in which Laurie Pike illustrates some of the wilder aspects of Amerika by way of clips from cable television (11.10 C4); and Married With Children, an American sitcom which exults in pre-political correctness attitudes.</p>

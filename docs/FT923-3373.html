			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Speyhawk reduces loss to Pounds 9.5m SPEYHAWK, the property developer that is trying to restructure its debts of more than Pounds 300m, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.54m for the six months to end-March. That compared with a Pounds 10.58m loss for the same period last year and followed a deficit of Pounds 216.8m for the year to September 30 1991, when it made Pounds 205m of provisions against its properties. Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman, said he hoped to be able to report the successful outcome of its restructuring discussions 'before Christmas'. The talks, which began over a year ago, have been drawn out because of the large number of banks involved. In April, the company said that its 46 banks and lending institutions, led by Barclays and Citibank, had agreed in principle to restructure their loans of Pounds 303m and provide it with working capital for four years. Speyhawk's heavy losses have made the company technically insolvent, with liabilities that exceed assets by about Pounds 80m. In his statement, Mr Osborne underlined the depressed state of the property market, which is in its worst recession for over 50 years. 'There are no signs of an immediate improvement in market conditions, making any return to profitability unlikely for some time,' he said. He blamed the company's 'disappointing' level of lettings on the oversupply of office space in London and the recession, which curtailed demand. As a result, few fully let properties were put on the market, which was 'sluggish and somewhat unreceptive'. Sales consisted of a number of small transactions. For the first six months turnover of Pounds 10.74m compared with Pounds 42.54m. Interest costs amounted to Pounds 9.54m, while overheads were Pounds 2.6m. Losses per share were reduced from 45.8p to 41.2p.</p>

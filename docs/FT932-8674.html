			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Business and the Law: Spanish film rules unlawful - European Court Spanish restrictions which prevent foreign language films from being subtitled in the official Spanish languages unless the film distributor agrees to distribute a Spanish language film in return have been struck down by the European Court of Justice. The court ruled the restrictions were contrary to Rome Treaty provisions on the freedom to provide services. These prohibit the discriminatory treatment of a service provider by reason of nationality or because the provider is in a different member state from that in which the service is performed. The court said the Spanish rules clearly gave Spanish film producers an advantage over other EC producers. The effect was to protect Spanish film production. The Court rejected the Spanish argument that the measures pursued a cultural objective and therefore should be allowed. The rules advantaged the distribution of domestic films, regardless of their content or quality. They pursued a commercial objective and there was no reason why Spain should be allowed to derogate from the basic Treaty provisions.

Commission's immunity from debt orders The European Court has rejected an action by a third party creditor against the European Commission for failure to give effect to a debt order. The Court said goods of the Community institutions could not be the object of an administrative or judicial measure without its prior authorisation. It also rejected a claim for non-contractual damages. The case concerned money paid from the European Development Fund by the Commission to the government of Burkina Faso for development projects. Some of the project was sub-contracted to the applicant, who carried out the work but only received 10 per cent of the money due. The sub-contractor wrote to the Commission asking for its position to be taken into account when the Commission authorised payments to Burkina Faso for the projects. Six months later the sub-contractor sent the Commission a debt order to protect its rights to the money owed. The Commission refused to be bound by the order on the grounds its immunity from such an order could only be lifted by the European Court. The sub-contractor sought to annul that decision. The Court said the Community institutions had an immunity which could only be lifted by the agreement of an institution or by express authority of the court. The sub-contractor had not applied to the court for such an authorisation so the Commission's immunity remained. The application for non-contractual damages was rejected on the ground the Commission had not acted unlawfully. C-182/91: Forafrique Burkinabe SA v Commission, ECJ 5CH, 29 April 1993. Application for interim measures fails The President of the Court of First Instance rejected an application by Compagnie Maritime Belge, the Belgian shipping company, for interim measures in the form of a suspension of part of the European Commission's decision of 23 December 1992 about the activities of shipping conferences involved in providing transport services between Europe and West Africa. The Commission decision found the conferences and their members had infringed EC competition rules. Fines were imposed and the conferences were ordered to stop the infringements. The applicant challenged the order to stop infringements in so far as they related to participation in the implementation of a co-operation agreement with Zaire. The President found CMB had not demonstrated that it could not wait until the outcome of the main hearing without suffering serious and irreparable harm.

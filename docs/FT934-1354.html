			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Romania wins no-confidence vote Romania's minority government has hung on to power after narrowly winning a no-confidence motion lodged by pro-reform opposition parties, reports Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. After 13 hours of debate, the motion was overturned by 236-223 late on Friday. It was the opposition's fourth no-confidence motion this year, but the first based on exclusively economic grounds.</p>

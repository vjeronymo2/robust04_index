			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The fire that destroyed the Farmers Bazaar and the century-old building that  housed it was started by an "electrical problem," Sgt. Frank Barone from the  Metro Arson Strike Team said Wednesday. Investigators believe the fire erupted  in the arcade room on the mezzanine level, he added.  </P> <P> Although investigators are uncertain what caused the electrical problem, Barone  said witnesses told investigators the building was plagued by problems with the  electrical system that led to power outages and tripped switches. There are no  plans to file criminal charges in the incident, he said.  </P> <P> The Farmers Bazaar burned down last week in a four-alarm fire battled by about  120 firefighters, who struggled with the flames for two hours. The bazaar was a  downtown produce emporium of common and exotic vegetables, situated near L  Street and 7th Avenue. The building also included a barber shop, fish market  and restaurants.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported among the estimated 200 shopkeepers and 50 employees  inside at the time. But four firefighters suffered minor injuries in fighting  the fire.  </P></p>

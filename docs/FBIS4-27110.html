			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  denounce the traitor Kim Yong-sam for whipping up a war fever  during his "inspection" of units of the puppet ground, naval and  air forces.    An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam recently "inspected" units of the  puppet Army and incited confrontation and war, crying for  "establishment of an iron-wall alert posture against the North."  This fully revealed the treacherous nature of the "civilian"  warmaniac who seeks a way out in opposing fellow countrymen in  collusion with outside forces.    The traitor is these days letting no chance pass by without  giving a shriek, as if invasion from the North were imminent.  But no one lends an ear to his outcry reminding one of the  guilty party filing the suit first.    The Kim Yong-sam group is openly having confabs with  bellicose quarters of the United States for a war against the  North and unhesitatingly talking about "retaliatory punishment"  and "opportunity of unification," while raising outcries over  "nuclear suspicion" against the North.    The South Korean puppets have even worked out with the  United States a war scenario against the North codenamed "New  Operation Plan 5027." Judging from this, their current movements  are very ill- boding.    The traitors bereft of reason, driven to a blind alley,  might  ignite a war any moment. However, it cannot be a way out for  them but and will only precipitate their own destruction.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns: The Korean people and People's  Army are always vigilant against the military moves of the  puppets and, if they attempt to harm fellow countrymen in  collusion with outside forces, will sternly punish them.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Inco loss deepens in final term to Dollars 39.2m Inco, faced with the lowest nickel prices in six years, posted a fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 39.2m, or 36 cents a common share, against a loss of USDollars 30.1m, or 28 cents, a year earlier, on net sales of Dollars 516m against Dollars 612m. Helped by a strong third quarter, the world's leading nickel-copper-platinum producer reported net profit for all 1993 of Dollars 24m, or 22 cents, against a loss of Dollars 22.3m, or 21 cents, on net sales of Dollars 2.13bn against Dollars 2.56bn. The results were slightly worse than analysts expected. The figures are stated after preferred dividends in both years. In 1993, Inco included a Dollars 187m gain from the sale of a subsidiary. Realised nickel prices were the lowest since 1987, said Inco. The average was Dollars 2.42 a pound in the fourth quarter and Dollars 2.72 in all 1993, down 20 per cent from 1992. Inco reduced output by 33m lbs last year and will make another cut of 40m lbs in the first quarter this year. LME cash prices have strengthened recently and Inco says its production plans for the remainder of 1994 are flexible.</p>

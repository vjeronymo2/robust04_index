			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Federal oxygen facilitates the hazardous ascent of three summits WALL STREET's final quarter of 1991 was not for the faint-hearted. After rising steadily if unspectacularly in the opening six weeks, US stock markets were hit in mid-November by a 120-point plunge in the Dow Jones index. Yet within six weeks, investors had recovered enough of their composure to construct a dramatic late rally that powered the major indices to a succession of all-time highs. Between the beginning of October and the end of December, the Dow rose from 3,016.77 to 3,168.83, a gain of just over 5 per cent. The broader market fared even better, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advancing 7.5 per cent, from 387.86 to 492.72, and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks rising almost 60 points, or 11 per cent, to 586.34. All three indices finished the year at previously unachieved summits. The dominant influences throughout the period were monetary policy and the state of the economy. The former became ever more accommodating as the latter slipped further into stagnation. The quarter opened with a mixed bag of earnings results, the expected disappointments (the car manufacturers' big losses, and IBM's 85 per cent decline in profits) mingling with the occasional shocks (Citicorp's massive write-off and Dollars 885m loss). Thanks to hopes for lower interest rates, share prices edged higher during the first month, despite the gloomy news from the corporate front. The lack of an easing in monetary policy wiped out some of October's advances, but in early November hopes of cheaper credit were realised when the Federal Reserve reacted to some horrible unemployment numbers by lowering the discount rate by half of a percentage point to 4.5 per cent. The rate-cut boosted market sentiment, and the Dow again flirted with new highs. Yet the news on the economy got worse, and by mid-November the official data showed an economy trapped in a spiral of rising unemployment, declining sales, waning consumer confidence and stalled industrial production. Eventually something had to give, and on November 15 the Dow plunged 120 points amid panic selling. Although a throwaway remark from President Bush about imposing a cap on credit-card interest rates, and the subsequent drafting by Congress of legislation aimed at doing just that, was blamed for the sell-off, more fundamental concerns about the lack of an economic recovery were behind the losses. The sharp declines in stocks - especially among small, biotechnology issues  -were heralded by some as a necessary correction to an overvalued market, and for the next month the market struggled to hold its ground as the bad economic statistics piled up. The mood changed suddenly after the Fed cut the discount rate by a full percentage point to 3.5 per cent on December 20. The cut - the biggest for a decade - took interest rates to their lowest levels for almost 30 years. Inspired by the relative attractiveness of stocks compared with other, lower-yielding securities, investors dived into the market with gusto. Between December 21 and New Year's Eve the Dow rose by 230 points. Betting that the Fed's aggressive easing would spark a recovery within six months, investors saw stocks as the best home for their money in 1992. In Canada, share prices mostly kept in step with Wall Street, although concerns about the weakness of the domestic economy restricted gains. Over the quarter, the Toronto composite index climbed from 3,387.88 to 3,512.40, a gain of 3.6 per cent. In Mexico, expectations of lower domestic interest rates, and of the possible benefits to be had from the free trade pact with the US and Canada (which should be signed in 1992), fuelled a 14 per cent gain in the Bolsa index in local currency terms. The Bolsa ended the year at 1,432.46.</p>

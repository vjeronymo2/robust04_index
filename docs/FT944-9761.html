			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Italy prepares to re-enter the fray - International Italy looks set to be in the spotlight over the next few days in the international bond markets. Political uncertainty, which has been worrying the bond markets for much of the year, has been highlighted by this weekend's demonstrations in Rome against the budget proposals of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government. A parliamentary vote of confidence, called by the government on Friday and scheduled to take place today, will provide a further immediate focus while debates on the budget are expected to continue until the end of the year. In addition, Italy is widely expected to re-enter the euromarkets soon, with a Y400bn eurobond, in tranches of three-, 10-and 20-year maturities, reported to be in the offing. That deal, which has not been confirmed, would be consistent with the government's long-term strategy of broadening its investor base and lengthening the maturity profile of its debt. After making considerable headway in 1992 and 1993, the government has run into problems. On top of a general disenchantment with bonds generally, triggered by the February increase in US interest rates, overseas investors have been particularly worried by Italy's debt, which is expected to reach 128 per cent of GDP in 1995, and its fiscal deficit. Since May, bond prices have fallen and yields risen, both in absolute terms and relative to the German bund. The yield spread between the 10-year Italian bond and the bund narrowed from more than 650 basis points in early 1993 to fewer than 300 points earlier this year. Since May, however, it has climbed steadily, hovering around 450 basis points in trading over the past two months. Foreigners have led the sell-off, with overseas investors accounting for less than 10 per cent of the overall lira debt compared with about 15 per cent last year. Analysts also suggest the average maturity of the debt - extended by six months to three years and five months since the end of 1992  -may have been shortened since the summer because the treasury has been forced to rely on shorter-term paper to cover its financing needs. After an initial welcome for Mr Berlusconi's election 'the euphoria has waned', says Mr Jose Luis Alzola, analyst with Salomon Brothers. The delay in publication of the government's financial programme in July contributed to scepticism, while in August an increase in the discount rate from 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent followed selling pressure on bonds and on the lira. Investors have become concerned that measures to reduce the fiscal deficit contained in the 1995 budget proposals, currently before parliament, are insufficiently radical and that political tensions may interfere with the budget's approval. 'The budget relies excessively on one-off measures, thereby postponing more significant action for subsequent years,' insists Mr Alzola. 'The markets are pretty sceptical. Longer-term, the risk remains that persistently high fiscal deficits will trigger further currency weakness and high inflation,' he adds. Inflation reached a 25-year low of 3.6 per cent in the summer, but the markets are still worried or, in the words of Mr Richard Benzie, analyst with UBS, 'deeply spooked' by the prospect of rising prices. 'It is hard to get bullish,' agrees Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist with Paribas Capital Markets, who says that part of the problem is the character of Italy's political process. 'It is so drawn out, so painful,' he says of the discussions surrounding the 1995 budget. 'The budget will be a focus for the markets until the end of the year.' There are grounds to suggest that these fears are overdone. Worries that the debt burden will directly increase pressure on interest rates - by increasing government pressure on a limited pool of savings - may be exaggerated. This is partly because the government is no longer so dependent on the domestic markets because of changes both in the international market and in Italy's own financial system. Italy's capital market is now much more open and integrated with the rest of the world, notes Mr Giorgio Radaelli, senior economist with Lehman Brothers International. He suggests that the emphasis on debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is misplaced and that the ratio between debt and private financial wealth is a more appropriate benchmark. 'What drives real yields down in the long run is the ratio between debt and private financial wealth. Prospects for this ratio are neutral to good,' he says. Also, Italy has 'so far under-utilised foreign currency issuance as a source of funds,' he explains. Italy followed up a Y300bn eurobond issue in January, co-led by JP Morgan and Daiwa, with a Dollars 4bn five-year deal in D-Marks, dollars and yen in July. Even after those issues, foreign currency debt still amounted to less than 4 per cent of total debt: further grounds, perhaps, for the markets to believe that a new euro issue is in the pipeline.</p>

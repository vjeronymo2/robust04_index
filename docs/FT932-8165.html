			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / 'Going concern' guidelines issued DIRECTORS should provide more details in the annual report of whether their company is a 'going concern' for the next year, under draft guidelines issued yesterday by a working party of accountants and accounts preparers. They should disclose any critical assumptions on the future of the company, including the need for financing arrangements to be in place 'for the foreseeable future'. The guidelines from the working group on going concern fleshes out details of a statement on this area recommended by the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. Quoted companies will have to make a statement of compliance with the code for year-ends after June 30. The working group suggested that the directors' statement would ideally be placed in the new operating and financial review section in annual reports recently recommended by the Accounting Standards Board. It has invited comments on its draft by July 16 and hopes a revised version will then be approved by the Cadbury committee and be ready by the end of September.</p>

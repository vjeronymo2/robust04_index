			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: A quiet French corner PROVENCE, it seems, is passe. The Dordogne has been done to death. Where next for the discerning British francophile trying to beat the crowds to a little corner of real rural France? Well, one could do worse than Languedoc Tarn - the hinterland of Toulouse, in the south west. Barry Fryer has gone to the extent of buying a small dilapidated chateau standing in 55 acres of parkland half an hour's drive from the city. It used to belong to the English secretary of Charles de Gaulle, the French president, during the last war. Fryer is an architect/developer, and Chateau Seran is an ambitious project. He is restoring and converting the chateau's outbuildings into individual apartments and houses for sale, keeping the main building and grounds as a select country club. It is his third such development in the area having completed and sold all 24 houses in his previous two projects. Outbuildings have been converted into a selection of cottages and houses for sale, some with their own private gardens, some without. The first have been completed. There will be 20 in all, priced from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds 95,000 - and they will include mod cons like central heating and washing machines. Fryer's preoccupation is with quality artisan workmanship, in keeping with the character of the buildings themselves: he stresses preservation and restoration, opting for plain whitewashed walls, tiled or stripped floors, and hardwood fitments. An annual maintenance charge of Pounds 1,000 covers services including security and maintenance checks and full use of club facilities including tennis courts,a pool, riding stables (the chateau is surrounded by 50km of bridleways), a restaurant, billiard room and business facilities. It is planned to open the country club to a limited non-resident local membership as well. Full details are available from Fryer at Chateau Seran, 81500 Massac, Lavaur, France.

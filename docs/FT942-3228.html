			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (8): From blueprint to reality - Paul Taylor looks at advances in satellite-based services Within five years a new generation of telecommunications satellites is likely to provide a truly global mobile telephone service, using light- weight pocket-sized handsets. Already, plans for satellite mobile communications systems such as Iridium, Globalstar and Inmarsat-P have become a hot topic for discussion in the industry. Geo-stationary satellites play a key role in fixed and mobile telecommunications networks, providing voice, data and video links over continents and oceans, maritime and aeronautical communications where land-based systems are not an option and global positioning and tracking services for military and commercial customers. On both sides of the Atlantic they are increasingly used to provide cost-effective two-way Vsat (very small aperture terminal) satellite voice and data telecommunications services to businesses. Datamonitor, the market research organisation, expects European satellite business service revenues to grow from about Dollars 140m in 1991 to Dollars 365m in 1997 - the fastest growing segment of the satellite communications market. Satellites can also provide telecommunications facilities to geologists, journalists, aid-workers and others in remote regions of the world using briefcase-size portable terminals, such as those supplied by Inmarsat, the London-based 74-member International Maritime Satellite Organisation. Inmarsat uses five operational satellites to provide services to 40,000 customers, most of them in its specialist maritime and aeronautical markets. Geo-stationary communications satellites usually operate at an altitude of around 22,300 miles. In contrast, most of the latest proposals are based on low-earth orbit (Leo) satellites which operate at between 400 and 1,000 miles. Over the past few years, about half a dozen Leo-based systems have been unveiled by international consortia. As Mr Robert Rosenberg of the Washington-based Insight Research organisation points out, 'it doesn't take a lot of money to slap a proposal down.' Turning these blueprints into reality is likely to be considerably more difficult and as KPMG Peat Marwick concluded in a recent study for the European Commission, 'limits on finance and radio spectrum probably mean that only two or three of the systems will ever reach the launch stage.' Among the front-runners are the Dollars 3.4bn Iridium project, conceived by Motorola, the US-based electronics group, and the Dollars 1.8bn Globalstar project developed by Loral, the US defence group. Iridium will be based on a 'constellation' of 66 small Leo satellites weighing 1,500 lbs ringing the earth at a height of 420 nautical miles. Handsets for use of the system will be dual-mode, also allowing calls to be made on the local cellular network where available. When a call cannot be routed via the terrestrial cellular network it will be relayed to the nearest satellite, transferring between satellites if necessary before being beamed down through one of 15 to 20 terrestrial gateways connected to the public telephone network or direct to its destination. Last August Motorola announced that after years of funding the research itself, it had raised Dollars 800m from an international consortium, including Raytheon, Lockheed and Sprint of the US, Bell Canada and a consortium of 18 Japanese companies including Sony, Mitsubishi and Kyocera as a first stage towards financing the Iridium project. As prime contractor for Iridium, Motorola will be responsible for designing and building the entire network and has a Dollars 2.8bn contract to maintain and operate the system for five years after its commercial debut in 1998. By then, Motorola's stake in the project is expected to have fallen from 34 per cent to 15 per cent. The financing agreement appears to have given Iridium a lead in the race to build a satellite-based mobile telephone system based on Leo technology once the US Federal Communications Commission approves licensing later this year. However, Iridium is likely to face fierce competition from Globalstar which has secured Dollars 275m of funding from an international consortium that includes AirTouch Communications (formerly PacTel) and Qualcomm of the US, Alcatel of France, Deutsche Aerospace, Vodafone of the UK and Hyundai Electronics of Korea. Globalstar will use 48 Leo satellites orbiting at 750 nautical miles. It has been designed by Loral as a low-cost global access satellite-based mobile telephone system. Globalstar telephones will be similar in size and cost to digital cellular telephones and will be able to make and receive calls anywhere in the world. A key feature of the proposed Globalstar system is that all calls will be set up and processed on the ground by a distributed gateway system. Loral claims the ground processing not only permits a more efficient, less complex and cheaper satellite network, it also uses, rather than bypasses, existing communications carriers. Because Leos are closer to earth than Geo-stationary satellites, they will work with much less powerful - and therefore smaller, lighter and cheaper equipment - Globalstar's dual-mode handset is expected to cost about Dollars 750. But there are also disadvantages. Leo satellite technology is costly and largely untested. The satellites themselves will have a relatively short life span - between five to eight years for Iridium satellites compared with 10 years or more for conventional Geos. In addition, so as to provide reliable global coverage many more Leos are needed than would be the case with their higher-flying counterparts. This also means a large number of launches, and an extended roll-out period. In an effort to overcome some of these technical and other problems and meet the concerns of some its members Inmarsat, which had originally planned to build its own Leo system, has opted instead for a system based on a new intermediate circular orbit satellites orbiting at 10,000km. The Inmarsat-P system will cost Dollars 2.4bn and be developed by an affiliate company, at least 70 per cent owned by Inmarsat and its signatories, which will also invite outside investment. It will use 12 to 15 satellites and be operational by 1999 or 2000. To supplement revenues from voice traffic most of these new satellite systems also plan to provide facsimile, paging, computer data and position determination services. This will bring them into direct competition with another group of network operators who plan to use 'little' Leos to provide non-voice telecommunications services - and with Teledesic, a Dollars 9bn satellite communications project backed by Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and Mr Craig McCaw, of McCaw Cellular Communications, the No 1 US cellular telephone company. Teledesic's plans call for 840 little Leos to be put into orbit 435 miles above the earth. The system, due to come into operation by 2001, is designed to deliver high capacity data, video and voice services worldwide using receivers and small antennas installed in homes and businesses. Just how large a market there will be for these voice and other services by the end of the century is the subject of considerable debate. KPMG's study suggested that the value satellite delivered mobile phone services will reach Ecu10-20bn a year within the next decade. Among the prospective network operators, Iridium expects to have 1.5m subscribers by 2002 while Globalstar expects to be collecting Dollars 1.5bn in revenues from 2.7m subscribers by the same year, with subscriber number growing to 16m by 2012. Nevertheless, some analysts question whether Leos make economic sense as a mass market voice telecom delivery system in competition with much cheaper terrestrial-based networks, while others caution that there are still formidable non-economic obstacles to be overcome, including the vexed issue of who should license and regulate these new global telecommunications services.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Armen Khanbabyan under the rubric "Armenia": "Who </F> Killed the Former Chairman of the Republic KGB: Minister of  Internal Affairs Accuses Lubyanka"]    [Text] Armenian Minister of Internal Affairs Vano  Siragedyan held a press conference on 25 January. In particular,  in answering the question as to what he thinks about the recent  elimination of the State National Security Administration of  Armenia and fundamental reorganization of the special services,  Vano Siragedyan said that overall this is a positive development  and emphasized that as a result of such a reorganization perhaps  a serious investigation will be opened into the case of the  murder last year of the former chairman of the Armenian KGB,  General Marius Yuzbashyan, and of a number of crimes committed  in similar style. Vano Siragedyan did not rule out that General  Yuzbashyan had been eliminated by specialists of the former USSR  KGB, since this crime was organized very professionally. For  instance, the general was killed with one shot, but several  spent cartridges were left at the scene of the crime in order to  confuse the real picture of the crime. According to Siragedyan,  Yuzbashyan knew quite a bit about the period when the processes  that eventually led to the current situation around  Nagorno-Karabakh were still at the inception stage. He knew who  was acting and how, and for this reason alone could become an  undesirable and stand in the way of certain forces in Moscow.    In addition, the Armenian minister of internal affairs  dwelled on the accusations leveled against him by a well-known  Moscow businessman, Serzh Dzhilavyan. Let us recall that  Dzhilavyan recently accused Vano Siragedyan of allegedly wanting  to organize his assassination. Siragedyan, in turn, remarked  that he has no intention of responding to such accusations,  because doing so would mean making a sort of political figure  out of a complete nonentity, which is what, in the minister's  opinion, the Moscow businessman is. At the same time, Siragedyan  said: "By making these sort of statements and accusations the  Moscow businessman has committed a very serious mistake. Sooner  or later he will be killed, either by creditors or by mafiosi  which make up this man's circle. Nobody in Russia, however, will  look for them or investigate the matter," said the minister,  "because Dzhilavyan himself has already pointed in the direction  of the so-called Armenian trail. After that, it is unlikely that  anybody would seriously look into his case when Dzhilavyan is  indeed killed by mafiosi."</p>

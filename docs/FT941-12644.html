			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Repayment mortgages are back - What's new? In recent years, repayment mortgages have become almost unmentionable among lenders. They preferred to promote mortgages backed by endowment policies, and which promised at once the prospect of a return in excess of the loan to the borrower and fat commission to the lender. But the virtues of repayment mortgages are beginning to become a selling point, now that bonus cuts by insurance companies have raised doubts about whether endowment policies will in future produce enough money to pay off the loans that they back. The Australian-owned Yorkshire Bank, operating beyond the bounds of its eponymous county, is the latest institution to suggest that homebuyers may be able to make substantial savings by using a repayment mortgage and increasing payments each year to shorten the term. For example, Yorkshire Bank says that someone borrowing Pounds 30,000 via its flexible-payment mortgage, and increasing the initial monthly payment of Pounds 186.76 by 1.5 per cent a year, would pay off the loan in 17 years 9 months, instead of the standard 25 years. Assuming the bank's current variable mortgage rate of 7.65 per cent on the flexible payment mortgage (APR 8 per cent), the borrower would repay a total of Pounds 56,662, or Pounds 11,753 less than by repaying over 25 years. On the same basis, a borrower of Pounds 50,000 would repay a total of Pounds 94,273 over 17 years 9 months: Pounds 19,597 less than over 25 years. Yorkshire Bank charges an arrangement fee of Pounds 150 on the flexible payment mortgage, which must be repaid by the borrower's 65th birthday. This means borrowers will have to be under 40, because the bank wants them to be able to switch back to the 25-year term if increasing payments to reduce the term become too onerous. The bank also sets the minimum loan in terms of the monthly payment that a borrower would have had to make on a 25-year mortgage. There is no upper limit, though the bank uses its normal criterion of three times main salary, plus any secondary salary. There are no penalties or fees for early redemption, in part or in full. Repayments can be made weekly, fortnightly or monthly, and interest is calculated daily. Borrowers select the level of payment the intend to make each year. UCB Home Loans Corporation, based in Sutton, Surrey, has just launched the Term Master repayment mortgage, allowing borrowers the choice of monthly repayment, which can be altered at will on payment of Pounds 25 for each change. Higher payments reduce the term. For example, a borrower paying Pounds 327 a month towards a Pounds 50,000 Term Master mortgage would repay the loan in 25 years, assuming UCB's current variable rate of 7.49 per cent (APR 7.8 per cent). A Pounds 34 increase in the monthly payment would cut the term by five years, saving about Pounds 14,000 on the total cost of the mortgage. UCB has an administration fee of Pounds 200, and charges a penalty of one month's interest if borrowers redeem the mortgage before the full term last arranged. Foreign &amp; Colonial, the investment trust group, this week launched a pension plan to be invested in its flagship Pounds 1.6bn F&amp;C Investment Trust. The F&amp;C pension savings plan will be available either as a personal pension or as an additional voluntary contributions (AVC) plan, with minimum contributions of Pounds 5,000 as a lump sum, Pounds 1,000 a year or Pounds 100 per month. Charges on the plan are to be fixed at an initial Pounds 100, plus a renewal charge of Pounds 50 a year and a fund management charge of 0.5 per cent. As investors in the F&amp;C Investment Trust, pension plan holders will have full shareholders' rights to vote and attend the annual general meeting, which will also give them an opportunity to question the trust's fund managers. After some months of negotiation with the Inland Revenue, Provident Life will next week launch a flexible annuity portfolio, which will allow people to retire but leave most of their accumulated pension fund invested, instead of having to buy an annuity immediately. Customers transferring at least Pounds 150,000 to the flexible annuity portfolio from either occupational schemes or personal pensions, including Section 32 buy-out policies, will receive a minimum payment of Pounds 7,500 a year. They will have the option of converting to a guaranteed annuity at any time, but conversion is automatic if the fund falls below the Pounds 7,500 minimum. Negotiations with the Revenue focused on whether the annual payments could correctly be defined as an annuity - Provident Life said they could, as current law describes an annuity as a source of pension payments. Customers can invest either in Provident Life's own funds or in a range of other investments of their choice. Provident Life says the portfolio is much more flexible than other phased retirement arrangements on the market, noting that it will allow customers to remain invested beyond the age of 75 instead of being compelled to buy a final annuity at that point. Commission is not loaded into the product but is negotiable.</p>

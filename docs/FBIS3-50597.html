The Nicaraguan people, especially the Sandinists,  happily join in celebrating this historic date, which symbolizes  freedom and dignity for the Cuban people, the Latin American and  Caribbean peoples, and the peoples from the North and South who  have been able to appreciate the importance of this event.    In its 35 years, the Cuban Revolution has been able to  overcome the many obstacles placed by the intolerant U.S.  Governments: the blockade, the attacks, the invasions, the sting  operations, and the slanderous campaigns. All these obstacles,  among others, have sought to deny the Cuban people their right  to self-determination.    Marti's people have not weakened or given up during these 35  years; on the contrary, they have risen amid the aggressors'  onslaughts. Cuba has been able to resist and show solidarity to  the world's peoples. The Nicaraguan people have indelible and  priceless memories of the generosity of these heroic people.    A century is about to end, and a new millennium is about to  start, but it is painful to see how, despite the meteoric  technological developments achieved by humanity, we will reach  the next millennium without having eradicated famine, poverty,  and the degradation of human beings. Quite the contrary, such  scourges have worsened in most countries. It is even more  painful to see how the U.S. Governments, acting above national  and international laws with impunity, have been the first to  deny Cuban people the right to build freely a society free of  illiteracy and high infant mortality, and, above all, a society  that is dignifying for human beings.    On this 35th anniversary of the victory of the Cuban  Revolution, may you, Comrade Fidel, the Cuban people, and your  party receive tokens of love and solidarity from the people of  Augusto Sandino and Ruben Dario. We trust that Cuba will reach  the next century with a stronger revolution that is free of the  U.S. blockade and the meddling of U.S. rulers.    Greetings from the Sandinist National Liberation Front and  from the Nicaraguan people. Best wishes for you and your people.  Fraternally,  [Signed] Daniel Ortega Saavedra</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: MGM cuts loss despite drop in film revenues METRO-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio taken over by Credit Lyonnais, its French bank creditor, yesterday reported reduced first-quarter losses. Net losses were Dollars 51.21m, against Dollars 87.4m a year earlier, on lower revenues of Dollars 196m compared with Dollars 298.9m. The net losses include extraordinary losses of Dollars 9.83m on repurchases of debt during the quarter. As a result the company anticipates lower interest costs in the future. Last year's first-quarter results included a one-off charge of Dollars 33m related to changes in accounting for income tax. MGM said the results for the current period reflected a fall in feature film revenues due to quarter-to-quarter differences in the timing of theatrical releases and availability of product for home video and pay television markets. Revenues in the feature films and television programming operations dropped to Dollars 149.2m from Dollars 243.5m. Theatre revenues fell to Dollars 46.87m from Dollars 55.37m, mainly due to currency fluctuations. MGM said theatre operations remained profitable and investment in multiplex theatres in Europe would continue. Mr Alan Ladd and Mr Dennis Stanfill, co-chairmen, said the company had 'accelerated MGM's development and production activities with the support of Credit Lyonnais'. They indicated, however, that these increased activities would not be immediately reflected in the company's results, due to the long lead times for development and production of feature films.</p>

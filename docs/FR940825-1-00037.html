			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following provides a discussion of the comments received on the 1988 proposed rule, and notes the changes that HUD made, and declined to make in the 1994 proposed rule as a result of these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Restrictions To Apply on Effective Date of Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in section III.B. of the preamble, the 1994 proposed rule uses, as did the 1988 proposed rule, the phrase ``the effective date of the final rule'' in lieu of the statutory phrase_``date of enactment'' of the 1987 Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Eligible Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Noncitizen Eligibility Limited to Statutory Categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two housing agencies and a legal services organization stated that Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAWs) and Replenishment Agricultural Workers (RAWs) should be included in the rule's list of noncitizens with eligible immigration status. These two categories of noncitizens were authorized to be given temporary lawful resident status by IRCA, which also granted amnesty to noncitizens who had resided illegally in the United States since before January 1, 1982. Although a later amendment to the HUD statute governing eligible immigration status for these programs (the 1987 Housing Act) clarified that the latter category of noncitizens have eligible status, it did not refer to the SAWs and RAWs. For this reason, the 1988 proposed rule did not include SAWs and RAWs as having eligible status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, after reviewing the language of IRCA pertaining to SAWs and RAWs (amending sections 210 and 210A of the Immigration and Nationality Act), and consulting with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) about the interpretation to be given sections 210(a)(5) and 210A(d)(4) (8 U.S.C. 1160 and 1161), HUD determined that noncitizens admitted for temporary or permanent lawful residence under these sections have eligible status, as long as their status has not expired or changed. In a letter to HUD dated December 17, 1993, the INS noted that as a practical matter, no additional RAWS were admitted during Federal fiscal years 1990 through 1993, the period in which RAWS could have been admitted, and stated that no noncitizens ``were or will be admitted as RAWs.'' Consequently, the 1994 proposed rule includes reference to SAWs, but not RAWs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter urged that HUD add to its list of the categories of eligible noncitizens two categories not expressly recognized by the statute as having such status: (1) Noncitizens who have lived, worked and paid taxes in the United States for many years and who will become legal permanent residents in the near future, such as relatives of citizens or permanent residents; and (2) noncitizens who are so elderly, ill, or disabled that the INS will not deport them on humanitarian grounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD lacks the legal authority to add these categories of individuals to the list of those eligible for admission to the programs covered by this rule. However, if individuals meeting these descriptions already reside in assisted housing, they may qualify for continued assistance under the regulatory provisions pertaining to mixed families if they live with citizens or permanent residents, or for deferral of termination of assistance if they are unable to locate alternative suitable housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Ineligibility of Noncitizen Students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 214 provides that noncitizen students who are not immigrants (i.e., are not seeking to establish residency in the United States) are not eligible for assistance. The Congress passed the provision concerning nonimmigrant student noncitizens (sec. 164, Pub. L. 100&hyph;242, 101 Stat. 1861) in the late fall of 1987, directly targeted against noncitizen students who are nonimmigrant in very emphatic language: `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may not make financial assistance available for the benefit of'' a noncitizen student who is a nonimmigrant. (Emphasis added) HUD lacks the authority to modify this mandate. However, the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;404, dated October 9, 1992, allows certain persons who may have been admitted to the United States as noncitizen students who are nonimmigrants to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent residents of the United States, and thus become eligible noncitizens under this rule. (See 8 CFR part 245 as amended on July 1, 1993, 58 FR 35832.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD, however, has interpreted the restrictions on assistance to noncitizen students as not applying to the citizen spouse of a noncitizen student or to the children of the citizen spouse and noncitizen student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Submission of Evidence of Eligible Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Documentation Requirements_Who Submits What  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter urged HUD to require all applicants and tenants, whether citizens or noncitizens, to submit documentation establishing eligibility. The commenter insisted that by doing so, HUD would reduce the likelihood of discrimination by owners, and ensure that applicants do not bypass the verification procedures by simply declaring that they are citizens. In contrast, another commenter insisted that HUD's requirement that noncitizens and citizens submit documentation of eligible citizenship or immigration status would only increase the burden on already-busy property managers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 proposed rule maintains documentation requirements because documentation requirements are imposed by statute. However, the 1994 proposed rule revises the documentation requirements for citizens, and for noncitizens who are or will be 62 years of age or older and are or will be residing in assisted housing when these regulations take effect. The 1994 proposed rule removes the requirement in the 1988 proposed rule that citizens and noncitizens 62 years of age or older and residing in assisted housing submit a verification consent form. (See section VI.A.2. of this preamble which describes the documentation required by the 1994 proposed rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 proposed rule does not modify the documentation requirements for all other noncitizens (i.e., those who are not 62 years of age or older and residing in assisted housing) because these documentation requirements for noncitizens are statutorily prescribed by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) (42 U.S.C. 1320b&hyph;7). Under IRCA, every individual who declares him or herself to be a noncitizen with eligible immigration status (except for certain elderly tenants) must submit immigration documents for verification by the INS. This requirement applies to every member of a household, including children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD disagrees with the commenter who suggested that requiring all tenants and applicants to submit documentation of citizenship or immigration status would lessen the likelihood of discrimination by responsible entities. Under both the 1988 and 1994 proposed rules, a responsible entity is required to ask any individual declaring eligible immigration status to submit immigration documents for verification with the INS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals who declare in writing that they are United States citizens are not required under IRCA to submit proof of citizenship. HUD construes this provision to mean that the Congress specifically intended to exempt citizens from IRCA's document submission and verification procedures, and this statutory construction is reflected in the 1994 proposed rule, as it was in the 1988 proposed rule. (See, also, the discussion between Senators Kennedy and Hawkins at 131 Cong. Rec. S11414, 11417 (daily ed. September 13, 1985).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interpretation is supported by the language contained in Part A of IRCA. Specifically, section 101 of IRCA (Control of Unlawful Employment of Aliens) amends the Immigration and Nationality Act by adding a new section 274A (8 U.S.C. 1324a), which provides at section 274A(b) for the establishment of an employment verification system. Under section 274A(b), the Congress specifically required an employer to attest under penalty of perjury that it had verified that an individual was not an unauthorized noncitizen, and that the verification was based upon a review of certain statutorily prescribed documents. These documents include, among others, U.S. passports and certificates of U.S. citizenship or naturalization. This statutory scheme is markedly absent under HUD's provisions under Part C of IRCA (Verification of Status Under Certain Programs). Accordingly, given the marked absence of these requirements from section 214, HUD is not imposing a proof of citizenship requirement in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter urged HUD to exempt persons with disabilities from the rule's ``citizen and noncitizen status documentation requirements.'' Another commenter asked that the rule exempt from the documentation requirements all persons who are covered by HUD's definition of ``elderly person,'' which would include non-elderly persons and persons with disabilities. The commenter suggested that the exemption could be limited to those instances where the individual actually submitted medical proof of his or her disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The documentation requirements under the rule are statutorily mandated under IRCA, and HUD does not have the discretion to administratively exempt from those requirements a particular group of persons. Moreover, section 621 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (106 Stat. 3812) (1992 Act), which amended section 3 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a) (1937 Act), revised the statutory definition of ``elderly person'' to remove the reference to persons with disabilities and limit this term to persons who are 62 years or older. (Before the amendment, persons with disabilities were included in the definition of ``elderly person,'' regardless of the age of the disabled person.) Accordingly, as amended by the 1992 Act a person with disabilities meets the 1937 Act definition of ``elderly person'' if the person is 62 years or older. In light of the amendment made to the definition of ``elderly person'' by the 1992 Act, HUD cannot treat disabled persons who are not 62 years of age or older as if they were elderly persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

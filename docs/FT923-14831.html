			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / People: Appointments and promotions Sir Trevor Holdsworth, the distinguished industrialist, has agreed to join the advisory board of UK strategic consultants LEK Partnership. LEK's board already boasts plenty of eminent names - including Lord Boardman, the former chairman of National Westminster and Lord Carr of Hadley, home secretary during part of the Heath government. But to date there has been no-one who could match Sir Trevor's industrial background. While Sir Trevor will not be offering the benefit of his wisdom direct to LEK clients, the consultants reckon that having the 'very serious and profound knowledge' of the former GKN chairman and CBI president on call will help counter any charges that strategists are better on theoretical rather than on practical questions. Sir Trevor is also chairman of National Power. *****- Arthur Andersen partner Ian Plaistowe has been appointed a deputy chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, the government-sponsored body which promotes good financial reporting. Plaistowe, 49, is chairman of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies and President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. He succeeds Ian McNeil, 59, a partner in Moores Rowland of Brighton. The Financial Reporting Council was established in March 1990 and is chaired by Sir Ron Dearing. It oversees the arrangements for the Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Reporting Review Panel and was set up as the first step towards implementing a new structure for setting and enforcing accounting standards as recommended in the 1988 Dearing Report. ***** The reshuffle of BRITISH AEROSPACE's top management team continues apace. Brian Cookson, the legal director, and Frank Saundry, the personnel director, have retired and Richard Lapthorne, the new finance director, joins the board this week. The retirement of Saundry and Cookson, who are both in their 60s, has given BAe's new chairman John Cahill a chance to remould his executive team. Saundry has already been replaced by Rob Meakin, although he has not been given a seat on the board, and a new legal director is being recruited. It is also expected that Hugh Colver, head of information at the MoD, will join BAe on the defence side. Graham Bond, treasurer at Nuclear Electric, has been appointed group treasurer at YORKSHIRE ELECTRICITY. He replaces Euan McGregor who is now divisional director of Yorkshire's new ventures. ***** Charles Allen, chief executive of GRANADA's leisure division, has been appointed to the group board. ***** Roger Williams, company secretary, has resigned from GALLIFORD because of ill health; John Livingston, finance director, has taken on the additional responsibility. ***** Bill White, chief executive of API Security Inc, ASH's American operations, has been appointed to the board of AUTOMATED SECURITY (HOLDINGS). ***** Roland Lewis, who has been part-time finance director of RESORT HOTELS since 1985, has been appointed to the post full-time. ***** Ian Barr has been promoted to finance director of COOKSON. ***** John Barnard has been appointed a director of HARRISONS &amp; CROSFIELD. ***** John Coleman, chairman of SMURFIT Continental Europe, is to become president when Dermot Smurfit becomes chairman and ceo in September. ***** Michael Arnaouti has been appointed company secretary of BOWTHORPE, on the retirement of Edward Cox.</p>

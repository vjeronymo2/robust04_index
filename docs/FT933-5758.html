			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (15): Islands of hope in a sea of despair - Non-government organisations / NGOs are now involved in virtually every aspect of African life NON-GOVERNMENT agencies provide isolated islands of hope in a sea of social and economic despair, the British charity Oxfam wrote earlier this year in its assessment of the African crisis. This is no exaggeration. By stepping into the vacuum left by the collapse of government services, NGOs have become as indispensable to Africa's development efforts as official aid flows. NGOs invested Dollars 6.4bn in Africa in 1989 - more than the World Bank's net transfers to the region, and more than six times the figure for direct foreign investment. And as disenchantment grows with African bureaucracies, donor governments are increasingly channelling official assistance through NGOs. 'They help the poor directly, without costly bureaucratic mediation of donors and recipient governments, and without danger of assistance ending up in pockets of the rich, the military or the corrupt,' says the World Bank. NGOs now get about one-third of their funds from official sources. Although emergency relief work dominates the headlines, NGOs are now involved in virtually every aspect of African life, providing health services, drilling bore holes, serving as a 'bank' willing to finance small traders and cottage industries. Farmers are more likely to get seeds for planting, rural credit and extension services from an NGO than from government. And they are more concerned about the welfare of African women than most African men. NGOs are often the only safety net between tough structural adjustment programmes and abject poverty. At Kikuyu Hospital, one of the oldest mission hospitals in Kenya, Ms Margaret Waweru, the administrator, says: 'We are seeing a growing number of patients who feel government hospitals no longer provide adequate services.' This is particularly true since Kenya's state hospitals started charging for services. Because Kikuyu manufactures its own drugs, it can sell them to patients at a fraction of the market cost. The mission hospital has also become the main referral centre for eye surgery in the country, because the infrastructure once available in state hospitals - drugs, surgical instruments, equipment - has collapsed. Many of the doctors working at Kikuyu left the state health service in frustration. 'It was very demoralising not to have the basic means to do your job,' says one of the eye surgeons. 'It's not a question of pay. Medics prefer working for NGOs because they know they will have the resources to work well." In the 1980s, it was common for NGOs to try to duplicate government services, Now the emphasis has shifted to working alongside government to strengthen their services. Kikuyu hospital runs training programmes for ophthalmologists in the state health service. In Zambia, Oxfam and Unicef have played a pivotal role in the rehabilitation of primary health clinics. And in Uganda, charities such as Save the Children Fund are supplying medical kits, essential drugs and salary top-ups for government health workers. But NGOs are not a panacea for Africa's ills: 'At best, we can only provide patchwork solutions,' says Friar Arnold Grol, the founder of an NGO called Undugu Society. The charitable nature of NGOs has also shielded them from public scrutiny. There are very few studies on the effectiveness of NGOs in alleviating poverty. Do they provide cost-effective services? Are NGO projects sustainable in the long run? And what happens to these projects when expatriate staff leave? One limited study, conducted by Britain's Overseas Development Institute, found a mixed bag of results. This is hardly surprising, given the thousands of NGOs, both foreign and indigenous, now operating in Africa. However, the study drew some interesting conclusions. Where poverty alleviation did occur, improvement was modest. There was little evidence to suggest that beneficiaries had managed to escape from poverty on a permanent basis, while few projects demonstrated potential to sustain themselves once an NGO ceased operating in the area. Credit-focused initiatives were found to be costly to administer due to the expense of monitoring large numbers of small loans. Few of the schemes became self-sustaining or self-administered. Drought or disaster quickly increased default on loans and eroded the capital base of these small lending ventures. But perhaps the greatest weakness of NGOs lies in their narrow focus. Often, projects fail because the wider economic or social context is not taken into account. In Ghana, a US-funded project to raise maize productivity was so successful that it collapsed when local markets were flooded with maize and prices plummetted. An engineering workshop making ox-ploughs in Acholi, western Uganda, went out of business when bandits started stealing cattle in the region. Another common temptation is for NGOs to create an artificial or temporary demand for produce or skills they are trying to develop. The activity collapses when NGOs stop purchasing the goods. These weaknesses notwithstanding, the NGO's seem set to play an increasingly important role in efforts to resolve Africa's development crisis.</p>

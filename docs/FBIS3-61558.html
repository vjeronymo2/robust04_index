Basic problems  in obtaining this generator are the accumulation of a parent  wolfram-188 radionucleide having sufficient specific activity,  dissolution of a wolfram target and conversion to an insoluble  matrix by selection of a sorbent and sorbent form of wolfram,  determining the sorption conditions, charging the generator  column with radioactive wolfram, and elution of rhenium-188 with  maximum bulk activity and high radionucleidic and chemical  purity of the end radionucleide. In the present work a study was  made of radiochemical fundamentals of this generator.  Possibilities for accumulation of a parent radionucleide of  wolfram-188 of high specific activity were determined. Optimum  conditions were found for dissolution of wolfram targets from  various materials (oxide, metal, acids) and converting them into  a sorpable form. Rules governing the sorption of wolfram and  rhenium on several sorbents were studied and the conditions for  maximum and minimum sorption of both metals were determined. The  conditions for charging generator columns with radioactive  wolfram and the elution of highly active rhenium-188 were worked  out. Aluminum oxide was used as sorbent and a sodium chloride  salt solution was used as an eluent. Several series of  generators with activities to 4 GBk were prepared and studied.

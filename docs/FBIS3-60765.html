			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Excerpt] The 10th PRC airliner hijacked to Taiwan this  year departed Taoyuan Chiang Kai-shek Airport for Hsiamen  [Xiamen] at 1823 local time [1023 GMT]. Although our government  reiterated that the principle of separately handling hijackers  and airplanes would remain unchanged, this time around relevant  units conducted a more thorough inspection of the airplane and  the people on board. The airplane was kept on the ground longer  than during the past nine hijackings, and was only allowed to  depart four hours later.    The hijacked airplane was a Yun-7 mid-sized airliner bound  from Kanchou [Ganzhou], Chianghsi [Jiangxi] to Hsiamen [Xiamen].  It was hijacked at 1310 local time [0510 GMT]. The hijackers  are a married couple from Chianghsi; they brought along their  daughter. The man is (Luo Chang-hu), the 38-year-old manager of  the Nanfang Trading Company. The woman is (Wang I-yin), a  34-year-old salesperson at a construction materials company.  [passage omitted]</p>

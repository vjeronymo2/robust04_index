			<p>Percent   <F P=102>   94FE0326G Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Jan 94 p  5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0326G </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The National Institute of Materials &amp; Chemical  Research (NIMC) of the Agency of Industrial Science and  Technology has successfully increased the alcohol combustion  temperature by 30 percent at maximum by controlling the  combustion state with a magnetic field. The concentration of  oxygen at the combustion temperature was controlled because of  the attraction of oxygen to a magnetic field. NIMC plans to  study applications of this technology to internal-combustion  engines including turbines, hoping to be able to eventually  develop a universal technology for increasing combustion  efficiency.    Atmospheric oxygen is a magnetic material that is attracted  to a magnet. In contrast, atmospheric nitrogen, which accounts  for 80 percent constituent of the atmosphere, is hardly affected  by a magnet. Based on these facts, NIMC controlled combustion by  burning fuel where only oxygen can be constantly supplied with  the aid of a magnetic field created by an electromagnet or a  permanent magnet.    NIMC carried out combustion experiments in air with a  platinum catalyst and checked variations in the combustion  temperature. A 1 x 2 cm piece of asbestos was placed between the  N and S poles of an electromagnet, more specifically, near the  end of the magnet where the magnetic field strength changes  suddenly. This is the place that is said to be most suitable for  promoting combustion with oxygen's circulation activated by the  magnet's attraction.    A constant amount of fuel, butanol or gasoline, was fed to  the asbestos piece with the attached platinum catalyst from the  side that is within a magnetic field. Oxygen was introduced from  the other side (no magnetic field) of the asbestos piece. The  combustion temperature was measured at a point 70 cm away from  the asbestos piece.    As a result, it was discovered that gasoline, which burned  at  440C prior to the application of a magnetic field now  burned at 480C with the magnetic field, showing a 10  percent increase in combustion temperature. In the case of  butanol, a 30 percent increase in combustion temperature was  reportedly observed.    At NIMC, Chief Researcher Nobuko Wakayama says, ``It appears  possible to use a magnetic field to improve combustion  efficiency.'' She adds that in the future, attempts will be made  to apply the technology to chemical reactions including  electrolysis and oxidation-reduction processes, and combustion  under microgravity.    Although there had hardly been any precedent of practical  application of a magnetic field to control chemical reactions,  NIMC is hopeful that the technology can be effective in fuel  consumption and diesel exhaust treatment because nitrogen oxides  (NO[.sub]x[/]) and hydroxides, in addition to oxygen, can be  attracted by a magnetic field.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAMS KNOCKS BOBBY CZYZ RIGHT INTO RETIREMENT  </P> <P> Charles Williams and Bobby Czyz both proved points to themselves Sunday in 10  furious rounds that resulted in Williams keeping the International Boxing  Federation light-heavyweight championship.  </P> <P> "I wanted to prove to the world I'm the No. 1 light-heavyweight in the world,"  Williams said, "and I think I did.  </P> <P> "Since I won the championship, I haven't gotten the credit I deserve. I'm kind  of known as the unknown champion. I think the phone will be ringing off the  hook for me to fight."  </P> <P> Czyz, 27, a professional since 1980, proved to himself that it is indeed time  to retire.  </P> <P> The fight ended with Czyz, his left eye almost closed, sitting on his stool  after the 10th round, unwilling to continue.  </P> <P> "I suspect it's time for me to call it quits, at least in this capacity," Czyz  said.  </P> <P> Williams began to turn the fight in his favor in the sixth round, and he  knocked Czyz down twice in the eighth.  </P> <P> The boxers both threw right-handed punches, but Williams caught Czyz flush on  the jaw. Czyz caught himself before he fell but then reeled across the ring and  went down. He was up at six and took a mandatory eight-count.  </P> <P> Badly hurt, he went down again from a grazing right hand, then got up at five.  </P> <P> Czyz tried to rally in the ninth round, but Williams had him in trouble with  some sharp punches to the head, and at the end of the 10th, Czyz was exhausted.  </P> <P> The only way Czyz could have won this rematch was by knockout, and it was  obvious he did not have the strength or the firepower to do it in the late  rounds.  </P> <P> Williams, 172 1/2, of Mansfield, Ohio, took the IBF title by stopping Czyz,  175, of Wanaque, N.J., after nine rounds on Oct. 29, 1987, at Las Vegas. Czyz's  right eye was closed in that fight.  </P> <P> One judge had Williams ahead by nine points, another by seven and the third by  six.  </P> <P> Williams, 27, making his third defense, has a 27-4-2 record with 19 knockouts.  Czyz is 30-5-4 with 24 knockouts.  </P></p>

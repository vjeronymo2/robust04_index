			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Subcommander Marcos of the </F> Zapatist National Liberation Army by Gaspar Morquecho in the  Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas, on 19 June; all quotation marks as  published]    [Text] Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- "I believe  Camacho is a courageous man. He clearly stated why he was  resigning because he had made a serious effort here." This is  how Subcommander Marcos appraised Manuel Camacho's resignation  as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas during  an interview he granted in the jungle. He also talked about the  National Democratic Convention, elections within EZLN [Zapatist  National Liberation Army]-controlled areas, and reactions to the  Zapatists' rejection of the peace accords.    [Morquecho] What is the EZLN's reaction to Camacho's  resignation as peace commissioner?    [Marcos] As we see it, on one hand, Mr. Camacho's  resignation  shows a lack of understanding by one of the presidential  candidates -- namely, Mr. Zedillo --to the significance of a  dialogue and the negotiations process.    "In his blindness, he does not see the advances made, such  as  the postponement of the cease-fire, the assurances that it will  be respected and that one side will not attack the other, that  the electoral process has gotten under way, and that elections  can be held nationwide. All of these are achievements reached  at the negotiating table in San Cristobal, and merit must  definitely be given to the mediator and the commissioner.    "When Mr. Zedillo invalidates, diminishes, or underrates the  work done by the commissioner, he is really undermining his  position and is taking the position of demanding a surrender.  "Mr. Zedillo sees the lack of a surrender as a failure. How  can we trust this candidate? If he wins the presidency, how can  he be open to negotiations or have a conciliatory attitude in  resolving the Chiapas conflict or, more specifically, the EZLN  conflict?    "It is definitely a low blow by the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] to the efforts made to advance the dialogue  and the negotiations, and it reflects a historic blindness to  see the advances that were made.    "What we also see is that when Camacho made the proposals in  response to the EZLN demands, he made an honest effort and acted  responsibly. He worked to get responses that would satisfy our  demands during the consultations, especially after Colosio's  murder. An interest group somewhere or a power group within the  federal government started to block all of the initiatives  geared to supporting those proposals, forcing us to notice that  no promises were going to be kept, and giving the impression  that Mr. Camacho had failed to obtain the EZLN's unconditional  surrender. The idea was to keep him busy so he would not  overshadow the PRI candidate in the middle of a campaign which,  everyone knows, is extremely weak.    "It seems to me that Camacho is courageous. He is clear when  he says why he is quitting because he made a serious effort and  we have acknowledged this. His efforts have been invalidated by  a man who is attempting to become the president of the republic  for the government party. The fact that he quit and said why he  was doing so shows that Camacho is a brave man."    [Morquecho] What can you tell us about the National  Democratic Convention the EZLN has called for?    [Marcos] From the outset, the Chiapas civilian sectors'  response was very perceptive because they were able to clearly  see, I imagine, the problems of a civil war, as well as the need  to find a solution, because, in one way or another, they are the  ones who will have to endure the brunt of a war.    "Chiapas civilian society understands that a convention is  the only chance worth taking in the process to achieve change.  A national-level response to this proposal is still lacking.  Several sectors have already taken a stand, but still very few  have done so.    "We want to clearly state that the National Democratic  Convention is not an EZLN convention, that is to say; it is not  a convention to vindicate the armed struggle but, rather, a  convention to search for a peaceful change and for a political  path to democracy.    "There is the fear that it will be a Zapatist convention  which could result in the vindication of the armed struggle --  the vindication of the EZLN, led by the EZLN.    "We are not proposing that the convention declare itself in  support of the armed struggle. Just the opposite is true. We  are saying the convention must declare that it will do  something. It must not sit and wait for 22 August but, instead,  do something before then and make an effort that is worth  making. We have nothing to lose by trying to determine whether  it is still possible to push for a peaceful transition to  democracy.    "I am interested in clarifying this because I have read that  it might be interpreted that the convention would be the  political arm of the EZLN.    "The National Convention will be the political arm of the  democratic struggle, just as the EZLN is the military arm of the  democratic struggle. In terms political experts like to use a  lot nowadays, the hard line comprises the EZLN, and the  conciliatory or peaceful line comprises civilian society.    "We are asking civilian society to organize more and not to  be divided. It could be through the convention, or it could be  through something else. By convening the convention, we are  responding to people who tell us: I want to do something; I do  not agree with the armed struggle, but I do agree with  democracy. Therefore, we are telling them: Well then, meet.    "We are offering them territory, support, protection, and an  idea of what could be. We are also offering an explanation of  what led us to take up arms, and which might take you to the  ballots. That would be the convention, and it would be good if  this were clear, right now, before it is held."    [Morquecho] Talking about elections, what does it mean not  to  hinder the electoral process in the zone under Zapatist control?    [Marcos] "We are willing to permit the entry of candidates  who want to campaign, the entry of ballot boxes, the holding of  the vote, and we are willing to give guarantees so there will be  no interference from our forces in this entire process. We are  appealing to the International Red Cross [IRC] to verify that  there is no aggression on our part, foreseeing there might be  provocations that might be blamed on us.    "That is one of the achievements of the negotiations, the  opening of the door by the most radical sector of democracy --  the hard democratic line, which is the EZLN -- so the peaceful  transition that civilian society demands so much will take place.    "We are yielding the ground won by civilian society, the  ground on which it can conduct its work, which, in this case, is  the electoral process in August. We will offer every  assistance, even decidedly standing back, if there are  guarantees that this will go down on record.    "This is why we are appealing to nongovernmental  organizations [NGO's], mainly those being organized in Chiapas,  to monitor this process, ensuring it is held normally within our  guidelines.    "This does not mean we are now calling on people to vote; it  simply means we are not going to interfere and we are going to  be consistent with the position we expressed in January when we  said we were not planning to interfere in the electoral process  in August."    [Morquecho] This means there will be polling officials and  representatives of the parties. The intervention of the IRC and  NGO's is being requested. This would involve voting tables at  polls in the areas under Zapatist control.    [Marcos] "Yes, but the difference is that these elections  will be the first ones organized by civilian society in national  territory. In other words, we are turning over to the NGO's the  organization of everything that must be done here in Zapatist  territory.    "We think it is an interesting barometer for the rest of the  country and the rest of civilian society to see elections that  are organized neither by the government nor an armed  organization in rebellion, and instead are organized by that  third force, whose belligerence we recognize and which is  civilian society itself.    "It would be a great nonbellicose advance -- I mean, an  unarmed and nonviolent advance, a peaceful advance. Civilian  society would organize those elections in our territories. That  would be the big difference."    [Morquecho] Then, there is an open invitation to all  candidates from every political party, in this case the  government party?    [Marcos] An open invitation? No, because there are some  people for whom we feel nothing but contempt. We will simply  not oppose to their doing whatever they have to do, but we will  not welcome them with open arms, especially those who would seem  to have suddenly forgotten what their elections record is in a  state in which fraud was so notorious that they even got elected  as senators with the so-called people's support.    "Let us not forget. We know what history is, and we must  acknowledge it. We will not prevent them from campaigning, but  the population of those regions under Zapatista control are  quite aware of who's who. We guarantee that there will be no  attack or interference of any sort. We are definitely not  inviting everyone, but if they want to come, we will not prevent  them."    [Morquecho] What were the reactions in Chiapas with respect  to the Zapatist opposition to the signing of a peace agreement?  Is there any apprehension as a result of some of the reactions?  I am referring now to opposition from the cattle ranchers, the  government, and the Army.    [Marcos] Once again, the Army is using phrases like  "transgressors of the law" and "violence professionals." These  are expressions it had discarded. The important issue here is  that they had agreed to respect the cease-fire, but now they are  leaving it open to the decision of their commander in chief who,  in this case, is Mr. Salinas de Gortari.    "While the EZLN is guaranteeing that it will respect the  cease-fire and is making every effort for it not to be broken,  so far, the Army is honoring it, but it is not giving any  assurances that it will last. It is also making the military  climate somewhat unstable and is blocking the elbow room we were  trying create -- the elbow room of a peaceful transition.    "On the other hand, the ranchers' reaction is contradictory  because what they wanted was our surrender, which would have  brought about peace. Now they are criticizing the government  for not to adopting a hard-line position. They do not want  negotiations. They want the Zapatists broken once and for all,  if they fail to accept what they are offered.    "This reaction is understandable. It unmasks, once and for  all, the alleged mediating position adopted by those ranchers  who were seeking public office, already negotiating, involved in  a dialogue, and who knows what. The masks they wore have  finally been removed, and once again they have returned to the  position they have always held.    "All of this is aimed at misleading the voters into not  believing that the so-called Indian -- Mestizo, or Ejido --  cattle owners formula can fool someone. [sentence as published]    "On the other hand, the PRI, which has always been very  insightful in implementing the best possible policies in this  state -- evidence of this lies in the fact that we decided to  take up arms -- chose to name as candidates to public office  people who have always been widely unpopular. Several of these  people are not even known, have always adopted a  middle-of-the-road position, and have never been to the  districts they say they represent. There are others who  undoubtedly represent a repressive tradition, such as that of  the cattle ranchers.    "The election climate throughout the state clearly shows  that  the PRI's permanence is also the continuation of the same  conditions that forced the EZLN to take up arms and remain  armed. It has been clearly demonstrated that the PRI, at the  state level -- and we still have the national level to consider  -- is the party that understood the war the least, as well as  the fact that it is the party that is responsible for  determining if this continues or comes to an end.    "The PRI has not understood or assessed the situation. It  still believes that things can remain the way they were before  by simply changing its speeches, by discussing the masses more,  or by supporting the rights and interests of the Indian  population. Even the ranchers have resorted to this, as if it  were possible to erase the track record they have accumulated.    "No candidate running for public office has ever come here  to  the Zapatist territories. Neither have the municipal presidents  of Ocosingo or Las Margaritas gone any further than those  communities. The municipal president of Las Margaritas never  went any further than Las Margaritas. The Ocosingo municipal  president never went any further than the brewery located at El  Jatate crossing.    "The only candidate running for public office that has  entered Zapatist territory, but when it was not yet a Zapatist  region, was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is candidate for the  presidency of the republic -- but not one deputy or replacement,  whether on a slate or a single ticket, or anything. Not even  one candidate running for municipal president ever came to this  region to request votes from places where they supposedly won  with 100 percent support."</p>

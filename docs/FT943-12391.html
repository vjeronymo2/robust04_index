			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch sales picture mixed Dutch retail sales fell 1.5 per cent in real terms in May, the first decline since January. However, the central statistical office blamed the downturn on one fewer Saturday in the month than May 1993. If corrected for that difference, the retail sales index actually rose by 1.7 per cent. The statistical office also reported yesterday that the Netherlands' trade surplus widened to Fl 1.7bn (Pounds 630m) in March from Fl 1.5bn in February and Fl 1.2bn in March 1993. The increased surplus extends the higher trend seen both in 1993 as a whole and in the first two months of 1994. Italian industrial producer prices rose 3.2 per cent in the year to May, compared with a 3 per cent rise in April, the national statistical institute reported. Wholesale prices rose by 3.5 per cent year-on-year to May 1994. Germany's balance of payments surplus on the capital account widened in May to DM8bn (Pounds 3.3bn) from DM2.3bn in April and DM6.5bn in May 1993, according to data published by the Bundesbank yesterday.</p>

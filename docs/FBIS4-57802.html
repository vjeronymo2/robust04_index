			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonio Marcello and Pamela Nunes] </F>   [Excerpt] Brasilia, 24 May (AE) -- The next president of  the Republic will be elected for a four-year term and will not  be able to seek reelection. The Constituent Congress today  approved for the second time a constitutional amendment that  reduces the presidential term from five to four years. Of the  357 congressmen in attendance, 323 voted in favor of the  amendment, 29 voted against it, and five abstained. The  possibility of an incumbent president seeking reelection already  had been denied during the first vote taken on the issue.  [passage omitted]</p>

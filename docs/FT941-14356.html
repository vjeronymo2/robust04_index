			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / BA attacks Air France 'subsidy': UK carrier calls on Brussels to force the repayment of Dollars 254m British Airways yesterday launched a vigorous attack on Air France as it urged the European Commission to force the French state-owned flag carrier to repay a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 254m) capital injection, saying it constituted a subsidy in contravention of the Treaty of Rome. The UK airline's attack comes as an EU commission is due to recommend a policy on state aid to ailing European national airlines, many of which are seeking support from their governments. BA and the UK government have campaigned against additional state aid to financially troubled European state carriers, which they argue are severely distorting the European airline market. BA's objection to the Air France refinancing package now before the EU follows Brussels approval for earlier government injections to Air France totalling FFr5.84bn during 1991 and 1992. The privatised UK carrier is worried that the French government will soon seek approval for further aid to Air France totalling more than FFr5bn as part of the latest rescue package for the troubled French carrier. Air France last night rejected BA's claims and insisted the FFr1.5bn injection involved convertible bonds and other paper issued under normal market conditions. It also stated that the earlier FFr5.84bn it had received involved FFr2bn in a government capital injection approved by the EU as not consisting of a state subsidy, with the remainder raised on the French financial market. Mr David Holmes, BA's head of government and industry affairs, said the current FFr1.5bn aid package 'was not a commercial investment: it was state aid which contravenes the Treaty of Rome and should be given back'. He added that Air France's 'financial salvation' should lie in its own hands and not through state handouts 'that are unfairly and illegally distorting Europe's air transport industry'. Although the funds were claimed to be required to finance earlier restructuring at Air France, BA said that there was no evidence of any such restructuring taking place. 'Air France's capacity continued to increase, its total workforce remained practically static, its investment policy focused almost entirely on expanding its fleet through the acquisition of new aircraft . . .', BA said. The UK carrier added that other European airlines had realigned themselves without the benefit of state financial support and Air France should do the same.</p>

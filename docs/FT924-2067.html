			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Stones to guns NOWHERE IN the world is the language of political violence more direct and expressive than in the Middle East. By kidnapping an Israeli border guard in Israel at the weekend and proposing a prisoner exchange, the militantly Islamic Palestinian group Hamas is engaged in more than a forceful effort to secure the release of its jailed leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. It is attempting, at a moment of apparent stagnation in Middle East peace talks, to undermine the negotiating process and assert itself as the leading Palestinian force confronting Israel. It will not succeed, at least in the short term. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's newly elected prime minister, remains committed to the peace process and says he believes it will yield agreement with at least some of his Arab neighbours next year. The Palestinians, too, are still uncomfortably on board. Nevertheless, the latest incident is a disturbing sign of the times. Coming after a week in which Hamas has murdered five Israeli soldiers, it underlines how the Islamic fundamentalists are coming to the fore, and are changing the character of the intifada, the five-year-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In Gaza especially, where the rebellion began and where Hamas's strength is concentrated, the conflict seems to be shifting from sticks and stones to low-level guerrilla warfare. Hamas's activities would not be so worrying if it were not for the fact that they are taking place in something of a political vacuum. The US-sponsored peace process launched in Madrid more than a year ago has yet to show tangible progress. In particular the Palestinian negotiators are showing increasing frustration with what they have thus far been offered: an interim, strictly limited arrangement for self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip pending talks on a final settlement after three years. It makes for a political climate in the territories in which violence could easily obtain a momentum of its own, and lead to a further hardening of attitudes on both sides. Mr Rabin will need to show diplomatic skill as well as toughness if the kidnapping affair is not to escalate. Most important, however, is the need to inject fresh momentum into the Washington negotiations. Israel, whose initial proposals on Palestinian autonomy were unacceptably meagre, must be urged to improve its offer. The Palestinians must then be pressed to proceed with local elections, and convinced that they cannot expect to exact further concessions through violence or external pressure. The other Arab negotiating parties must be kept at the table. There is only one player that can do all these things: the country that launched the process. Add the Middle East to the list of foreign problems that will confront President-elect Bill Clinton immediately after inauguration day.</p>

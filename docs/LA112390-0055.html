			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Oh Say Can You See: President Bush told American troops in the Persian Gulf  Thursday that he has a secret weapon -- Roseanne Barr.  </P> <P> Standing before the camouflage-clad troops with his wife, Barbara, Bush said,  "You'll be glad to know that if it goes on too long, we have a secret weapon in  reserve. If push comes to shove, we're going to get Roseanne Barr to go to Iraq  and sing the national anthem. Baghdad Betty, eat your heart out." Television  personality Barr received much bad press for an off-putting rendition of the  national anthem before a major-league baseball game in San Diego last summer.  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan rises again on signs of labour accord THE sustained assault on the D-Mark, and the weak opening on Wall Street took some of the shine off continental equities, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN took heart on signs that the government, unions and employers were close to an accord on labour costs, and the Comit index rose 9.42 or 1.8 per cent to 537.40. Foreign demand revived for telecommunications issues after Iri announced that a plan for reorganisation of the sector would be ready by the end of the month. Stet soared L280 or 9 per cent to fix at L3,380 and Sip was L147 ahead at L2,440. Recurring rumours of an industrial or financial accord continued to boost Fiat, L254 higher to fix at L6,345.

San Paolo slid L170 to settle at L9,520. Ferruzzi and Montedison steadied after the recent volatility.

DTB players, it was said, took advantage of the highs to sell baskets of shares in the cash market. Export-sensitive cyclicals rose further on the strength of the dollar, but financials looked soggy on worries that the D-Mark's comparative weakness might impede the decline in interest rates. In chemicals, Hoechst rose another DM4.20 to DM258, for a two-day gain of DM10. The pharmaceutical and agrochemical group, Schering, picked up DM9.30 to DM794.50 and Mr Werner Kiesse at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that a rumour had been circulating about a joint venture between the two companies. Turnover rose from DM7.2bn to DM7.7bn. On the downside, the software company, SAP, dropped DM222 or 13.5 per cent to DM1,425 after it disclosed that it had failed to achieve forecast profits. PARIS closed its June account with another modest rise, index arbitrage bringing volatility into a wide spread of share prices. The CAC 40 index closed 7.13 higher at 1942.41,in turnover of FFr4bn, up again from FFr3.6bn on Tuesday. Peugeot rose FFr9 to FFr549.

L'Oreal rose FFr41 to FFr1,085 on short covering. Fallers included UAP, FFr15 easier at FFr589, and Canal Plus, down FFr24 to FFr1,271 for a two-day fall of FFr47 on fears that it was reaching market share saturation in the television subscriber stakes. ZURICH turned back after a firm opening as the dollar weakened and the SMI index shed 12.1 to 2,322.9. Against the trend, Swissair added SFr15 to SFr693 in respose to optimistic earnings estimates for this year and 1994 from a leading Swiss Bank. Shares in Richemont, parent of Rothmans International and Dunhill Holdings, were suspended until tomorrow pending an announcement on the group's restructuring. AMSTERDAM, under pressure from the lower trend on Wall Street and the weaker dollar, was unable to hold on to early gains. The CBS Tendency index gave up 0.2 to 110.9. Hoogovens shed FL 1.70 to Fl 32.50 on news that it will be hit by US anti-dumping duties. STOCKHOLM fell 1.2 per cent in heavy trading in respose to higher domestic interest rates, a weaker krona and the announcement of a 3.8 per cent drop in first quarter GDP. The Affarsvarden index dropped 12.7 to 1,063.10.

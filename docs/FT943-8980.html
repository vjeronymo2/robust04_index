			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: Rare outing for Purcell's Indian Queen When they decided that the Glasgow International Early Music Festival would be biennial, somebody omitted to count ahead and notice that there would be no festival in 1995. That is the year of the Purcell tercentenary - well set to be the biggest early music jamboree that Britain has ever seen. Glasgow was not to be outdone. For the major attraction of the 1994 festival, it is ambitiously presenting a fully-staged production of The Indian Queen, one of Purcell's musical works on - or around - a play by Dryden. Is it an opera? Is it a play with incidental music? Even in Purcell's day there was some indecision as to who these semi-operas were intended for, so it is not surprising to find that they rarely get a showing. Unfortunately for Purcell enthusiasts, these scores contain some of the composer's best music. The usual solution is to perform the music in concert and leave the play as a synopsis in the programme. The commemoration of Purcell's death next year, however, demands more serious treatment. And it will get it: both the Royal Opera and ENO have new, fully-staged productions of the two most famous of the semi-operas planned. Their tributes will probably be more lavishly staged, better rehearsed and sung than this Indian Queen (they had better be]) but they will do well to be half as convincing. On the only other occasion that I have seen The Indian Queen performed as intended with play and music together, the two art-forms barely made contact, as though musicians and actors were not on speaking terms. Kate Brown, the producer in Glasgow, achieves a far greater unity than that. Unlike The Fairy Queen or King Arthur, this work does draw music into the heart of the drama. The key scene is the wicked queen's visit to the sorcerer's cave, where Purcell devised sinister music of the supernatural to create a world far removed from the earthly scenes of the rest of the play. David Thomas was marvellous as the sorcerer Ismeron, growling in his deepest bass tones for the spoken lines and slowly rousing himself into song. Otherwise, Purcell mostly tried to elaborate general themes from the drama, an exotic story set among Aztec warriors. There is not a lot else one could do with the play, which rarely bothers itself with such disciplines as logic or restraint. Triumphant generals regularly change sides at the drop of a helmet and unconquerable tyrants are liable to be seen in chains in the next scene for no apparent reason. Juliet Cadzow played the Indian Queen as a cross between Boadicea and Cruella de Vil. Out of ludicrous material Matthew Whittle and Dan Maxwell did well to create serious male leads. The musicians have an easier time of it, as Purcell's score is overflowing with songs and dance music that have brilliance of character already written in. The soprano Tinuke Olafimihan stood out among the singers. Gregory Squire conducted the Baroque Orchestra of the Scottish Early Music Consort with more zest than tidiness. They should all thank Kate Brown for giving them a production (designed by Louise Belson) which had wit and effervescence. It is amazing what one can achieve with a tiny budget and a big imagination. Final performance at the Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> A SENTENCE TO BACK BENCHES  </P> <P> While I understand the public's frustration with the system, term limits are  not the proper cure. There are more appropriate means of ensuring turnover and  restoring faith in the process.  </P> <P> One is meaningful campaign-finance reform, including reducing rates for  political advertising and challenging the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 ruling  equating campaign spending with free speech. Last year, I proposed spending  limits on California races to challenge the court decision, and I'll push the  legislation again this time.  </P> <P> The most needed change is true grass-roots politics. I was told by all the  "experts" not to challenge an incumbent two years ago. Incumbents can be  defeated (four Assembly members lost last week), but challengers need spirited  grass-roots campaigns.  </P> <P> Why hard work instead of term limits? Because some incumbents should be booted  out, but the good ones should stay awhile. As a freshman legislator, I turned  to experienced colleagues for advice on complex policy issues. Who will all the  freshmen in 1997 turn to after Proposition 140 takes effect? Lobbyists  representing special interests, rather than a colleague who represents the  public interest and who has built up expertise in key issue areas.  </P></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sales drop 6% at Siemens Nixdorf TURNOVER at Siemens Nixdorf Informations-systeme, the lossmaking German computer company owned by Siemens, dropped by 6 per cent to DM4.5bn (Dollars 2.76bn) in the first five months of its financial year. Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, chief executive, yesterday blamed troubled conditions in the company's foreign markets for the drop, together with the upwards valuation of the D-Mark, which accounted for one-third of the fall in turnover in the five months to the end of February. The sales downturn reflected poor conditions in Italy, Spain and France. In the UK, however, order intake increased by 15 per cent in the five months. Sales in Germany had remained virtually steady. Mr Wiedig said the number of employees had fallen by 1,700 since the beginning of the financial year and was set to drop by a further 3,200, to around 44,000 by the end of the year. He did not comment directly yesterday on the outlook for the company's profit and loss account. In November last year, Siemens Nixdorf said it expected a further reduction in losses in 1992-1993, after reporting a net deficit of DM513m in the year to September, down by 34 per cent on 1990-1991. Turnover for last year rose by 7 per cent to DM13bn.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION GETS THE MICROSCOPE  </P> <P> Perhaps not a moment too soon, state health officials are set to begin what  should be a timely and thorough examination of just what science knows and does  not know about the effects of malathion spraying on Southern California  residents. A panel of medical experts is being convened, and air and water  monitoring is set to start this month. The goal of the panel as well as of the  monitoring should be to determine, as quickly as possible, whether the spraying  is safe, as a number of experts claim.  </P> <P> Many Los Angeles and Orange county residents are alarmed and angry over the way  some officials previously brushed aside health concerns. Those who were already  agitated about the aerial pesticide campaign to eradicate the Medfly had  further cause for apprehension this week: An author of a 1980 state study that  is repeatedly cited as a cornerstone in the argument that malathion spraying  poses no health risk now says that state officials altered some of the report's  conclusions. This distressing charge comes from Marc A. Lappe, who worked as  part of a state risk-assessment team in Santa Clara County. In reply, state  officials admit that changes were made, but say they were scientifically  trivial.  </P> <P> This is why the decision to form a health panel and begin monitoring was  unavoidable and necessary. A perception of risk was bound to grow as long as  the state shut its eyes to questions about malathion spraying. Now, within the  next two weeks, the state will conduct water and air monitoring, the latter  with the use of vacuum-type devices placed near hospitals, schools and other  buildings in spray areas. And a panel of local, expert physicians and  scientists is due to meet as soon as this week.  </P> <P> The state has what may be its last and best chance to restore full faith in the  system. The first step in boosting credibility is in making sure that the panel  represents independent and dissenting points of view. One other action would  help: the governor's explicit endorsement of both the monitoring program and  the expert examination. It is true that Gov. George Deukmejian's own appointees  in the Department of Food and Agriculture and in the Department of Health  Services -- after some prodding -- set the wheels in motion for monitoring. A  spokesman said the governor "has always been willing to listen to and take into  account" new technical evidence. But there would be no better way now to show  that willingness than an enthusiastic Deukmejian public endorsement of the  panel, the monitoring and special testing as needed. The worst thing would be  to let this situation drift out of control.  </P></p>

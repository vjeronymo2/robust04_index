			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires states to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or to implement new ones for certain nonattainment areas. Section 182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed EPA to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The Act further requires each area required to have an I/M program to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. Based on these requirements, EPA promulgated I/M regulations on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950, codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 51.350&hyph;51.373).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under sections 182(c)(3), 187(a)(6) and 187(b)(1) of the Act, any area having a 1980 Bureau of Census-defined urbanized area population of 200,000 or more and either: (1) designated as serious or worse ozone nonattainment or (2) moderate or serious CO nonattainment areas with a design value greater than 12.7 ppm shall implement enhanced I/M in the 1990 Census-defined urbanized area. The Act also established the ozone transport region (OTR) in the northeastern United States which includes the States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia. Sections 182(c)(3) and 184(b)(1)(A) of the Act require the implementation of enhanced I/M programs in all metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) located in the OTR which have a population of 100,000 or more people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act requires basic I/M programs to be implemented in the 1990 Census-defined urbanized area of the following nonattainment areas: (1) any area which is classified as moderate or worse ozone nonattainment and is not required to implement enhanced I/M or (2) any area outside the OTR that is classified as serious or worse ozone nonattainment or moderate or serious CO nonattainment with a design value greater than 12.7 ppm and having a 1990 Census-defined urbanized area population of less than 200,000. Any areas classified as marginal ozone nonattainment or moderate CO nonattainment with a design value of 12.7 ppm or less shall continue operating existing programs that are part of an approved SIP as of November 15, 1990 or implement any previously required program, and shall update the program to meet the basic I/M requirements set forth in &sect;&sect;51.350&hyph;51.373.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements for the following: network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience; vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance; enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness; compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. The performance standard for basic I/M programs remains the same as it has been since initial I/M policy was established in 1978, pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act. The performance standard for enhanced I/M programs is based on a high-technology transient test, known as IM240, for new technology vehicles (i.e, those with closed-loop control and, especially, fuel injected engines), including a transient loaded exhaust short test incorporating hydrocarbons (HC), CO and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  cutpoints, an evaporative system integrity (pressure) test and an evaporative system performance (purge) test. For enhanced I/M programs, all requirements must initially be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from an existing test-and-repair network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is part of the OTR and contains the following MSAs or parts thereof with a population of 100,000 or more: Allentown-Bethlehem, Altoona, Beaver, Erie, Harrisburg Lebanon-Carlisle, Johnstown, Lancaster, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley, Reading, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, Sharon, State College, Williamsport, and York. Sections 182(c)(3) and 184(b)(1)(A) of the Act require all states in the OTR region which contain MSAs or parts thereof with a population of 100,000 or more, to submit a SIP revision for an enhanced I/M program. Section 51.372(b)(2) of the federal I/M regulation required affected states to submit full I/M SIP revisions that met the requirements of the Act by November 15, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 5, 1993, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER) submitted to EPA a SIP revision for an enhanced I/M program. The revision included a copy of the final enhanced I/M regulation, 67 Pennsylvania (PA) Code Chapter 178; the Pennsylvania  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M Request for Proposals (RFP); the Pennsylvania I/M legislation, Act 166; and supporting documents. On March 30, 1994, PADER submitted an addendum to the SIP which included portions of the selected I/M contractor's proposal. The I/M regulations were adopted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on June 3, 1993 and become effective on January 1, 1995. EPA's I/M regulations require state I/M rules to be effective by November 15, 1993. However, EPA believes that the effective date of the Pennsylvania enhanced I/M program is approvable for two reasons. First, it would be a futile act to require the Commonwealth to amend its regulations to require an earlier effective date at this time. It would normally take Pennsylvania more than the six months remaining before the effective date of January 1, 1995 to complete the administrative process to amend the regulations. Secondly, an earlier effective date would not change any of the requirements of the regulations. Pennsylvania has already initiated all of the steps required under the federal I/M regulations to be conducted prior to January 1, 1995 under independent authority. The January 1, 1995 effective date will allow the Commonwealth to fully implement the enhanced I/M program consistent with the requirements of the federal I/M rule. Therefore, EPA concludes that the delay in the effective date of the Pennsylvania I/M rule is deminimis, and EPA proposes to approve the January 1, 1995 effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

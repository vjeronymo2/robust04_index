			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes week on a higher note Cautiousness over currency movements prevailed, and share prices closed moderately higher after fluctuating in a narrow range on small lot index-linked trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose 28.21 to 18,959.60 after a high of 19,078.41 and a low of 18,873.09, a week's loss of 2.5 per cent. The index rose in the morning on Thursday's gains in the Chicago Nikkei futures market; however, afternoon selling on the Singapore futures market pushed share prices lower. While the yen stabilised against the dollar at the Y105 level, lingering worries over currency fluctuations left investors inactive. Volume was 260m shares against 299m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 3.56 to 1,557.11 and the Nikkei 300 closed up 0.90 to 287.96. Losers led gainers by 505 to 471, with 187 issues remaining unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.93 to 1,294.50. Telecommunications stocks, which had lost ground this week on US threats of trade sanctions, firmed with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rising Y14,000 to Y900,000 and NEC advancing Y11 to Y979. Sony surged Y230 to Y6,030 on better than expected earings estimates for the year to March. Aiwa, a Sony subsidiary, rose Y30 to Y2,300. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, plunged Y220 to Y7,280 on reports of poor earnings estimates. After the market closed, the company announced that it would report a pre-tax profit of Y42.5bn for the current year to March, instead of the previously forecast Y57.5bn, due to slack earnings in Europe. Pioneer Electronic plunged Y220 to Y2,580 on prospects of the company's first loss since its listing in 1964. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 59.45 to 21,096.20 in volume of 43.1m shares. Roundup A depressing theme, taking in interest rates, bond markets and pressure on equities, weighed on the region yesterday. HONG KONG finished cautious ahead of a key interest rate meeting, the Hang Seng index closing 39.30 higher at 10,825.88, but 5.9 per cent lower on the week. Brokers were talking about a rate increase in line with that in the US but, in the event, the prime rate was held at 6.5 per cent. Nevertheless, analysts said that they still expected a rate increase soon and, in London, the Fleming Hong Kong index fell 124 to 10,702. TAIWAN hit more selling in the financial sector as the weighted index closed off 60.02 at 5,845.47, down 7.1 per cent over the two week period which included a week's closure for the Chinese new year. The Big Three banks fell between TDollars 6 and TDollars 8. One observer said that some investors were withdrawing from banks and focusing on asset-backed issues. BANGKOK ended a volatile session higher, with the SET index recording a rise of 10.88 to 1,456.08, a week's gain of 3.5 per cent. Turnover was firm at Bt10.2bn. Bangkok Bank remained the main focus of interest, losing Bt3 at Bt197. KUALA LUMPUR moved higher after Thursday's setback in improved turnover of MDollars 1.4bn compared with the previous session's MDollars 831m. The composite index gained 14.59 to 1,086.73, barely changed on the week. AUSTRALIA saw a sharp fall in bonds as an ADollars 150m fixed interest portfolio moved slowly through the market, and the All Ordinaries index closed 17.7 softer at 2,223.2, 0.8 per cent down on the week in turnover of ADollars 481m. The gold index lost 25.4, or 1.5 per cent to 2,392.0, but Samantha Gold jumped 30 cents to ADollars 6.90 on what was described as a recent excellent quarterly report. Petroz peaked at ADollars 1.17 before closing another 5 cents to the good at 95 cents, up since Wednesday when it announced that its well in the Timor Gap was the first to strike oil in the region. NEW ZEALAND also blamed the bond market as the NZSE-40 index dropped 40.74 to 2,284.17, down 2.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of NZDollars 65m. BOMBAY advanced on sustained buying by domestic investors and mutual funds, bringing lifting the BSE 30-index by 47.65 to 3,915.04.</p>

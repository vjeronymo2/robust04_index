			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAINS CONFIDENCE IN TOWER DESPITE RUMORS, BUSH SAYS  </P> <P> President Bush said Monday that he retains confidence in John Tower as his  nominee for secretary of defense and that the controversy over the former Texas  senator's private life would not cripple his ability to handle the Pentagon  job.  </P> <P> The Senate Armed Services Committee has held up Tower's confirmation while the  FBI investigates new allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing. In the  course of its renewed inquiry over the weekend, FBI agents turned up additional  charges of personal misconduct by Tower, but they could not be substantiated,  sources said.  </P> <P> Bush was briefed Monday on the progress of the FBI investigation and told  reporters at an afternoon press conference that he has heard nothing that would  shake his confidence in Tower.  </P> <P> "I think people would not want a person to step aside, given rumor,  particularly if the rumor is baseless," Bush said. " . . . If these allegations  prove to be allegations without fact behind them, I think the people are going  to say: 'Wait a minute, what went on here?' "  </P> <P> He said, however, that "if someone comes up with facts" indicating that Tower  is unfit to serve in government, he is not too "narrow-minded" to listen to  them.  </P> <P> The FBI report is virtually complete but has not been forwarded to the Armed  Services Committee, sources said. No date has been set for a vote on the  nomination, but panel Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said Monday evening that a vote  today is unlikely.  </P> <P> The full Senate probably will not receive the nomination until next week.  </P> <P> Bush said that, if Tower is approved, as he expects, he does not believe that  "there's any danger to his credibility or his ability to do his job."  </P> <P> Some Democrats in Congress, notably House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les  Aspin of Wisconsin, have said that the flurry of rumors about Tower and the  protracted confirmation process will leave him weakened and unable to  effectively take charge at the Pentagon.  </P> <P> Tower was said Monday to be confident that he will be confirmed. He spent the  day at the Pentagon working on budget and policy issues with aides.  </P></p>

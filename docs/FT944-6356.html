			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Overseas gravy train may be running out of steam - Preparing expatriate packages is challenging the expertise of human resource management Expatriate employment deals - once one of the best ways for individual employees to get rich on their own account - appear to be undergoing something of an upheaval across Europe among many multinational companies, according to the findings of some recent reports. Renting out your house while you are away, living off expenses and paid schooling for the children have all been traditional ways of saving money when on expatriate assignments. But companies, increasingly aware of such costs and savings, are becoming more interested in taking them into account when preparing expatriate packages. Prof Chris Brewster, professor of European Human Resource Management at Cranfield University School of Management, said: 'People are realising that the whole deal is negotiable and that factors other than cost of living may be involved.' Expatriates, he said, tended to cost four times more than the outlay for local staff. 'These are the most expensive of employees but probably less time is spent strategically thinking about their roles than on anyone else in the staffing system,' he said. An Ernst &amp; Young report, drawn from a survey of some 427 multinational companies with operations across Europe, found many employers were cracking down on the packages as they expanded their expatriate workforces. A third of the employers said they expected to be changing the basis for paying their salaries, mostly moving towards paying host country rates often lower than those at the home base. Almost half the employers said they expected more of their expatriate employees to accept host country contracts within the next three years. Michael Kaltz, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young specialising in expatriate services, said companies were placing 'tremendous emphasis' on reducing the cost of traditional expatriates. He said: 'The normal practice of retaining expats on home country packages will become a thing of the past as employers integrate expats into the local workforce.' About 40 per cent of the employers wanted policy changes on expatriate career development to address such issues as cost containment, dual careers, repatriation, moves within Europe and taxation. 'Companies have to give more thought about what their individual expatriate employees are going to do when their assignment is over,' said Kaltz. Ernst &amp; Young also gave an insight into some of the other deals made available to expatriates. Of the companies offering a pre-assignment trip, 62 per cent included the partner and 21 per cent the whole family. Almost all the employers provided home leave visits, with 15 per cent of them offering more than one paid home visit per year. Nearly six in 10 of the employers expected their expatriates to contribute to their housing costs abroad. However, more than three-quarters of employers said they did not adjust pay to reflect a lower cost of living in a host country. Most provided additional health care and the vast majority provided educational assistance. The underlying message from the study is that companies are at last waking up to the changing nature of expatriate employment and its strain on the corporate budget. Managements working on overseas assignments are also beginning to display greater awareness of the need to balance the social demands of families, not least those of the working wife. The costs of getting it wrong, both in potentially wrecked careers and to the company in moving people back, can be alarming. A Europe-wide survey carried out for Mobile Europe by Employment Conditions Abroad, consultants on overseas assignment packages, found employers increasingly more willing to recognise the social and domestic concerns of employees sent abroad, such as care of elderly parents and children's schooling. Foreign postings were becoming shorter and employers more flexible in the way they put their packages together, it said. Some 72 per cent of almost 200 who replied to the survey said they would now pay the cost of transfering non-married partners overseas, although no more than a quarter were yet willing to accept same-sex partners when staffing assignments. Cranfield has found that many of the largest multinationals, including the oil companies, are trying to reduce their reliance on expatriate staff, recruiting more local expertise where they can. At the same time, more smaller companies are expanding overseas, adding perhaps one or two expatriate posts on staff. The type of people taking expatriate assignments is changing too. Still predominantly male, they are tending to have better qualifications than previously, often possessing Master of Business Administration qualifications. Many also have wives pursuing careers, who do not see why they should drop their own jobs to follow their husbands abroad. Such developments are leading to far more businesslike discussions between managements and prospective expatriate staff. Bargaining is becoming more common and market forces can have a decisive influence in recruitment decisions. For example, bio-technology graduates are in short supply in the UK compared to those in Italy; so at least one UK-based company is taking on Italians for bio-technology posts. It can get them for less than it would need to pay UK candidates. A need for better human resource management in the preparation of expatriate employees emerged in recent research carried out by Cranfield and the Centre for International Briefing at Farnham in Surrey. It discovered 'a serious lack of knowledge about local business environments' among 205 large company senior managers moving overseas. About 70 per cent of them wanted more pre-departure training on local business law and practices. Most of those going outside western Europe and English-speaking countries were worried that they had received no host country language training. While you have to wonder at the advisability of appointing anyone who thinks it is easy to ask a Moslem his Christian name - an admission of one of the respondents - one can sympathise with the manager who arrived in Tokyo and found to his consternation that a crash course in Japanese prior to going there was essential for such basics as shopping and travelling. Managers were asking for 'nuts and bolts' training covering law, dealing with business partners, local nationals and ordinary business etiquette. They stressed that preparation was equally or even more important for transfers to similar cultures, often because of different bureaucracies. The paperwork and permits demanded in the US were a common source of anguish. A manager summarising a common lament in a part of the survey questionnaire left for general remarks, wrote: 'One learned much on arrival. If we had known about some of it before, we might not have come.' A summary of the Ernst &amp; Young report is available free from the firm, phone Sue Griffiths, tel 931 2618.

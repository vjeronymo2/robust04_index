			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Japanese Economic Package: The economic measures in detail THE Japanese government's economic package, announced yesterday, comprises the following measures: Expansion of public works spending totalling Y8,600bn. In order to stimulate demand, the government will provide an additional Y3,400bn to general public works, Y500bn for disaster relief, Y550bn for spending on cultural, educational research facilities, Y550bn for advance land acquisitions by public institutions, Y1,800bn for regional public works, Y1,000bn for local governments' advance purchases of land for public works projects, and an Y800bn increase in public housing loans. Advance acquisition of land for future public works. Although in previous economic support measures, land acquisitions were kept at minimum levels, the current stagnation of the property market has prompted the government to try to activate land transactions through purchases by public funds. Of the Y8,600bn, the amount allotted to advance land purchases totals Y1,550bn. This will include Y1,000bn for purchases by regional public institutions, Y150bn for public corporation purchases, Y250bn for special accounts spending and Y150bn for the treasury account. Increasing housing investments. The sharp decline in housing purchases by individuals has contributed to the slump in the property market. The Y800bn increase in public housing loans, included above in the Y8,600bn, is aimed at enhancing housing and land purchases. Housing eligible for housing loans by the Housing Loan Corporation will be increased by 10,000 units. The plan includes easing of terms of lending for new and used houses and parking lots. Encouraging corporate capital spending. The government will aim to encourage capital spending by increasing the Japan Development Bank's lending quota for labour saving investment by Y900bn. Although not included in the Y8,600bn, the government hopes that additional spill-over effects of tax breaks for the promotion of equipment investment will total Y1,000bn, and frontloading of capital investments by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and other utilities such as electric power companies, will amount to Y700bn. Revitalising small and middle sized corporations. For small and middle sized enterprises, the government will expand lending provisions at government-affiliated financial institutions by Y1,200bn. The government will also promote computer investments and investments to rationalise operations at the small-sized companies by offering tax incentives and accelerated depreciation. Unemployment measures. The government will avoid unemployment by smooth collection and analysis of information in labour shifts. Job training, transfers, and temporary suspensions will be also be implemented to sustain employment. Enhancing services and information for the consumer. The government will respond to sluggish consumer demand by researching with private sector companies to find new products, easing consumer credit, and activating demand through promotional events. Promotion of imports. The government will promote imports through the development of foreign trade terminals, strengthening import promotion capabilities of the Japan External Trade Organisation, expansion of import financing measures, use of imported goods for government facilities, and strengthening the Office of Trade Ombudsman. Stabilising the financial system. The measures to support the country's ailing banks, announced on August 18 by the ministry of finance, were reconfirmed. In addition, the government will ask banks to compile specific plans this year for establishing a joint entity which will buy land held as collateral against problem loans. The government reiterated that preferential tax treatment will be provided to financial institutions which write off assets, and that problem assets at the banks are to be disclosed at the end of this fiscal year. It also called for the early restructuring of non-bank financial institutions and housing-loan companies facing mounting problem debts. To prevent banks from curbing corporate lending, the government will promote additional measures which will raise the banks' capital, and cut assets. Activating the stock market. The government aims to stimulate the stock market by allowing additional public funds to flow into stock market. The government will also limit the additional supply of new shares into the market by suspending government offerings of former state owned companies. Revitalisation of individual investor activity is also anticipated. Limitations on stock investments of public funds such as postal savings and postal insurance funds will be abolished. An additional Y1,120bn, will be provided by the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, raising the potential amount of public funds which could be invested in the stock market to Y2,820bn. Loan trusts, savings vehicles offered by trust banks, will be allowed to invest in the stock market. Sales of shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the former state owned telecommunications company, currently held by the government, will be suspended for the two fiscal years to March 1994. Sales of two state owned corporations, JR East, the railway operation, and Japan Tobacco, will also be suspended for the current fiscal year to March 1993. Individuals, who have failed to return to the stock market due to the sharp decline in investor confidence, will be encouraged to invest in shares again, through long-term investment products, lower minimum trading units of shares, and accumulative stock investment schemes. To activate the corporate bond market, the government will eliminate laws limiting issuance of corporate bonds, and will abolish the system whereby every corporate issue has to have a bank acting as the agent. Laws banning a company's purchase of its own shares will also be reviewed. In addition, brokers will be expected to promote stocks by abiding rules set by the securities dealers' association, and financial institutions will be requested to refrain from selling stocks to realise unrealised gains on share holdings. Authorities will review futures and options trading, which is seen as having distorted the underlying stock market. Implementation of a flexible monetary policy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by G. Mihajlovski: "Additional Contingent of </F> Americans"]    [Excerpts] An additional contingent of 200 to 250 U.S.  troops will arrive in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] in the next few weeks. This information was  given by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John  Shalikashvili at yesterday's news conference in Skopje.    Shalikashvili, who had meetings with President of the  Republic Kiro Gligorov and Defense Minister Vlado Popovski, also  visited U.S. troops serving as part of the UNPROFOR forces for  Macedonia, located in the Petrovec military camp, and said at a  news conference that President Clinton had announced his  readiness to send more U.S. troops to Macedonia. [passage  omitted]    The Defense Minister of the Republic of Macedonia Vlado  Popovski also spoke at the news conference, and said that the  Macedonian side thought that the U.S. contingent should be  expanded, because that was a way of strengthening the preventive  peacekeeping. "We agreed that Macedonia represented the key  factor for peace and stability in the region, and that  preventive peacekeeping in Macedonia was equally important as  the solution to the conflict in Bosnia- Herzegovina."    Minister Popovski said that they had had discussions about  military cooperation with the United States, in the sense of  giving assistance to the transformation of our defense concept  to NATO standards. On the possible arrival of a U.S. military  attache in Macedonia, Popovski said that "there obviously is a  need for a military liaison officer but he will be given the  status of a military attache after the establishment of full  diplomatic relations," explaining that the United States had  also agreed that there was a need to send such a person to  Macedonia.    Asked about possible discussions on ceding the Krivolak  military camp to U.S. soldiers, Popovski replied: "Such ideas  are neither current nor initiated by either of the two sides.  We only discussed possible U.S. assistance in the  transformation of our army, first of all for the defense of the  Republic of Macedonia, and for its inclusion in the `Partnership  for Peace' project."    According to the information released from the cabinet of  the  president of the Republic of Macedonia, the Macedonian-Greek  dispute was also a subject of discussions between President  Gligorov and Shalikashvili (also attended by Foreign Minister  Stevo Crvenkovski and Popovski), in the sense that it could have  negative implications for the wider stability in the south of  the Balkans. President Gligorov personally has renewed the  request by our state to join the "Partnership for Peace" NATO  project.</p>

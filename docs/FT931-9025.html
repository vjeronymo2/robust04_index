			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin talks in trouble TALKS between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic ran into further problems yesterday when Virgin renewed its threat to take further legal action against BA, Paul Betts writes. Virgin said that after two weeks of negotiations the two sides were 'back to the drawing board' in their efforts to settle their dispute over BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin. Virgin is seeking a cash offer from BA for the 'serious commercial damage' it claims to have suffered. Relations between the two sides deteriorated following the disclosure at the weekend of a letter from Mr Robert Ayling, BA's new managing director, to Virgin, setting out proposals to settle the dispute. 'We do not expect to see every piece of correspondence between the two companies in the newspapers,' Virgin said, adding that the terms in the letter were unacceptable. The proposals included Pounds 3m in compensation for an earlier maintenance dispute between the two airlines and an independent arbitration procedure on Virgin's claims against BA. Virgin said the maintenance dispute was a separate issue which had already been the subject of arbitration for the past 18 months. BA, which is expected to announce sharply lower third quarter earnings today, yesterday described the talks between the two airlines last week as 'friendly', adding that both sides had agreed to continue discussions this week.</p>

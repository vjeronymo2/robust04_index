			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA;  </P> <P> SOCKERS  </P> <P> Donald Cogsville, the Sockers' first-round draft choice from University of  North Carolina, signed a one-year contract Thursday. No other Socker  first-round selection has ever signed with the professional team.  </P> <P> "I was aware of that dismal fact before I got here," Cogsville said. "I knew it  was going to be tough because the Sockers have won so many championships, and  they have so many veteran players."  </P> <P> Cogsville, 24, led the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring last year with 14  goals and was a member of the U.S. national team for seven months in 1988. He  will switch from forward to defender. DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

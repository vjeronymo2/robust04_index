The government  needs to know what stand independent deputies will take in the  State Duma, he added.    Chernomyrdin stressed that the government would support any  faction willing to work for the good of the country and called  on deputies to establish firm cooperation between government and  parliament based on a centrist position. He, in his turn,  guaranteed to support constructive dialogue between the two  branches of power. If necessary, I will come and meet you and  bring the whole government with me, he said.    Chernomyrdin said the government would not be pursuing  "popular" economic policies and that everything should be done  to avoid a situation where the executive proposes "unpopular"  and the legislative "popular" measures.</p>

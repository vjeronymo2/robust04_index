			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Chinese likely to agree on Hong Kong talks BRITAIN and China are expected to announce this week that they will hold talks on Hong Kong's future political development. At a meeting of Governor Chris Patten's Executive Council yesterday, his top advisory body agreed to defer temporarily the introduction of a bill in the Legislative Council (Legco), the colony's law-making institution. The bill would give effect to Mr Patten's plans for broadening the democratic franchise in elections due next year and in 1995. It is unlikely, however, that the talks herald a change in China's opposition to Mr Patten's plans. Beijing's overture was seen in Hong Kong as an attempt by China to slow down the process of Legco ratification. The negotiations about talks have been conducted in Beijing by Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador, and senior Chinese government officials. The two sides are still working out the details. It was unclear last night what the scope and duration of the talks would be. Barring last-minute hitches, they are expected to be announced by Friday. Mr Patten's legislation is not expected to be discussed. Beijing's decision to request talks has placed Mr Patten and the British government in a difficult position. Mr Patten, who has called for dialogue with China since he announced his proposals last October, could face a strong backlash in Hong Kong if he refused to talk. However, few in the Hong Kong administration believe that China's 11th-hour agreement to talks is anything but a tactical manoeuvre to prevent Mr Patten's legislation from being introduced into Legco. The governor has been receiving conflicting advice as to whether he should introduce legislation while talks are in progress or wait until they finish. Britain's Foreign Office was strongly of the view that presenting the bill to Legco while talks were under way would be unacceptable to China. Deferral of the bill would be likely to draw stiff criticism from Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, said that while he welcomed the prospect of talks, he saw no reason why Mr Patten should delay the bill's introduction into Legco. However, deferral of the legislation would probably be welcomed by Hong Kong's conservative politicians, who have been advocating such a policy.</p>

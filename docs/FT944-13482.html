			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Seaperfect ready for market Seaperfect, the world's largest controlled producer of shellfish, is coming to the market next month through a Pounds 27m placing and offer which will value the scallop and clam farmer at about Pounds 60m. The company, which was founded by an American computers entrepreneur, yesterday published a pathfinder prospectus setting out its reasons for coming to the UK market. In it, Seaperfect forecasts that losses this year will not exceed Pounds 1m. Last year the group incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.69m. Mr Bill Lord-Butcher, the US-born chief executive, said flotation would give Seaperfect the means to increase scallop and clam production 10-fold over the next few years to meet rising demand. Currently the group processes some two tonnes of shellfish a day. It farms shellfish in Chile, Florida and South Carolina, producing seed in its hatcheries and setting the young clams and scallops in protected coastal areas. The process takes 17 and 30 months from seed to harvest for scallops and clams respectively. Mr Lord-Butcher argues that controlled production will become increasingly important as wild shellfish stocks decline because of over-fishing, pollution and poor reserve management. Wild catch, mostly from Japan and China, still dominates the market for shellfish. The company warns in its prospectus, however, that the business does come with a certain degree of risk, in spite of the controlled production processes. Where possible insurance had been taken out against factors such as disease and pollution. After the placing and offer directors will hold 21 per cent of the company and new investors 44 per cent.</p>

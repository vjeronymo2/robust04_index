			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / German bank chief airs treaty worries MR Helmut Schlesinger, president of Germany's Bundesbank, said yesterday the Maastricht treaty had created tensions because some countries felt threatened about loss of national identity and the road towards full political union remained undefined. 'Just how uncertain people are in assessing the treaty is reflected in the outcomes of the referendums in Denmark and France, perhaps even in the avoidance of such referendums in other countries,' he said. 'The essential debate on Europe's future political shape, a federal state versus a federation of states, has not even reached major parts of the general public as yet.' Mr Schlesinger warned that uncertainty regarding further developments towards political union, had a direct impact on plans for monetary union. In a speech to the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, Mr Schlesinger set out Bundesbank reservations about the pace of European political union and monetary union. 'I believe it to be short-sighted simply to regard European monetary union as the logical conclusion to the process of economic integration. Monetary union is rather a step with a significance of its very own. A single market can exist and be beneficial without inevitably requiring further moves towards integration in the monetary sphere.' He also warned that the creation of a completely independent European Central Bank as a plank for monetary union was not a 'cure-all' for ensuring price stability. 'Monetary policy cannot reverse a grave misdirection of fiscal and wage policies. Anti-inflation policy cannot be reduced to the problem of providing the proper set of technical instruments.' The Maastricht treaty has already established four criteria for entry into monetary union. But Mr Schlesinger, quoting Chancellor Helmut Kohl, repeated that there was 'no side entrance for candidates who do not meet the stringent prerequisites'. The Bundesbank president questioned how consensus on the need for currency, budgetary, and fiscal stability could be achieved once monetary union has been established, particularly following the uncertainity arising from political union. IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, indicated yesterday it would focus its pay campaign in east Germany on enterprises it believes can afford to meet the union's wage demands. Its leaders will decide on Monday on a ballot of members in eastern Germany for an all-out strike in support of higher wage increases.</p>

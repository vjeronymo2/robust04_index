			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / S African military link with violence doubted A SOUTH African judge charged with investigating public violence yesterday cast doubt on allegations that the country's military is involved in fanning township unrest. The anti-apartheid Weekly Mail newspaper and the African National Congress yesterday presented a memorandum to the commission of inquiry chaired by Mr Justice Richard Goldstone, arguing that South African military intelligence set up front companies and used them to train agents to foment township violence. In recent weeks, the Weekly Mail has published several articles quoting individuals who claim to have been involved in such activities, including a former senior official of the Inkatha Freedom party, the ANC's main black political rival. The ANC views the Weekly Mail revelations as proof that a so-called 'third force' exists within the security forces to provoke violence aimed at ANC supporters. The Weekly Mail's lawyer, Mr David Soggot, told a hearing of the commission yesterday: 'There is general evidence ..which authorises the inference  .that military intelligence has set out on a strategic policy of funding violence and is still bent on that strategy.' However, Mr Justice Goldstone said evidence provided so far did not support charges that the military was continuing to fund violence at present - though he said he would examine all military activities that could have a bearing on current violence. His commission, set up by President F W de Klerk last October, is charged with investigating the causes of violence since July last year.</p>

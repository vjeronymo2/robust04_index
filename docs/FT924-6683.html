			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Romanian government approved THE Romanian parliament yesterday accepted a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and committed to gentler reforms. The cabinet is dominated by the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF) which won 28 per cent of the vote in September's elections. It includes several junior ministers who served in the communist era and favours a slower reform. However, the cabinet is weighted towards the party's younger wing and brings many newcomers to the government. It also includes some reform-minded independents, such as Mr Misu Negritoiu, who will be deputy prime minister in charge of economic reforms. Romanian nationalist parties which captured 12 per cent of the vote did not, as feared by many, win cabinet posts. The democratic convention, a coalition of anti-communist parties which came second in the polls, voted against the government because it said it failed to present concrete economic policies. Mr Vacaroiu said he would not present a long-term strategy for four months.</p>

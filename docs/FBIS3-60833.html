			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Folly of Hate in Lebanon"] </F>   [Text] The last thing in the world Lebanon would need under  its present political and economic circumstances is a new round  of terrorist bombing. But, it seems, some of the opposing  factions in that country have not as yet learned from the past  hard experience since they've done it again. A massive bomb  explosion wrecked the headquarters of the Christian Phalange  Party in Beirut yesterday (Monday) as a result of which two  innocent people were killed and dozens of others were injured.    The Christian Phalange Party was responsible for some of  Lebanon's cruellest acts of crime during that country's decade  and half years old civil war that came to a partial end in 1991.  But despite their poor past performance record the bombing, or  the act of planting it, was most unwarranted, a big mistake and  an act of utmost narrow-mindedness.    This latest act of terrorism is bound to breathe new life in  the old and evil religious and factional animus, and trigger a  new round of vengefulness, destruction and killing. What is  most unfortunate is that in this midst a series of most innocent  people, who have nothing to do with the dirty game of politics  and political rivalry, will most likely pay the price.    In yesterday's bombing two people, including a young boy,  who  had nothing to do with the Phalange Party or its activities,  were killed. Also according to the reports, panic-stricken  residents of the buildings around the party headquarters shouted  hysterically as they forced their way through the wreckage to  find their loved ones. Words alone cannot describe the  dastardliness and the cruelness of the act. One has to put  himself in the shoes of those whose loved ones were killed or  maimed by the bombing to grasp the extent of the crime. Why?  Why not put the blind evil of hate behind?    Bomb attacks were frequent during the civil war, and whether  the terrorists like to admit it or not, in Lebanon bombings have  run their course. They are ineffective weapons of persuasion  and can't make a dent in anybody's mind except perhaps foster  hatred -- what Lebanon can and must do without. The bombings  harm everyone including the very people or groups they are  supposed to help. The experience of using a bomb as a means of  furthering one's political goal has not been successful in that  country, and the only thing they have managed to bring about is  to make the whole of Lebanon measurably poorer, irrespective of  one's religious or party affiliation.    Lebanon is like a boat and all the Lebanese people in it  will  either be saved by reaching the shore (of prosperity) or sink  together. One bad thing about terrorist bombings is that they  scare off tourists who bring badly needed foreign exchange into  that country, as well as investments by affluent Lebanese  expatriates or foreign companies. After all who would want to  get caught in the crossfire of bombings?    Not only that the rich Lebanese, who would want to bring  their moneys into Lebanon and invest there, would be scared off,  but also the friendly countries and international lending  institutions which have made their contributions and loans  contingent upon progress in the national reconciliation process,  and in general, Lebanon's peace and stability would be forced to  have a change of mind.    The different Lebanese factions must have learned by now  that  Lebanon should have a place for all legitimate religions and  political religious groups with no exception. And that the  different factions will have to put their human and material  resources together if they want to see Lebanon on a development  course again.    Those responsible for the planting of the bomb at the  Phalange Party headquarters must have not grown enough to  understand the wastefulness and folly of their act. But one  thing is plenty clear: Those behind the act are not just the  enemies of the phalangists but also their own party, clan,  families, and in short the enemies of Lebanon and every  individual in it.    A word of advice for the phalangists: Nothing in life is as  sweet as the exercise of prudence and forgiveness. However,  before they begin thinking about quenching their sense of  revenge by killing innocent people and destroying their  life-earned properties, the phalangists should look into their  own political setup to make sure the bomb was not an inside job  by the ultra-inept who would like to see a resurgence of  religious and factional enmity in Lebanon.</p>

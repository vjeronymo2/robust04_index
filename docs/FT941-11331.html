			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Vard shares tumble as AEA quits cruise bid Shares in Vard, the loss-making Norwegian cruise ship and ferry operator, tumbled yesterday as AEA Investors, a US investment company, withdrew its Dollars 565m bid to acquire two of Vard's cruise lines. Vard's shares fell 21 per cent to NKr51 in active trading on the Oslo bourse. On Wednesday they were the second-most traded share when they rose NKr4.50 to NKr64.50. The collapse of the AEA deal is the second time Vard has failed to conclude asset disposals in recent months. AEA and Vard had hoped to complete the deal by this spring. AEA said it had decided not to pursue the transaction having concluded that its investment goals for the two cruise lines could not be achieved within the financial framework proposed for the transaction. Proceeds from the disposal would have enabled Vard to lift its position in the mass cruise market by concentrating financial resources on Norwegian Cruise Line, its remaining cruise business. It had planned to strengthen, expand and modernise Norwegian Cruise Line as well as reduce borrowings and strengthen the line's balance sheet. Mr Terje Mikalsen, Vard's chairman, said a number of alternatives to the US deal were being studied. Analysts said the failure of the deal pushes fleet renewals far into the future and raises questions over alternative strategies for Vard to accomplish goals which could have only been made possible by the disposal. They suggested AEA may have backed out of the deal because of reservations about the potential of the high-risk cruise industry versus the cost of participation and the return on investment. Vard said bookings for the two cruise lines were stronger than in previous years. It forecast profits for both cruise lines in the current year.</p>

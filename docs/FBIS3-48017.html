			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In following the agreement of the Uruguay Round of  talks and the trend toward deregulation, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] plans to drastically  ease export controls on textile products. Within this year, the  ministry will remove legal cartels on two categories of  products, thus lifting ceilings on exports to the United States.  In addition, the export permit system requiring exporters to  get permits for exports will be abolished except for limited  items exported to the United States and the European Union (EU).    Japan's textile products have lost their competitiveness in  face of other Asian nations' export offensives, and thus the  meaning of numerical controls has diminished. The measure also  has the purpose of reducing the textile industry's burdens by  simplifying export procedures.    The products, cartels on which will no longer be legally  accepted, are secondary textile products like woolen fabric  goods and cotton trousers. The legal cartel system has been in  effect more than 20 years, and during that period MITI has set  export ceilings each year, while the Export Cooperatives have  checked export quantities and contract terms.    Controls on two categories of products, exports of cotton  fabric goods to Canada and fishing nets and synthetic fiber  products to Canada and three other countries, were removed from  the legal cartel system at the end of last year. With the  additional two categories of products to the United States being  removed from the system, only three categories of products will  be left to benefit from the legal carteling.    Meanwhile, the export permit system which will be abolished  in principle at the end of this year will apply mostly to  textile goods. The ministry is thinking about excluding East  Europe and the Middle East from the permit system by the end of  March, ahead of other countries.    Exporters' papers related to obtaining permits take the  ministry about two days per case to review, entailing much work  for the ministry officials concerned. By 1995, regulations left  on exports to the United States will be only those aimed at  curbing exports to the United States through a third party, plus  those governing legal carteling. The number of permit  application papers reviewed will fall from about 310,000 at  present to 50,000 cases in the future.    According to MITI, by the series of deregulation measures to  be effected this time, the products whose export quantities  remain under control will drop from 95 to 28 percent in export  value as far as exports to the United States are concerned.    The Multinational Fiber Agreement (MFA), which sets the  rules  for international dealings on textile products, will be absorbed  into the GATT's rules over a period of 10 years after the  Uruguay Round agreement goes into effect. The Uruguay Round  agreement regards self-controls on exports as being "gray-area  measures" and prohibits them. This means remaining regulations  will be abolished sooner or later.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> STRICTEST VDT SAFETY BILL IN U.S. PASSED  </P> <P> The New York City Council has approved legislation to protect the health and  safety of more than 12,000 city workers who use video display terminals. The  bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law of its kind in a  major city, according to the New York City Video Display Terminal Coalition of  labor unions and occupational safety and health groups. The bill mandates that  VDT operators at city agencies be given a 15-minute break when they are  required to work at a terminal for more than two consecutive hours. Under the  law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions -- including pregnancy --  would be allowed to obtain transfers.  </P></p>

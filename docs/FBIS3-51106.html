			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] PT [Workers Party] President Luis Inacio Lula da  Silva stated on 10 January that a political campaign exists to  defame the party. He indicated that the death of labor leader  Osvaldo Cruz Jr. is being used by his adversaries due to his  good conduct in the investigation. Lula also stated that the PT  is going to bring charges against [Sao Paulo City] Mayor Paulo  Maluf (PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]); Union Force President  Luiz Antonio de Medeiros; Justice Minister Mauricio Correa;  Nelson Guimaraes, the police commissioner in charge of the case;  and probably former [Sao Paulo State] Governor Orestes Quercia,  who have accused the PT of being involved in Osvaldo Cruz Jr.'s  death.</p>

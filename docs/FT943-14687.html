			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Graystone sales bring in Pounds 2.1m Graystone, the engineering company originally Ptarmigan Holdings which returned to profits in 1993, has announced two disposals for a total of Pounds 2.1m to be used to cut debt. It is selling Arnold Belford, supplier to the bakery industry, to the API Group for Pounds 1.68m. This represents another step towards the group's concentration in the engineering and distribution sectors. Belford showed turnover of Pounds 2.9m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 300,000 in 1993. Graystone is also disposing of its investment of 3m C and D redeemable ordinary shares in Blue Thane, for Pounds 450,000 cash.</p>

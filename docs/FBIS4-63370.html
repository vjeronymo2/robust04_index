			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Groznyy, 22 May -- Today a three-day international  conference entitled "Genocide in the USSR: Policy, Practice and  Ideology" ends in the Chechen capital. The recurrent theme of  the conference has been the continuing policy and practice of  genocide not only on the territory of the former Union, but also  in other regions of the world. Video documentaries have been  presented to the forum dealing with acts of mass genocide in  Tajikistan, Ingushetia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Abkhazia, and  Bosnia, as well as historical materials on the spiritual and  physical destruction of the people in Chechnya.    At the end of the conference's second day a speech was made  by Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of the Chechen Republic-Ichkeria,  who demanded the continuation of the Nuremburg trials for the  organizers and ideological inspirers of the policy of genocide  on the territory of the former Union in the present stage.  Impunity engenders new crimes, Dudayev said. Touching on the  stance of the international community, the Chechen president  noted with regret that it remains an indifferent observer of the  evil deeds being committed against peoples all over the world.    Dudayev declared the complete bankruptcy of the United  Nations, an illegitimate body in which authority is illegally  usurped by a narrow group of political clans in the person of  the so-called five permanent members of the UN Security Council.  This situation contradicts the fundamental interests of the  international community, Dudayev said.    The president of the Chechen Republic-Ichkeria appealed to  the states and countries of the world to recognize all the  riches and resources of the planet as the exclusive property of  the most high, and the right of all peoples to use these  resources without regard to state borders and formations. In  particular, Dudayev proposed as a first step that a water supply  line should be laid from the icy peaks of the Caucasus to the  Middle East, where water is the main cause of instability,  bloodshed, and war. Today the conference will end its work  after adopting a number of fundamental documents.</p>

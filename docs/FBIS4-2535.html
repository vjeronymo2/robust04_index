			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wei Min: "New Policy Benefits Car </F> Buyers"]    [Text] A new policy governing China's budding automotive  industry seems appealing to both manufacturers eager for  business and consumers who dream of owning a car.    The policy, which was approved by the government last month,  for the first time orients the auto industry toward the  interests of everyday consumers.    The policy document is kept confidential, but key points  have  been released by government officials.    China's market of 300 million households, comprising 1.18  billion people, is potentially the world's largest. However,  since the average worker earns only 4,000 yuan ($460) a year,  most of the 1 million sedans now in use are owned by work units.    Experts predict that competition will be intense among auto  makers, Chinese and foreign, to develop affordable small cars.    Business Weekly has learned that foreign companies such as  America's General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co, France's  Renault SA, Sweden's Volvo, South Korea's Daewoo Motor Co and  Japan's Nissan Motor Co will launch components-manufacturing  projects in China before long.    Industry observers are paying close attention because such  projects can be developed into car-assembly plants in a short  time.    China now has six assembly ventures with Germany's  Volkswagen  AG, France's Peugeot SA, America's Chrysler Corp and Japan's  Suzuki Motor Corp. These plants produced 230,000 sedans last  year.    "Don't worry about competition," a reform-minded official  said. "Competition among auto makers benefits customers as well  as the growing market economy."    The new policy does try to promote the development of  domestic manufacturers.    For instance, it prohibits the approval of new assembly  plants over the next two or three years. After that, approval  will be withheld from projects that would assemble cars with  complete knock-down components from overseas.    In new ventures at least 40 percent of the parts used in  assembling cars must be made in China. In three years that  proportion must be 60 percent.    Sources close to the negotiations with foreign auto makers  say potential investors seem undeterred by the policy.    The market is too big to ignore, and all foreign  manufacturers planning to invest in China say they like  competition.    Aside from foreign auto makers quite a number of Chinese  plants are developing low-priced cars.    Some claim that in a couple of years mini cars selling for  20,000 yuan ($2,300) will be available.    Experts point out that low-priced vehicles are not  necessarily low quality and heavily polluting.    Besides standards for safety, quality, fuel consumption and  exhaust emissions, the experts say, manufacturers should also  pay attention to road and repair conditions.    In addition to the 230,000 sedans made in China, about  400,000 vehicles from overseas entered the country through  various channels.    Car smuggling was rampant in 1992 and last year but has now  been stopped. Nevertheless, people still ask if Chinese-made  sedans will be good enough to compete with imports.    It is believed that China will have to cut tariffs on  imported cars if, as expected, it rejoins the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) this year.    A long-time industry observer pointed out that current  situation shows the government has not yet made up its mind to  give the industry free rein to develop.    No official permission has been granted for large enterprise  groups to raise urgently-needed development capital at home or  abroad despite years of appeals.</p>

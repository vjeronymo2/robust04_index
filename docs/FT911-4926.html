			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: New head named at AP Moller MR JESS SODERBERG was yesterday named to take over as group head of the A. P. Moller shipping, offshore and industrial group, one of the world's biggest shipping companies. At the same time the group reported a fall in net profits to DKr1.14bn (Dollars 178.33m) from DKr1.62bn last year, reflecting a steep increase in taxes to DKr878m from DKr495m. Apart from shipping the group's operations include offshore oil and gas production, manufacturing and retailing. Mr Soderberg, who is 46, will succeed Mr Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller, whose father, Mr A. P. Moller, founded the group in 1904. Mr Moller, 78, will retire from the company within the next couple of years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with provisional Haitian President </F> Emile Jonassaint by reporter Federico Guevara in Port-au-Prince  on 24 May; from the "24 Hours" newscast; in French with  passage-to-passage translation into Spanish -- recorded]    [Text] The National Palace in Haiti has a new guest, Emile  Jonassaint. He spoke to the ECO news enterprise and several  Latin American reporters on the Haitian situation.    [Begin recording] [Guevara] I would like your opinion on the  international community's stance regarding Haiti.    [Jonassaint] The international community acts this way  because it has been misinformed on what has taken place in  Haiti. I believe the international community now has precise  information and that it will change its opinion in the  not-too-distant future. I occupy this post in response to an  article in my country's Constitution, which provides that, in  the case of a vacancy, the president of the Appeals Court shall  become president.    [Guevara] What is your opinion on a possible multilateral or  unilateral military invasion?    [Jonassaint] Haiti cannot fight the international community;  Haiti does not have the atomic bomb. It is impossible. Haiti  could be reduced to ashes in a matter of minutes, but we know  that your country, Mexico, has always rejected any sort of  military intervention against other states. Mexico has always  opposed such intervention in other sovereign states.    [Guevara] What about the possibility?    [Jonassaint] I do not know. They can do whatever they like,  but I doubt it. Haiti has its protectors. [words indistinct]  extremely difficult.    [Guevara] What will happen in the next few days?    [Jonassaint] Only God knows; I am not a fortune teller. [end  recording]    Emile Jonassaint, who was born in 1913 and is 81 years old,  is perhaps a faithful representative of that 18th century black  elite -- the old Haitian oligarchy -- where the mixture of  ancestral popular rites and their very own interpretation of  constitutionality are clear examples of the enormous  contradictions that seem more noticeable in this Caribbean  country.</p>

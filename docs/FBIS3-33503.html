To ensure PFL support for his plan -- the Social Emergency Fund  [FSE] will be voted on today -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso  committed himself to stimulating government participation in the  revision, including voting on changes in the economic order.  The minister asserted that he supports the end of monopolies in  the field of telecommunications and oil. The PFL defends these  points as being fundamental for the revision.    Cardoso yesterday received for breakfast PFL President Jorge  Bornhausen and PFL leaders in the Senate Marco Maciel  (Pernambuco) and Luis Eduardo (Bahia). The minister's first  gesture in favor of the revision was to ask rapporteur-general  Nelson Jobim (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party -- Rio Grande  do Sul) to move forward the date for reporting his comments on  the amendments and proposals related to the economic order.    Bornhausen said: This is a political gesture by the  minister. He is thus stimulating debate about the issues that we  deem fundamental for the revision.    The agreement with the PFL will make it possible to vote on  postponement of the constitutional revision to 31 May -- as the  PFL wants -- during today's session of the Constituent Congress,  which has been convened to vote on the FSE. According to  Cardoso's agreement with the PFL leaders, postponement of the  deadline for the end of the revision work will be voted on  first, as a guarantee of the government's commitment to the  constitutional revision.    According to Senator Marco Maciel, the agreement does not  mean that the government will support the changes proposed by  the PFL:    "There are changes in the economic order that are of  interest  for the development of the plan, but the leaders of the party  and of the allied bloc in Congress will be responsible for their  approval."</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Atreus sales well below estimates Atreus, the shower screen and mirror supplier which came to market in March via the reverse takeover of URS International, a shell company, yesterday gave a warning on sales. The statement - which was issued after the market had closed - said that while sales for the three months to December 31 were 'slightly ahead' of the corresponding period last year, they were 'substantially below expectations'. The shares slipped 1p to 20p. The company said that margins had come under pressure and the second half would not now be as profitable, reflecting costs of the new initiatives it was taking. However, the group said it intended to declare a final dividend of 0.527p to make a total of 0.791p for the year.</p>

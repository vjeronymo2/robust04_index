Palestinian sources have confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Hamas  did  not respond to the call for an extraordinary meeting after the  Cairo agreement was signed. The call was made in the name of  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], the  Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF], and the Palestine  Liberation Front [PLF]. They said that not holding the meeting  would be "a violation of the APF's bylaws which commit members  to attend any meeting called for by at least four factions."    The sources added that the four factions submitted a plan  for  the reactivation of the role of the opposition alliance, the aim  of which was to foil the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement. They  revealed that the plan includes the following four points:    1. Formation of a national and Islamic command for the  intifadah inside the occupied territory. Some parties have  reservations about the formation of such a command for security  reasons related to the difficulty of coordination among the  military wings of the factions. The plan urges parctical steps  because of the Cairo security agreement which "is harmful to the  security of the factions in the occupied territory."    2. A call for people's conferences. This issue has not been  resolved because while the PLO factions want an organizational  role that would produce leaderships from the Palestinian  diaspora and the occupied territory, Hamas is opposed to such  conferences or to restriction of the task to just  "mobilization," and it is suspicious of such conferences.    PPSF sources have told AL-HAYAH: "Even if Hamas rejected the  initiation of such conferences, we would begin work" along with  the other three factions.    3. Initiation of political and informational steps as well  as contacts with the leaders of the Arab and Islamic states with  the aim of strengthening the position against the agreement.    4. Discussion of some APF organizational issues. PPSF  sources said: "We will accept no obstructionist formula. There  must be effective moves."    The same sources said that the Israeli forces recently  arrested a number of military activitists from the organizations  opposed to the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement. PPSF Secretary General  Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid was yesterday informed of the arrest of the  PPSF's military commander in Gaza. He sees the "arrest campaign  as an initial result of the Cairo agreement."    Meanwhile, sources of the PFLP, which is led by George  Habash, have denied any PFLP intention to move to the occupied  territory and also denied discharging some of its cadres. They  told AL-HAYAH that the PFLP "differentiates between moving the  decisionmaking to the occupied territory and moving its cadres.  Although we are passing through a financial crisis, it clings  to every member of its cadres. The magazine AL-HADAF (the  PFLP's mouthpiece) still appears weekly."</p>

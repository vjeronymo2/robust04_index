			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> THIRD TIGHT END OUT WITH INJURY  </P> <P> USC is down to its fourth tight end, sophomore Bob Crane, after redshirt  freshman Brad Banta suffered a stress fracture in his left leg Saturday in the  Trojans' 45-42 victory over UCLA.  </P> <P> Earlier this season, starter Frank Griffin suffered a season-ending knee  injury, and backup Yonnie Jackson a season-ending foot injury.  </P> <P> Banta was injured when a Bruin defensive back fell on his leg, Coach Larry  Smith said.  </P> <P> Inside linebacker Matt Gee strained his right knee during last Saturday's game  after removing a leg brace because it was uncomfortable.  </P> <P> "The doctor about tore his head off," Smith said. "And we (coaches) didn't know  he didn't have it on because they wear those (braces) below their pads."  </P> <P> Redshirt freshman Gidion Murrell will start at inside linebacker in place of  Gee.

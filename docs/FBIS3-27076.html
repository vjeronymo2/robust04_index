			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic said today that the Bosnian Serbs have  accepted a Russian proposal to stop the confrontation with NATO.    The new proposal calls on Serbs to withdraw their heavy  weaponry from around Sarajevo, while Russia dispatches 400  soldiers, now serving in the UN Protection Force in Croatia, to  Sarajevo to guarantee the peace.    Karadzic made the announcement after meeting outside  Sarajevo  with Russian presidential envoy and Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin.    During the meeting Churkin gave Karadzic a letter from  Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    According to Serbian sources, Yeltsin asked the Serbs to  withdraw their heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo immediately  in order to avoid bloodshed and establish peace in Sarajevo and  all of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Karadzic described the Russian proposal as "helpful and  constructive" for the peace process.    Churkin said that Russia's proposal will end the possibility  that any side in the Bosnian conflict will gain the upper hand.    He also expressed the hope that the Bosnian Muslims would  also accept the Russian proposal.    He pointed out that the UN Protection Force in Bosnia should  fulfill its peacekeeping duties and supervise all sides in the  conflict.    The overwhelming opinion here is that NATO will not carry  out  air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions since all the conditions  required by NATO have been met.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Personal View: Bank of France must go its own way What do Mr Jean-Claude Trichet and his colleagues on the Bank of France's monetary council think about the Bundesbank's problems in controlling German money supply? After renewed signs during the past few weeks that M3 'broad money' is expanding beyond the Bundesbank's target range, should France not be implementing a monetary policy suited to its own domestic economy, rather than acting as a Bundesbank satellite? We are unlikely to find the answer to either question - at least in any coherent way. The monetary council, since it was set up in January, is behaving more like yet another elitist club within a secret state than a pioneer of a new liberal monetary order. Mr Trichet, the Bank's governor, announced after the council's first meeting that he is the sole spokesman to the press. Any suggestion that council members would voice their views publicly, in similar fashion to officials of the Bundesbank or the US Federal Reserve, was rebuffed. Cynics would argue that there are no secret council deliberations to discover. Attempts by journalists and market analysts to ferret out the council's position on the biggest question of all - should French monetary policy become much more independent of the Bundesbank? - could mirror poor K's efforts in Kafka's 'Trial' to find out the contents of his judges' notebooks: the result would be blank pages. The cynics have a point. The Balladur government, in its rush to grant independence to the Bank of France, has left the council largely insulated from the type of normal pressures which would, in an open society, lead to changes in policy. Members have not had to face questions from any parliamentary committee. Nor do they publish minutes of meetings. They are not subject to US-type freedom of information legislation. The Bank of France's monthly bulletin remains bland, offering no insights to compensate for secrecy elsewhere. All this illustrates that liberal ideology was hardly a big influence on Mr Balladur's decision to give priority to central bank independence. Rather, the driving idea was that independence would boost the credibility of France's anti-inflation policy. France would thereby enjoy the benefits of lower interest rates and an even harder currency. This hypothesis is now in doubt. French bond yields have risen by more than 1 percentage point in the three months since the council started work, whereas the rise in German rates has been only 0.70 point. So long as independence means that the central bank is free to follow a policy of imitating every Bundesbank move, in splendid insulation from domestic political pressure, there is little prospect of any gain. The French financial markets and macroeconomy will remain vulnerable to monetary and fiscal shock from Germany. At best the credibility of French monetary stability can be no greater than Germany's. Yet in view of the recent history of error in German monetary policy, could France not aim to do better? Achieving a higher monetary standard of performance than Germany would offer France the best long-term route to lower interest rates. Unless the council is soon forced away from dependence on the Bundesbank, France could become a case study in how not to grant independence to a central bank. A failure of the French economy to recover significantly later this year might turn the council into a scapegoat in the presidential election campaign. Perhaps there is still an opportunity for the Balladur government to prompt a change in course. Legally, the French government retains responsibility for exchange rate policy. Mr Balladur could instruct the council that a stable franc against the D-Mark is no longer a central aim. Paris needs only to drop hints that exchange rate stability is less important that other economic objectives. The franc/D-Mark rate would then fall. An end to the stable franc policy could also come irrespective of Mr Balladur's wishes. The possibility that his rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, may occupy the Elysee Palace next spring could act as a catalyst for a weaker franc. The franc is poised in Humpty Dumpty fashion just above its old support level of FFr3.43. If it is knocked off the wall again, the French and German governments are unlikely to send in a joint rescue force. Such a fatal accident would indeed be for the best. A floating franc would not end the need to co-operate with the Bundesbank. It would, however, provide France with the best opportunity for constructing a domestic anchor for monetary policy that reconciled central bank independence with genuine economic liberalism.

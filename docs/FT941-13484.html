			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's strong run halted by program sales Wall Street US blue chip stocks retreated yesterday for the first time in seven sessions after an afternoon wave of program selling brought a sharp swing in share prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.69 off at 3,912.79, after crossing the 3,900 threshold for the first time on Friday. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 extended its loss in late activity, ending down 2.75 at 471.97. The American SE composite shed 1.37 to 483.37 and the Nasdaq composite 3.63 to 790.65. New York SE volume came to 298m shares, while declines outscored rises by 1,200 to 903. With the US Treasury postponing its scheduled budget report because of last week's weather-related shutdown, investors were free to concentrate on a fresh batch of corporate results released during the session. The strength of two stocks - International Business Machines and Caterpillar  -was sufficient to propel the Dow ahead by as much as 15 points by midsession. IBM was at centre stage amid growing anticipation that the computer company would today report its first profit since the second quarter of 1992. The stock climbed Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 58 5/8 in heavy trade of 4.2m shares which lifted it to the top of the NYSE's most active list. Caterpillar advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 101 1/4 as its strong earnings report late last week generated continued interest among buyers. The stock also benefited from an upgrading by Morgan Stanley. However, with the US Treasury market showing weakness as the afternoon progressed, most stocks failed to make much headway. Analysts said some issues slipped in a follow through to gains related to the 'double-witching' expiration of stock options on Friday. In the final two hours, the Dow retraced its earlier progress and fell into negative territory, while the secondary indices broke into full retreat. Among the exceptions, Reynolds climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 in an endorsement of its recently announced restructuring. In other basic metal issues, Alcoa added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 75 5/8 . Several oil companies posted lacklustre results, but their share prices were mixed. Texaco put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 66 1/4 , Amoco slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 5/8 and Arco receded Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 106 1/2 . Chevron, which has yet to report its performance, gained Dollars 1 at Dollars 92 5/8 . Computer issues were generally stronger. Computer Associates firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 in a rebound from a sharp sell-off last week. Advanced Micro Devices rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 , while a strong fourth quarter lifted Unisys by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 13 3/8 . Profit-taking pushed the Nasdaq down after Friday's record-setting performance. An exception to the trend was Cyrix, which jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 24 1/2 on a report that it had gained ground in a legal battle to sell clones of Intel computer chips. But Intel edged up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 65 1/2 . Canada Toronto extended its losing streak to three consecutive sessions. The TSE 300 index closed 36.1 down at 4,465.8 and falls led rises by 512 to 303 after volume of 72.4m shares. The heavily weighted precious metals sector dropped 1.56 per cent on soft gold prices and a negative report from New York brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette on the gold industry.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Date set for tougher toxic waste rules FURTHER strengthening of the already tough regulations governing emissions from incineration of toxic waste by Rechem International at its Pontypool plant will take effect in the autumn, Mr Gwilym Jones, a junior minister at the Welsh Office, assured the Commons yesterday. He urged Labour MPs who had sought a public inquiry into the plant to await the outcome of a survey being undertaken by Professor Lewis Roberts of the University of East Anglia. Its findings on the levels of contamination by PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) near the plant are expected to be announced in January. Mr Jones acknowledged the anxiety of people living near the plant but maintained that the need for an inquiry or other form of investigation could best be decided in the light of the survey's findings. The more stringent regulations to be introduced in the autumn, he said, would stem from the Environmental Protection Act. Rechem had already announced that it would invest Pounds 2.5m to improve emissions from the incinerator stack. The Pollution Inspectorate has served it a notice to improve matters by next May. Mr Jones promised that every effort would be made during Britain's presidency of the European Community to hasten a ban, sought in a directive, on imports of toxic waste from developed countries outside the EC. Defending the continued imports of toxic wastes from underdeveloped countries, Mr Jones emphasised that a ban might lead to illegal or environmentally unsound dumping - 'the worst of all crimes against the environment'.</p>

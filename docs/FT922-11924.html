			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Arts: Krystian Zimerman Krystian Zimerman, a superlatively fine pianist, is on the way to becoming one of the world's master-recitalists. At the on Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday his playing maintained a degree of poise and security, an aristocratic finish, a combination of searching eloquence and simplicity, to which very few of his generation (or, indeed, any other) could aspire. More than this, he imparted to the music a quality of sound that one recognised as utterly his own: lightly luminous yet deep-toned, with a crystalline glitter in bravura passages that never went hard or vacuously brilliant. It is a sound imbued with the spirit of musical seriousness, which is why it absorbed the listener's attention instantly and completely. On this occasion, though, his performances of Brahms and Chopin never quite achieved that state of interpretative finality which brooks no argument - the ability of a Richter or an Arrau to take controversial approaches to tempo markings or details of texture and phrasing and establish them as inevitable, impervious to criticism, at last while one listens. Zimerman opened with the four early Brahms Ballades, op. 10, and took them so gently and ruminatively that their narrative and picturesque elements were diluted. ('Edward', the first of the set, particularly craves more sense of forward movement.) All four pieces sounded wonderfully beautiful, but a shade too 'private'. Similarly, although Zimerman's four Chopin Scherzos were full of fiery flashes, shining bursts of inspiration, limpidly lyrical turns of phrase, the balance of passion and repose was never held absolutely steady. He tended to sustain tone through the rest-markings - this was especially noticeable in the first Scherzo - with the consequence that the music sometimes felt rushed, and robbed of its full dramatic import. (A monster with a flash-camera destroyed the build-up of no. 2.) He was at his incomparable best in two of the three Szymanowski Masques (why not, as advertised, all three?). In general, even where one quibbled, one admired the pianist's deep thoughtfulness more than ever. Royal Festival Hall</p>

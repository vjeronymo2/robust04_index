			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Mandarin views Ulster as puzzle: A look at the fresh faces in Northern Ireland's peace process Mr Quentin Thomas, who will lead the government's team in next week's talks with Sinn Fein, is a 50-year-old career civil servant who is said to approach the Northern Ireland peace process like an intellectual puzzle. Deputy secretary at the Northern Ireland Office since 1991, Mr Thomas has been a prominent and influential presence in behind-the-scenes negotiations in recent years. Deeply knowledgeable about the province's affairs, his solid track record has won him the confidence of Tory backbenchers and interested observers. A Cambridge man, educated at Perse School and Gonville and Caius College, his career began in the Home Office in 1966. He served on the crime policy planning unit between 1974 and 1976 and as secretary to the Royal Commission on gambling between 1976 and 1978. He was head of the Home Office's broadcasting department for four years from 1984 and moved to the Northern Ireland Office in 1988. He is married to the daughter of a former Treasury solicitor and his brother is a Bristol university professor. The European Investment Bank aims to more than treble its lending to Northern Ireland over the next three years, James Whittington writes. Sir Brian Unwin, the bank's president and chairman, said in London yesterday that he hoped loans of about Ecu30m (Pounds 24m) would be raised to at least Ecu100m by 1997 as part of the European Union's bid to bolster the peace plan. He said the bank would focus on long-term credit for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

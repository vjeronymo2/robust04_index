			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>   [Text] Esteban Lazo, vice president of the Council of  State, gave the opening address at the second meeting of  Caribbean businessmen in Santiago de Cuba. Lazo stated that the  main objective of this meeting is to contribute to increasing  the level of economic and commercial relations with Caribbean  area countries.    [Begin recording] [Lazo] We want to sell more in the  Caribbean; we want to buy more in the Caribbean. We want to  increase the presence of joint enterprises with Caribbean  companies. We hope, above all, that these meetings can be the  occasion and the place not only for Cuba's trade with the  Caribbean, but for Cuba as a center of Caribbean trade, thus  allowing us to convert Cuba, its eastern region, and Santiago de  Cuba into a center from which we Caribbeans can trade and  negotiate with the rest of the world. [end recording]    In his address, Michael Manley, Jamaica's former prime  minister, condemned the U.S. blockade of Cuba:    [Begin Manley recording in English, with simultaneous  translation into Spanish] I can say without hesitation that the  embargo begins with injustice. I can go further in saying that  it is contrary to international law. I go even further, in my  statement that it is now maintained in defiance of the  overwhelming UN vote. [end recording]    In another part of his address, Manley stated that history  would be made with the creation of the Association of Caribbean  States, which will come to life with Cuba's presence.    Other addresses during the course of the morning were  delivered by Osvaldo Martinez, president of the economic  commission of the National Assembly of the People's Government  and director of the World Economic Research Center, and by  Octavio Castilla, vice minister of foreign investments and  economic cooperation.</p>

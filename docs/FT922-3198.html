			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Madrid stumbles but keeps its head - Spain's austerity package has spurred the recent market rally FOR Spaniards, who do not eat Danish bacon because their own jamon serrano is infinitely superior and who prefer their fried dough churros to any sophisticated Danish pastry, it was a shock to be tripped up by a country they knew little about and cared less. Worse still was learning that the Danes, with their prosperous, well-balanced economy, had rejected the Maastricht treaty whose convergence criteria Spain, both deficit and inflation-prone, was making extraordinary efforts to meet. The mix of surprise and injured pride sent the the Spanish markets into a tailspin last week. Denmark's 'no' to Maastricht all but wiped out a May rally which had raised Madrid's general index by more than 10 points and pushed it past the psychologically important 260 barrier. Some brokers believed that the rally would continue and that the index's high this year - 266.5 at the end of February - was within reach. Then, after last week's referendum, they were like players on a football field where an unseen hand had moved the goalposts. The index closed 2.07 down yesterday at 249.27. Foreigners did not think much of the domestic pitch either, and hammered the Spanish bond market, so depressing the 10-year bond to December 1991 levels. But there are some who are managing to keep their heads while all about them are seemingly losing theirs. 'The market is reacting with a quasi-panic which is quite out of proportion,' says Mr Juan Cueto, head of research at Gestemar, Banco de Progreso's broking arm. 'Whether there is a (Maastricht) treaty or not, Spain's economy will continue to converge with those of northern Europe,' says Mr Michael Hyman, the chief investment officer of GH Asset Management in London. 'Spain is, without a doubt, one of the most attractive investments in the EC.' Such upbeat perceptions owe a great deal to the austerity programme, appropriately known as the Plan de Convergencia, that the government has drawn up and has vowed to adhere to. Last month, it stuck to its guns on austerity when it endured a half-day general strike called by the unions against proposed cuts in unemployment benefit, which are central to the programme. It was precisely this doggedness, together with the fact that the protest strike was only supported by some 34 per cent of workers, that spurred the May market rally. If the government manages to maintain its determined battle against inflation and public spending then, it is claimed, much of the havoc wrought upon the markets could be repaired. Such thinking assumes that the economy is on course for recovery and that the government will deliver. This is more important now than ever because analysts are no longer looking at a Spain which is being cheered on by pan-EC convergence fever, but one which might well be left to its own devices. The government had hoped to lower the fiscal deficit this year but, after reviewing spending during the first quarter, the Bank of Spain warned that the deficit could instead rise by half a point to stand at 5 per cent of GDP by December. '1992 is going to be a write-off as far as deficit reductions are concerned,' says Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief of research at the Banco Santander de Negocios. Mr Diego Prado, a partner at Carnegie Espana, believes that virtually the sole chance of a positive signal which might spark life into the domestic market lies with the 1992 budget. Although this will not be unveiled formally until October, its main outline is normally leaked ahead of the parliamentary recess at the end of July. In the absence of such signals, there are brokers such as Mr Ramiro Mato, chief executive of Argentaria Capital, the equities division of the public sector financial services group, who believe that there will now be a possibly prolonged lull in the market, punctuated by the odd rally.</p>

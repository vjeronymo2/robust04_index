It is not quite clear to Russia yet how  this will be formulated from the legal point of view. The  details will evidently be coordinated in the course of further  negotiations, the special envoy of the Russian president, Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, told journalists in Moscow on  Wednesday.    According to him, Russia continues to support the idea of  Muslim-Croat integration. "It will be even better if an  interesting legal form, capable of drawing a final solution to  the problem nearer, is found," Churkin said.    In comments on the wish that the Russian leadership would  "take a better-balanced stand" expressed by the Bosnian Prime  Minister, Haris Silajdzic, Churkin said: "The very fact that all  Bosnian sides complain from time to time that the stand taken by  Russia is not balanced well enough points to its correctness and  objectivity."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to the  Palestinian president, has affirmed that the Israeli withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho has actually begun and vanguards of the  Palestinian police will deploy there within a week.    This follows the agreement reached by the Palestinian and  Israeli sides on security arrangements for Hebron in the wake of  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The agreement provides for the  deployment of 160 international observers to oversee the  arrangements.</p>

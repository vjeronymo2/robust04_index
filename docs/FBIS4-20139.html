			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["eli"-signed report: "CDU Leadership Supports Ruehe's </F> Bundeswehr Plans"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  presidium is backing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in the  dispute about the Bundeswehr reform and has widely approved of  "basic considerations" on a reform of the forces. CDU Secretary  General Werner Hintze said in Bonn on Wednesday [27 April] that  it is important to increase the Bundeswehr's efficiency and to  prepare it for its future tasks. The presidium has worked out  five principles on which the reform will be based: Compulsory  military service must be maintained and equity in conscription  increased. A structural reform must adjust the Bundeswehr to  its new tasks, such as establishing crisis-reaction forces. The  army needs modern equipment. And finally, some streamlining is  necessary in the organization.    Hintze emphasized that the size of the army and the duration  of military service must take these principles into account.  Defense Minister Ruehe, who is a member of the CDU presidium,  has always stressed that cutting the time of military service by  two months and reducing the army to 340,000 troops is the only  way to meet these requirements. Hintze pointed out that the  working group set up by the coalition must produce results  quickly and must not discuss the matter "for months." The  secretary general said the talks should be concluded before the  summer recess as the soldiers have a right to security of  planning.    Social Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping  accused Ruehe of doing harm to the Bundeswehr. Scharping spoke  of a "tug-of-war between two worn-out coalition partners  motivated by party politics" that is carried out at the expense  of the Bundeswehr. But the troops need perspectives they can  rely on. They did enormous work in German unification and they  have a right for speculations to come to an end. In its party  program, the SPD is aiming at reducing the army to 300,000  troops.</p>

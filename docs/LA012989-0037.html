			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING FOR A FINE KETTLE OF FISH SOUP;  </P> <P> L.A. MAY NOT OFFER A GREAT BOUILLABAISSE, BUT THE ALTERNATIVES CAN BE VERY GOOD  INDEED  </P> <P> You can't buy a good bouillabaisse in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> If you've a mind to, you can undoubtedly make a completely satisfactory version  at home in your own kitchen, but weeks of tasting bouillabaisse in various  restaurants failed to turn up a single one worthy of the name.  </P> <P> And there are plenty of dishes that go by the name. Some older restaurants have  served bouillabaisse for years, and many newer restaurants, cashing in on the  cachet of Mediterranean cuisine, have put it on their menus. But every time  I've tried the dish in local restaurants, it has not been the supernal soup of  Marseille.  </P> <P> There, waiters arrive at your table carrying a tray filled with various cooked  fish that are only hours out of the water. These they bone, surround with a few  pieces of potato and put in a bowl. Then a broth made of tomatoes, fish stock,  olive oil and spices -- the high note of saffron singing out over the rest --  is added to the bowl. Finally the waiter places a bowl of croutons on the  table, followed by another heaped with bright red rouille, and a third filled  with grated cheese.  </P> <P> In Marseille, bouillabaisse in a good restaurant means hours of happy eating;  in Los Angeles it generally means a rather sad interview with a tired stew  filled with tough fish.  </P> <P> But although you may not find bouillabaisse worthy of the name in Los Angeles  restaurants, you will find plenty of wonderful fish soups that do not even  aspire to the name. Not one of the following soups calls itself a bouillabaisse  -- but there's not one that wouldn't be cheered in Marseille.  </P> <P> Fish soup at Spago is a wonderful broth the exact color of a good  bouillabaisse. Perfectly poached pieces of salmon, shrimp and delicate slices  of scallop give you little bits to bite into. The well-toasted bread (this is  important if it is not to get too soggy) adds further textural interest. There  is even a great dollop of garlicky rouille spooned over the soup. It may not be  bouillabaisse, but if there's one soup I've eaten in a restaurant recently that  makes you understand why people are so crazy over Provencal fish soup, this is  it. Not big enough to be more than the introduction to a meal, the soup costs  $8.50 a bowl; it's worth it. Fish soup at Trattoria Angeli in West Los Angeles  comes in a great big bowl; it's meant to be an entire meal. And it is. There is  a fine subtle broth, clear in flavor and texture, amply filled with mussels,  shrimp, clams, and salmon. This soup also has a hunk of well-toasted bread  floating about in it. This delicate soup is nothing like bouillabaisse, but  seafood fans will find it extremely satisfying. It costs $15.50.  </P> <P> Fish soup at Le Dome on the Sunset Strip arrives in a tall, footed bowl. With  its clear, fresh flavors, I think it's just about the best thing on the menu.  Like bouillabaisse, the soup comes with rouille, little toasts and grated  cheese. It is certainly too small to make an entire meal of, but at $6.50 a  bowl you might consider ordering a couple.  </P> <P> Fish soup at City Restaurant on La Brea is flavorful, but fairly thin. It has a  definite Provencal zing -- down to the dab of rouille that has been spooned  into the middle. The last time I had it, the soup was filled with rice,  vegetables and disconcerting slices of zucchini. One of those thin, crusty  loaves that the French call ficelle was served on the side, adding to the  Mediterranean appeal of the soup, which costs $4.50 a bowl.  </P> <P> Fish soup at DC 3 in Santa Monica comes in two styles. There is cioppino, the  San Francisco version of bouillabaisse. But even better is the Chilean sea bass  in a stunningly simple broth redolent of saffron. The fish itself -- a big  buttery chunk -- has all the freshness of flavor that I associate with a true  bouillabaisse. At $6 a bowl this is not a meal -- but it certainly is a good  beginning.  </P> <P> Fish soup at Pazzia on La Cienega is a real meal. You get a bowl filled with so  much fish and so much bread to catch the juice on the bottom that there is  barely any broth. The flavors are strong, mingling the heady perfume of  parsley, tomatoes and garlic with that of lots of seafood. In addition to  little squares of fish there are shrimp and whole fistfuls of Manila clams. The  soup, not always on the menu, is $15.  </P> <P> Fish soup at Tribeca in Beverly Hills takes its name not from the Mediterranean  but from the East Coast. They call it Montauk seafood stew -- but with its  heady broth of tomatoes, garlic, white wine and fennel, it tastes as if its  origins had more to do with the Mediterranean than the Atlantic. This one, with  its harvest of fish, clams and mussels, is a major meal. It costs $18.  </P> <P> Fish soup in New Orleans is called seafood gumbo -- and it's got a history as  rich as that of bouillabaisse. With its base of onion, garlic, herbs and broth,  the soup even bears a certain similarity to its Provencal cousin.  </P> <P> The seafood gumbo at Orleans in West Los Angeles, a zesty mixture of rice and  roux with handfuls of shrimp, crawfish and fish thrown in for good measure, is  among the most satisfying of soups. It costs $8.95 a bowl -- and will prove far  more satisfying than one of the pallid versions of bouillabaisse you'll find  around town.  </P></p>

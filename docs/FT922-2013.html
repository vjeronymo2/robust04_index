			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories under pressure on prospects for recovery BRITAIN is on its way to economic recovery, Mr John Major, the prime minister, assured the Commons yesterday. He refused, however,to commit himself to a precise timetable. A sceptical Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, reminded the prime minister that 12 months ago he said the recovery would start 'within weeks' and that Britain would be out of recession by the end of 1991. 'Why are you being so coy now?' he demanded. Mr Major told Mr Kinnock not to be misled by a newspaper report that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had said that Britain was three years away from full recovery. What the chancellor had actually said, he insisted, was that in 'two or three years' people would look back and see that the right decisions had been taken at the critical time. The prime minister described the rise in unemployment in May to 2.7m as 'very unwelcome' but stressed that the rate of increase was slowing. He also emphasised the recent economic indicators showing that manufacturing production had risen three months running, while the rate of increase in average earnings had slowed to 7 per cent. Welcoming any movement from the 'trough' caused by government policies, Mr Kinnock taunted the prime minister over his earlier optimistic forecasts, which had proved to be 'absurdly wrong'. Mr Major claimed that the recovery was 'later than it might have been' because of Mr Kinnock's 'boasting' that he would be heading a Labour government after the general election. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, warned that unemployment was rising inexorably towards 3m. He protested: 'It is now more than two months since the election, and only a handful of weeks before school leavers come on to the register.' Tories jeered when Mr Ashdown accused the government of being 'so consumed by self-satisfaction' that it offered no policies and no hope for those without jobs. The prime minister retorted that Mr Ashdown's only answer was to subsidise the inefficient, the uneconomic and the out of date. 'Clearly we need the right sort of economic policy that will sustain long-term employment prospects. That is what we are putting in place,' he said.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Personal pensions - predictions, incentives, and now a compensation loop? (3) Sir, your article, 'The high cost of bad advice', is apposite. I wonder when the real perpetrator of the current imbroglio facing the life sector will be in the dock? It was the government in its headlong rush to privatise everything, including occupational pensions schemes, that created the personal pensions regime - which, in turn, led to the mis-selling. This was fuelled by the National Insurance rebate. Quite a scam really] Yet some insurers still give money to the Conservative party.

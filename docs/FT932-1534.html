			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Profits improve 5% to Pounds 12m despite lack of consumer confidence FIRST LEISURE reported a 4.6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.2m but said it had not yet detected any recovery in consumer confidence, writes Andrew Bolger. Turnover for the six months to May 2 increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 52m and operating profits by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 14m. However, a higher tax rate meant that earnings per share fell slightly to 5.74p (5.88p). Lord Rayne, chairman, said: 'During this period of continuing economic stress, trading patterns have been volatile, with no consistent trends discernible. 'The gains which have been made tend to reflect the group's own efforts, rather than any recovery in consumer confidence.' The sports division experienced a more difficult first half and the small improvement in trading profits, from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 7.6m, was entirely due to the first-time contribution from two new Super Bowls at Bristol and Plymouth. The dancing division maintained the progress achieved during the second half of last year, increasing trading profits from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 7.5m. That was mainly due to the successful refurbishment and relaunch of six discotheques and the opening of a large new discotheque in Liverpool. The resorts division improved trading profits from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.7m, with trading ahead of last year during the Easter period. Blackpool Tower, following the final phase of its Pounds 10m redevelopment, had traded strongly since reopening for Easter. The interim dividend is increased by 6.4 per cent to 2p (1.88p). COMMENT First Leisure's prospective multiple of 22 demands an ambitious rate of growth. Pre-tax profits this year should grow to Pounds 35m, but whether the company's foray into bingo will be sufficient to maintain its momentum must be open to doubt. The acquisition of Nudge is certainly a sensible first step. First Leisure will gain seven bingo clubs and considerable management expertise. It can then expand the chain aggressively leveraging off its proven leisure management skills. But the group will only have a small shout in the bingo world. Rank and Bass already control about a third of the UK's outlets and may make life difficult for the new entrant. Funding the purchase by paper, despite gearing of 15 per cent, suggests First Leisure may be reserving its firepower for something bigger. That will be needed as the group's dancing and bowling markets mature and its tax rate climbs.</p>

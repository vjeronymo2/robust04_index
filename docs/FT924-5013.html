			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Chopping down my muse MY NEIGHBOUR has cut down some trees which were overhanging his garden but were growing on land owned by the Forestry Commission in Scotland. (He had no permission to do this). These were beautiful crab apples planted, I believe, to be viewed from my window (possibly at the time of the Queen's Coronation). There are others planted strategically around the village and he has kept the ones to be viewed from his window. He is building a large shed, the roof of which will be my new view. He tells me that as it is a shed he can build it up to a third of the size of his garden without planning permission. Have I any redress in law against him? Can I sue for loss of amenity? I am a songwriter and one of my songs (which has been performed in public) was inspired by these trees. I have been so unsettled by his action that I have been unable to write since. On the facts as you describe, you have no remit in respect of the fact that your neighbour has either cut down or pruned the trees planted on Forestry Commission land which were overhanging his property. The details which you have given of the proposed shed are not sufficient to advise with certainty - if the shed does not exceed 9 ft in height, then planning permission would not be necessary. However, we suggest that you intimate your disquiet to your local planning department as a coterminous proprietor and request that they take the matter up formally if appropriate. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

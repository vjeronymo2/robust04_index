			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Jean Cot, commander in chief of the </F> UN Protection Forces, by an unidentified correspondent on 5  January; place not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Blue Helmets have had  enough: OUEST FRANCE reveals this morning that one of them, a  Frenchman, killed a Serbian sniper on Christmas Day who had been  terrorizing a district of Sarajevo. Listen to what General Cot  had to say about this in an interview granted to Radio France  Internationale this morning. The line is not very good, but his  comments are important:    [Cot] One cannot retaliate with weapons as an answer to  anything, but there is no doubt that the rules of our mission  not only allow us to retaliate, but they demand that we  retaliate. I have often repeated this to my men, when we are  attacked directly and when the attacker has been identified  beyond doubt. Believe me, even if we do not shout it on the  rooftops every time it happens, we have retaliated on numerous  occasions.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you confirm that a French  Blue Helmet killed a Serbian sniper on Christmas night?    [Cot] I do not wish to give much publicity to these actions  that, you will understand, must remain discreet. We have  indeed, however, set up an anti-sniper device that should allow  us--which already allows us--to make cowards think, those  cowards who shoot at women, children, and also at soldiers  [words indistinct]. I would like sniper alley--which in the end  reinforces hope a little--to be called bastards alley. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and  foreign minister of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP], will have his book New Conservative Revolution  published in mid-April. In the book, he puts forth his view on a  realignment of political parties, proposing that members of the  LDP, the Japan New Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger] with the same  political belief form two new parties. His book is likely to  become a sensation because his moves, including his ties with  Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], are drawing attention.    Commenting on the Hosokawa government, Mr. Watanabe points  to  its decision to scrap a plan for the national welfare tax and a  delay in compiling the fiscal 1994 budget, and then definitely  says: "The coalition government has no policies and is  incompetent. Nothing can be done unless it is removed from  power." In his book, Mr. Watanabe claims that the basic  political belief will be shared by "politicians who seek public  popularity" and "other politicians who attach importance to the  public interest," and then says: "This book calls upon the  politicians who attach importance to the public interest. I want  to practice real politics by rallying forces who share my  political belief and policies."    Mr. Watanabe has written the book based on the result of a  five-year study meeting that has been held by Koji Kakizawa and  Bunmei Ibuki, members of the House of Representatives and  bureaucrats. The two legislators will be named coauthors in the  book. On policies, the book proposes to: 1) streamline or merge  six government ministries and agencies by pushing for  administrative reform; 2) introduce a federal system; 3) add 100  trillion yen to the 10-year basic plan for public investment and  build a high-speed information network; 4) make Japan's vigorous  international contributions by reviewing the five principles for  Japan's participation in UN peacekeeping operations; and 5)  shift to a single-seat constituency system. The book calls for  a strong political leadership in Japan to deal with the  post-Cold War economic and political situation. It shares many  points with Ichiro Ozawa's book: Blueprint for Building a  New Japan.</p>

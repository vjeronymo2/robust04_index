			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOLL WOULD WORK  </P> <P> I wholeheartedly support the idea of a toll road in San Diego County ("San  Diego Toll Road Plan Among 4 OKd by State," Sept. 15).  </P> <P> As usual, opposition comes mainly from the politicians, who stand to lose votes  from not being able to "give" their constituents another "free"way.  </P> <P> They claim that motorists, given a choice between paying to use a toll road or  traveling "free" on surface streets, would choose to clog up the surface  streets. They are wrong in this assumption, as free-market economics continues  to prove (i.e., the Coronado Bridge versus the Silver Strand route to North  Island).  </P> <P> I would much rather pay the toll than lose valuable time and gasoline stuck in  slow traffic. Surely my time, as well as that of other motorists, is worth more  than a couple of bucks for a toll.  </P> <P> They are also concerned about the $2,800 fee that new homebuyers have paid for  roads. What they seem to forget is that the fee (actually a tax), was mandated  by government for building roads in that area.  </P> <P> Toll roads can and do work when left to the free market and private industry to  administer. The record of government-run roadways (higher taxes, poorer  conditions) speaks for itself.  </P> <P> JOEL DENIS  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

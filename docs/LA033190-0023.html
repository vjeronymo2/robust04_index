			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SON OF CULT LEADER LOSES FIGHT AGAINST EXTRADITION  </P> <P> The 19-year-old son of a cult leader wanted in Ohio in connection with the  killings of a family of five was ordered Friday to be extradited next week.  </P> <P> Damon Lundgren, whose fight against extradition has progressed further than his  father's and two other cult members', is to be given to Ohio authorities at 8  a.m. Wednesday, San Diego Municipal Judge Bill Woodward ordered.  </P> <P> Lundgren's attorney, Tom Senters, protested the order because a writ has been  filed with the California Supreme Court seeking to stay the proceedings until  it can review the case.  </P> <P> Senters argued before Woodward that a continuance of the hearing should be  granted because of the possibility that the high court might intervene.  </P> <P> Woodward disagreed, but ruled that Lundgren is not to leave the state until  Wednesday, giving the Supreme Court time to intervene.  </P> <P> "I'm simply ordering an extradition. We will communicate this to the demanding  state," the judge said.  </P> <P> Lundgren's father, Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, and two followers, Daniel Kraft, 25,  and Kathryn Johnson, 36, are also fighting extradition to Lake County, Ohio,  where the bodies of the five victims were found buried in a barn. Investigators  believe they were killed execution style in a religious sacrifice for the cult,  which numbered about 18.  </P> <P> Senters told the court that the Supreme Court clerk told him Thursday that the  court had not decided whether to intervene.  </P> <P> "I have no knowledge as to how long it takes for the Supreme Court to act. I do  not know when the Supreme Court received the writ," Senters said.  </P> <P> "The court is actively reviewing the matter, as of yesterday," Senters told the  judge.  </P> <P> Senters said Damon Lundgren's case has progressed faster than the others  because he filed the legal papers before the other attorneys did.  </P></p>

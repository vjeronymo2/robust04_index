			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) members held secret talks with the Fair Trade Commission  (FTC) in February and March of 1992 to broker a deal on a new  maximum fine for firms violating the Antimonopoly Law by  bid-rigging, informed sources said Wednesday [12 January].    Those who attended the meetings were members of the LDP's  panel on the Antimonopoly Law, including former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura, as well as FTC officials headed by  former Commission Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, the sources said.    On several occasions at a Tokyo hotel and the headquarters  of  the LDP, then the ruling party, both sides discussed the size of  the maximum penalty and decided to raise it to 100 million yen  from 5 million yen, the sources said.    Nakamura, who was the panel's deputy chairman, is facing  allegations that he received 10 million yen in dubious  contributions in January 1992 from major construction firm  Kajima Corp.    The negotiations were reportedly tough since the LDP had  strongly opposed the FTC's proposal in 1991 to raise the penalty  to several hundreds of million yen. But when the meetings  started, the LDP relaxed its stance, the sources said.    They quoted one participant as suggesting that there must  have been an arrangement within the LDP on settling the issue  beforehand.    Nakamura reportedly acted as an agent of former political  kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who has been indicted on charges of  evading income tax on secret donations from the construction  industry.    Kanemaru and Nakamura are known for having close connections  with the nation's construction industry and have therefore  become the center of the current corruption scandal involving  the industry.    It has also been reported that Umezawa explained Nakamura's  role in a meeting with Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo  Ishihara.    After reaching the agreement with the LDP, the FTC announced  the 100 million yen penalty figure on March 12, 1992.</p>

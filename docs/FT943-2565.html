			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Clinton will not meet with Adams The US government has assured Mr John Major that President Clinton will not meet Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, when he visits Washington soon, Kevin Brown writes. British officials said Mr Major had not sought guarantees on the treatment to be given to Mr Adams, who is expected to be given a visa for a second visit to the US. US officials are understood to have responded sympathetically to British warnings, however. Britain has also told the US that it would prefer Mr Adams to be given a limited visa, which would prevent him travelling to many centres of Irish republican support. Washington is said to have accepted British advice that contacts with constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland should be stepped up.</p>

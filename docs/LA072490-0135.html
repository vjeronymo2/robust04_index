			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> TRUSTEES TO CHOOSE NAMES FOR 2 SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The Santa Ana Unified School District Board of Trustees will choose between  suffragette Susan B. Anthony and legendary athlete Jim Thorpe tonight when they  name one of two new elementary schools to be built to help house the district's  growing student population.  </P> <P> Two prominent names in Mexican history are being considered for the second  school, with trustees to decide between former Mexican President Benito Juarez  and Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of California.  </P> <P> After seeking public input in naming the proposed schools, a district committee  sifted through a list of 30 suggestions before narrowing down the possibilities  to four names.  </P> <P> Permanent elementary schools in the district have traditionally been named  after famous people, with an emphasis on former presidents. The names of living  people normally aren't used, according to district officials.  </P> <P> The new schools are being referred to as School 9 and School 10. School 9 will  be constructed at Alton Avenue and Greenville Street, and School 10 will be  built at 900 W. Richmond St.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["The Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "This is the </F> Reply!"]    [Text] Having closed our eyes and contemplated an  appropriate reply to the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre in Hebron,  and having heard proposals and talks and read slogans, we  suggest the following:    --The PLO should declare an immediate withdrawal from the  peace negotiations, cancel its recognition of Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338, close the Palestinian ranks, gather all  the small and large factions without exception into one  framework, and deploy the PLO forces on all Arab borders with  Palestine.    --The Arab regimes participating in the peace process should  do exactly as the PLO does, close the file of negotiations  forever, call on the Arab Defense Council to meet, form a  unified military command, and declare war on Israel.    --The oil-producing states, including the Libyan  Jamahiriyah,  should cut the supplies to the Western states and turn this Arab  wealth into a weapon in the battle because the Arab oil is for  the entire Arab nation.    --The Arab states should ignore their differences, close  their ranks, firmly support the Palestinian people, and view  their international relations on the basis of the Palestine  question because it is the Arabs' first and basic cause.    --The Arab states should lift the embargo on Iraq and  compensate it for all the destruction inflicted on it during the  second Gulf war. Moreover, the movements waging an armed war  against the current regimes in Algeria and Egypt should halt  this war and declare a general truce because priority should be  given to the confrontation with the enemy.    --The Islamic states should declare a holy jihad, channel  their forces and efforts toward the land of mobilization and  steadfastness [Jordan], and abandon their previous positions,  taken since Israel was established.    --The Russian nationalists and communists should topple the  regime of Boris Yeltsin and reinstate the former Soviet Union,  which supported the Arabs and stood against imperialist Western  ambitions.    These are the elements of the real reply to Israel. Perhaps,  the first and most important element, however, is to unleash the  freedom of the Arab individual and allow him to have his own  opinion about his future and that of his homeland -- this will  be the real reply.    Note: Had one-half of these demands been achieved, the State  of Israel would not have been established in the first place,  and no one would have dared go to Madrid, Oslo, and other cities.</p>

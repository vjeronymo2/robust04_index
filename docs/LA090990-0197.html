			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: I would greatly appreciate any information you can give me on Control Data  Corp.  </P> <P> I've held this stock for several years because of information in the firm's  annual report about reorganizations and other efforts to raise profitability.  It is difficult for me to understand how the information in the annual report  can be correct, while the company is not paying dividends and the price of the  stock continues to fall. -- Jamestown, N.Y.  </P> <P> A: The headline of a recent Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. report about Control Data  is: "Like Watching Paint Dry."  </P> <P> Charles Frumberg, the analyst who follows the computer company, admits that  Control Data has been "a war of attrition for investors" who've been waiting  for an upturn in earnings. But he thinks that good things are about to happen  for all of you patient shareholders, so he is recommending that clients buy the  stock.  </P> <P> Frumberg says the firm's businesses are starting to improve, which might allow  Control Data to embark on a restructuring that could come in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> A restructuring, Frumberg predicts, could give Control Data stock a boost.  </P> <P> But before the company can buy back some of its own stock as part of any  restructuring, the analyst says, it will have to obtain some debt relief. It  will probably also want to sell its 10 million shares of Seagate Technology.  </P> <P> Frumberg thinks Control Data will earn $1.25 a share this year. That compares  to a loss of more than $16 a share in 1989. The Institutional Brokers Estimate  System at Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan says the average estimate of all analysts who  follow the company is $1.27 a share -- close to Frumberg's figure. The highest  estimate is $1.50 a share, the lowest $1.  </P> <P> Says Frumberg: "If someone was ever going to own this stock, now is the time to  own it. The earnings are now becoming substantial, and a restructuring is  imminent."  </P> <P> Q: When World War II ended, I bought some Russian bonds that dated back to  1916, 1919 and 1921. I paid 10 cents on the dollar. I'd like to know their  value today. Will the new regime in Russia make good on the bonds, or do I have  a better chance of winning the lottery? -- Newport Beach  </P> <P> A: The bonds are probably worth zilch today. But there is hope.  </P> <P> At the economic summit in Houston earlier this year, the United States  disclosed that it was negotiating to resolve financial claims with Russia  dating back to the czar.  </P> <P> Britain struck such a deal in 1986. The Russians agreed to pay off czarist  bonds that were repudiated after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Bondholders got  about 10 cents on the dollar.  </P> <P> But in the past few years, the Russians have coughed up more money, according  to Robert Fisher, vice president of R. M. Smythe in New York. British holders  of czarist bonds have now gotten back about one-third of what is owed them.  </P> <P> Keep the faith. But it probably wouldn't hurt to play the lottery anyway.  </P> <P> Q: While I was at an airport in Pittsburgh, I came across the enclosed brochure  for a investment product handled by a firm called ELCOA. It claims to pay an  effective annual rate of 10.58% on a six-month investment. Can you tell me more  about this type of investment? What are the risks, and how secure is ELCOA?  Venice, Fla.  </P> <P> A: What ELCOA is doing is simple.  </P> <P> ELCOA stands for Equipment Leasing Corp. of America. The company will take your  investment and that of thousands of other people and buy equipment --  everything from fax machines to lathes -- which it then leases out. The ELCOA  offering is handled by an investment firm called Welco Securities Inc. of Bala  Cynwyd, Pa.  </P> <P> The first thing I did was check out Welco. The National Assn. of Securities  Dealers in Washington says it had a minor problem with the company in 1986, but  otherwise it appears to be clean.  </P> <P> I then spoke with a Welco salesman, without identifying myself as a reporter.  He said the ELCOA fund invests one-third of its money in office equipment,  one-third in light commercial equipment and the rest in restaurant equipment.  He said defaults on its leases have been running at about 2.75% a year.  </P> <P> The salesman pooh-poohed the idea that a recession could cause the default rate  to skyrocket and the investment's return to plunge. "If you are talking  depression, with thousands of businesses folding, then there's a risk," he  finally conceded.  </P> <P> But I wonder how many restaurants will be returning refrigerators, and how many  office computers will be returned unpaid for if there is just a run-of-the-mill  recession. You'll have to decide if this risk is worth the few extra dollars  you'll earn on your money.  </P> <P> Q: I have been trying to find out the value of two gold coins that I obtained  from an estate, but have been unsuccessful. One is a 1901 $10 gold piece with  an eagle, 13 stars and three arrows on the lower right. It is in perfect  condition. The other is dated 1846 and is a $5 gold piece. It has three arrows  in the lower right, 13 stars and an eagle. -- Tustin.  </P> <P> A: The key phrase is "perfect condition." If the $10 piece is one of the few  truly perfect ones -- in the numismatic sense of the word -- it could be worth  "thousands of dollars," according to Norman Stack, partner of Stack's, a New  York rare coin dealer. If it is less than perfect, it's worth between $250 and  $500.  </P> <P> The $5 piece is more common and worth around $150, he says.  </P> <P> You should also check the coin for the city in which it was minted. The letters  O for New Orleans, C for Charlotte, N.C., or D for Dahlonega, Ga., might  appear. If there is no letter, it was minted in Philadelphia. The D, O and C  markings would add to the coin's value. JOHN CRUDELE  </P></p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (11): Private sector helps to revitalise small towns - Some distinctive schemes for supporting businesses, and communities, are examined by Rhys David Five years after it was set up as a semi-autonomous unit, Business in the Community in Wales is finding there are activities and campaigns which it can adopt in response to local issues which are not possible within the larger UK framework - as well as national schemes that are not appropriate to Wales. The main distinctively Welsh thrust has been towards building public and private links in a number of small towns through business partnerships. A year ago BITC was asked to help involve the private sector in Llandudno which had been badly hit by floods. Following a number of meetings, the Aberconwy partnership, under the chairmanship of Mr George Newson of Quinton Hazell, the automotive components company, has been set up, with a brief to come up with ideas for strategic development of the town. A similar exercise is now being undertaken in Tredegar, south Wales. Businesses ranging in size from the self-employed to more than 150 employees were brought together in July under the sponsorship of Swalec, the Welsh utility company, to talk with other local organisations and the local authorities about ways of revitalising the valleys town, and about the forms of co-operation which might best achieve this. The next step will be the creation of a town forum which will give business in the town a vehicle for discussion with the public authorities. As in Llandudno, the aim is to develop a strategic partnership. In Caernarfon, where a Pounds 43m scheme to improve the urban environment is planned, a dialogue has also begun, with the Welsh Office keen for the private sector to back up public sector pump-priming. At present, however, the local authorities are expressing greater enthusiasm for an informal rather than a formal link with business. In education, BITC in Wales has mobilised companies behind business-education partnerships. The Japanese, big investors in Wales, have been particularly supportive of Aim High, an educational initiative which encourages young people to raise levels of achievement in education and training. Sony, Panasonic, Toyota, Brother, Hitachi, Aiwa, Hoya, Zeon and Takiron are among the groups which have participated. Business leaders have also been taken, as in other parts of the UK, to see what is happening on the ground, under the Seeing is Believing programme. A group of senior business leaders visited Cardiff earlier this year to be briefed on Track 2000, a project for collecting and recycling old appliances, backed by ASW, the steel products group. As a result, other businesses, including Marks &amp; Spencer and British Gas became involved. Similarly, the idea of professional firms donating time has been adopted in Wales. In two years, services worth Pounds 175,000 have been donated, and a new group for north Wales is being started. One of the big differences according to Mr Simon Knighton, BITC Wales director, is the smaller number of big companies compared with some English regions, which as a result puts a bigger onus on the 50,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in Wales. What Wales does have, however, is a separate political and government dimension and this, according to Mr Knighton, can shorten communications and expedite action. The move to unitary authorities in Wales under local government reform is also seen as likely to make it easier for companies to become involved in working with the community. There is overlap, however, between the aid and support agencies, which he believes needs to be rationalised. At a much more local level another organisation, Abergavenny-based Community Enterprise Wales (CEW) co-ordinates the work of groups and individuals seeking to develop community-based enterprise activity. Such businesses, which must be owned and controlled by the local community, can be service or manufacturing operations, and examples within Wales include a local supermarket, cinemas, printing and publishing, catering and childcare. For a small fee the 130 groups in membership - the target is more than 300 by the end of the current financial year - gain access to advice and information and to courses and seminars run by CEW, which is funded by a three-year grant from the Welsh Development Agency. Just as importantly, CEW acts as a voice for community groups and lobbies for them. Some of the most successful enterprises have been established in the south Wales valleys where local groups have come together to bring back into community use former miners' and workmen's halls, and to provide specialised transport services for the disabled and elderly. Other businesses have been set up to recondition white goods so as to provide low cost products to low income families, and renovate old buildings. In some places community businesses are managing workspace, thereby helping to create further jobs. Close links have in many cases been established with local authorities which have seen the community businesses as a way of creating jobs and bringing back self-respect to areas suffering from the decline of traditional industries. In central Cardiff, Packet Promotional Services, a company set up with local authority help, has created jobs for people with learning disabilities, packing promotional literature for a big national group, while on the city's Ely Estate businesses repairing garden tools and upholstery have been created. In nearby Barry, an area badly affected by closures in the chemical industry, a community enterprise is providing catering at a South Glamorgan county council leisure centre. 'We look to see what local services can be provided to get the economy going again. People gain skills which they can use in the community and their friends and neighbours are encouraged to do likewise,' Mr Peter Lewis, finance director of CEW, observes. 'Local authorities now see this as a way of delivering part of their economic development strategy and of helping the most marginal communities.'</p>

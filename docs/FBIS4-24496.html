Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui  Monday [30 May] called on leading industrialists to help develop  Taiwan's industrial base in order to ensure continued economic  growth and boost domestic competitiveness in international  markets.    Li made the statement while meeting with a group of 20  industrialists, headed by Chairman Kao Ching-yuan of the Chinese  National Federation of Industries.    To seek further progress, Li said, the industrial sector  should learn how to make the best use of its resources and  stress personnel training as well as research and development.    The government will cooperate with the industrial sector in  mapping out appropriate policies and laws to help domestic  industries cope with challenges and competition from abroad, Li  pledged.    Various phases of economic development call for different  strategies, he added.    Li talked with the industrialists on a variety of economic  and noneconomic issues, including financing, investment, the  national health insurance program, the introduction of foreign  laborers to Taiwan, environmental protection, and Taiwan's entry  into GATT.    Among the industrial representatives were President Liu  Kuo-chao of the Taiwan Electric Appliance Manufacturers  Association, President Lu Chi-sheng of the Taiwan Association of  Machinery Industry, and Chairman Wang Yiu-tzeng of the China  Rebar Group.    The president said that he was happy to exchange views with  the industrialists.

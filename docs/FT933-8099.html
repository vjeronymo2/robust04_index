			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Indonesian troops to quit E Timor Indonesia yesterday said it would withdraw all combat forces from the territory of East Timor, leaving only troops engaged in development projects, Reuter reports from Jakarta. The official Antara news agency quoted Maj Gen Theo Syafei, military commander for the region, as saying all combat forces would be pulled out by October. He said 10 territorial battalions would remain. Since Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 it has fought a guerrilla war against a dwindling band of Fretilin rebels. But despite its apparent military success the government has come under heavy international attack for its role in the territory, 2,000km east of Jakarta.</p>

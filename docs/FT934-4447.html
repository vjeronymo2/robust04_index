			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees deficit expected to grow to Pounds 8.5m Losses for the 12 months to the end of September at Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the financially troubled ITV company, are likely to be higher than expected. Last month the company issued a formal statement saying that a deficit was likely for the year. All the signs were that the expected loss, mainly caused by controversial methods of selling advertising such as trying to pull forward revenue by heavy discounting, could be contained at a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 5m. It is believed that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees has now decided not to include a discount on its subscription to the national ITV network in the 1992-93 year because it will not be paid until early next year. A discount of some Pounds 3.5m is expected because of the fall in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees' share of net advertising revenue - the basis on which network programme costs are allocated. As a result pre-tax losses of the company, in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a stake, are likely to be in the region of Pounds 8.5m. There is,however, a realistic possibility of a return to profit in the current financial year. Despite its problems Yorkshire is being examined by a number of possible predators, including LWT which already owns 14 per cent. Any purchase by another ITV company, however, would require the immediate disposal of Tyne Tees because under proposed new government rules an ITV company, outside London, can hold two broadcasting licences but no more. The new rules, due to come into effect on January 1, will be debated in the House of Commons next Wednesday and by the House of Lords on December 13.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Volvo truck plant for Poland Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is to establish a truck assembly plant in Poland. The plant, which will be located in Wroclaw, will have a capacity to assemble up to 1,000 heavy and medium-duty trucks a year. Volvo trucks have been assembled hitherto in Poland by Jelcz, the Polish truck maker, but this agreement expires at the end of the year. The Swedish group said that it would be moving equipment, tools and personnel from the Jelcz facilities to Wroclaw, where it planned to produce more than 700 trucks in 1995. Volvo is the leading importer of heavy-duty trucks to Poland and expects to deliver around 550 units this year. It has established a new marketing and finance company during 1994 and has a network of 10 dealers selling exclusively Volvo vehicles.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Fierce price war takes toll on outcome at JFB FIERCE PRICE competition contributed to depressed profits at Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the metals and engineering group. Pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 declined 19 per cent from Pounds 8.87m to Pounds 7.15m. It also announced the appointment of a new non-executive chairman, Mr Martin Llowarch, former chief executive of British Steel. He was named deputy chairman in June and will replace 65-year-old Mr John Clay, who retires at the annual meeting. During the year the group experienced 'unprecedented pressure on margins'; competition was especially severe from Germany. In the current year, the devaluation of sterling was expected to help JFB 'fight against some fairly frightening price cuts,' said Mr Llowarch. JFB was also taking steps to cut costs, including more than a 6 per cent reduction in the workforce. The group had taken a Pounds 750,000 exceptional charge in 1991 to cover the costs of rationalisation. The final dividend is maintained at 2p for a total of 3p. Mr George Hardie, joint managing director, said this was an indication that JFB did not think things 'will get worse'. Earnings per share fell from 4.7p to 3.3p. Two acquisitions - for a total of Pounds 3.5m - helped JFB increase sales by 4 per cent to Pounds 124.2m. The companies contributed Pounds 5.9m in sales and Pounds 546,000 to operating profits. Mr Hardie said sales from continuing businesses had actually fallen by 9 per cent. The sharpest decline was in Firth Rixson, which supplies rolled rings for engines to the depressed aerospace industry, as well as other sectors. Operating profits tumbled from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 1.8m, on sales 8 per cent lower at Pounds 58.3m. Mr David Hall, joint managing director, stressed that business was not expected to fall further, in spite of a hard-pressed aerospace industry. Aerospace formed just 23 per cent of JFB's overall sales, he said, with Firth Rixson increasingly concentrating on opportunities in power generation. He also said the group was in talks on the acquisition of a US company which would broaden JFB's product range. The castings division saw a 9 per cent decline in on-going sales, and a 7.5 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 888,000. It benefited from an increase in exports. Light engineering, which manufactures products such as cables and machinery, virtually maintained profits at Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 4.5m) on sales 12 per cent higher at Pounds 49.4m. The increase came from the inclusion for a full 12 months of Cobden Chadwick, the printing press manufacturer, acquired for Pounds 3.8m in November 1990.</p>

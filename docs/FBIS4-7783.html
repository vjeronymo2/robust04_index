			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cajnice, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- The army of the Srpska  republic today halted the eight-day offensive by Muslim forces  toward Cajnice, Foca, and Visegrad, and undertook a  counteroffensive, the headquarters of the Herzegovina Corps  announced this evening.    The same source says Muslim soldiers are withdrawing toward  the Drina, where strong police forces, which are not allowing  them to cross over to the left bank of this river, are waiting  for them on all bridges.    The defeat of the Muslim forces was also admitted today by  Ferid Buljubasic, commander of the eastern Bosnia corps, and he  sought help from the international community.    At 0900 this morning, the headquarters of the Serb forces  says, two NATO aircraft violated the air space of the Srpska  republic throughout the whole area of the upper Drina valley at  the impermissible altitude of 600 meters. If this happens  again, the headquarters of the Serb army says, such aircraft  will be shot down. [passage omitted]</p>

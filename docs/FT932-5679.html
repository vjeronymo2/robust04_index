			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALING IN the newly demerged Zeneca yesterday was the highlight of the traded options in an otherwise dull derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. The launch of the contract in the traded options coincided with the first official day of trading in Zeneca's underlying stock. SG Warburg was said to have carried out the biggest trade in the stock option when it sold the July 650 'straddle' (calls and puts). Total turnover in Zeneca was 1,154 by the official close, making it the day's third most actively dealt stock option. That list was headed by Lasmo, in which 2,029 lots were traded as speculation that the company would soon announce disposals continued to do the rounds. It was followed by Tesco on 1,277. Total volume in the traded options was 14,683, up from 12,119 on Friday, with 4,053 contracts transacted in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,015 in the Euro FT-SE option. In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index recovered from early selling, boosted by the increasing strength of sterling and a firm Wall Street opening. June finished at 2,862, an advance of 23 from Friday's close and some 10 points above its fair value premium to cash of around 5 points. Turnover at 4,517 contracts was very poor. More than 1,000 lots were dealt in the September contract, which finished trading at 2,882.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / People: Bodies politic Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been appointed chairman of the steering committee of the London School of Economics' financial markets research centre. Pennant-Rea (above), a former editor of The Economist, has taken over from Sir David Walker, the first chairman of the LSE's financial markets group. The group, which undertakes basic research into the nature of financial markets and their links with the flow of savings and investment in the domestic and international economy, has always had close ties to Britain's central bank. Sir David is a former executive director of the Bank of England and Mervyn King, the Bank's chief economist, helped set up the group in 1987. The group, which was launched with funding from City sources, has recently been awarded a Pounds 1.3m funding package from the Economic and Social Research Council which will result in it being designated an ESRC research centre.</p>

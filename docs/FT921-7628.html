			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Astra to pay more after 36% advance ASTRA, Sweden's largest pharmaceutical company, announced yesterday a 36 per cent rise in 1991 pre-tax profit to SKr3.41bn (Dollars 571.2m) from SKr2.51bn for the previous year. Sales rose by one-third over the same period to SKr12.5bn. Profits per share jumped to SKr18.00 from SKr11.90 and Astra proposes to improve its dividend to SKr3.25 per share from SKr2.45. The company expects its performance in 1992 to continue to remain strong. It predicts a pre-tax profit increase of between 20 and 25 per cent. Last year's performance extends the pattern of impressive results from Astra. For 1990, the group achieved a 36 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to SKr2.5bn, while in 1989 profits rose 23 per cent to SKr1.85bn. Astra's success stems from its current range of drug products. Sales of Losec - its anti-peptic ulcer drug - more than doubled in 1991 to around SKr4.85bn from SKr2.1bn in the previous year, reflecting its successful introduction during the year to both the US and Japanese markets. The company's cardiovascular anti-high blood pressure drug Plendil, which reached the German market for the first time at the end of 1991, enjoyed a 78 per cent boost in sales to SKr336m, while there was a 51 per cent growth in sales of Pulmicort, the anti-asthma agent, to SKr1.22bn. Sales of Turbuhaler, an inhaler delivering medication to asthma patients, increased by 10 per cent to SKr790m.</p>

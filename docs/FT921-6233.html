			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Argentine equities show signs of maturity - Investors' initial enthusiasm is giving way to a more sober analysis Argentina's hyperactive stock market is coming of age. After beating the world's bourses last year with a rise of 370 per cent in dollar terms, the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange is settling down to a less intense, and more measured, pace. That does not mean slow, though: so far this year it has grown by 'only' 15 per cent. The underlying fundamentals that powered the market in 1991 have not changed: Argentina's embrace of free market reforms continue to pay off, with relatively low inflation, economic growth and ordered government finances. Foreign capital is still flowing in. These factors, combined with a shortage of investment paper, led to last year's across the board price increases. However, the first surge of enthusiasm is giving way to a more sober analysis. Investors are becoming more discriminating. Regulators are cracking down on what is still regarded as a 'cowboy' market. Also, investors' appetite for equities should be sated by a hefty batch of privatisation issues. On Monday, the government unleashes an international marketing offensive to sell its remaining 30 per cent in Telecom Argentina, the country's second-largest privatised telephone company. The flotation, which should raise at least Dollars 640m, will inject liquidity into the market and broaden its investor base. Telecom - 39 per cent-owned by the French and Italian state telephone companies - has a seven-year monopoly over services in northern Argentina, renewable for a further three years. It forecasts a 40 per cent increase in revenues to Dollars 1.2bn in 1992 and a 130 per cent rise in net profit to Dollars 120m. Telecom shares should, therefore, imitate the performance of Argentina's other telephone company, Telefonica de Argentina: its share price has risen by almost 50 per cent since its flotation in December. Other privatisation issues are expected to dominate the stock market this year. The government plans to net about Dollars 6bn by selling seven companies, which range from the post and telegraph company to big gas and electricity util-ities. Controlling stakes will probably be sold directly to the operators, with minority stakes floated on the local and international equity markets. Mr Martin Redrado, head of the National Securities Commission, says there is 'real hunger' for stocks in Argentina and doubts that privatisation issues will swamp the market. Although prices are high, with price/earnings ratios averaging 20, he says Argentina's market capitalisation of Dollars 18.5bn is equivalent to 13 per cent of GDP. Analysts say investors are becoming more demanding. Mr Christopher Ecclestone, a Buenos Aires equity analyst, says: 'There is some disillusion that prices may have peaked, but there is still value in second-tier stocks. People who bought almost anything last year to get exposure to Argentina are reorganising their portfolios as the economic picture becomes clearer.' Banking, construction and food shares are popular, but he warns that the market is still faddish and restless. Curiously, interest from private companies in raising equity capital remains muted: only five companies have applied for a listing and just eight companies which are already listed made rights issues for a total of Dollars 300m in 1991. Privately, stock market officials say that Argentine businessmen are irrationally afraid of listing, and accuse local investment banks of not knowing how to structure share issues. Sooner or later, however, Argentina's capital-starved companies will have to turn to the equity market to survive. Meanwhile, Mr Redrado is forcing companies to improve disclosure and adopt international accounting practices - a move that could reveal some companies as far less healthy than their present accounts suggest. He also intends to crack down on widespread market manipulation, by doubling his force of inspectors to 30. Last week, in an unmistakable warning to the market, the government suspended two financial companies for alleged tax and trading offences.</p>

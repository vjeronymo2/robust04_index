			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Loic Bouvard, president of the North Atlantic </F> Assembly and deputy speaker of the French National Assembly:  "Russia in Turmoil"]    [Text] There are now fears that Russia might not sign the  Partnership for Peace, the association proposed by NATO to all  the countries of the former Warsaw Pact which seeks to take into  account both the Central European countries' desire to join the  Atlantic Alliance and Russia's reservations about seeing NATO  expand and move eastward.    Why have we reached this deadlock situation when, at the  last  Clinton-Yelstin summit in Moscow, everything seemed to be going  smoothly and in the right direction?    In my view, we should see in this much more the effect of  Russia's domestic policy than any misunderstanding about the  case of the ultimatum and the air strike in Bosnia.    Everything changed in Russia after the first free  parliamentary elections on 12 December last year, which were  clearly fair and which saw the victory of the extremists (right  and left) over the center.    Indeed, the new Duma (Russia's national assembly) contains a  slight majority of right-wing extremists (Zhirinovskiy and other  nationalists) and left-wing extremists (Communist Party, "Women  of Russia," and agrarians).    It is they who immediately decreed the release of Rutskoy  and  Khasbulatov, the defeated parties in last October's  confrontation between President Yeltsin and the Assembly, which  saw the White House, seat of the assembly, shelled and stormed.    It is they who oppose President Yeltsin's policy of  rapprochement between Russia and the United States, between  Russia and NATO.    These political forces, nationalists of all kinds, harking  back to Greater Russia and the empire to be rebuilt, form a  constant threat for the president, which he is forced to take  into account. Hence his vacillations and about-faces, and those  of his Foreign Minister Kozyrev.    Anything is a pretext for glorifying Russia, placing the  emphasis on the humiliation it has suffered at the West's hands.  For these people, NATO is the 45-year old enemy, which  triumphed over the Warsaw Pact and with which no compromise is  possible! The situation of the Russian minorities in the Baltic  countries, NATO's alleged exclusion of Russia during the bombing  raids around Gorazde, the Ukrainian claims to Crimea, anything  is a pretext for attacking the government, calling for Mr.  Kozyrev's resignation, and planning the 1996 presidential  campaign against Yeltsin.    This is the situation. We are perhaps on the eve of the  reawakening of imperialist Russia, taking up, through the CIS,  the USSR's hegemony over its neighbors.  <H5>  Nationalist Issue </H5>   Belarus, which has never formed a state in the past, is  already returning to the Russian fold. Ukraine, a country  bigger than France inhabited by 50 million people, is  floundering in economic depression and is close to  disintegration, with the west (the former Westernized Galicia)  opposing the east (Kharkov region, inhabited by Russians), and  not to mention Crimea given to Ukraine by Khrushchev, himself a  Ukrainian, which is inhabited mainly by Russians and which  Russia is claiming.    The division of the Black Sea Fleet is raising apparently  insoluble problems and is accompanied by the Russians' desire to  occupy Sevastopol as a naval base within a network of some 20  military bases in the nearby CIS countries.    The disparity in power between Russia and its CIS neighbors  is such that it is difficult to see how the first can fail to  collect its stake quickly and peacefully, unless Ukraine alone  is reluctant.    Russia has asked the United Nations to give it a  peace-keeping mandate in the countries of the former USSR, thus  behaving toward the former Soviet republics, and especially  Central Asia, in the same way as the mandate which could be  given to NATO in Central Europe.  <H5>  Partnership for Peace </H5>   Russia, this very big country which remains a superpower  with  its 30,000 or so nuclear warheads and its 2 million men under  arms, regards itself as a "Eurasian" power and not simply as a  European power. Zhirinovskiy, who received 25 percent of the  votes in December 1993, and 75 percent of the Army's votes,  dreams of conquering the south and of access to the Indian  Ocean. Others aspire to regain a foothold in the Baltic from  Kaliningrad and bases in Latvia; yet others are looking toward  Poland and Romania, via Moldova.    In short, Russia is in turmoil and, although it is true that  the people are primarily concerned with feeding themselves and  coping with the numerous problems of everyday life, the standard  of living being only the equivalent of around 500 francs per  month, the politicians are working to ensure respect for Russia  and demanding for it preferential status in Europe in face of  the Atlantic alliance.    This confrontational attitude merely strengthens the malaise  and fear of the countries on the European fringes, former  satellites of the USSR, which are now enjoying the taste of  freedom. We should not be surprised at the fact that the former  Communists, now back in power in Bulgaria and Poland, are  demanding, like those of Romania and Slovakia, or like the  moderate leaders of the Czech Republic or Hungary, immediate or  almost immediate entry into NATO. As president of the NATO  Assembly, I have met with them and they have all begged me to  ensure that the Partnership for Peace, which they immediately  signed, should be the first step leading to full integration  into NATO, which Russia obviously does not want at any cost.    Scarcely five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall,  Europe  is once again facing its old demons of extreme nationalism,  xenophobia, wars of religion, ostracism, and rivalry based on  the desire for power.    Bosnia, this terrible sore on the flank of our continent,  will poison interstate relations for a long time. West Europe's  inability to take action when there was still time, the  spectacle of Europe's squabbling over Maastricht and expansion,  mean that Europe is likely to remain a dwarf on the  international chessboard and that, once again, as was the case  for 45 years, the decisions are made in Washington and Moscow.    I draw two conclusions from that which strike me as crystal  clear.    The first is that, in this dangerous world fraught with many  threats, France is right not to drop its military guard and to  propose a Military Programming Law which strengthens our defense  and our ability to intervene.    The second is that France is right to make every effort to  ensure that the European Union, on the basis of the  Franco-German tandem, asserts itself economically, politically,  and militarily and is capable of imposing itself as a factor of  stability and security in Europe.

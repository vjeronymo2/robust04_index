			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly met today in an ordinary  session and adopted a new military code, which had been drafted  by the Armed Forces Ministry. The National Assembly speaker  explained that the new military code will fill in gaps  Senegalese courts had found while trying to implement the French  military code, which previously had been in force in Senegal.  The new military code is for Armed Forces' military personnel,  the paramilitary corps, and those who commit offenses against  the Armed Forces.</p>

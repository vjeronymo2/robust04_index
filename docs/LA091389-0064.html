			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CLOSET SUPPORT BOLSTERS ZSA ZSA IN 2ND TRIAL DAY  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor, her trial for slapping a motorcycle police officer still in its  preliminary stage, proclaimed her innocence again Tuesday and said her wardrobe  would carry her through, even if her case is drawn out.  </P> <P> "I have enough clothes (even) if this lasts a year," the Hungarian-born actress  said shortly before returning to Beverly Hills Municipal Court for a second day  of jury selection.  </P> <P> There was considerably less media attention and only a handful of fans in  evidence Tuesday as Gabor arrived with her eighth husband, Prince Frederick von  Anhalt, and her lawyer, William Graysen.  </P> <P> While a number of spectators who attended the first day of her trial were there  simply to catch a glimpse of someone famous, some of those who showed up  Tuesday said they wanted to show their support.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'She's Got Support'  </P> <P> "I don't want to see her get a bum rap," said Margaret Holloway, 60, of Los  Angeles. "I thought I'd come down and see what really happened. I just want to  show her she's got support. Everybody needs support."  </P> <P> Another fan pressed a homemade card saying "I Love You Zsa Zsa" into Gabor's  hand before she walked into the courtroom in the morning.  </P> <P> And after lunch -- during which Gabor visited her dentist to have her teeth  cleaned and elected not to order the "jailhouse chili" at a local restaurant --  she was greeted by a public-access cable television show host known as Mr.  Pete, who has been selling buttons reading, "Free Zsa Zsa. Her trial is our  trial."  </P> <P> "Oh, dahling, I love you," Gabor said in her trademark Hungarian accent as she  examined one of the buttons on his jacket.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restful Night  </P> <P> Wearing another Donna Karan design -- this one a camel and black leopard print  with a plunging neckline and adorned with a black silk flower off the shoulder  -- Gabor said she had a restful night after experiencing a nightmare the night  before her trial began.  </P> <P> "Of course I slept well. I didn't do anything wrong," Gabor said as she swept  past reporters.  </P> <P> At another point, she added: "Why should I be punished? I didn't do nothing."  </P> <P> On Monday, she said she had dreamed Sunday night that the officer she allegedly  slapped was "beating me up."  </P> <P> Gabor, however, was unable to say anything specific about the charges against  her Tuesday, because of a court-imposed gag order.  </P> <P> Von Anhalt, who has been taking brief naps in court, said his wife is taking  the case seriously, although the intense public attention "goes a little  against our private lives."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renowned for Her Temper  </P> <P> Gabor, renowned for her volatile temper, is accused of hitting Officer Paul  Kramer after he stopped her June 14 for an expired registration tag on her  $215,000 Rolls-Royce convertible.  </P> <P> The actress says Kramer manhandled her and threw her over the hood of her car  to handcuff her.  </P> <P> A police account of the incident said that while the officer was on his radio  checking her license, Gabor suddenly drove off. Kramer gave chase, stopped her  car a short distance away and ordered her out. Gabor complied, but slapped the  officer in the face.  </P> <P> After she was arrested, fingerprinted and released, Gabor complained that  Kramer had brutalized her and called her a "whore."  </P> <P> The charges against the former Miss Hungary include battery on a police  officer, disobeying a police officer and driving with an expired license, all  misdemeanors. She also is charged with having an open container of alcohol in a  vehicle -- a flask of Jack Daniels found in her glove compartment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Professional Manner'  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox has said there is no evidence that Kramer "acted  in anything other than a very professional manner."  </P> <P> But Graysen said he intends to make Kramer's alleged history of abuse the focus  of the trial, which is expected to last about a week after a jury is selected.  </P> <P> The selection of a jury was expected to continue through Tuesday, and  prosecutors said they anticipate giving their opening statements today.  </P> <P> The prospective jurors have been asked various questions, including how they  feel about profanity, whether they believe police have too much power and  whether there is a potential for police to abuse that power.  </P></p>

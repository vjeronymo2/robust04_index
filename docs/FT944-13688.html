			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (3): Why networks need managers - How to check software piracy and petty thefts A City of London bank, which recently conducted an audit of its personal computer networks, found 50 megabytes of computer memory were missing. The problem was eventually traced to one of the technical IT staff, who had taken four megabytes of memory out of each new machine that was purchased, and put it into his home computer. With the price of memory running at Pounds 80-100 per megabyte, such petty thefts can cost the business a significant amount of money. Not to mention the loss of capacity on the network, for which the business could also suffer. The bank's problem is not untypical. According to Adrian Botterill, UK marketing director of network supplier Azlan, many businesses do not know how much equipment is connected to their networks. Often equipment is purchased without any plan or strategy by user departments and the IT department is not consulted. Even in IT, PCs and PC networks tend to be small beside the larger mainframe and mid-range systems and few people bother to keep precise records. 'A lot of companies don't know what networks or systems they have in use. Individual staff connect PCs to networks with such a degree of freedom that IT departments often don't know what is happening,' says Mr Botterill. Only now are user organisations beginning to realise that PC networks need to be properly managed. Networks are installed to enable staff to be more productive by improving the flow of information within a department or an entire organisation. For example, a sales department is given access across the network to the debtors and creditors list on the accounting system. Sales reps then know which customers they should target for further sales, and which are a bad risk. These organisations not only risk loss of hardware, but could put in jeopardy those very benefits which they want to achieve, if they fail to look after the equipment. For example, can the network cope if everyone wants to access a particular application at the same time? What happens if more users are added to the network and traffic increases, causing regular 'crashes'? 'Networks are designed to cope with some failures. But you could have a lot of invisible failures, and if you then load the network up with more data traffic, you could go too far and hit a brick wall,' says Lee Taylor, of specialists supplier Logical Networks. Software is available to deal with each of these issues. But no single product copes with the lot all at once. The products fall into two categories: traditional network management software; and a new raft of products designed to manage desktop applications and hardware. The former includes Sun Net Manager, Hewlett Packard's Open View or IBM's Netview. These have evolved since the mid-1980s, beginning as products for managing distributed mainframe and mid-range computer systems, linked together over wide area networks. They manage the networking hardware - routers, bridges and multiplexers. They also monitor the network traffic and alert the IT staff before a route becomes overloaded so they have time to take action. For example, if a network is running at 50 per cent capacity, but previously it was at 20 per cent rising to 30 per cent, then it is clear that the steady increase in traffic could pose a problem. The software should automatically sort out such problems. All three packages support the international standard for network management, known as SNMP (simple network management protocol). However, they can be expensive, especially for small networks. Logical Networks quotes a minimum of Pounds 5,000 for Sun Net Manager, and Pounds 12,000-Pounds 20,000 for Open View. Much less expensive are the desktop management products, such as the Norton Administrator from Symantec at Pounds 350 for a five-user pack, rising to Pounds 2,900 for 50 users. Lan Desk Manager, from Intel, costs Pounds 715 for a network with just one server up to Pounds 7,000 for one with 20 servers. The Norton Administrator, for example, maintains an inventory of all PCs on the network, including the processor power and memory of each machine. Software upgrades and back-ups are also made easier, because the Administator can distribute software throughout the network. This solves a big network administration problem. Back-ups and other 'housekeeping' activities used to be done by a centralised IT department. With the advent of PC networks, users were expected to do their own. But in practice, few do so. Instead, IT staff spend most of their time moving around the organisation, often troubleshooting problems that occur precisely because housekeeping is done badly or not at all. According to a recent study by Gartner Group, the market researchers, this type of administrative activity can represent up to 84 per cent of the total cost of ownership of a PC network. The initial capital investment comprises the remaining 16 per cent. The Administrator also deals with a relatively new problem facing businesses: that of software piracy. A business can face litigation if found to be using illegal copies of applications software packages. According to Mr Taylor, it is easy to copy software, or to load up a package on to several different machines. 'I don't believe there are many companies in the UK which know how many copies of Microsoft Word they have,' he says. The software industry is moving to crack down on such illegal copying. The Federation Against Software Theft, an industry body set up specifically to deal with the problem, has the power to demand a software audit. 'It is easier for companies to do an audit if they have the management software in place,' says Mr Botterill. The Administrator, for example, checks every software application on the hard drives, and monitors the usage of each. It tracks software licences, and can be made to enforce licensing - for example, if 500 licences are paid for, it can be asked to refuse to log on the 501st user who tries to access that particular package. But all of the desktop management products are proprietary and one package will not work with another. A new technical standard, known as the desktop management interface has been agreed. Most manufacturers are now redeveloping their software to meet this standard, and products should be available next year.</p>

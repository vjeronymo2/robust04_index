			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, today  received at the Presidency Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, president of the  state of Palestine.    The audience was attended on the Algerian side by Mokdad  Sifi  and Mihoub Mihoubi, advisers on diplomatic affairs and  presidential official spokesman. On the Palestinian side, the  meeting was attended by the Palestinian ambassador to Algeria,  Abu al-'Iz, and Yasir Abd Rabbu, head of the PLO Information  Department.    On leaving the office of the head of state, Mr. 'Arafat made  the following statement:    [Begin recording] ['Arafat] First, I had to come here  following the formation of the first Palestinian administration  on the first liberated Palestinian territory. I had to come to  Algeria; this country that always stood by its Palestinian  brothers; Algeria, which has reiterated and continues to  reiterate that we are with Palestine, irrespective of whether  this Palestine was in the right or in the wrong.    I briefed the head of state on the latest developments in  our  land, and on the formation of the administration and the  challenges facing us. I thanked him for the support he has  provided for the Palestinian security forces -- these forces  that left this country for our land. Yesterday, these forces  made moves using all their equipment; all this highlights the  significance of these deeply rooted and original  Palestinian-Algerian relations.    Also, we tackled all the problems facing the Palestinian  national authority, especially now that we are starting from  zero. Our underlying structure was totally destroyed by the  Israeli occupation. The head of state reiterated to me and to  my brothers that Algeria will remain on the side of the  Palestinian people until, God willing, we pray in holy Jerusalem.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, what are the  priorities of the political program?    ['Arafat] You have seen the published program. The most  important issue for us now is to stress our national unity,  because we look forward to establishing a modern and democratic  state. We take into consideration the pan-Arab relations that  link us with our Arab nation. We also take into account the  far-sightedness, originality and religions and spiritual  foundations of Palestine, the first of the two kiblahs and the  third holy mosque; sacred places for both prophet Mohammed,  God's peace and prayers be upon Him, and Christ, peace be upon  Him.

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Heroines in search of a plot - Cinema SINGLE WHITE FEMALE (18) Barbet Schroeder TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME (18) David Lynch SISTER ACT (PG) Emile Ardolino Imagine that you are a single white male and that into your darkened bed glides your supposed girlfriend. She is in the midst of doing unpublishably intimate things to you when you realise - horror] - that it is not your girlfriend at all. It is your girlfriend's girlfriend. Barbet Schroeder's Single White Female is a delectably creepy tale of role-exchange from the director of Reversal Of Fortune. Much psycho-nonsense is spoken in the press notes about 'delicate symbiosis,' 'dyadic conflict' and the like. But we know where we are - grand guignol country - from the first spooky play with malfunctioning lift-doors to heroine Bridget Fonda's warning prowl around her plain-Jane new flatmate's suspicious personal effects. Expensive perfume? Pearl earrings? Jewelry? Miss Fonda, a comely computer software expert, has placed the personal ad ('Single white female seeks same') after the loneliness-inducing crisis of a broken romance. Dumpy Jennifer Jason Leigh answers. But the new rent-sharer's initial input of love, labrador pups and shoulders-to-cry-on is soon modulating to sexual jealousy, knifed neighbours and defenestrated pooches. Like most mystery thrillers, the film is better with the mystery than the thrills. These last come tumbling down on us in the final reel as if someone has opened a cupboard in the Gothic Props department: 'dead' persons returning to life, hairsbreadth chases through boiler rooms, zappings with iron hooks . . . How much less frightening than the early drip-drip of anxiety as Ms Fonda watches the schizophrenic Ms Leigh titrate one personality into another, recolouring her little girl lost as waif-with-a-vengeance. Schroeder and screenwriter Don Roos, adapting a novel by John Lutz, know when to leaven suspense with laughter. (Protective gay neighbour to frightened Fonda: 'I can be butch when I want to. I get it from my mother.') And designer Milena Canonero turns the European-style New York apartment - all high ceilings, ornately jaundiced walls and crumbling balcony grilles - into a crucible for terror as resonant as any since Rosemary's Baby. David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a strange film. Is it the exhausted ravings of a writer-director still trying to coax money from a cult TV series? One suspects it is. This two-hour prequel discloses the before-death hi-jinks of murdered 'heroine' Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). Once supposed a small-town innocent, Palmer is here revealed as Miss Loose Morals of the 1990s. She is a girl who sleeps around, sniffs coke, tears off her top in red-light dance dives, has sex a trois, and wears a smouldering come-hither look that Jean Harlow would be proud of. Meanwhile Agent Cooper (Kyle McLachlan) flexes his storm-lantern jaw somewhere in the spirit world; David Bowie, Kiefer Sutherland and others float through in guest cameos; and there are walk-in mirrors, secret diaries, bloodthirsty prowlers and sudden deaths. In short, anyone caught mentioning the words 'Norman Rockwell' in this American small town would probably be lynched. The charm of the TV Twin Peaks was its elusiveness. Evil was present but metamorphic. The audience was kept hungry for the solid food of information through endless servings of weird canapes and surreal titbits. The movie instead, knowing it cannot keep a tapas bar going through a two-hour film, heats up the red meat, sloshes on the wine, hurls in the gypsy violinists and ends up effectively raping the audience's taste-buds. With this film David Lynch becomes the most annoying director in America. He looked like a genius in Blue Velvet; he blew it with the kitschy hyperboles of Wild At Heart. He looked like a genius again in early episodes of Twin Peaks; the peaks blow it here, creating the most ozone-destroying, tourist-deterring eruption since Mount Saint Helen's. Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act is the week's third heroine in search of a cogent plot. American audiences clearly think she found it: the film made Dollars 137m, third only this year to Lethal Weapon 3 and Beauty And The Beast. Indeed combine a police chase thriller with a fairy story and you have this tale of a mob-hunted black cabaret singer (Miss G) who finds sanctuary and - yes - salvation in the nunnery where the police hide her as a protected witness. Think of Nuns On The Run and multiply by minus six. Jokes are thin, sentimentality is rife and among those peering into the camera lens making funny faces are Maggie Smith (Mother Superior), Harvey Keitel (chief mobster) and Miss Goldberg herself, whose unlikely sexpot-chanteuse is matched by her more unlikely 'sister act.' When she coaches the rickety convent choir in hip hymns and swinging spirituals, and they perform them before the visiting Pope (see the back of His Holiness's head as he bops along in the organ gallery), all sane British filmgoers will run screaming to the nearest pub. Why America's filmgoers stayed and paid is a puzzle. Perhaps the glutinous message about sisterly love transcending self-interested hide-and-seek appeals to popular taste in the age of post-yuppie piety. Then again perhaps audiences just like seeing Misses Goldberg, Smith and company going over the top and staying there, even though rightminded cinephiles wish they would return to the trenches. Talking of rightminded cinephiles, Sight and Sound magazine has published its latest Top Ten Films Of All Time international critics' poll. It has its its share of non-surprises. Citizen Kane tops the chart for the fourth decade running. Renoir's La Regle du Jeu and Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin are once more the arthouse favourites. And Hitchcock's Vertigo and John Ford's The Searchers still carry the torch of popular Hollywood up the pantheon steps. The casualties are more interesting than the survivors. Italian cinema has fallen down the stairway completely. No Bicycle Thieves nor L'Avventura nor 8 1/2 . Singin' In The Rain has plummeted from third-equal in 1982 to nowhere in 1992. And Buster Keaton's The General has tumbled into oblivion from a precarious tenth. Meanwhile Eastern cinema has crept back in with Ozu's Tokyo Story and Ray's Pather Panchali. So have those austere hermit-mystics Carl Dreyer (The Passion Of Joan Of Arc) and Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey). What does it all mean? My theory is that the new list is pre-millennial: suggesting a nervous alertness in us all to those new slabs of time, and perhaps space, awaiting us eight years hence. Localised angst or antics from such as Antonioni or Keaton - Mediterranean alienation, Civil War knockabout  -have yielded to more mystical echoes from distant lands and times. Even the two American crowd-pleasers ascending the chart - Vertigo and The Searchers - are about loss and being lost; about precise places turning into landscapes of infinity. Or then again, perhaps the poll just reflects the knock-on processes of movie fashion and research. Such-and-such a film is restored or reassessed (like Vigo's L'Atalante, back in the list after a three-year absence); while others (Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, third in 1982, out this year) have a decade of benign neglect. Only Kane seem immune to all caprice. It must be magic. There it stands, the greatest movie conjuring trick of all time: a film whose feats of technical prestidigitation have been analysed countless times, a film that even gives away its own plot secret (Rosebud equals sled), yet a film so sublimely convoluted that it has a dozen enigmas for each one that is solved. Sight and Sound Top Ten: Citizen Kane, La Regle Du Jeu, Tokyo Story, Vertigo, The Searchers, L'Atalante, The Passion Of Joan Of Arc, Pather Panchali, Battleship Potemkin, 2001: A Space Odyssey.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Euromark futures fall SHORT-DATED Euromark futures fell for the second day running yesterday after a Bundesbank council member raised new doubts in the market about the speed and scale of future interest rate cuts in Germany, writes James Blitz. The March Euromark contract opened yesterday at 92.08, a level which prices three-month D-Marks at 7.82 per cent by the spring. Three-month money was trading yesterday at around 8.55 per cent. The assumption that there will be a fall in rates of around 70 basis points over the next two months was considered by one dealer to be 'fair value' for the contract at the start of trading. However, Mr Helmut Hesse, the Bundesbank council member for Bremen, dampened sentiment by saying that the German central bank should not make big, rapid interest rate cuts in view of the current inflationary trends in Germany. The release of his speech, due to be delivered in the city of Bremen, helped to push the March contract down to a close of 92.03 after it had risen as high as 92.13 at one stage. The June contract was worse hit, perhaps because, as one dealer put it, it was far too bullish on rate cuts. The contract was finally 10 basis points down at 92.88, at which level it prices three-month money at 7.12 per cent in June. There was little other news to affect the German market. Dealers already know that the Bundesbank will intervene in the market today using a fixed rate two-week repo of 8.60 per cent. However, a dealer suggested that there will be interest in whether the Bundesbank uses a variable rate repo below 8.60 per cent, when lending money for one month. French franc futures also fell back yesterday after a bullish start to trading, which saw the March contract as high as 90.53. The contract retreated to close at 90.35, pricing three-month French francs at 9.65 per cent by the spring. Three-month French cash remained far higher than this, however, finishing yesterday at around 11 3/8 per cent. Short-dated sterling futures were slightly weaker after the Bank of England announced the date for the next gilt auction as January 27. The March short sterling contract declined 3 basis points to end at 93.26.</p>

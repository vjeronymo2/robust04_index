			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Settlement hope in council swaps case SETTLEMENT of Chemical Bank's Pounds 2.94m claim against the Hammersmith and Fulham council in London  - part of the interest rate swaps litigation  - appeared to be imminent last night. It will be the fifth of the six lead cases to have been resolved without the High Court having an opportunity to give guidance for the remaining disputes between banks and local authorities. The litigation stems from the House of Lords ruling in January last year that all swaps deals entered into by local authorities were void because they were outside councils' legal powers. Chemical Bank's case was opened on Wednesday. Its lawyers returned to court yesterday but went away without the hearing being resumed. Their places in court were taken by the lawyers for NationsBank of North Carolina  - formerly NCNB National Bank of North Carolina  - which is suing Hammersmith for Pounds 306,000, plus interest and costs, in the last lead case. Mr Robert Englehart QC, for NationsBank, told Mr Justice Hirst that, although a large US bank, it had been 'a veritable minnow' as far as the UK swaps market had been concerned. Its only swaps deals with local authorities had been two interest rate 'caps' transactions with Hammersmith, in which it had been intermediary between the council and Midland Bank and Salomon Brothers International. Mr Englehart explained that a 'cap' buyer paid a lump sum premium to the seller. In return, the seller agreed to make payments to the buyer if a variable interest rate such as Libor exceeded the fixed rate in the contract. It had been 'a most unfortunate dabbling' in the local-authority swaps market for NationsBank. It had received no payments from Hammersmith but had to honour back-to-back transactions in which it had sold the 'caps' to Midland and Salomon Brothers. The result had been that NationsBank had lost more than Pounds 1.75m instead of making an Pounds 81,000 profit. The hearing will continue on Tuesday.</p>

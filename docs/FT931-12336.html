			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Thomas French lower and selling loss-maker AFTER THE adoption of new accounting requirements and paying Pounds 103,000 to a former director, Thomas French &amp; Sons has seen its pre-tax profit fall from a restated Pounds 285,000 to Pounds 110,000 in the year ended October 3 1992. The group also announced the sale of Kaz Krafts, which incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 210,000 in the period, to Legend Fine Art for some Pounds 200,000 cash. The group's overall focus was now more strongly directed to the core activities of curtain tape and window accessories. Earnings per share fell from 5.51p to 0.19p, with the continuing businesses accounting for 4.58p (6.86p). They were arrived at after adding back payment to director of Pounds 68,000 net, and adjustments for discontinued operations of Pounds 443,000 net. A maintained final dividend of 2.175p is proposed for an unchanged total of 3.625p. Although the signs were for continuing recession the first quarter of the current year had gone well, said Mr Jeremy French, chairman. The curtain tape business acquired from British Trimmings last June was performing to expectations and benefit was coming from the elimination of loss-making activities. Net borrowings were Pounds 2.15m, giving gearing of 40 per cent. Turnover in continuing activities in 1991-92 fell 3 per cent to Pounds 12.8m generating a trading profit of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 1.26m) while losses in discontinued businesses fell from Pounds 337,000 to Pounds 189,000. Charges for losses on sale or closure of discontinued business, including Pounds 173,000 of goodwill previously written off, were Pounds 382,000 (Pounds 334,000).</p>

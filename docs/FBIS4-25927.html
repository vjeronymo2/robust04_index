			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by XINHUA reporters Wang Dajun (3769 1129 6511) </F> and Jiang Zhi 3068 3112: "The Origin of the Korean Nuclear  Issue"]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- Recently, disputes  surrounding the Korean nuclear issue have again intensified.    On 10 June, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  decided to suspend its assistance to the DPRK [chao xian 2600  7639], and the United States and others advocated economic and  military sanctions. The DPRK reacted strongly to this. On 13  June, it announced it would immediately withdraw from the IAEA.    The Korean nuclear issue is long-standing. After the Gulf  war, the United States, using its satellite photos as proof,  said that it suspected there were facilities in the DPRK's  Yongbyon district, about 100 km north of Pyongyang, used for the  development of nuclear weapons, claiming inspections of the  DPRK's nuclear facilities must be carried out. The DPRK  repeatedly declared that it had no intention to produce nuclear  weapons nor did it have the capability to do so. At the same  time, it accused the United States of deploying nuclear weapons  to the ROK [han guo 7281 0948] to threaten its security. The  two sides have since become antagonistic toward each other.  Only later, after the DPRK and the ROK signed the "Joint  Declaration on Denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula" and the  DPRK signed a nuclear safety agreement with the IAEA and agreed  to accept inspections, did the tense atmosphere on the peninsula  somewhat ease.    During the period between May 1992 and February last year,  the DPRK received unscheduled nuclear inspections from the IAEA  on six occasions. However, the two sides disagreed on the  targets and inspection results. In February last year, the IAEA  Board of Governors passed a resolution to carry out mandatory  "special inspections" on the DPRK's nuclear facilities. At the  same time, the United States and the ROK resumed their joint  military exercise, "Team Spirit," which had been suspended in  1992. In light of this, the DPRK announced on 12 March 1993 its  withdrawal from the "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT],"  which it had joined at the end of 1985. The situation on the  peninsula thus became tense again.    Under these circumstances, the United States held two rounds  of vice foreign ministerial talks with the DPRK and made  promises on the question of assisting the DPRK in remodeling its  nuclear facilities. The DPRK subsequently announced that it  would not withdraw from the "NPT" for the time being. During  their talks, both sides agreed to hold a third round of talks  within two months to discuss settlement of the nuclear issue and  improvement of bilateral relations. However, because of  differences over a number of issues between the two sides, the  third round of talks were not held. It was not until the last  10 days of February this year did the DPRK reach a compromise  with the IAEA and the United States: The DPRK agrees to receive  inspections of its seven nuclear facilities; the South and North  resume contact on the exchange of special envoys; the United  States and the ROK agree to stop this year's joint military  exercise; and the United States agrees to hold the third  high-level talks with the DPRK. At the same time, the United  States also put forward two conditions, namely the IAEA's  inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities be acceptable to all  parties and the South and North realize the exchange of special  envoys. After these two conditions were essentially met, the  situation on the peninsula became further eased. As a result,  there was another inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities by  the IAEA in early March this year.    However, the IAEA was not satisfied with the inspection  results, which led to the sharpening of differences among the  concerned parties. During the last 10 days of April, the DPRK  told the IAEA that it wanted to replace the fuel rods in its  five megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and invited it to send  personnel to the site to supervise the replacement. However,  while expressing a cautious welcome, the IAEA again set  preconditions, asking the DPRK to accept its all-out inspection  of its nuclear facilities and operation process. The DPRK did  not accept this demand. In early May, after the IAEA indicated  that it would not send personnel to the DPRK to supervise the  replacement, the DPRK went ahead and replaced the nuclear fuel  rods by itself. The IAEA held that the DPRK's action made it  impossible to determine whether the plutonium produced by the  nuclear reactor had been diverted for other uses. The DPRK, on  the other hand, stressed that its replacement of the nuclear  fuel rods was monitored by the IAEA's monitoring device  installed at its nuclear reactor and waste facilities, and that  its replacement method fully preserved the technical possibility  for later measurements.    The serious difference over this issue between the IAEA and  the DPRK has drastically chilled the eased atmosphere on the  peninsula. In wake of the IAEA's recent announcement that it  would suspend its assistance, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman  issued a statement saying the DPRK deems all IAEA resolutions  null and void; that it will not accept continuous nuclear safety  inspection, which it accepted when it was placed under special  status; and that it again declared that it regards UN sanctions  as a declaration of war against the DPRK.    The origin and development of the Korean nuclear issue shows  that the issue can only be resolved through sincere dialogue by  all parties concerned; sanctions and confrontation can only  aggravate the tense situation on the Korean peninsula.</p>

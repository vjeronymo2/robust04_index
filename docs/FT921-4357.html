			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Trade News: China Light and Exxon in HKDollars 60bn power plans CHINA Light and Power (CLP) and its partner Exxon plan to spend up to HKDollars 60bn (Pounds 4.4bn) over the next decade on new power plants and associated transmission and distribution systems in Hong Kong, the two said yesterday. CLP and Exxon are the monopoly suppliers of electricity to Kowloon and the New Territories in Hong Kong. Their predictions of future capital spending were made as the two companies signed another 15-year scheme-of-control agreement with the Hong Kong government for supply of power to the colony. The agreement will run from October 1993 until 2008. The two said they would also be signing heads of agreement with the Chinese government this week for supply of natural gas from Hainan Island, 500 miles south of Hong Kong, to fire a planned power station at Black Point in the New Territories. Black Point has a planned capacity of 6,000 MW, making it the world's biggest thermal power station under active planning, and is due to start producing electricity by 1996. CLP and Exxon intend up to half of it to be fired by gas and the remainder by coal. The China National Offshore Oil Co (CNOOC), and Arco International Oil and Gas, the exploration arm of the US oil company, plan to lay a 500-mile submarine pipeline from the Yinggehai gas field to the New Territories. The agreement, which provides for supply for a minimum of 20 years, requires CNOOC to deliver gas by 1996. The renewal of the scheme of control for CLP and Exxon was the first major issue the Hong Kong government put before the Chinese government in the wake of last year's airport agreement. It was required to do so as the agreement straddled 1997. Both companies expressed confidence in the future of Hong Kong and southern China. The Hong Kong government has allowed the two to keep 20 per cent of the profits they derive from selling electricity to China. Currently, some 10-12 per cent of their output is sold to China; last year, those sales earned the companies HKDollars 900m in revenues. The scheme of control allows the companies to earn a return of 13.5 per cent, and 15 per cent on average net fixed assets in electricity-related operations.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WIMBLEDON ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GRAF STORMS PAST SALMON IN THE FIRST ROUND, 6-1, 6-2  </P> <P> The key to beating Steffi Graf? Wait until she's sick, apparently.  </P> <P> Graf obliterated her first-round opponent, Julie Salmon of England, 6-1, 6-2,  and said afterward that she felt fine.  </P> <P> "I am perfect," Graf said.  </P> <P> As she improved her record to 194-7 since becoming No. 1 in 1987, Graf was  playing her first match since she played in a weakened condition and lost the  French Open final to Arantxa Sanchez of Spain.  </P> <P> On that day in Paris, Graf was recovering from a virus and feeling sick, but  that wasn't so unusual. In four of her last five losses, Graf was sick, with  one thing or another.  </P> <P> "I am easy to get something, I guess," she said.  </P> <P> Graf said she is taking more vitamins now, but isn't sure if it's going to  help.  </P> <P> "I'm just someone who gets colds and everything real easy. There is nothing I  can do."  </P> <P> It was business as usual for the other top women in the first round. Martina  Navratilova, seeded second, defeated Jill Hetherington of Canada, 6-3, 6-2;  Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, seeded third, defeated Diane Balestrat of  Australia, 6-1, 6-0, and Chris Evert, seeded fourth, defeated Peanut Harper,  6-1, 6-1.  </P> <P> Navratilova scored her 49th victory in her last 50 Wimbledon matches with  relative ease, but she did not notice any intimidation factor working in her  favor.  </P> <P> "I was too busy worrying about me," she said. "I suppose if she fell down with  her knees knocking, I would get an idea, but that didn't happen."  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> Tim Mayotte of Bradenton, Fla., seeded eighth, won his first-round match  against Paolo Cane of Italy, 7-6 (7-2), 6-0, 6-1. It was Mayotte's 30th  Wimbledon victory and made him the fourth-winningest active male player at  Wimbledon behind Jimmy Connors, who has won 81; John McEnroe, 47, and Ivan  Lendl, 33. . . . Monica Seles, 15, the Yugoslavia-born and Florida-bred  sensation, has entered the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, which will be played  Aug. 7-13.  </P> <P> Eleventh-seeded Brad Gilbert of Piedmont, Calif., is the only seeded player yet  to complete his first-round match. Gilbert was tied at two sets all against  John Fitzgerald of Australia when play was suspended because of darkness. . . .  From 32-year-old Martina Navratilova: "I read that some of the players said  they thought I would get more nervous playing the younger players. That's funny  because the only one older is Chris (Evert)."  </P></p>

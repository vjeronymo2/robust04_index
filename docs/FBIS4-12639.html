			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 Apr (MENA)--The Journalists Association  Council has held an emergency session chaired by the  Association's deputy chairman Jalal 'Isa. At the request of  seven members of the council, the Association discussed the  repeated arrests of journalists and their interrogation by the  state security prosecution and military prosecution branches in  cases related to publication and opinion.    The Association said that these arrests run counter to the  criminal procedures law, the Journalists Association Law, and  all other laws that safeguard the security of the journalist.  The arrests threaten all the immunities enjoyed by journalists,  the Association added.    The Council's statement notes that some of these procedures  are arbitrary and that journalists are being mistreated by the  interrogation body, which is entrusted with defending  journalists and obeying the law. The interrogation body has  failed to notify the Journalists Association to attend the  interrogation sessions dealing with publication crimes. This is  a basic and important issue guaranteed by the law, the Council  added.    The Council said the Association refuses to permit  journalists to be treated like criminals or ex-convicts [words  indistinct].    The Council called on all the state's [words indistinct] to  respect the immunities guaranteed the press and journalists by  the laws and constitution. The Council reiterates the  Association's great desire to maintain healthy and frank  relations with all state bodies. The Association also stressed  that it will not cede any of its rights to defend journalists  with all legitimate methods against any infringement or attack.    The Council said that the current circumstances through  which  the country is passing make it incumbent upon us all to combine  our efforts and unify our ranks against the forces of  treacherous terrorism. Those entrusted with respecting the law  and legitimacy must not violate them, the Council said.</p>

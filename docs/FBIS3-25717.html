			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Announcer] Paris says it is very preoccupied  with the Nigerian-Cameroonian border conflict, and has been in  contact with Yaounde to gather the most complete information on  the issue. Regarding this, a French diplomatic and military  mission arrived in our capital this afternoon. It was welcomed  at the Yaounde Air Force Base by a delegation led by the chief  of general staff, Pierre Temenge. Joseph Ley, you have just  returned from the Yaounde Air Force Base where you really saw  the disembarkment of a detachment of French paratroopers from  Bangui, Central African Republic [CAR].    [Ley] Yes, Charles. At 1525, a French Air Force Transal  aircraft landed at the Yaounde Military Base. The heavy-duty  transport aircraft was carrying a detachment of French  paratroopers and two military jeeps. As you said, they came  from Bangui, the CAR. Fifty minutes later, two [name  indistinct] helicopters, which generally serve as a support for  land troops, also landed at the military base with equipment and  some men. The equipment and the men were welcomed by a  high-level delegation led by General Pierre Temenge, the chief  of general staff. Also included in the delegation were General  Claude Meka, the commander of the Yaounde headquarters and of  the first military region; Colonel Paul Yakana Yebama, the chief  of air staff; Commander Etoga, commander of the Yaounde Air  Force Base; and several other Cameroonian military officers.    On the French side, it was Colonel (Ballaman), military  attache at the French Embassy in Yaounde, who led the welcoming  committee. According to a French military official, for now  these men and their equipment will remain here in Yaounde. They  will only be deployed in the case of necessity and [words  indistinct] on the Cameroonian side.    France has reacted militarily, but it has also reacted  diplomatically, because a French diplomatic mission from Paris  arrived at the Yaounde International Airport late this  afternoon. This delegation is made up of officials concerned  with African and Malagasy affairs at the Elysees and at the  French Foreign Service. In addition to this the French Embassy  has just presented to us the following statement from the  spokesman of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated 25  February. The statement reads: France is very concerned by the  tension currently reigning between Nigeria and Cameroon. This  follows the entry of Nigerian forces into the Bakasi Peninsula  and the clashes that took place on 18 February. France is  attentively following the evolution of the situation in the  field and in New York, where Cameroon has called for an  emergency meeting of the Security Council. France is in  permanent contact with the authorities of the two countries. It  is making efforts to ensure that any act that may lead to a  further degradation in the situation is avoided, and that a  peaceful settlement is found to the dispute. To this end, in  collaboration with its partners, the French Government has  embarked on diplomatic action, both on the bilateral and  international levels, where this affair might be discussed. The  European Union is also intervening along the same lines. Our  concern, the communique continues, is that peace must be  preserved and that the most appropriate international forum be  found as soon as possible to ensure a peaceful solution to this  dispute. Well, Charles, this is all I have concerning this  diplomatic and military mission undertaken by France to  Cameroon. In case of necessity, this mission will come to  support the actions already undertaken, with much success, both  by our soldiers and our diplomats.    [Announcer] Thank you, Joseph. Still, concerning this border  conflict between Cameroon and its neighbor, Nigeria, the  minister of defense visited with Cameroonian troops over the  weekend. Accompanied by the chief of general staff, the minister  visited the front to see the morale was of the Cameroonian  troops. Their morale was judged to be good. The outcome of the  latest clashes was one Cameroonian soldier killed, with more  than 30 dead on the Nigerian side, according to our  correspondent, [name indistinct] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / MFI sweetens the pill of a 39% decline MFI, the furniture group, sent a mixed message to the City yesterday, reporting a 39 per cent fall in pro forma pre-tax profits to Pounds 40.2m because of disappointing sales, but giving an upbeat statement on current trading. It was the company's first full-year results presentation since its flotation last July. The shares gained 1 1/2 p to close at 128 1/2 p. 'We are trading 3 per cent ahead, but 11 weeks is nowhere near a trend, and we are still cautious,' said Mr Derek Hunt, chairman. Turnover for the year to April 24 fell 6.7 per cent to Pounds 603.9m. Mr John Randall, finance director, said trading had been particularly disappointing during the 10-week new year sale, when MFI makes about a third of its turnover. While this partly reflected lower levels of activity in the housing market, he admitted MFI had made mistakes in its promotional campaigns which led to competitors stealing market share. MFI had since adjusted some prices and revamped its advertising. Sales suffered most in kitchens and bedrooms, which carry a higher profit margin because MFI manufactures them itself. Gross margins fell 1.7 points to 57.4 per cent because of the unfavourable sales mix and exchange rate movements. But Mr Randall said the company's progress in cutting costs made it optimistic it could increase profits next year, even if the economic upturn was weak. MFI has reduced overheads by 7.2 per cent through cutting staff by 800, investing in new systems, reducing stockholding and purchasing freeholds on four previously leasehold properties. Surplus space in some stores has been sub-let, leading to lower costs and rental income for the year of Pounds 7.2m. Mr Randall said at least another 100,000 sq ft of surplus space would be leased out in the current year, taking rental income to Pounds 8.5m. Analysts expect costs to fall further this year, and based on an improvement in sales of 3 or 4 per cent are forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m this year. Proceeds from the flotation allowed MFI to redeem its preference shares and reduce borrowings to Pounds 62m, taking gearing from 80 per cent to 52 per cent. Since the year-end, the company has received Pounds 21m from the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Carpetright, which was floated last month. Pro forma earnings were 4.5p (7.4p). The final dividend was held at 2.5p, making a total of 3.75p. Lex, Page 16</p>

The main items on the conference agenda were to transmit the  guidelines of the sixth conference of provincial, regional, and  municipal foreign affairs offices; to review Anhui's foreign  affairs work, and to decide on this year's tasks in foreign  affairs and foreign liaison.    Governor Fu Xishou attended and spoke at the conference,  while Yang Liangduo, vice governor and concurrently director of  the provincial foreign affairs office, delivered a work report.    The conferees agreed: In 1993 Anhui, saw the fastest and  most productive growth of its economy, as well as an  accelerating pace of opening to the outside world. Today an  excellent situation of multidirectional opening at various  levels and through different channels has taken shape in the  province. Workers engaged in foreign affairs have made their  share of contributions to promoting the sustained, rapid, and  healthy growth of the provincial economy and to accelerating the  pace of opening to the outside world.    In his speech, the governor said: Local governments should  further gear their foreign affairs work to the needs of economic  construction, reform, and opening up. To effectively carry out  foreign affairs work, they should familiarize themselves with  the pulse of local economic developments as well as with some  knowledge of economics.    He emphasized: We should strengthen the centralized, unified  leadership over foreign affairs work and the management by the  relevant departments. Principal party and government leaders at  all levels should show concern for and support foreign affairs  and should bring into full play the functions of foreign affairs  offices, which can only be strengthened, not weakened. Foreign  affairs offices should help party committees and governments  implement to the letter the central authorities' principles and  policies on foreign affairs. They should give good advice and  serve as competent assistants to the party committees and  governments while providing quality service to other departments  and units. He added: Foreign affairs and foreign liaison  departments at all levels should fight corruption and promote  clean government to intensify the building of spiritual  civilization. They should firmly crack down on and correct some  unhealthy practices and chaotic situations in contacts with  foreign affairs matters, in striving to score periodic results  to ensure Anhui's opening in a sound, orderly manner.    In his report, Yang Duoliang emphasized: Foreign affairs  departments should foster an overall concept of foreign affairs  and improve work in the following seven areas: 1) strengthening  management to ensure that Anhui's foreign affairs work proceeds  in a healthy, orderly way; 2) actively expanding contacts with  foreign countries by inviting more persons to visit Anhui and  sending more persons abroad; 3) increasing exchanges with  foreign countries in various forms and through different  channels; 4) strengthening the functions of foreign affairs  offices and improving the quality of their staff members; 5)  reinforcing discipline in foreign affairs work and enhancing the  security concept to safeguard the national dignity and security;  6) stepping up publicity to foreign countries to make Anhui and  the degree of its opening better known to the outside world; and  7) strengthening the leadership to go all-out in promoting the  opening to the outside world.</p>

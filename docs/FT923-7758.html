			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Conder loss nears Pounds 23m leaving negative funds LOSSES IN 1991 at Conder Group, the construction and property concern based in Winchester, grew from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 22.6m pre-tax and the unaudited balance sheet at the year-end showed negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 5.95m. Mr Alan Lovell, chief executive, said that KPMG Peat Marwick would have qualified the accounts had they been published. As it was, the auditor was 'unable to express an opinion as to whether or not it is appropriate to draw up the accounts on the basis that the group is a going concern'. October 8 is the deadline for publication and Mr Lovell said it was planned that Conder would have done enough by then for the accounts to be unqualified. 'Enough' amounted to the sale of IEI, the building services arm providing mechanical, electrical, ventilation and air-conditioning services on a design and construct basis. Mr Lovell said he felt the management was not doing the work of receivers, though he admitted that IEI was core and its sale 'disappointing'. It would be sold 'way above' book value, he said, and its sale would repair the damage to the balance sheet. He added that the management had already done sufficient to produce 'modest profitability' in May and June and to make the now smaller group viable at the moment, though it had made an undisclosed loss in the first half of 1992. Conder was 'operating within facility levels' agreed with NatWest, its bank. Mr Lovell said an independent future was possible but disposal of the group was not ruled out. Turnover tumbled to Pounds 183.4m (Pounds 289.1m) with 40 per cent of the fall from disposals and 60 from decline in continuing businesses. Operating profits of Pounds 7.19m turned into losses of Pounds 7m before exceptional charges of Pounds 6.05m (Pounds 22.2m) which related to the losses of Elmeta, the closed curtain-walling company, and Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 3.52m) for property write-downs and rationalisation costs. Losses per share were 54p (39p) and the shares fell from 13p to 8p.</p>

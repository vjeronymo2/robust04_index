			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / International Company News: IBM investors intensify pressure IBM is coming under increasing pressure from large shareholder groups to take action to improve its dismal financial performance. The US computer giant is understood to be planning a special board meeting next week to address the shareholders' concerns. The California Public Employees Pension System, known as Calpers, is believed to be seeking a meeting with IBM's outside directors to discuss the company's difficulties. Calpers is one of IBM's largest shareholders. IBM said that it has engaged in some correspondence with Calpers, and that within the past two months Mr John Akers, IBM chairman and chief executive, had met Mr Dale Hanson, Calpers' chief executive, to discuss the company's situation. IBM officials declined to comment, however, on whether the company's board will hold a special meeting next week. Neither would they comment on whether Calpers has requested a meeting with outside directors. Calpers has been instrumental in forcing the boards of directors of several large corporations to deal with financial problems. The pension fund was one of several shareholder groups that put pressure on Westinghouse to reform its corporate governance rules and on Sears Roebuck to restructure its operations. If Calpers meets IBM's outside directors it would suggest that the pension fund investors are dissatisfied with IBM management's handling of the company's financial problems. It could also signal an effort to displace Mr Akers. However, Mr Akers has so far retained the strong support of IBM's board members, including outside directors, and his position appears to be secure. He is expected to retire at the end of 1994 when he reached IBM's traditional retirement age of 60, and there are no obvious candidates within IBM's ranks to replace him sooner than that. Institutional investors have, however, been pushing IBM to consider dropping its 'full employment' policy, under which the company has so far avoided involuntary layoffs throughout a massive reduction of its workforce, including 40,000 planned job cuts this year through voluntary early retirement schemes. Mr Akers, who has resisted layoffs in the past, said a year ago that the company's full employment practice could continue only if the prosperity of the company improved. Wall Street analysts expect IBM to announce further cuts, of up to about 30,000 people, and take a large charge against earnings. Some have also suggested that IBM may be forced to cut its dividend. Mr John Jones of Salomon Brothers said earlier this week that he sees a 50 per cent chance of IBM halving the dividend. There is also rising speculation that IBM may be forced to consolidate its mainframe computer operations.</p>

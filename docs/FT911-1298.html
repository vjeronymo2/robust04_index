			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (10): Moving away from the political arena - Labour SOUTH AFRICA's trade union movement, at the forefront of the liberation struggle throughout the 1980s, is rapidly moving away from the politics of confrontation. In the dark days of the mid-80s, when tens of thousands of anti-apartheid activists were detained under South Africa's state of emergency, unionists were often the only people left to organise opposition to apartheid. Skilled at negotiation as a result of the annual pay round with employers, and close to local communities through their links with workers, unionists led the anti-apartheid front until black political activity became legal in February last year. Since that time, though, union leaders have played a surprisingly small role in national politics. The largest trade union federation, the Congress of South Africa Trade Unions (Cosatu), remains a member of the tripartite alliance led by the African National Congress (ANC), and also including the South African Communist Party (SACP). But over the past year, Cosatu has taken a back seat in the alliance. The leaders of the ANC - most of whom have little experience of modern South Africa, having spent many years either in exile or in jail - have failed to seek union leaders' opinions or expertise in drawing up policy. When the ANC elects a new expanded executive in July, it is likely unionists will be well represented. They will then face the dilemma of how to work within the alliance, while guaranteeing their independence in the new South Africa. The experience of trade unions throughout Africa shows that post-liberation governments often restrict or even repress union activity. South Africa's unions are keen to ensure this does not happen to them. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers and one of the country's best-known trade unionists, says Cosatu will participate in constitutional negotiations as part of the ANC delegation, providing support staff for the ANC negotiating team. 'But we are vehemently defending our independence, now and even beyond negotiations.' Mr Ramaphosa, a leading political figure before the unbanning of the ANC, says a high priority for the NUM will be to ensure workers are involved in restructuring the gold mining industry, which has been thrown into crisis by the low gold price (see graph below). Some 40,000 jobs were lost last year and a further 40,000 could go this year, given the current gold price. Against this background, Mr Ramaphosa says the NUM is willing to be 'reasonable' in its wage demands - but management must agree to improve conditions, respect human rights, and negotiate issues such as job grading, staffing levels and working hours. In the context of such high retrenchment in mining - and with as many as 40 per cent of the population unemployed - the challenge for trade unionists will be to ensure they are not left representing a small employed elite at the expense of the millions of unemployed. 'The main thrust of our struggle has always been to fight for the rights of all working people, including the unemployed,' says Mr Ramaphosa. He acknowledges this has led to debate over the virtues of a national minimum wage. 'We need to settle on a minimum wage which does not leave us with a massive unemployment problem,' says Mr Ramaphosa. 'It should not be pegged at a level which industry cannot afford.' In the end, says labour consultant Duncan Innes, last year may prove to have been a turning point, ushering in a 'more constructive era' in which black unions position themselves less for confrontation, and more 'to influence future state and corporate policies from within.'</p>

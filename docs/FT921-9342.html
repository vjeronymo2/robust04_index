			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A history lesson from the Bank FT-SE Index: 2,537.1 (-1.3) Those who believe this recession belongs in the context of a long economic cycle need look no further than the latest Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin. The text is full of historic superlatives. The level of UK house repossessions is without precedent. Last year's nominal growth in UK GDP was the lowest since the early 1960s. The gearing of the UK personal sector is at an historic peak. The present UK recession is as long as any since the war. In the US, capital investment in relation to GDP is the lowest since the 1940s, while interest rates are the lowest since 1964. German interest rates are the highest since the war. French unemployment is at a record and rising. Given all that, it sounds as if the UK market had better be right in expecting an imminent cut in interest rates. Yesterday, three-month money closed below base rate for the first time since November. But electoral pressures apart, it is not quite clear that the UK's inflation performance justifies monetary easing. It was announced yesterday that producer price inflation, though falling, was still at 4.5 per cent in January. The government has just awarded a pay rise to public employees averaging some 6.4 per cent, the same figure which aroused the ire of the Bundesbank when granted to German steel employees last week. The Bank of England, while conceding progress is being made against inflation, is careful to point out that retail prices of UK services rose last year by 10.5 per cent. Above all, as the Bank repeatedly reminds us, the UK is not alone in being crippled by debt. When combined with a level of real interest rates without precedent at this stage in the cycle, this is the biggest single reason for the persistence of the world economic downturn. Even in this year's second half, the Bank says, UK consumption is likely to be flat in real terms. For those still banking on a consumer-led recovery, the message is simple - don't hold your breath.</p>

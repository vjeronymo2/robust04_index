			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / US-led forces near Somali 'City of Death' A SMALL contingent of US Marines moved into the lawless Somali town of Baidoa last night and took control of the disused airstrip to prepare for the arrival within hours of a much larger military intervention force. Colonel Mohammed Gutaale, commander of airport security in the terrorised town, refused to let foreigners beyond the airport perimeter last night and said: 'The Marines are in control of the airport now. You cannot come in.' The seizure of Baidoa airport under cover of darkness is the first penetration by US military of Somalia's starvation-ridden interior. It marked the start of the second phase of Operation Restore Hope. Commandos at the airport were last night preparing for the arrival of US Marine reconnaissance units expected between midnight and 4am local time. Up to 700 US and French soldiers will take the town by road in a 70-vehicle armoured convoy and by air from Cobra combat helicopters at twilight. As many as 100 people a day are dying in Baidoa. The decrepit 'City of Death', at the centre of the starvation zone, is a critical objective for the US-led operation to provide security for the delivery of relief to up to 2m Somalis at risk of death by starvation. Gunmen, who have been on an orgy of looting and violence in the past week, huddled in groups near ramshackle tea stalls in Baidoa late yesterday afternoon discussing if they should leave before foreign troops arrived. Isolated gunshots echoed throughout the day as gunmen reportedly tried to loot diesel fuel and food and settle final scores before hiding their weapons and withdrawing their battle wagons from the streets. The seizure of the airport came hours after Mr Robert Oakley, the US special envoy in Somalia, held final talks in Baidoa with local clan-faction leaders and aid workers. Mr Oakley told clan leaders and Somali elders that the US forces were coming simply to assist aid workers efforts to deliver food to the starving. He urged them to co-operate with the troops in their policing mission. In a meeting with dispirited aid workers Mr Oakley said the soldiers had been making sensible preparations for the operation. 'We are not anticipating a military threat here but as always we are coming prepared,' Mr Oakley said before returning to the airport in a battered all-terrain vehicle with armed gunmen sitting on the roof. He also warned Somalis and foreigners to stay away from the airport and said: 'After midnight be very careful until troops get settled down.' Aid workers who have been holed up in compounds fortified by sandbags and machine-gun emplacements on roofs expressed hope the US military intervention would allow them to get back to serious work. At makeshift roadside garages mechanics repaired axles and spare wheels and tuned engines to ensure cars could make a speedy getaway. Residents pushed donkey carts or broken-up wheelbarrows loaded with sacks of US wheat and EC vegetable oil off the streets behind the walls of compounds fearing foreign troops might confiscate plundered relief supplies.

			<p>941022 FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Air London lower Turnover at Air London International, the charter broker, rose from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 18.1m for the year to July 31. However, pressure on margins and higher overheads, arising mainly from increased sales efforts, left pre-tax profits 13 per cent lower at Pounds 640,000, against Pounds 726,000. Earnings per share dropped to 4.7p (5.6p) but an unchanged recommended final dividend of 1.9p holds the total at 3.5p.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Markets (At a glance): Oil sector begins to bubble The oil sector has seen some active dealing on the stock market in recent weeks, most of it hinging on switches between BP, the largest company in the sector, and other smaller companies with speculative potential. The whole sector was shaken by the news on Wednesday that Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil had made a deal to to accquire Occidental Petroleum's North Sea assets for Dollars 1.35bn. Enterprise dropped 6p to 551p, having at one point hit 570p, but switching into its high-yielding convertible stock led to drops in the share price of the major stocks in the sector. BP dropped 11p to 343p on Wednesday. Dealers were discounting a loss by BP for the first quarter, which would have been the first ever in the company's history. The results, published on Thursday, in fact revealed a net income of Pounds 10m, and shares edged up 3p to 346p on the news.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'CHILD'S PLAY' SEQUEL NO. 1 AT BOX OFFICE;  </P> <P> FILMS: KEVIN COSTNER'S 'DANCES WITH WOLVES' DEBUTS WITH THE HIGHEST PER-SCREEN  AVERAGE OF THE YEAR.  </P> <P> The holiday movie season got a rousing send-off over the weekend, with the  horror sequel "Child's Play II" taking the No. 1 spot with $10.7 million at the  turnstiles, and "Dances With Wolves" riding to glory in limited release, with  ticket sales of $598,257 on 14 screens -- for the year's highest per-screen  average, of $42,733.  </P> <P> The slate even got a boost from "Ghost," the seemingly eternal summer holdover.  The Paramount Pictures film jumped 37% to take third place over the weekend  with $4.3 million in ticket sales, a feat some sources attributed to reports  that "Ghost" was the year's top-grossing film to date.  </P> <P> "We're definitely on our way for the holidays," declared John Krier, president  of Exhibitor Relations, which provides box-office information to exhibitors.  </P> <P> Krier predicted healthy numbers for films set to open through Christmas. "This  is the earliest we've ever gotten started -- and the signs are certainly more  than healthy," he said.  </P> <P> "Child's Play II" is a follow-up to the 1988 sleeper about a murderous doll  named Chucky. The Universal Pictures sequel opened on 1,996 screens for a solid  per-screen average of $5,370.  </P> <P> The first "Child's Play" with the murderous pint-size doll opened on Nov. 9,  1988, to $8 million on 1,377 screens, an average of $4,781 per screen.  </P> <P> But it was the per-screen numbers for "Dances With Wolves" -- some of the  highest in recent years -- that sent the industry buzzing.  </P> <P> Its $42,733 gives it one of the highest platformed-openings of recent years,  following "Good Morning, Vietnam" (1987) with $48,577 and "Born on the Fourth  of July" (1989) with $43,005.  </P> <P> Flanked by a massive marketing and publicity campaign -- including lots of  press coverage of star/first-time director Kevin Costner -- "Dances With  Wolves" opened to largely positive reviews, the New York Times being a major  exception.  </P> <P> Because of the film's three-hour length and the fact that Westerns have not  done well at the box office lately, "Dances" was considered a gamble.  </P> <P> But based on opening weekend figures, Orion executives are anticipating a hit.  </P> <P> "This is one of those times when everything came together -- including the fact  that we had an exceptional film to work with," said David Forbes, president of  distribution.  </P> <P> Currently in release in eight cities -- Los Angeles, New York, Washington,  Chicago, Dallas, Seattle, San Francisco and Toronto, "Dances" will widen to  approximately 1,000 screens Nov. 21.  </P> <P> Elsewhere at the weekend box office:  </P> <P> Tri-Star Pictures' psychological thriller "Jacob's Ladder" -- which last week  dominated the box office -- dropped a rung and more than 30%, to the No. 2 spot  with ticket sales of about $5.1 million.  </P> <P> Columbia Pictures' comedy, "Sibling Rivalry" was in fourth place, with ticket  sales of approximately $3 million, and Warner Bros.' "Reversal of Fortune"  ranked fifth, with grosses of about $2.5 million.  </P></p>

These two draft  agreements were the focus of discussions between a Swiss  delegation, headed by Daniel Staufaher, chief sector at the  Ministry of Economy, and the Albanian side, represented by  officials of the Ministries of Mining and Energy Resources and  Finance and the Albanian Electro-Energy Corporation.

(Tirana ATA in English 1000 GMT 30 Apr 94)    FARMERS BUY MACHINES: Farmers in the Has district, a  mountainous area in northeast Albania, bought 145 mechanized  agricultural implements last year. This was made possible by  loans provided by the state to this area, which is one of the  poorest in the country. Among various types of machinery, we  can mention 50 belarus tractors and cultivators. Has was  previously part of the Kukes district, but with the new  administrative realignments carried out two years ago, Has  became a separate district. Despite great difficulties during  the transition period, particularly those related to the  distribution of land to private farmers, agricultural production  has increased due to the hard work of the farmers and the  credits made available by the state. (Tirana ATA in English  1004 GMT 30 Apr 94)    EXPORTS INCREASE: According to data from the Statistics  Institute, Albanian exports reached an amount of 28,208,000 leks  in the first quarter of 1994. During the same period last year,  exports were only worth 1,469,000 leks. Among the principal  commodities exported were minerals such as ferro-chromium,  copper, and items manufactured using aluminum and chromium. A  large number of medical herbs was also exported. Some  commodities, such as oranges, lemons, fish, cognac, and  kerosene, are both exported and imported. Reports from the  Statistical Institute confirm that exports to Italy make up 67.9  percent of the total, those to the United States 8.56 percent,  and those to Greece 7.19 percent. Export figures were the  highest in February, with a trade volume of 1,388,000 leks.  (Tirana ATA in English 1006 GMT 30 Apr 94)    BUILDING SITES BOUGHT: In a recent article, the LAJMI I  DITES newspaper considered the activity of companies acquiring  construction sites directly from private owners to be an  encouraging economic indicator. Data on state properties and  those whose ownership needs to be juridically determined are  still missing. With title deeds of so much land still  uncertain, construction firms are hard pressed to find  economically viable projects. A number of real estate companies  have been opened in Tirana to assist investors in finding sites  to establish their businesses. The companies assist with sales,  purchases, and rentals of real estate. (Tirana ATA in English  1201 GMT 30 Apr 94)    ASSISTANCE FOR MEDICAL SERVICE: The Dorkas Association,  which  has been working in Korce district for two and a half years,  hopes to assist 185 medical centers in Korce, Pogradec, Kolonje,  and Devoll through its project.

The first contingents of aid  reached Korce recently, thus marking the first stage of the  project. During this stage, a new medical center of European  standards will be built in Pojan in Korce. The project is being  financed by the Belgian Government through Dorkas and will be  carried out in cooperation with the Albanian Ministry of Health  and Environmental Protection. (Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 2  May 94)    BANK'S OPERATIONS: The Fier Commerce Bank last year provided  credits to buy 170 autotractors of different types, without  including here the agriculture machinery that was provided by  the Aggro Commerce Bank. Kastriot Orizaj, the Fier Bank  director, told an ATA correspondent that "the bank carries out  2,000-3,000 operations a day worth 30-40 million leks, which  ranks this bank as one of the most powerful in Albania." During  last year, the bank realized a profit of 32.8 million leks.  (Tirana ATA in English 1004 GMT 3 May 94)    PRIVATIZATION IN KUKES: Out of 120 trade units, only 46 so  far are considered to be privatized in Kukes district. The  units, which are not privatized yet, have been forcibly occupied  by the former land owners, who are using them without being  registered in the tax office. The storehouses of the state  trade enterprise, worth 1.1 million leks, are not yet  privatized, although all the necessary documents are ready. No  one dares to buy them because they fear a possible conflict with  the former land owners. (Tirana ATA in English 1006 GMT 3 May  94)    PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS: The number of workers employed in  the private sector is increasing in Tropoje. Some 1,732 workers  are actually working in the private sector, with some 40 percent  employed in trade activity, 20 percent in artisanship, 10  percent in construction, etc. Din Prengizi, chairman of the  district tax office, told ATA that salaries in the private  sector are higher than those given by the state.

During the first three months  of 1994, the amount cashed by units was 20 percent higher.  (Tirana ATA in English 1014 GMT 9 May 94)    TIRANA-DURRES HIGHWAY WORK: Construction work on the first  Tirana-Durres highway began on 9 May. The government has  invested $4,250,000 for its first 5 km. The construction work  will be carried out by an Italian-Albanian joint venture called  Euroteorema-Peqin. Attending the inauguration ceremony was  Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, who laid the corner stone.  Ministers, local government officials, World Bank  representatives, and Italian Ambassador Paolo Foresti were also  present. The first 5 km will be finished within five months, at  which time other investors will provide for further construction  of the highway. (Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 10 May 94)    PLANT TO CLOSE: The Agency for the Restructuring of  Enterprises is going to initiate procedures to close down the  Nickel-Cobalt Plant in Elbasan. Albanian and World Bank  specialists have reached the conclusion that the plant is  inefficient, with no possibility of being restructured in the  future. In its 4 May meeting, the government granted permission  to start the procedures. The Nickel- Cobalt Plant, known as the  12th plant of the Steelworks Combine in Elbasan, has  continuously been inefficient and has had many problems since  its inauguration in 1979, which was clamorously appraised by the  propaganda of the time. Specialists say that its technological  byproducts have always been dangerous for the workers' health  and that its products were of low quality. The state has made  annual investments in the plant ranging from 20-70 million leks.  The plant interrupted its production only at the end of 1990  when the state did not subsidize it and when its efficiency  faced the market economy. A negative consequence of the plant's  work has been the environmental pollution caused by failures in  the dust purification system and the leakage of poisonous  liquids and gas. The smog created by the plant polluted the  environment of Elbasan city and the Shkumbini River, which  sometimes pushed the polluted water above the set norms. A  group of Chinese specialists offered to help rebuild the plant,  but an agreement was not reached because of its non-profitable  nature. (Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 10 May 94)    TELECOM AFFILIATE RESTRUCTURING: Sokol Zotaj, acting  director of the Tirana Telecom affiliate, told ATA that the  restructuring of the Telecom affiliate in Tirana will consist in  purchasing and operating computers, computerizing the process of  preparing the bills, and changing the practice of sending  invoices to telephone subscribers from the telephone paying  offices to their homes. The new organization is expected to be  able to solve the conflicts created between the Tirana affiliate  and telephone subscribers, which have sometimes been sent to  court. Subscribers do not pay their bills because they say the  number of impulses has been manipulated. There are two  alternatives that cannot be sorted out until everything is  computerized, as there is a possibility of tapping onto others'  telephone lines or irregularities in defining the number of  impulses by Telecom. (Tirana ATA in English 1027 GMT 10 May 94)    BANK DEPOSITS: Artan Santo, deputy general director of the  Savings Bank, told ATA that deposits by Albanians amount to 13  billion leks since 1991. In 1991, deposits were 3.4 billion  leks, while in 1992 they amounted to 5.6 billion leks. Although  interest rates have been reduced from 33 to 24 percent, the  number of depositors has been on the rise. Their number has now  reached 600,000 people. In order to create facilities for  depositing money, the Savings Bank plans to open 10 service  centers in June. Installed mainly at customs points in Albania,  the centers will also exchange other currencies. (Tirana ATA in  English 1207 GMT 10 May 94)    TELECOM PLAN: Sokol Zotaj, director of the Tirana affiliate  of Telecom, states that "Telecom is now getting down to  business." Zotaj pointed out that by installing new phone  numbers, priority will be attached to businessmen, officials,  sick people, and former political persecutees. Based on a  master plan that was prepared in early 1993, it is expected that  there will be 12,000 phone numbers in 1996 and 33,000 in 2002.  A commission with representatives from the Tirana affiliate and  the Tirana municipality has been established because the  affiliate is not able to meet all the citizens' demands for  phone numbers. (Tirana ATA in English 1010 GMT 11 May 94)    LICENSES: According to the General Department of Minerals,  very few companies so far have requested a license to use  mineral resources. Meanwhile, there are several construction  companies which, together with Italian partners, have set up  equipment for producing inert materials. The law that was  approved two months ago regards these materials as mineral  resources, so those who do not have a license are obliged to pay  a fine that varies from $3,500- 350,000 in conformity with the  law. The construction companies have claimed that they are  still "in the phase of preparing documents." (Tirana ATA in  English 1012 GMT 11 May)    AIRLINE PLANS START: Arberia Airways, an airline company  founded in December 1992, based in Tirana, and with an initial  capital worth $1.5 million, is now ready to start flights from  Tirana to Zurich, Geneva, Brussels, Hamburg, Dusseldorf, and  Skopje, RILINDJA writes, citing a statement by Selaudin Sinani,  the company's director. Some 40 tourist agencies that operate  in Albania signed contracts for cooperation with Arberia Airways  at the Makedonia Hotel in Tetova, having at the same time the  opportunity to buy shares in the company. Another meeting to  sign contracts was held in Germany and Switzerland one week ago,  in which the participants agreed to cooperate. Besides Albanian  Airlines, a joint venture with Austrian capital and Ada Air, a  private company with French capital, Arberia Airways is the  third company set up in Albania after the overthrow of the  communist regime. (Tirana ATA in English 1030 GMT 13 May 94)    PLANT CLOSES: The Albanian Government recently authorized  the  Agency for Restructuring of Enterprises to close down the Soda  Plant in Vlore. Its production was suspended three years ago  due to a serious situation in the plant. The studies by the  World Bank and the Institute of Studies and Projects of Chemical  Technology in Tirana confirm that the plant has turned out to be  ineffective and with no possibility for restructuring. During  the last three years, the plant has recorded losses amounting to  millions of leks. The Soda Plant was built in 1967 and its  technology is Chinese. The plant was becoming a source of  pollution for the environment of the Vlore coastal area, which  is ranked as one of the best tourist locations in Albania.  (Tirana ATA in English 1204 GMT 13 May 94)    FUNDS FOR MEDICINE, EDUCATION: Kudret Shalesi, chairman of  the Tirana District Council, informed ATA that this year the  council will receive funds from the state budget worth  277,295,000 leks. The main part of the funds, some 172,705,000  and 50,411,000 leks, will be granted to the medical and  educational sectors respectively. Construction, trade, and  agriculture will be granted increase, too. The education budget  for the whole district will be 22 times higher compared to a  year ago. The rise will mean an increase in teachers' salaries.  At the same time, the expenses for the medical service will be  45 times higher compared to last year. The council has set up  another fund for the cultural sector, amounting to 870,000 leks.  The funds for the Construction Ministry will be mainly used for  cleaning, greening, maintenance of roads, drainage, and public  fountains. The council has also foreseen a rise in funds for  fisheries. (Tirana ATA in English 1010 GMT 14 May 94)    LICENSES FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS: The leading board of the  Albanian National Bank approved new procedures to issue licenses  to open commercial banks, which will include private banks with  local and foreign capital, joint capital, and shareholding  banks. The package of new regulations, which has been compiled  by Albanian bankers in cooperation with foreign experts,  complies with the key monetary principles in the present banking  world. One of the fundamental requests for issuing the license  is the existence of an initial minimum capital of $500,000. Also  required for the license is the governing capability of bank  initiators -- so that at least one of its main leaders has  long-term banking experience and a good reputation -- as well as  the introduction of a reliable business plan. (Tirana ATA in  English 1030 GMT 14 May 94)    SHKODER AQUEDUCT: From this year's budget, the government  has  allocated $127,000 to restructure the Shkoder aqueduct. That  will considerably improve the situation in the existing network  of aqueducts so as to ensure greater supplies of drinking water  to Shkoder inhabitants. The Projects Institute in Tirana will  draft the restructuring project. Then a tender will be conducted  to select the winner for the restructuring. All rehabilitation  work is envisaged to be over in 1994.

Muca states that after  the construction of the complex, the Islamic associations will  invest money for new teachers at the monastery and for those  from remote areas of Bulqize to be accommodated in dormitories.  (Tirana ATA in English 1013 GMT 16 May 94)    FOUNDATION ASSISTS FARMERS: Recently, the Albiran Foundation  brought to Albania 25 75-horsepower tractors and other  agricultural equipment, worth $1 million. Albanian  Radio-Television cited the foundation managers as saying that  the creation of the agricultural equipment base has a human  character because, with the tractors, the farmers will carry out  agricultural services at lower tariffs than those carried out by  private tractor drivers. They also said that during September,  the Albiran Foundation will invest another $1 million to improve  the irrigation system in the Vore region, near Tirana. They  will establish an agricultural repair shop and training center.  This is the second project carried out by the Albiran  Foundation in Albania, following one in the medical sector,  which started several months ago in Tirana.

Franco Busi,  president of the Busi Group, the main investing partner, said  that "in the annual meeting of the company council in Atlanta,  scheduled for 25 May this year, I will have the pleasure to  report that this giant has started work in Albania, too. I am  at an age to know what revival means, and at present, Albania is  at a stage in its revival."

Production of Fanta  and Sprite will start later. (Tirana ATA in English 1819 GMT 19  May 94)    ALBKROM VENTURE WITH GERMANS: The decision that the Albkrom  Managing Board made recently once again testified to the  priority of German investments in Albania. Out of four foreign  companies, the Albkrom Corporation chose the German group BSE to  continue final negotiations for the establishment of a joint  venture. The selection was based on a cooperation platform, the  estimation of Albkrom resources, and the investments the German  group offered. The latter drafted a plan for modernizing the  Bulqize Mine, as well as six other ambitious projects to invest  in Albania. The spokesman of the Ministry of Energy and Mining  Resources said that the German group will continue negotiations  with Albkrom for a period of four weeks, before signing a  contract.

(Tirana  ATA in English 1212 GMT 23 May 94)    PRICE INDEX: Recent data from the Statistics Institute  confirms that the retail price index amounted to 113.8 percent  as against December 1993. Compared to March 1994, in April the  index had a 9-percent increase. Compared to the same period  last year, the rise is 32.8 percent. Such an increase was  expected not only due to a price rise in retail goods, such as  kerosene, electricity, and telephone tariffs, but also to a  price rise in fruit.

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> EXPLODING PROSPECT GOT QUICK CURE  </P> <P> Should Exploding Prospect win the $200,000 San Fernando Stakes Sunday at Santa  Anita, give an assist to Dr. Ed Hill.  </P> <P> Hampered by shin problems off and on since he arrived at trainer Vladimir  Cerin's barn in November, 1988, Exploding Prospect came up with some tenderness  in his left foreleg after his second victory last fall at Oak Tree.  </P> <P> Enter Hill, a Chino acupuncturist. A few minutes and one well-placed needle in  an ear later, Exploding Prospect's shin woes were over.  </P> <P> "He seemed to contribute in correcting this problem in about five minutes,"  Cerin said. "We haven't had a problem since. I've used acupuncture before, but  never with any kind of success.  </P> <P> "There's never been this dramatic a result. It was only one treatment and it  just seemed to hold. I found it best sometimes not to try and understand those  things, just accept them.  </P> <P> "I contacted Dr. Hill because I'm a little hesitant to start injecting to kill  the pain. I wanted to see if we could get rid of the cause rather than only the  symptoms. This horse hasn't had a vet bill in two months."  </P> <P> Although it took the son of Miswaki awhile to make it to the races, Exploding  Prospect has made the most of his opportunities.  </P> <P> After finishing a troubled fourth in his debut Oct. 5, the 4-year-old has  strung together three consecutive victories. He easily disposed of maidens in  his second start, then handled winners and two turns in his next appearance,  going a mile.  </P> <P> Moving to Hollywood Park, Irving and Marge Cowan's colt went virtually wire to  wire in the Affirmed Handicap, outrunning Splurger, Flying Continental and  others. In doing so, he also gave Cerin his biggest victory.  </P> <P> Hoping to make it four consecutive wins, Exploding Prospect is facing his  stiffest challenge in the San Fernando, the middle leg of the Charles H. Strub  Series.  </P> <P> He will be traveling a mile and an eighth for the first time and the field  includes Malibu Stakes winner and probable favorite Music Merci, Malibu  runner-up Exemplary Leader, Opening Verse, the unluckiest horse of the meeting,  Splurger and Flying Continental.  </P> <P> Impressed with Exploding Prospect from the moment he set eyes on him, Cerin is  hopeful heading into the San Fernando.  </P> <P> "He seems to have improved since his last race," said Cerin, who boasts some  quality in his stable of 12. Besides Exploding Prospect, he also trains  Hollywood Reporter, who upset Music Merci in a division of the Spotlight  Handicap last spring, the hard-knocking Lady Brunicardi and the stakes-placed  Yes I'm Blue.  </P> <P> "He's trained superbly and he's done everything we've asked him to do and  probably just a little better than anticipated," Cerin said. "We've tried to  get him to rate (run slightly off the pace) a little bit and we seem to have  accomplished that as well."  </P> <P> With Exploding Prospect having won twice at a mile, Cerin wasn't eager to  shorten him up. Hence, the decision to skip the seven-furlong Malibu.  </P> <P> "I feel like it would have been counter-productive to do that and put speed  back into him," he said. "Our goal is to win 10-furlong races with him.  </P> <P> "I think a mile and a quarter's within his reach. I hope I'm right and I hope  we'll have the opportunity to find out."  </P> <P> Such a chance will be available Feb. 4 in the Strub Stakes. Whether Exploding  Prospect returns in the $500,000 Grade I depends on what happens Sunday.  </P> <P> "Winning is so difficult to predict," Cerin said. "They say there's only one  way to win a race and many ways to lose. If he comes up with a tremendous  effort, that would help earn him a spot in the Strub. Winning would make it a  lot sweeter. I know he's in great shape. He's beaten some of the entrants and  hopefully he can beat the rest.  </P> <P> "I'd rather (he) not have the lead. He doesn't need the lead, but if they go  very slowly, he'll take it. I believe he's good enough where he can dictate the  pace in the race by sitting second or third."  </P> <P> With Laffit Pincay, who rode Exploding Prospect in the Affirmed, staying on  Music Merci and Gary Stevens, who was aboard for his first two wins, sticking  with Splurger, Pat Valenzuela has the mount Sunday.  </P> <P> Valenzuela hasn't worked Exploding Prospect but the trainer doesn't consider  that a minus.  </P> <P> "I have tremendous faith in my exercise rider, Jesse Marquez," Cerin said. "So  long as the jockey has confidence in me and my ability, I feel that he'll  follow my instructions and Patrick does have confidence in me."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Others entered in the San Fernando, which has been demoted to a Grade II stake,  were Raise A Stanza, who is also entered in the San Carlos Handicap today,  River Master, Live The Dream, Crown Collection and Secret Slew, who will be  ridden by Bill Shoemaker. After the San Fernando, Shoemaker will fly to Bay  Meadows and make his final appearance there Monday. . . . After drawing the  rail in his last two starts, Olympic Prospect drew the outside for the  seven-furlong San Carlos. His main rivals in the $110,500 race are Tanker Port,  who is unbeaten in four starts on the dirt, Oraibi and Candi's Gold.  </P> <P> An off track is a possibility for the San Fernando, but it doesn't worry  Vladimir Cerin. "I have no reason to believe Exploding Prospect won't handle  mud," he said. "A good horse should handle any surface." . . . The California  Thoroughbred Breeders' Assn. will hold its California Winter Mixed Sale Monday  and Tuesday at Del Mar.  </P> <P> Hawkster, nominated for the Strub, worked seven furlongs on the turf in 1:26  3/5 for trainer Ron McAnally. Preparing for a possible return late next month,  Magical Mile went half a mile in :51 4/5. . . . The William P. Kyne Handicap  will be simulcast locally from Bay Meadows after Santa Anita's ninth race. The  Kyne, which figures to be run over a muddy track, drew 11 entrants, including  Happy Toss, Honor Medal, Variety Road and No Marker.  </P></p>

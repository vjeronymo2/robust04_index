			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERMAN SEEKS $272,000 FOR LAKE RESTORATION  </P> <P> Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) asked a key House subcommittee on  Wednesday to earmark $272,000 for restoration of a lake and recreational  facilities at Hansen Dam in the northeastern San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "There is a great demand for recreational facilities in the San Fernando  Valley," Berman told the House Appropriations Committee's energy and water  development subcommittee.  </P> <P> "We need to provide a safe alternative to the streets for city youth."  </P> <P> The money is set aside in a 4-year-old federal trust fund generated by the fees  paid by Bill Blomgren, a contractor who is digging silt from flood control  channels. Blomgren, who sells the silt to construction firms, pays 15 cents to  25 cents into the fund for each ton removed.  </P> <P> The $272,000 represents $167,000 expected to accrue from the silt dredging this  year and $105,000 from the trust fund appropriated by Congress last year but  returned to the Treasury under across-the-board budget cuts imposed by the  Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.  </P> <P> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the 1,540-acre dam area, is  completing a master plan and environmental impact statement for revitalization  of the long-neglected lake property, which straddles Pacoima and Lake View  Terrace. Berman also requested that the House subcommittee specifically direct  the Army Corps to continue the dredging operation and commit all appropriated  federal funds to complete the long-anticipated restoration.  </P></p>

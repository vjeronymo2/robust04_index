			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Markets await German ruling INTERNATIONAL foreign exchange markets held steady yesterday in spite of a rate cut by the Danish national bank as dealers looked towards today's all important German ruling on Maastricht and its implications for European currency union, writes Peter John. The day began with a sharp mark-down of the US dollar, continuing Friday's trend on the back of disappointing employment statistics and the expectation that those figures have set the agenda for the next few weeks. The US markets were operating at reduced capacity because of Columbus day celebrations and a public holiday in Japan. Consequently, the dollar lacked support and slipped in very thin trading, to be quoted at well below DM1.60 in early European dealing. However, it rose steadily throughout the day as technical positions were adjusted and by the close it was up at DM1.6040, unchanged on Friday's weak close. This was less a justification of the US currency's fundamental value than a refocus on today's judgment by the German constitutional court on the validity of the Maastricht Treaty on European union. If the court votes against the Treaty there could be catastrophic consequences for a number of leading European currencies. It is more likely that the court will produce a verdict that agrees with Maastricht but imposes conditions. In any event, the D-Mark is likely to be the main gainer and the currency was firmer against a range of European currencies. Meanwhile, sterling was generally weaker after indications in the latest producer prices statistics that some inflationary pressures might be returning. It closed at DM2.4550 against the D-Mark, down from DM2.4650. Several economists were taking a very cautious line on inflation yesterday and cracks were beginning to show in the rate-cut-by-November argument. Much depends on the outcome of tomorrow's Retail Prices Index figure, particularly the figure for underlying inflation which excludes the impact of mortgage interest payments. Meanwhile, the Danish Krone held steady as the central bank cut its key CD interest rate by half a percentage point to 8.5 per cents. However, economists said any hope that this signalled a return of generally lower interest rates in Europe was misplaced. Danish rates were around 11 per cent after the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism broke in early August and were merely returning to conventional levels. The Greek drachma came under pressure in early trading after the Socialist victory in Sunday's election. The Drachma opened at Dr146.50 against the D-Mark in light trading down from Friday's fixing at Dr145.48 but by the close in London dealers were quoting it at Dr144.75.</p>

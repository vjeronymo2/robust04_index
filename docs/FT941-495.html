			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Major told to resign by Euro-sceptic Tory Backbench Conservative anger over Mr John Major's handling of the European enlargement crisis exploded in the Commons yesterday as Mr Tony Marlow, a long-standing Euro-sceptic, demanded the prime minister's resignation. As glum Tory MPs digested the compromise, Mr Marlow told Mr Major: 'No objective observer believes this so-called compromise has achieved anything of real value to the UK. As of now, you have no authority, credibility or identifiable policy in this vital area. Why don't you stand aside and make way for somebody else?' Mr Major snapped back: 'Anybody listening to what you have had to say . . . would in no sense suggest that you were an objective observer of any matters relating to the Community. It might be a useful novelty if from time to time you were prepared to support the government you were elected to support.' The exchanges reflected bitterness among Euro-sceptic MPs, many of whom believe that the prime minister failed to deliver the strong defence of Britain's interests that he promised last week. Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, said the agreement was 'sad and humiliating', and warned that it would be opposed by some Conservative MPs when it comes before the Commons later this year. Mr Nicholas Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South West, said people would one day tell the government: 'You must say no, and mean it.' Some rightwingers endorsed Mr Marlow's outburst, claiming that many MPs would like to see Mr Major replaced. But others said that was likely to prove counter-productive. Mr Terry Dicks, MP for Hayes and Harlington, said Mr Marlow 'has not got the nous to realise that he did the Euro-sceptics' cause more harm than any 40 speeches by Mr Major'. The enlargement compromise was welcomed by many Conservatives as the best available deal. Mr Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said the government would have the support of the vast majority of Conservative MPs. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the agreement was 'a humiliating climbdown following an unnecessary conflict'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'The government has made a fool of Britain in Europe; the cabinet has made a fool of the foreign secretary, and the prime minister has made rather a fool of himself.'</p>

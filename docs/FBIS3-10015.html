An AP dispatch  reported that according to UN officials the main topics to be  discussed will be human rights and the end of hostilities. A UN  statement said UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali set the  dates for the next meeting after consulting with the Guatemalan  government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity  (URNG) guerrillas.    On 14 February, a Guatemalan Government official said the  negotiations between the government and the leftist guerrillas  could produce a peace agreement by the end of the year. Three  years of negotiations for peace in Guatemala have yielded  limited results so far. Of an 11-point plan prepared in 1991,  only partial results have been achieved on one subject: the  country's democratization. The next round of talks will center  on the human rights issue and the end of hostilities, according  to the sources.    The guerrilla war in Guatemala has already lasted 34 years  and claimed 130,000 lives. The debate about the creation of a  commission for investigating violations of human rights has been  a serious obstacle in previous negotiation efforts.</p>

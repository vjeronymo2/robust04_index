			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOREST SERVICE MAY BILL MARINES FOR BRUSH FIRE  </P> <P> The U. S. Forest Service will consider billing the Marine Corps for the  $2-million cost of fighting a brush fire last year that was caused by a Camp  Pendleton platoon.  </P> <P> Forest Service Special Agent Tom LaNier said Monday that the service's legal  office in San Francisco will review the Marine Corps' investigative report and  determine whether to hold the corps financially liable for the 10,000-acre  blaze.  </P> <P> He said the review will also enable the agency to decide whether two Marines  involved in the incident should face penalties.  </P> <P> "I'm requesting a copy of the (investigative) report to see if there was gross  negligence or what did go on," LaNier said.  </P> <P> The investigation, finished in November but released last week, concluded that  the Oct. 18 fire, which took about 900 firefighters five days to contain, was  caused by the "unlawful use of pyrotechnics."  </P> <P> The report says that 1st Lt. Joseph Shannon took a 10-man platoon and a  canister of flares and smoke grenades into the firing range for a training  exercise and allowed the devices to be discharged in an area that was  restricted because of high fire danger.  </P> <P> The incendiary devices started two quick-spreading fires that eventually burned  parts of San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> The report says Shannon received a military violation notice for improperly  firing the pyrotechnics, failing to maintain communication with the firing  range control officer and not reporting that a Marine suffered smoke  inhalation.  </P> <P> Another Marine, Staff Sgt. John Cadigan, who gave Shannon the devices and asked  him to dispose of them, received a warning, according to the report.  </P> <P> LaNier said the Forest Service was unaware until last week that the Marine  Corps had investigated the fire, although Camp Pendleton officials acknowledged  from the beginning that Marines had started it.  </P> <P> "They were up-front; it was military maneuvers," LaNier said. However, the  report raises questions about whether the fire was caused during normal  activities, he said.  </P> <P> "If there is a chance they were outside the scope of normal maneuvers. . . . we  will try to go after the military or potentially the individuals," he said.  </P> <P> He said he expects the Forest Service's legal office to complete its review in  30 to 60 days.  </P></p>

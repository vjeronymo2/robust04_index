			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Max Weber Max Weber (1864-1920) is often portrayed by enlightened modern executives and organisational thinkers as a villain of equivalent rank to Frederick Taylor, father of the now discredited 'scientific' school of management. That reputation is only half-deserved. Weber, a German lawyer turned sociologist, provided the theoretical underpinning for Taylor's much more practical influence by arguing that the most efficient form of organisation resembled a machine: a bureaucracy replete with hierarchy, rules and controls. He distinguished this 'rational-legal' model of organisation, as he called it, from 'charismatic' (leader-dominated) and 'traditional' ones (those driven by custom and practice). In their best-seller In Search of Excellence, Tom Peters and Robert Waterman took the 'villain' view, in tone as much as content. They reported that Weber 'pooh-poohed charismatic leadership and doted on bureaucracy'. And they blamed him for arguing, as they put it, that 'its rule-driven, impersonal form . . . was the only way to ensure long-term survival'. Together Weber and Taylor propounded the idea that the best form of organisation was an inward-looking, 'closed' system peopled by rational actors. The 'rational actor' part of the proposition was soon thrown out as unrealistic by the likes of Elton Mayo and Chester Barnard, who saw managers as messy, very 'social' actors. But the closed-system doctrine held sway for decades. Only from about 1970 did theory finally catch up with reality, combining an open systems view of organisations with the 'social actor' view. Hence today's fashion for the idea that managers and organisations must both undertake lifelong learning. Weber only half-deserves his modern reputation for two reasons. First, it is never fair to judge with too much hindsight - at the time, his thinking seemed quite reasonable. Second, he was less oppressive than most people realise. He made a relatively enlightened distinction (for his day and background) between power and authority. Power, he said, was the ability to force people to obey, regardless of their level of resistance. Under authority, however, orders were obeyed voluntarily. The inadequate exercise of authority in most bureaucracies disturbed Weber; he saw the excessive wielding of power as a threat to human freedom and democratic values. He warned that bureaucracy could turn into an iron cage. He even wrote 'this passion for bureaucracy is driving me to despair'. Yet Weber's influence has perpetuated the dangerous metaphor of organisations as machine bureaucracies, rather than adaptive organisms. As the strategy and organisation expert Henry Mintzberg argues, machine structures can only work well so long as a set of simple, repetitive tasks need to be performed consistently. When tasks grow more complex and change, the machine's regulated efficiency impairs the organisation's effectiveness, impeding creativity and motivation. In today's world, that is a pretty lethal combination.</p>

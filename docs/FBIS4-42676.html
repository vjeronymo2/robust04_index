			<p>BFN     [Text] While the total popular support behind the ruling  coalition parties, the True Path Party (DYP) and the Social  Democrat People's Party (SHP), was 35 percent during the local  elections which were held two months ago, it has become apparent  that currently only 17.4 percent of the people are happy with  the performance of the DYP-SHP coalition government.    A public poll conducted by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS among  2,184  people in city squares of Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya and  Bursa according to random sampling showed that 79.4 percent of  the people are not pleased with the Tansu Ciller government;  however, they are undecided about President Suleyman Demirel's  interventions. While 51.6 percent of the interviewed said they  agreed with the criticisms which Demirel directed against Ciller  and the government, 51.8 percent said they did not think it  necessary for Demirel to be a more active president. One of the  interviewed citizens expressed his view by saying: "Demirel's  statements are correct. However, if he knew everything that  well, why did he give up the office of prime minister then?"  <H5>  Questions-Answers </H5>   Four separate questions which can be answered either "yes"  or  "no" were asked of 2,184 people who are eligible voters and who  were selected at random in five metropolitan cities. The  questions asked and the replies received are as follows:    Question 1: Does Demirel remain within the limits of the  Constitution as he fulfills his presidential duties? Yes--941  (43.1 percent), No--1121 (51.3 percent), No comment--122 (5.6  percent).    Question 2: Do you agree with the criticisms which Demirel  directs against Ciller and her Cabinet as president? Yes--1124  (51.5 percent), No--981 (44.9 percent), No comment--79 (3.6).    Question 3: Do you think it is necessary for Demirel to be a  more active president under these conditions?    Yes--960 (43.9 percent), No--1131 (51.8 percent), No  comment--93 (4.6 percent).    Question 4: Are you pleased with the performance which the  DYP-SHP coalition government has shown under Tansu Ciller's  leadership?    Yes--380 (17.4 percent), No--1734 (79.4 percent), No  comment--70 (3.2 percent).    The following are some of the interesting reasons which some  citizens gave for their answers:    "Demirel is not sincere when he criticizes Tansu Ciller,  whom  he introduces as `his daughter.'"    "It is enough if Demirel is just active on the secularism  issue."    "The DYP-SHP coalition under Demirel's leadership was  better." "Ciller acts her own way no matter how much Demirel  criticizes her."    "They all look alike, God damn it." "It is Demirel who is  responsible for all that has happened because it was he who  introduced Mrs. Ciller."    "All that Demirel has said is correct. Well, if he knew that  much, why did he quit his post as prime minister then?" "Demirel  is justified in his criticisms, but a president should not  interfere in everything."    "Demirel is now doing everything that he criticized the late  President Turgut Ozal for."    "With the exception of terrorism, the Ciller government has  not been successful in any issue."</p>

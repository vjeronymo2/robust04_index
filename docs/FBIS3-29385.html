Hosokawa said the five are Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii,  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, International Trade and Industry  Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Posts and Telecommunication Minister  Takenori Kanzaki and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    Two deputy chief cabinet secretaries, Yukio Hatoyama and  Nobuo Ishihara, will also become members of the cabinet-level  forum, Hosokawa said.    The forum will hammer out a package of market-opening  measures which will include ways to promote deregulation,  imports and investments. It will also include measures to  tighten antitrust policies and improve government procurement  procedures, government sources said.    Asked by reporters when the task force will reach a final  conclusion on the package, Hosokawa said "I still do not know."    Hosokawa denied that he himself will ask U.S. President Bill  Clinton by letter or telephone not to take punitive actions  against Japan.    Clinton and Hosokawa, who met in Washington last weekend,  failed to reach an accord over the trade framework.    The president said Wednesday he expects to have policy  recommendations drawn up in the next few days to slash Japan's  vast trade surplus with the U.S. totaling 50 billion dollars  annually.</p>

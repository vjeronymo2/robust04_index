			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By An Hui-chang from the "News Behind the News" column] </F>   [Text] With the people's criticism of the government's  diplomatic policy regarding the North Korean nuclear issue which  has been in a state of confusion, the National Unification Board  [NUB] expressed strong displeasure over the remarks of Vice  Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong suggesting withdrawal of the  condition for an "envoy exchange first."    In a regular Monday morning meeting on 4 April, Yi Yong-tok,  deputy prime minister and minister of the NUB, said: While the  government has coped effectively with the North Korean issue  ever since it declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty by relegating work to each relevant  office, people with less training have erred.    Thus, he expressed his displeasure as head of the diplomatic  and security team.    Concerning the phrase "people with less training" mentioned  by Deputy Prime Minister Yi, a relevant official at the NUB said  that this phrase refers to Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK Ambassador to  the PRC, who invoked public criticism for raising the "untimely  theory of attaching importance to China," and to Vice Foreign  Minister Hong, who revealed a readiness to "withdraw" the  condition of "envoy exchange first" during a recent debate with  National Assemblymen.</p>

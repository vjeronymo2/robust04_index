			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Political fog descends on the last primary rites: The uncertainties that lie beyond inevitable wins for George Bush and Bill Clinton THIS is not the first time that California has held a presidential primary too late to make a difference. But it may be unprecedented that the largest state of the union, the seventh (Ohio), the ninth (New Jersey), and three others (Alabama, Montana and New Mexico) should go through their quadrennial political rites today and attract such little attention. There are two obvious reasons for this state of affairs. The first is that Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman set to run as an independent, is on none of the ballots and his growing legion of supporters will have difficulty registering their preference by writing in his name or voting for uncommitted slates of delegates. The second is that President George Bush and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton are assured of the Republican and Democratic parties' nominations respectively. Mr Bush has been over the top in the delegate count for a month, and it is inconceivable that Mr Clinton will not get the roughly 150 more delegates he needs out of the 700 to be awarded today. There is interest, of course, in the contest in California between Mr Clinton and Mr Jerry Brown, the former California governor. While his campaign briefly flourished in the spring Mr Brown was the favourite out west, but most local polls now give Mr Clinton the edge, although not by much. The polls also report that Mr Perot would carry California easily if the presidential election were held now. Although write-in votes for him in California today will not be counted because he is not a certified candidate, his supporters could send their message by voting for Mr Brown in the Democratic race or the conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan in the Republican contest. A loss for Mr Clinton would not be fatal, but it would not help at a time when his campaign is struggling to be heard. Both Mr Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980 and Mr Walter Mondale in 1984 lost the California primary - to Mr Brown, Mr Edward Kennedy and Mr Gary Hart in turn - but went on to win the nomination. Mr Clinton must hope that the first of these precedents, in which Mr Carter went on to the presidency, and not the last two, holds good. Mr Bush's big concern is that his popularity in California, a Republican stronghold in recent presidential elections, has slipped so alarmingly. The state's lagging economy is obviously a factor, an issue he sought to address in his weekend campaign swing. Fewer pitfalls appear to await the two party frontrunners in Ohio and New Jersey, where neither Mr Bush nor Mr Clinton has appeared much - the same goes for Mr Brown and Mr Buchanan. This is an unusual circumstance for both states, especially Ohio. Outside the presidential arena most interest centres on the two California races for the US Senate - one for the remaining two years of the term vacated by Republican Pete Wilson when he became the state's governor and the other for the full six-year term to succeed Democratic Alan Cranston, who is retiring. There is a good chance that two women will win the Democratic primaries. Mrs Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco who ran Mr Wilson close in the 1990 governor's contest, is the favourite today - as she is to defeat in November Mr John Seymour, the Republican who was appointed to replace Mr Wilson. Ms Barbara Boxer, the feminist congresswoman, faces a tougher contest against Lieutenant Governor Leo McCarthy, the establishment moderate insider, and Congressman Mel Levine, the Los Angeles liberal whose campaign has taken on a sharp law-and-order theme after the city's riots. Success for Mrs Feinstein and Ms Boxer would be seen as confirming the growth of women's political power. The congressional candidacy of Ms Jane Harman in the Los Angeles suburbs is being watched for the same reason. Should she win the Democratic primary, she might find herself in November up against Ms Maureen Reagan, the former president's daughter and favourite for the Republican nomination in the district. Republican Senate fights in California once again pit southern arch-conservatives against northern moderates. Mr Seymour will probably beat Mr William Dannemayer, one of the most reactionary members of Congress, but the contest between Congressman Tom Campbell and Mr Bruce Herschensohn, an outspoken Los Angeles TV commentator, is closer. In both races abortion has become a dominant issue. Victories for Mr Seymour and Mr Campbell, both, like Governor Wilson, in favour of choice in reproductive matters, might suggest that Mr Bush's determination to keep the Republicans on an anti-abortion tack is out of tune with majority opinion in his party. Typically, California also had a fistful of referenda on issues which may have wider ramifications. Perhaps the most controversial is the 'Buy America' initiative on the Los Angeles ballot, which would amend the city charter to give procurement preference to California contractors. Its opponents believe this would deter the foreign investment sought by Mr Peter Ueberroth, who is in charge of reconstruction for riot-ravaged Los Angeles. However, one poll says the amendment will pass. Elsewhere in the country most interest focuses on the performance of incumbent members of congress, increasingly seen as an endangered species. Typical is the Ohio case of Ms Rose Mary Oakar, whose bid for a ninth term is clouded by the fact that she overdrew her account on the House of Representatives bank more than 200 times. But nothing in the internal political woodwork of the six states voting today can disguise the fact that, for the moment, the minds of the voters are looking ahead to November and into a political fog more impenetrable than anything which regularly descends on San Francisco.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "They Flew Like Birds"] </F>   [Text] General Vogelman, commander of the U.S. Air Force,  recently visited Tver. Previously the general had been received  by military aviators in Pskov, Ivanovo, and the Moscow region,  where the guests were acquainted with our defense equipment  since they want to cooperate for the sake of peace.    Tver aviators also saw a thing or two in their country when  they flew U.S. military aircraft a year ago. During the return  visit the U.S. air aces put our MiG's and Su's "through their  paces" -- and they flew like birds.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Peng Peiyun, state councillor and minister of  the State Family Planning Commission, concluded her sixth  inspection tour of Fujian and left Fuzhou last evening. During  her stay, she held extensive discussions with leaders of the  departments concerned, listened to reports on Fujian's economic  development plan, family planning, health, and women work, and  affirmed the achievements scored in these fields. At the same  time, she set new demands.    Peng Peiyun emphatically pointed out: Family planning work  is an arduous and long-term task, which should be carried out in  a conscientious, sustained, and down-to-earth way. We should  continue to do a good job of rural health work, conduct better  investigations and study, combine the "double learn from and  double emulation" activities with the work of the grass-roots  units, and turn the implementation of the outline of the program  for the Chinese children of the 1990's into government behavior.  She said: Fujian is one of the provinces that has done the  work of the grass-roots units well. It has had a successful  experience in stabilizing policies, laying a solid foundation  for the work of the grass-roots units, and managing the floating  population and the population of foreign-invested enterprises.  [passage omitted]    Peng Peiyun urged combining the "double learn from and  double  emulation" activities with family planning work; combining  production, livelihood, and child bearing; decreasing the number  of births and [words indistinct]; and making family planning  voluntary on the part of the women involved.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Since August 1993, the industrial and commercial  administration organs at all levels across the province have  actively plunged into the joint operation of antismuggling along  the 1,400 km long border. As of now, these administrative  organs have dispatched 1,272 personnel to the struggle against  smuggling and trafficking in smuggled goods. They have cracked  down on the 6,923 cases involving illegal import of cars. They  have confiscated more than 67 million yuan in goods and  collection of fines.    The industrial and commercial bureaus of various cities and  autonomous prefectures across the province have made unified  arrangements for the specific struggle against smuggling and  trafficking in smuggled goods. They have also continuously  carried out the activities of dealing blows at smuggling and  trafficking in smuggled goods by concentrating their time and  giving priority to handling key cases. The industrial and  commercial administration organs of border cities and counties,  which have coordinated with the armed police forces and public  security organs of border areas, have enhanced the supervision  and inspection over vital communications lines and passes by  assigning personnel to be on duty day and night. They have  conducted strict inspection over vehicles passing by, as well as  investigated and handled promptly the smuggling of vehicles and  goods as soon as they have been discovered.</p>

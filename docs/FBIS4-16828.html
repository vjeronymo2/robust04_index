			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Arkadiy Sidoruk] </F>   [Text] Washington April 20 TASS -- "We believe that Russia,  as co-chairman of the Madrid process, is playing a most  important role in the peace-making efforts in the Middle East  and in the endeavours to settle the Palestinian problem fairly,"  ITAR-TASS was told by assistant director of the Palestinian  centre in Washington Sa'id Hamid. "This explains the importance  of the Moscow meeting between Chairman of the PLO Executive  Committee Yasir 'Arafat and Russian President Boris Yeltsin," he  added"    The Palestinian representative said the meeting was  "exceptionally important". In his opinion, it was a logical  continuation of the consistent efforts lately exerted by the  Russian diplomacy in the Middle East. Moscow has always  expressed concern over the situation in the region and has done  its best to achieve stability there.    "We are thankful to Russia for its understanding of our  concerns and anxieties, understanding of the legality of our  rights for which we are striving. We are thankful to it for its  good offices, which it is ready to offer us," Hamid stressed.  He expressed the hope that the Russian president would use his  influence to convince Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin during the  latter's forthcoming trip to Moscow that Israel should fulfil  the terms of the agreement on the settlement principles, signed  by the PLO and Israel in Washington last September. "The  principle of Palestinian self-government will remain a dead  letter as long as the Israeli troops remain on the occupied  territories," Hamid stated.</p>

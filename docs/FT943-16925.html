			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester reopens its doors to savers Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is to reopen its doors to savers today. The decision ends a three-week period when the society stopped taking deposits after the High Court ruling which disallowed the terms of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid. The new accounts are all deposit - rather than share - accounts, meaning that investors will not become members of the society and will have no voting rights. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said it was not appropriate for new shareholders to join C&amp;G while it was still working on a revised cash payments plan in order to meet the terms of the court ruling 'as an alternative to making an appeal.' Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled that the provisions of the 1986 Building Societies Act barred the 220,000-plus C&amp;G investors who had been shareholding members of the society for less than two years from receiving cash payments. C&amp;G has not ruled out an appeal. But a decision on whether to launch an expedited appeal would have to come within 28 days of the formal court order which was made last week. C&amp;G is likely to announce its intention within the first half of this month. If the society can devise a new cash payments scheme which is lawful and looks likely to deliver the necessary high proportions of support from members, then such a course would appear preferable to risking the delay which even an expedited appeal process would mean. That is the prospect which seems to lie behind C&amp;G's ban on new members, even though those joining now would not be able to vote on the Lloyds offer in terms of the original schedule. The society closed its savings accounts because it believed that even though the court ruling would not allow new depositors to receive a windfall benefit from the Lloyds offer, some potential customers might wrongly interpret the judgment. The three new accounts - the London account, the Gold deposit account and the Tessa deposit account - offer the same rates of interest as the share accounts they replace.</p>

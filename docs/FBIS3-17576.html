Boris  Nikolayevich works every morning. He has bathed in the sea. He  has been going for walks. He has made several trips in a  helicopter, and toured the port of Tuapse, which must be  developed. The court has dried out a bit, and today he played  tennis. Inasmuch as the weather has allowed us to, we have  relaxed. Even the fact that we have simply changed scenery has  had a beneficial effect on us.    "How much can you speculate about the president's health? If  he has gone to rest in Sochi, does that mean that he must  definitely be undergoing treatment? Are there no doctors in  Moscow!? How many illnesses have people invented for the  president. But would we, his family, really have allowed Boris  Nikolayevich to work if he had been seriously ill? Are we  enemies of his health?    "I would like to tell KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA: Believe me, the  president feels absolutely normal, and there is no need to carry  on speculating about his health. You must understand that it is  easier to tolerate any lie but the one that concerns the health  of a person close to you."</p>

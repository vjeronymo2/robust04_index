			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Do It All trims for return to profits BOOTS and WH Smith, 50-50 partners in Do It All, yesterday attempted to deflate speculation about the loss-making do-it-yourself chain by announcing a development and rationalisation plan. The plan includes a roll-out of its new project-based trading concept to another 38 stores at a cost of Pounds 10m, taking the total in the new format to 82 by next autumn. Other parts of the 223-store chain will be pared back through the sale or closure of stores which are unprofitable or not amenable to conversion to the new style. Boots said yesterday the action was being taken to make Do It All cash positive in two years' time. The number of shops to be closed or sold was simply described as 'significant'. Speculation that this could mean 50 stores was dismissed as 'rumours'. On average each store employs 27 people. Do It All opened the first of the new format stores in July 1991. Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of Smith, said that, where comparisons were possible, the converted shops were showing sales 10 or 11 per cent ahead of a year ago. New product ranges were also being sold in the non-converted stores. Blanket price discounting had ceased, although low prices were still important, he added. The statement was seen by analysts as an attempt to defuse criticism at Smith's annual meeting tomorrow and Boots' interim results presentation in two weeks' time. Aside from the commitment of the extra Pounds 10m, there was little in the statement to surprise analysts. Do It All said 'the intention is to dispose of as many of these poorly performing stores as possible, closing only those which are unsaleable'. It said the market for out-of-town retail sites was recovering and Do It All was talking to several potential buyers. These are thought to include carpet, furniture and electrical retailers as well as other DIY operators. The Do It All chain was forged by the merger in 1990 of Smith's Do It All and Boots' Payless. It has been hit by tough trading conditions and a fierce price war. In Smith's annual results to the end of May, its share of the Do It All loss was Pounds 14.3m. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOTAL REPEAL OF CATASTROPHIC CARE IS SEEN  </P> <P> The No. 3 Democrat in the House predicted Tuesday that the catastrophic health  care law will be repealed because the House will not accept a pared-down  version unanimously approved by the Senate last week.  </P> <P> The Senate voted, 73 to 26, against repealing the hotly controversial law and  instead then unanimously passed a compromise plan to retain coverage for  hospital bills of Medicare recipients. The compromise, authored by Sen. John  McCain (R-Ariz.), also would kill a surtax on benefit recipients.  </P> <P> But on the House side, Majority Whip William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) said: "I do  not see the votes for the McCain plan." Gray was among 360 representatives who  voted last week to repeal the catastrophic coverage plan, even though the House  had voted support in both 1987 and 1988. According to Congressional Quarterly,  151 Democrats and 44 Republicans who originally favored the law changed their  minds and voted to scuttle it.  </P> <P> Now, Gray's remarks indicate that even the belated Senate effort to rescue  parts of the package appear doomed to fail.  </P> <P> "It's good to wipe the slate clean," he told a breakfast meeting of reporters  about the largest expansion of the Medicare program since its inception in  1965. Gray acknowledged that it may take years for Congress to adopt a  replacement because of the strong backlash against the financing of the  catastrophic coverage.  </P> <P> Reminded that the Senate had voted nearly 3 to 1 against repeal, Gray shot  back: "The Senate has been known to be wrong."  </P> <P> Gray noted pointedly that the House Democratic leadership did not take a  position on the catastrophic health care law, well aware that almost 200  Democrats in the House were prepared to scrap it.  </P> <P> He forecast that the Senate-approved bill would be defeated in the House just  as an alternative plan presented by Reps. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) and Henry A.  Waxman (D-Los Angeles) was defeated by a vote of 269 to 156 last week.  </P> <P> On the issue of reducing capital gains taxes, Gray said that there is no hope  of changing the outcome even if the House votes a second time. The Democratic  leadership opposes the capital gains cut advocated by President Bush but the  cut passed the House after a number of Democrats defected to the Administration  position.  </P> <P> Under a compromise being discussed in the Senate, the capital gains provision  would be removed from a House-passed budget reconciliation bill and therefore  would have to be approved by the House again and sent back to the Senate. But  the outcome, Gray said, will not change.  </P> <P> "The issue is lost in terms of the House," Gray said. "More than 60 Democrats  already have voted for it, so how can they explain how they changed their minds  less than a month later?"  </P> <P> Gray minimized the long-term impact of the loss for House Democratic leaders,  however, noting that Bush is a first-term President with high popularity and  had made a cut in capital gains a top campaign issue.  </P> <P> "He's going to roll you on any issue he wants," Gray said. "We lost a battle,  but not the war."  </P> <P> But Gray acknowledged that Bush presents a difficult target for Democrats  because he has moved to compromise on such issues as Central American policy,  budget funding decisions, the savings and loan bailout and his drug program.  </P> <P> "The guy is not a target like Ronald Reagan was," Gray told reporters.  </P> <P> Members of Congress had said they were flooded with letters, phone calls and  demands at town meetings from constituents that led to last week's moves to end  the tax and many benefits. While some congressmen reported large amounts of  mail continuing Tuesday after a three-day holiday over Columbus Day, others  said letters had tapered off.  </P> <P> Some reported the letters and phone calls nearly duplicated an uproar in 1983  when Congress bowed to public pressure and repealed a proposed income tax  witholding on interest and dividend income that had been passed the year  before.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> A House-Senate conference committee will meet on the fate of the controversial  law providing catastrophic health care for the elderly. It could repeal the  plan entirely, as the House voted to do. Or it could scale it back, as the  Senate did when it voted to keep the hospital care benefit. No date has been  set for the meeting.  </P></p>

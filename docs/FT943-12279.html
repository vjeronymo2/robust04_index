			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Observer: Victimless The casualty list after last week's musical chairs in John Major's government may be a bit shorter than first appeared. Far from being a victim, Tim Sainsbury tells Observer he asked to go. He is now 62 and has spent 11 unbroken years in government, so Sainsbury decided that four years at the department of trade and industry was enough. Intriguingly, he says he also yearned for some freedom to speak out against Sunday trading laws - which might make for some interesting chats with the rest of the Sainsbury family.</p>

This is  how Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas responded today when he  said that "we already know Europe's position."    The meeting was summoned by the EU Executive Commission  Agriculture Directorate to try to reach an agreement in the  commercial dispute, which originated with restrictions on Latin  American banana purchases, effective since July.    Latin American countries will meet in San Jose on 13 January  to try and reach a consensus regarding an EU offer to assign  quotas to each producing country and 70 percent of the import  licenses. Most Latin American banana countries object to this  European initiative.    "There is no need for a meeting with the EU, because Costa  Rica already knows what it will be told," Rojas stated through a  spokesman.    Costa Rica, together with Colombia, has begun negotiations  regarding the EU initiative and has represented Latin American  interests before GATT, which was lodged with a lawsuit nearly a  year ago.</p>

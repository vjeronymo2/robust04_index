			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Bella figura of the north: Berlusconi's home city of Milan is centre-stage Milan knows all about operatic coincidence. But even at La Scala, the city's world-famous opera house, the Milanese have rarely been asked to believe in a combination of political, economic and athletic good fortune as extravagant as that achieved by their city over the past three months. The first act of this drama reached its climax last Wednesday night as AC Milan, Italy's most successful soccer team, humiliated the Spanish champions Barcelona in the European Cup final. Somehow it seemed only right that Milan should score the decisive second goal moments before Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the team's owner and Italy's new prime minister, won a crucial vote of confidence in the senate. It is the rise to power of Mr Berlusconi, Milan-born media magnate, that has led the press to dub his home town the unofficial capital of Italy's second republic. This is quite a transformation for a city which was notorious only two years ago as the hub of the country's Tangentopoli ('bribesville') scandal - the nationwide network of bribes and political favours which undermined the old political regime. Milan is certainly well-represented in the political life of the new Italy. Forza Italia, Mr Berlusconi's four-month-old political movement, was conceived in Milan and the federalist Northern League, one of its two main government partners, has its headquarters there. The interior minister and the speakers and deputy speakers of both chambers of the Italian parliament are also Milanese. Mr Marco Formentini, a senior League politician and the city's mayor for the past year, says Milan is now reaping the fruit of a decade of struggle, particularly by his own movement. The League pressed for an end to the old centralised and corrupt political regime. The process was then 'accelerated', Mr Formentini claims, by Mr Berlusconi's decision to enter politics earlier this year. Now in power nationally, the League's separatist strategy - which would have made Milan capital of the 'Republic of the North' - seems to have been toned down. Mr Formentini now talks about the possibility of greater autonomy for other Italian cities, be they in the north, centre or south. But he adds: 'Milan will be the beneficiary of these changes, because we have always been a city with enormous potential, crushed under the weight of central state control.' Economic recovery may help realise that potential, the northern city's business leaders claim. Since the March election, the number of shares traded on the Milan stock exchange has occasionally exceeded that of Wall Street. Mr Michele Porcelli, general manager of Assolombarda, the federation of Milanese companies, says his members have noted a gradual upturn over the past four months, but remain cautious. He interprets this as a welcome sign that the short-lived boom of the early 1980s will not be repeated. 'The downturn has changed the lifestyle (of the Milanese),' he says, adding that good economic news for the city would also be good for the country. As for the corruption scandal, the city's shame has turned into pride in its magistrates, who are tracking down and prosecuting the corruptors and the corrupted. The charismatic courtroom performance of Mr Antonio Di Pietro as prosecutor in the first big Tangentopoli trial, which finished in Milan three weeks ago, was watched by millions on national television. 'Milan is proud to be the centre of the mani pulite (clean hands) investigations,' beams Mr Formentini. The mayor has also demonstrated his pride in the political prominence of his fellow citizens; he put up posters around the city welcoming the election of Milanese speakers in the two chambers of parliament last month. But there are plenty in Milan who dislike the fact that the city is identifying itself with the right-wing national government. On April 25, 300,000 people took to Milan's streets to commemorate the liberation of Italy from fascism in 1945. The demonstration was dominated by the defeated left. Mr Alex Iriondo, Milan secretary of the opposition Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), is critical of the city's council and the new government, which he believes could hold back recovery. 'The relaunch of the city doesn't depend on our citizens holding high offices of state,' he says. Indeed the legacy of the Milanese former prime minister, Mr Bettino Craxi, who is facing corruption charges, suggests that occupying high office can create even deeper problems. The former socialist leader's network of political patronage is held responsible by many Milanese for hampering the city's economic and political development over the past decade. Ironically, Mr Berlusconi thrived under this environment, when he was building his Fininvest empire in Milan during the 1980s. Mr Berlusconi may now be prepared to reward the city with real institutional power to add to its economic and financial importance and reinforce top politicians' sentimental links with the city. For example, last week Mr Vito Gnutti, industry minister, fuelled speculation that parts of the budget, industry and finance ministries might decamp to Milan. That would fit in with the hopes of some respected Milanese commentators, who have long urged the government to move certain institutions - for example, the Consob financial watchdog or even the central bank - to the Lombard capital. Such moves would underpin rather than undermine national identity, according to Professor Mario Monti, rector of the private Bocconi University. 'It would be easier to keep national unity if we could avoid a Rome-centred concept, which generates so much anti-Roman sentiment throughout the country,' he says. But Mr Attilio Ventura, president of the Milan stock exchange, believes changes in the institutional balance of power are unnecessary. The fact that the central bank and Consob are in Rome has little impact on Milan's position as the dominant financial centre, he points out. Mr Sandro Molinari, chairman of Milan-based Cariplo, one of Italy's biggest banks, is similarly sceptical, claiming that an institutional reshuffle is unlikely. 'Milan is the central motor of the economy, and Rome is the motor of political life,' he adds. If Mr Gnutti's hints are fulfilled, other Italian cities and regions may also start demanding a slice of the institutional cake. But for the time being the question of Milanese pre-eminence does not seem to worry the rest of Italy. Milan's pretentions are watched with a certain disdainful amusement by Romans, traditionally dismissive of their stress-prone northern compatriots. The rest of the country may simply be waiting to see if Milan's luck holds: as opera lovers know, the coincidence by which our hero receives riches in act one is often offset by a blow of fate before the final curtain.</p>

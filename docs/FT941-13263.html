			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: USAir trims deficit to Dollars 116.5m in quarter USAir, the US carrier in which British Airways holds a minority stake, yesterday showed progress in cutting its losses, reporting a fall in its fourth-quarter after-tax deficit to Dollars 116.5m from Dollars 254m last time. The final quarter's performance helped bring a significant cut in full-year losses to Dollars 349.4m from Dollars 600.8m before accounting changes and to Dollars 393.1m from Dollars 1.23bn after the changes. But it also marked the end of the fifth consecutive year in which USAir has failed to show a net profit. Like other US airlines, it has been suffering intense competition from low-cost carriers and has been trying to cut costs in response. In the year just ended it benefited from a slight recovery in the US market and from a steep decline in fuel prices. The company said if all non-recurring items were stripped out of its full-year results, it would have shown an operating profit of Dollars 23.7m, compared with operating losses of Dollars 223.1m the year before. But Mr Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive, acknowledged the airline's financial results remained unsatisfactory in spite of the progress made. Fourth-quarter turnover rose to Dollars 1.8bn from Dollars 1.63bn and losses per share fell to Dollars 2.29 from Dollars 5.66, while full-year turnover rose to Dollars 7.08bn from Dollars 6.69bn. Losses per share fell to Dollars 7.68 from Dollars 13.88 before accounting changes and to Dollars 8.48 from Dollars 27.23 after the changes.</p>

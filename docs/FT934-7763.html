			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Argentaria sale raises Pta170bn for Spain ARGENTARIA, the banking corporation controlled by the Spanish government, netted about Pta170bn for the Spanish exchequer yesterday when it placed 25 per cent of its equity on the domestic and international markets in its second public share offering this year. The share issue, which took place just six months after the the corporation's first share offer, brought the government- held equity stake in Argentaria down to just over 50 per cent. In spite of setting a price of Pta6,050 per share which was at the top of its previously announced range, Argentaria's paper was heavily oversubscribed. The offer price represented a 5.61 per cent discount on Tuesday's closing price of Pta6,410 and demand among US and UK investors was between four and five times the available paper. The strong bids for Argentaria shares mirrored the success of the earlier placement when the equity was offered at a price of Pta3,800 and was also strongly oversubscribed. Investor interest has been fuelled by firm third-quarter results and by the potential for further growth on the back of cross-selling among the group's well-established niche units. Argentaria controls a group of state-owned financial institutions which include the post office savings bank as well as units that are market leaders in the domestic mortgage sector and in lending to the local administration. It is the fourth biggest group by market capitalisation on the Madrid stock market after Endesa, the electrical utility, Telefonica and the energy group Repsol. Argentaria is 23 per cent owned by foreign institutions, although no single share-holder owns more than 1 per cent.</p>

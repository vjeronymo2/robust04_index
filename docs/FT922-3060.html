			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Stock exchanges may share NY building THE New York and American stock exchanges, fierce rivals for nearly a century, are considering a tentative developer's proposal to build a headquarters on Wall Street which would house both institutions. The idea is being floated by JP Morgan, the large New York bank, and would involve building a new tower on a site adjacent to the current New York Stock Exchange building. The site, on the corner of Wall and Broad Streets in lower Manhattan, is now partly occupied by Morgan's former headquarters. Mr William Strauss, chief financial officer of the American exchange, said that 'creating a financial hub in lower Manhattan makes a lot of sense to us'. But he added that Morgan had not yet presented any economic evaluation of the scheme and no active discussions were taking place. 'They have left us with an idea. I presume they are working on the economics,' he added. The scheme envisages the two exchanges remaining separate institutions, with their own trading floors. However, it could pave the way for a sharing of functions to cut costs and is likely to prompt speculation about an eventual merger between the two institutions. Both the New York exchange and its much smaller rival face increasing competition from electronic dealing systems which do not require a physical trading floor. A spokesman for the New York exchange said merely that it received constant approaches about possible property developments and was willing to listen to JP Morgan's ideas. If the project were to go ahead, the new building would not be ready for occupation until near the end of the century. The scheme would demand a large package of aid from the New York city and state governments, but in return might help stem a gradual drift of business away from the financial district in lower Manhattan and reinforce the area's role as the world's leading financial centre. New York is anxiously awaiting news as to whether Morgan Stanley, the large investment bank headquartered in mid-town Manhattan, has decided to remain in the city or move out to Stamford, Connecticut.</p>

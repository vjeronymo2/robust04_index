			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In response to the accusations of fraud leveled  against it by the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT] and the  Youth Wing of the Rally of the Togolese People [JRPT] in their  21 and 22 February declaration, the Action Committee for Renewal  [CAR] has just sent us a declaration in which it says it is  surprised that the RPT and the JRPT have accused it of having  committed massive frauds during the recent legislative  elections. In its statement, the CAR asserts that in fact, some  faults were committed and that it is the present government  entirely committed to the RPT which has organized the elections,  provided security, and ensured the appointment and management of  personnel and the equipment. Once again, the CAR reaffirms its  unchanging desire for nonviolence and immediately encourages all  the political parties to respect the verdict of the ballot box.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Selling copiers Caveat emptor is a basic principle which all buyers should observe when entering the market. But a business that expects to take advantage of its customers' failure to observe the principle is adopting a risky strategy. Buyers hit by underhand selling techniques are unlikely to engage in further transactions with companies that have ripped them off. Yet shady selling practices appear to have become commonplace in the supply of photocopiers in the UK. According to a report published yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading, some photocopier dealers and leasing companies are guilty of 'misrepresentation, obfuscation and deceit'. They use leasing arrangements to overcharge for the equipment, impose steep annual increases in service charges and tie their customers up in contracts that last far longer than the equipment they supply. Their customers discover they have been conned only after signing lease contracts with penal termination clauses. Some of the businesses caught by these methods have been large companies that ought to know better. They can afford the legal expertise to scrutinise the small print in contracts and demand clarification on lease terms. But most are small businesses, including professionals such as doctors, surveyors and financial advisers. And 15 per cent of an OFT sample of complaints on the subject were colleges or schools, housing associations, churches, clubs or other social groups. They are unlikely to have acquired the business acumen to spot a bad deal. The problem lies in the opaque nature of leasing contracts which often omit the cost of the equipment, the implied interest rate and the charges on early termination. Many buyers lack the experience to demand such information or to understand the overall cost of the lease. They are also subjected to cold-calling and high-pressure sales techniques. The problem is compounded by the unfamiliarity of the product. Car leasing is largely free of unscrupulous practices because most buyers have a grasp of the economics of the car ownership. They do not sign leases that last longer than the cars. They can weigh the monthly payments against well-known prices and likely service costs. Customers are less businesslike in acquiring office products, predictably so in the case of small businesses and public bodies. Much of this could be dealt with by self-regulation. There is a limited number of large companies making photocopiers and providing the lease finance. Some are household names with reputations at risk from the unscrupulous methods of those who sell their products. They all have an interest in cleaning up their industry and avoiding practices that destroy relationships with their customers. Central to improving the industry's reputation is greater transparency in the nature of the transaction. It is hard to see why businesses leasing photocopiers should be denied the sort of basic financial information required for credit sales of domestic consumer goods by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. And contracts must embody the OFT's recommendations for clear explanation of costs and penalties. If the companies involved cannot provide this without compulsion, legislation may be inevitable.</p>

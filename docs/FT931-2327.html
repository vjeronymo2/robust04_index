			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Gardiner shuffles board for new start GARDINER GROUP, the distributor of security and surveillance equipment, yesterday dismissed its chief executive and announced sweeping board changes following an investigation into a Pounds 4.8m overstatement in its 1991 accounts. Mr Yashar Turgut has been replaced as chief executive by Mr Harvey Samson, group finance director. Mr Turgut's departure follows a report by accountants Price Waterhouse which concluded that the company's accounting records had been falsified. According to Price Waterhouse, there had been a deliberate mis-statement in the value of the company's stocks, mainly of burglar alarms. Mr Ian Nellist, group finance director during the period when the mis-statement took place, 'has so far been unwilling to discuss the matter with Price Waterhouse or the board', the company told shareholders yesterday. Anxious for a new start following the four-month investigation, the company said Mr Samson would be joined on the board by Mr Richard Clemons as chairman, replacing Mr Thomas Buffet who resigned last November; Mr Bob Underhill, a former executive director at Stirling Group, has been named as finance director. Announcing a Pounds 2.05m pre-tax profit on turnover of Pounds 73.8m in the year to October 31 1992, the company claimed it was now ready for expansion in Britain and continental Europe. Earnings were 1.34p and a final dividend of 0.19p makes a 0.66p (1.3p) total.</p>

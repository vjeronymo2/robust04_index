			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: HUSBAND'S POT COMES BETWEEN TEACHER AND HER JOB  </P> <P> Vicki Sherling of Moultrie, Ga., named 1989 Teacher of the Year in Colquitt  County, isn't allowed back in the classroom. Sherling was acquitted this week  of charges that she grew marijuana in a greenhouse in her back yard. But for  now, Supt. Billy Mock says he's not going to rehire her. Mock explained that  the former high school chemistry teacher knew her husband, Mike, smoked pot and  said that the issue is one of morality. Her husband, a former teacher and  lawyer, has pleaded guilty to drug charges and is awaiting sentencing. "She  admitted in our hearing that she knew it was going on, that it was being used,"  Mock said. Sherling, 38, is now appealing her dismissal to the state Board of  Education. "I feel great that finally the truth got out and I have cleared my  name, which was my intent," she said. "I had the truth on my side." She has  denied ever smoking marijuana and testified that she had pleaded with her  husband to stop smoking it.  </P> <P>  -- "I won fair and square," said Miss America Gretchen Carlson from St. Paul,  Minn. "I'm not refuting anything. I'm standing above it. This has been a  wonderful year, and I have a ton of people to thank for that. Unfortunately,  someone has seen fit to tarnish that." TV Guide, in its Sept. 2 issue, said  that judges failed to count interview scores in last year's pageant. "We all  knew way before the pageant that the interview would not be balloted on the  final night," Carlson said. "But it was balloted in the preliminaries, in which  the finalists were chosen." Carlson will end her reign Sept. 12.  </P> <P>  -- Harvard's Kennedy School of Government has named six fellows, including  candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and former Florida  Gov. Reubin Askew and ex-Christian Science Monitor Editor Katherine Fanning.  Others selected at the school's Institute of Politics in Cambridge, Mass., are  Nancy Risque Rohrbach, a former senior aide in the Ronald Reagan White House;  Bernard Sanders of Burlington, Vt., a former Socialist mayor; former Sen. Paul  S. Trible Jr. (R-Va.), and Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of  La Raza and an expert on Mexican-American civil rights. Each will direct a  non-credit student study group in the fall semester. JAMES MARNELL  </P></p>

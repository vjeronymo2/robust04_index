			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Conflicting influences put Dow on see-saw Wall Street US SHARE prices ended mixed yesterday after fluctuating amid the conflicting influences of weaker bond prices, some unexpectedly good jobs news and a mixed batch of corporate earnings reports, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.78 at 3,200.88, having spent the day see-sawing within 20 points either side of Wednesday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.77 at 414.90, while the Amex composite closed 1.09 lower at 374.51 and the Nasdaq down 0.03 at 597.12. Turnover on the NYSE was again heavy, at 216m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 961 to 787. The market opened in a positive mood, buoyed up by the news that weekly state unemployment insurance claims fell by 15,000 in the week ended October 10. Analysts had been expecting a rise in claims. But the early gains did not last and shares lost ground by mid-morning in the wake of further declines in bond prices. Although the weakness in bonds was primarily due to some unusual trades on the Chicago futures market the move in the market was enough to unsettle equities, which moved into negative territory just before midday. After an uneventful afternoon, blue-chip prices picked up ground on some late buying. Earnings reports continued to pour in from some of the biggest companies. AT&amp;T firmed Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 41 7/8 after the telecommunications giant announced third quarter net income of 72 cents a share, a substantial improvement on the Dollars 1.40 loss incurred at the same stage a year ago. BankAmerica, however, failed to impress, the stock dropping Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 41 5/8 in turnover of 3.5m shares after the west coast banking group reported a modest improvement in net income to Dollars 1.22 a share, but also announced a Dollars 600m rise in problem assets. Salomon was another big loser, dropping Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 33 1/2 in turnover of 1.9m shares after the group announced a 95 per cent decline in third quarter profits to just Dollars 6m in the wake of a sharp drop in trading profits at its securities subsidiary. Sears Roebuck fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 5/8 after the company unveiled a Dollars 2.25 a share loss for the third quarter following big charges against earnings to cover write-offs and losses at its insurance unit caused by Hurricane Andrew. Canada TORONTO gains in the mining sector were offset by a decline in gold shares, leaving the overall market little changed. The TSE 300 composite index added 6.14 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 3,258.77, with advances over declines 273 to 257. Volume climbed to 34.3m shares worth CDollars 277.5m against the previous 25.7m worth CDollars 252.1m.</p>

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Sport: Age-old appeal of Wimbledon - The crowd has found two unlikely heroes this week. John Barrett explains why AGE HAS its compensations. Ask Ivan Lendl, the 32-year-old near veteran who has played at Wimbledon every year since 1979. For five of those years this likeable Czech was the world No 1, invincible on every surface but grass. Yet, in spite of two appearances in the Wimbledon final and four in the semi-finals, this consummate professional had never looked like winning the title. Nor had he ever been the favourite of the crowd. In 1986 the boy Becker beat him to retain his title, at 18 still younger than any previous winner. The next year Ivan was unlucky enough to face an inspired Pat Cash, the Australian who had grown up on grass courts in Sydney. Yesterday on Court No 1, the scene of several unhappy memories over the years, Lendl (seeded 10) was cheered to the echo by a delirious crowd when he came back to inflict a 6-3 1-6 2-6 6-3 7-5 beating on Son of Fred - otherwise Sandon Stolle whose dad has the doubtful distinction of having been a losing finalist at Wimbledon three years in a row in the 1960s. It was poetic justice really, because as a gesture to Fred, Ivan has taken Sandon under his wing, practising with him and passing on his vast knowledge to help the young man establish himself on the circuit. The other heavyweights in the lower half survived - Stefan Edberg (2), Michael Stich (3), Pete Sampras (5) and Goran Ivanisevic (8) lost no sets and only 28 games between them. There were two surprises. Richard Krajicek the 11th seed from the Netherlands who I had seen as a serious outside threat, went down to the unseeded Frenchman, Arnaud Boetsch, ranked 44 in the world. Perhaps young Krajicek was a victim of his own indiscretion. The day before, on Dutch Radio he had said that 80 per cent of the top 100 women players were fat pigs. Yesterday he admitted he had exaggerated. All he was trying to say, he explained, is that some of the women were over weight and none of them deserved equal prize money with the men. The reverberations are still echoing around the world. Then a qualifier, Henrik Holm of Sweden, unseeded and ranked a lowly 131, put out the left-handed Russian Alexander Volkov, seeded 15, in four sets. Last year Volkov had been within two points of beating the eventual champion Stich. What a difference a year makes. The two remaining higher women seeds in the top half sailed serenely through yesterday - Monica Seles (1) a 6-4 6-1 winner against Laura Gildemeister and Martina Navratilova (4) successful 7-5 6-1 against a strong German challenger, Barbara Rittner, the junior champion here last year. As with the men, there were two big surprises. Mary Joe Fernandez (7) injured her leg in a fall and was beaten 6-3 6-3 by the American Amy Frazier, while the young German hope Anke Huber (10) went down surprisingly 6-2 6-3 to Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia. Today the top half of the men's draw and the lower half of the women's draw will be completed before what is certain to be an enthusiastic audience. In an effort to recapture some of the atmosphere of last year's magical Middle Sunday (remember the Mexican Wave and Jimmy Connors' farewell appearance?) the first 2,000 members of the overnight queue will be admitted to seats in the Centre Court at reduced prices. Other seats in Nos 1 and 2 Courts will be sold as usual. Jim Courier (1) has yet to lose a set and will not lose one easily to the former Soviet player Andrei Olhovskiy, while Boris Becker (4), after his escape on Thursday against Martin Damm, should get past Bryan Shelton without fuss. The two matches that will capture the attention are McEnroe v last year's semi-finalist David Wheaton (16) and the all-French clash between Guy Forget (9) and Henri Leconte. Britain's hero, Jeremy Bates, who has reached the third round with victories over Michael Chang, the No 7 seed who was out of sorts and Javier Sanchez, a clay-court specialist, faces his toughest test against Thierry Champion of France. Among the women, the holder Steffi Graf (2), the beaten finalist Gabriela Sabatini (3) and the 1991 semi-finalist Jennifer Capriati (6) who last year so dramatically beat Navratilova, are all in action. I cannot see Mariaan de Swardt, Rika Hiraki and Patricia Hy respectively causing any upsets, but I have been wrong before. On Thursday we had one of those special Wimbledon occasions that will live on in the mind. Two former champions, both unseeded, battled for four absorbing hours on the Centre Court. The American left-hander John McEnroe, the champion in 1981, 1983 and 1984 and already discussing a possible retirement, played the 1987 champion Pat Cash. The Australian is a part-time player these days. He has competed in only three tournaments this year and is into rock music as a guitarist. His guests for the day were Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones and Jimmy White. Like the defeated snooker finalist, Cash should have won . . . could have won, anyway, in four sets. But McEnroe, encouraged by coach Larry Stefanki since January to take the ball early and trust his own reflexes to find those impossible angles on service return, was inspired. His instant reactions on the volley against Cash's fierce drives were miraculous. Lacking match play, Cash could not convert his chances. To a standing ovation the pair left the court with McEnroe the victor 6-7 6-4 6-7 6-3 6-2. Late last night McEnroe earned another standing ovation - on the Centre Court this time - when his doubles with Stich against the holders John Fitzgerald and Anders Jarryd was halted for bad light by the referee Alan Mills at 8.15pm just as McEnroe and Stich had taken a two sets to love lead 6-3 7-6. Twice in two days the bad boy of world tennis had become the people's hero. Like Lendl and good wine, McEnroe is maturing with age. It makes you wonder just what else he might have achieved if he had been brought up on Dale Carnegie instead of Robert Ludlum]</p>

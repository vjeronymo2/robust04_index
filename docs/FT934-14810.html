			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US maize estimate reduced still further THE US Department of Agriculture has reduced its estimate of the size of the US maize harvest yet again. The USDA's latest report, released on Tuesday night, forecast that the crop, which suffered from late planting and the summer's record deluge, would be about 6.96bn bushels, down 3.7 per cent from its September estimate. That was the fourth such reduction in as many months. If production does indeed fall below 7bn, it will the smallest US maize crop since 1988, a drought year. The magnitude of the reduction surprised grain traders, who responded by buying maize futures at the Chicago Board of Trade on Wednesday morning. By midsession, maize for December delivery was up 3 cents at Dollars 2.47 1/4 a bushel. The short harvest, however, poses no risk to grain supplies, or even of food price inflation, as much of 1992's record crop is still in storage. Mr David Miller, analyst with the American Farm Bureau, estimated yesterday that there would be 1.1b bushels of US maize still in storage after all domestic use and export demand is accounted for. 'Carryout stocks will be more than adequate,' he said. The USDA harvest estimate was based on an October 1 crop survey, when less than 10 per cent of the nation's maize crop had been gathered. The smaller forecast reflected cool September temperatures, which reduced yields in Iowa, and damage from scattered early frosts in Minnesota and other northern areas. Farmers with severely damaged crops are ploughing them under to qualify for government payments, rather than attempting to harvest them. The report also reduced the USDA's soyabean production estimate to 1.89bn bushels from 1.91bn in September. Copa, the European Community farmers' lobby has raised its forecast of the 1993 EC grain crop to 167.13m tonnes, down from 161m last month and the 169.47m it estimated for the 1992 harvest. The EC grain trade lobby, Coceral, last week put the 1993 the community's grain crop at 164.87m tonnes. It estimated the 1992 harvest at 168.47m. Copa's higher 1993 estimate mainly reflected a higher maize figure of 30.44m tonnes, against Coceral's 28.66m. The farmers' lobby also forecast a higher 1993 durum wheat crop of 6.93m tonnes, compared with Coceral's 6.15m.</p>

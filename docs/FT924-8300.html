			<p>921112 FT  12 NOV 92 / O&amp;Y warns of liquidation threat OLYMPIA &amp; York has warned creditors that failure to approve a debt-structuring plan later this month will probably lead to the company's bankruptcy and the forced liquidation of its assets. O&amp;Y, which was the world's biggest property developer before it filed for court protection in May, said in a letter to lenders that unsecured and under-secured creditors were likely to receive nothing if it is forced into liquidation. This group of creditors holds more than CDollars 4bn (Pounds 2.08bn) of O&amp;Y's total debt of CDollars 13.5bn. The restructuring proposals cover CDollars 8.6bn of debt. Thirty-four groups of creditors will vote on O&amp;Y's proposals at meetings scheduled to be held in Toronto between November 25 and November 30. Canada's Companies Creditors Arrangement Act, under which O&amp;Y is operating, is silent on the precise proportion of votes required for the plan to go ahead. The final decision will rest with an Ontario judge. The company hopes to obtain the approval of all 34 groups, but is confident that it can implement the restructuring without the endorsement of some of the smaller groups whose claims relate to specific buildings. The approval of the unsecured creditors, whose vote is scheduled for November 30, is viewed as crucial. In their present form, O&amp;Y's proposals provide for the unsecured and under-secured creditors to acquire a 90 per cent equity stake in the parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments. O&amp;Y's US and Canadian properties would be spun off into two new separate companies in which creditors would also have a substantial shareholding. The viability of the plan depends heavily on an upturn in the North American commercial property market. O&amp;Y's proposals assume a substantial increase in rental incomes over the next five years to finance improvements in the buildings which it will continue to manage. The plan does not cover the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands or negotiations with lenders to specific US properties. Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, said in his letter to creditors that the initial 250-page restructuring plan might be modified in the course of negotiations over the next two weeks.</p>

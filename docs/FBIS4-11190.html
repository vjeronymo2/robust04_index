			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Ruben Zamora,  presidential candidate for the leftist coalition, here today  said that he is worried by the poor turnout of voters this  morning when the voting sites opened.    "Very early this morning I toured the city and saw that the  turnout of voters was poor and this worries me," Zamora said.  Zamora is the presidential candidate for the leftist coalition  headed by the former rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front (FMLN). "I ask the Salvadorans to think of what is  happening and to go and vote," Zamora said when calling on the  2.7 million registered voters to consider the importance this  election has on the future of the country and to go out and cast  their vote.    The presidential candidate admitted that the electoral  authorities corrected the mistakes reported during the first  election held on 20 March. At that time, none of the parties  that participated in the election attained the necessary  majority -- half plus one of the votes cast -- to become  president of the Republic. For this reason, the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE] called for a run-off election between  the two leading candidates.    Thus, Zamora and Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA]  candidate Armando Calderon Sol confronted each other today to  decide which of the two will be president for the 1994-1999 term.    Zamora has said that the experience gained in the first  round  made it possible for the coalition to be more alert at voting  sites and prevent irregularities and fraud attempts.    The TSE called the 2.7 million citizens with voting rights  to  go to the 381 voting sites, spread throughout the country's 262  municipalities. The election started at 0700 local (1300 GMT)  and will close at 1700 (2300 GMT). The TSE expects to release  the results of at least 30 percent of the vote four hours after  closing time.</p>

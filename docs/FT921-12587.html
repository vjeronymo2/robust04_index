			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): A matter of fixed interest IN THE Inland Revenue notes of guidance for the tax return (1991/92) paragraph 72 deals with capital gains tax exemptions and in the section on gilts it also mentions as being exempt 'certain corporate bonds eg debentures or loan stocks) acquired after 13 March 1984. Does exemption apply to convertible preference shares or to convertible loan stocks, with fixed rate of interest? What are the principles governing such exemptions? The definition of 'qualifying corporate bond' is complex, and is covered in clause 117 of the current taxation of Chargeable Gains Bill. The relevant definitions of 'security' and 'normal commercial loan' can be derived from clause 132(2) (b) of the Bill and paragraph 1(5) of schedule 18 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, respectively. Convertible preference shares are excluded from the exemption, and so are convertible loan stocks (except any which are merely convertible into qualifying corporate bonds or are deep-gain securities). On balance, the qualifying-corporate-bond legislations probably benefits and Treasury - more CGT is saved by the disallowance of indexation losses than is foregone by the exemption of indexed gains.

All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Digital killed the audio star: High-quality broadcasts promise to transform the way we consume music and television In 1983, Virgin group founder Mr Richard Branson showed a record magazine an electronic box which could receive music from satellites and transfer it to people's stereo systems. The box was an April Fool's hoax. To Mr Branson's delight, the magazine fell for it, running the story on its front page. Ten years later, no one is laughing. Households in the US can already pay to have compact disc-quality music broadcast to their homes. Using newly available digital recording machines, they can make copies as clear as anything they can buy from their local record shop. Some in the music industry believe that, as such services become more widely available, the compact disc, the cassette - even the record shop itself - could disappear. In their place would be a home juke box, from which people could select CD-quality albums or single tracks, and record them whenever they wished. Some go further: with music available on request and at the touch of a button, people will not even bother to record it. Similarly, instead of going to the video store to rent a film or waiting for a movie to appear on television, cable subscribers could order whatever film they wanted and it would immediately appear on their screens. Mr Alain Levy, chief executive of PolyGram, one of the world's biggest music groups, doubts that music lovers will stop buying compact discs and cassettes in great numbers. 'The technology will exist, but my gut feeling is that changes in people's behaviour take a lot longer.' Similarly, Blockbuster, the Florida-based video rental company which now owns the Cityvision chain in the UK, argues that the delivery of movies directly to the home will not ruin its business. 'The threat to home video is overstated. We think it will be viable through to the end of the decade,' claims Mr Ron Castell, senior vice-president of programming and communications. But Mr Nic Garnett, director general of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents music companies worldwide, believes it is safer to proceed on the assumption that delivery of entertainment directly to the home will catch on. He has already begun campaigning for legislation to ensure that record companies' revenues are protected and that people who receive their music at home are made to pay for it. He wants music companies to be given the right to authorise or refuse the broadcast of their recording to people's homes. 'In most cases, permission will be granted - but on terms,' he says. In the US, a company called Digital Music Express (DMX) already provides 30 channels of CD-quality music 24 hours a day to 10m cable subscribers. For between Dollars 10 and Dollars 12 a month, which includes a tuner and a remote control device, subscribers can listen to anything from chamber music to a reggae channel. The music is not interrupted by commercials or disc jockeys. While the selected channel is playing, the remote control device displays the name of the track, the artist, the album title, the composer, the record label and, where applicable, the position in the charts. Next month, DMX says it will start broadcasting to cable subscribers in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Programmes will be transmitted by satellite from Atlanta to European cable operators. If subscribers want a high-quality recording of the music they are listening to, they can use one of two new products, the Digital Compact Cassette or the Mini Disc. The DCC looks similar to a cassette tape, but produces a sound as good as a compact disc. The Mini Disc is a smaller version of the CD, but it can record as well as play music. The recordable, blank CD is not yet commercially available, but it is technically feasible and many expect it to be on sale eventually. The next development is likely to be digital audio broadcasting, which will allow radio stations to broadcast high-quality, interference-free sound from terrestrial transmitters to purchasers of special receivers. Mr Henry Price, head of engineering information at the BBC, says he expects digital audio broadcasting to begin in Germany in the second half of 1995, and in the UK shortly after that. In theory, listeners could then make digital recordings of rock songs or concerts, but Mr Price wonders how many will. The UK already has the digital Nicam television sound system, enabling people to record CD-quality music. Even analogue radio transmissions can provide an acceptable level of sound for decent recording. But there is not much evidence of widespread recording from radio or television. Even with DMX, there is the disadvantage that you cannot record what you want when you want it. The 30 channels have a daily programme of music and, while subscribers can select one, they cannot choose an album or track. Similarly, while television watchers can make a video recording of a film on a networked or subscription channel, if they want a particular title they have to wait until it appears on the schedule - or rent it from a video shop. If current methods of buying music or renting videos are to be replaced, subscribers will have to be able to choose the recording or film they want when they want it. Time Warner, the US media group, is already promising cable subscribers the right to choose, with the announcement last month of an 'electronic superhighway'. The group, the second largest cable company in the US, will use digital storage and compression technology (see inset) to offer subscribers a wide range of movies on demand. The 'electronic superhighway' will start on an experimental basis in Orlando, Florida, in early 1994. Time Warner says it has no plans to offer music on demand, but Mr Michael Tyler, a partner with consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, says the technology can be used to do so. The Virgin group, which owns 70 music and entertainment mega-stores worldwide, says it does not believe these trends will put it out of business. Mr Will Whitehorn, the group's spokesman, says that, while smaller record shops might suffer, large outlets can adjust by selling other products. With music sales slowing, Virgin's stores are devoting more space to computer games. Products which the company believes could become more important include laser discs. 'There's always going to be some sort of software that people want to collect,' he says. Virgin sees no reason to alter its plans to have 200 megastores by 1996. People like a CD or cassette box and the pictures and information that go with them, Mr Whitehorn says. He argues that there will always be people who like browsing in music stores. Blockbuster, which last year announced a joint venture with Virgin to build music megastores in the US and continental Europe, does see ways in which electronic delivery can, in the meantime, help retailers. It is currently experimenting with a system called 'Soundsational', which could deliver high-quality copies of an album - in cassette or compact-disc form - from a computerised centre to an individual record store in a matter of minutes. Soundsational's advantage is that it could significantly curtail the store's stock of older or less popular records. Mr Castell says the company hopes to test the system within the next 12 months.</p>

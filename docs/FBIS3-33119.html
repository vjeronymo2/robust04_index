Copaz President Hector Rosada today denied a local media  report that the two generals and a colonel were going to be  replaced before the next meeting with the guerrillas, which will  be held in Mexico soon. The appointed officers are General  Marco Antonio Gonzalez Taracena, current deputy chief of defense  general staff and Copaz member under the previous government;  General Victor Manuel Argueta, commander of the Honor Guard; and  Colonel Victor Manuel Ventura, director of the Polytechnic  School.    Rosada asserted that the defense minister had reported his  intentions to replace one of the military representatives for  health reasons and not "to find new participation mechanisms."  The sociologist [Rosada] who met last week with the UN mediator  in the peace process said: "Yesterday I asked President Ramiro  de Leon Carpio and Gen. Enriquez not to change them because they  are doing a good job."    The peace delegation is chaired by Rosada who is the author  of the peace proposal presented by de Leon last year. The  proposal includes three military and three civilians who will  negotiate the end of the armed conflict that was initiated in  1960. This is the only armed conflict that prevails in Central  America.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR FIRED  </P> <P> After 18 years on the job, El Segundo's public works director was abruptly  fired Monday and told to clean out his desk and hand in his keys to City Hall  within 24 hours.  </P> <P> William Glickman said he was surprised by City Manager Fred Sorsabal's decision  to fire him and was not told why he was being let go.  </P> <P> "I honestly don't know. I have no inkling," said Glickman, who earned $79,560  annually.  </P> <P> "I can honestly say there haven't been any criticisms or negative comments or  things suggested like 'Bill, shape up in this area or that area,' " the  55-year-old Glickman added.  </P> <P> Glickman said that by 5 p.m. Tuesday, he had said goodby to his co-workers and  filled out his retirement papers.  </P> <P> Sorsabal, who has resigned from his job effective next week to become Mission  Viejo's city manager, declined to comment on the firing, except to say it was  carried out in accordance with city personnel regulations.  </P> <P> Those regulations specify that department heads such as Glickman serve at the  pleasure of the city manager and can be terminated at any time.  </P> <P> Glickman and two other department heads were essentially stripped of some of  their power about four months ago when Sorsabal created the position of  development services director. Glickman and the city's planning and building  and safety directors were instructed to report to the new department head.  Previously, the three had reported to the city manager.  </P> <P> At the time, Sorsabal said he was creating the new position, which was filled  by former Planning Director Lynn Harris, to streamline the city's bureaucracy  and make it more responsive to residents.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Councilman Alan West lashed out at Sorsabal's action, saying it  was unfair to fire Glickman and not tell him why. Even if Sorsabal had been  unhappy with Glickman's work, he should have been given an opportunity to  improve his job performance, West asserted.  </P> <P> West said he was unaware of Sorsabal's plan to fire Glickman. "To treat people  like that stinks," he said.  </P> <P> Councilman Jim Clutter said he, too, was unaware that Sorsabal intended to fire  Glickman. Nevertheless, he defended Sorsabal, saying the city manager is trying  to make programs work.  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Seven killed in Moldova clashes Seven people were killed yesterday when Moldovan interior ministry troops launched the first big offensive against Russian-speaking separatists in the Dnestr region, Reuter reports from Kishinyov. The dawn raid on the town of Bendery showed that President Mircea Snegur had abandoned his previously moderate approach. Months of separatist violence have already left more than 50 dead and produced more than 5,000 refugees. The assault on Bendery overshadowed a second day of peace talks between Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Moldova which ended inconclusively last night in the Moldovan capital, Kishinyov.</p>

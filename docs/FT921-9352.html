			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Fraud trials and justice YESTERDAY'S collapse of the second Guinness trial raises fundamental questions about the administration of justice in the UK in cases concerning fraud. It comes hard upon the decision to abandon the third trial in the prolonged Guinness prosecution. It is likely to be followed today by the verdicts in the Blue Arrow case, in which - after 12 months and a cost estimated at nearly Pounds 40m - five of the 10 defendants have already been found not guilty. By any standards this is not a good record for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) which is responsible for prosecuting large fraud cases. Not all the blame can attach to the SFO or its outgoing director, Mrs Barbara Mills. In Blue Arrow some of the blame for the trial's inordinate length must go to the easy-going, non-interventionist style of the judge Mr Justice McKinnon. And in Guinness Two, it was Mr Roger Seelig's conduct of his own defence which prolonged the trial to an oppressive degree and threatened his health. But there is much which can be laid at the door of the SFO in its approach to fraud trials. In particular, delays of as much as seven years in bringing cases to trial are clearly unjust. The injustice is heightened when the charges are withdrawn, as they have been on Guinness Three, after years under threat of imprisonment - not to mention the damage to income and employment - for the accused. Sheer size Also overdue for change is the SFO's approach of throwing the book at defendants. The sheer size of the prosecution cases threatens the process's manageability. Presenting such cases as all-embracing prosecutions, with dozens of charges, ensures they drag on for months and years and become complex beyond the grasp of experienced judges, never mind jurors. As the former appeal court judge Sir Frederick Lawton has recently pointed out, there is a limit to the number of times an individual can be sentenced for the same crime. Justice does not require that every dishonest act should be identified and punished. Sir Frederick commended the advice of the former Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard that prosecuting counsel should choose the best six counts and leave the others on the file. Recent scandals A rethink in the approach to the prosecution of alleged fraud is required before the start of the next round of cases arising out of the more recent crop of scandals. Much of the system - including the SFO - was created after the publication of the report of the Roskill Fraud Trials Committee. But Roskill's recommendation that complex fraud trials should be heard by a tribunal comprising a judge sitting with two expert lay assessors was not implemented. The argument that many frauds are too complex or too long to be tried by a jury gains credence from the current failures. Despite this, it is probably too soon to write off trial by jury in fraud cases - especially since juries have returned commonsense verdicts in cases which have reached completion such as Guinness One and Barlow Clowes. Judges could do more to help juries by simplifying proceedings along the lines envisaged by Roskill. With a tougher approach during pre-trial hearings to reduce cases to manageable proportions, it should be possible to complete most cases in the six weeks Sir Frederick recalled as necessary for his most complicated case. Finally, the SFO appears to be under-resourced to deal with major fraud cases. To judge by its performance, a budget of less than Pounds 15m is inadequate to tackle the investigation and prosecution of frauds involving Pounds 4.5bn - or to attract high quality professionals to its staff. Reflecting the words of Mr Justice Henry yesterday after the collapse of the second Guinness trial, the present failure to find a just and effective system for prosecuting serious fraud cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

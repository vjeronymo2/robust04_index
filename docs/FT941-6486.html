			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Another Keating minister quits: Grants scheme administration is called 'deficient' Mr Paul Keating's Labor government yesterday suffered its third senior ministerial resignation in as many months, when Ms Ros Kelly, who held the sports, environment and territories portfolio, announced she was quitting. Ms Kelly has been battling allegations she gave preference to marginal Labor electorates when administering a ADollars 30m (Dollars 21.5m) sports and cultural grants scheme before last year's general election. She has maintained no impropriety occurred but has been unable to produce substantial evidence explaining how the grants were made. Senator Graham Richardson will take over most of Ms Kelly's duties, while retaining his health portfolio. The government thus avoids another cabinet reshuffle. Mr Keating will resume responsibility for the 'status of women'. A parliamentary committee yesterday described Ms Kelly's administration of the sports and cultural grants scheme as 'deficient. The minister did not approach the minimum standard in relation to supporting her decisions with documented reasons,' it said, but fell short of censuring her. Five opposition committee members issued a dissenting report, accusing the government members of shortening the inquiry. The dissidents claimed: 'It is beyond reasonable doubt that (the) programme has been used and refined as a part of the government's marginal-seat election strategy and that the grants were used to seek electoral advantage'. They said the minister should be censured. In December, Mr John Dawkins quit as treasurer, as did Mr Alan Griffiths, industry minister, in January.</p>

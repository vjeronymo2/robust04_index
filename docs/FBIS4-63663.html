			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation in Crimea is largely calm, RIA was  told by (Petr Chernichevich), an advisor to the Crimean  president on military issues. However, he said that some  tension could nevertheless be sensed, caused by the  unpredictability of the Ukrainian authorities' next moves.    Reinforcements are constantly arriving at the Ukrainian  National Guard units in Simferopol and Sevastopol. The number  of guards has already reached 2,000, consisting mainly of men  from western Ukraine who arrived in Simferopol on Sunday. They  have also received 29 armored personnel carriers, according to  Chernichevich.    All important sites in the Crimean capital remain under the  strict guard of interior troop units loyal to the Crimean  Government, and the city's streets are being patrolled by  Crimean Cossacks.</p>

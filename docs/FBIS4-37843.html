			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has called on the Yemeni  leaders to resolve the situation and stop the fighting  immediately. He deeply regretted the violation of the  cease-fire for the sixth time today and reiterated the need to  implement Security Council Resolution 924 and restore the  constructive dialogue between the two sides.    In statements he made today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the  Yemeni crisis has in fact entered a stage of  internationalization, with the Security Council's intervention.  He noted that the Arab League had tried to resolve the crisis,  but its mission was unsuccessful.    He ruled out the possibility of sending an Arab League  delegation on a new mediation mission to resolve the Yemeni  crisis. But he referred to possible Arab League participation  as part of a UN delegation undertaking to arrange a cease-fire  there.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say that the Arab League's  Secretariat General is at present coordinating with the United  Nations in the search for a solution to the crisis. He added  that the Arab League does not aim to compete with any other  party or to exclude anyone from the solution mechanism, but its  main objective is to reach a cease-fire and search for a  settlement through a constructive and objective dialogue between  the Yemeni parties.    On the question of the Arab League's recognition of the  south  Yemeni state, he said: We in the Arab League are bound by rules  and laws that stem from the Charter and its council's authority.  He added: The Arab League accepted the unity of the two Yemeni  sectors when the north and south were joined into one state that  became the Yemeni people's legitimate representative.    He said that any change in this status requires referral to  the League's Charter and its council's authority. He expressed  his belief that the question of recognition is not the only  issue being raised now. He added that the main issue is the  cease-fire and the restoration of a dialogue between the Yemeni  parties. He added that it is premature to raise the question of  recognizing south Yemen at the Arab League level.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say that the Arab League member  states are sovereign. If one of these countries recognizes  south Yemen unilaterally without the Arab League's involvement,  the League would have no authority over it.    He stressed that the Arab League is constantly coordinating  with the representatives accredited to it and with the United  Nations through the League's New York offfice, which is  constantly sending reports on the latest Yemeni crisis  developments in the United Nations.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said he expects the Security Council to  hold another meeting to emphasize the cease-fire resolution.  But he ruled out a Security Council resolution imposing  international sanctions on any party that violates it.    He admitted that it is difficult for the Arab League to  adopt  a resolution on dispatching international observers to supervise  the cease-fire in Yemen, not only because Sanaa is opposed to  it, but also because there are technical, administrative, and  logistical difficulties that impede the international observers'  work in Yemen.</p>

Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 15 (CNA) -- The government will do its  best to safeguard the safety and property of overseas Chinese in  Lesotho in the absence of diplomatic relations between the two  countries, officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said  Saturday [15 January].    Taiwan suspended diplomatic ties with Lesotho Wednesday  after  the Maseru government switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing.    Currently, there are about 400 overseas Chinese residing in  the southern African kingdom, the officials pointed out, adding  that most of them are doing business in garments, groceries, and  car repairs.    As overseas Chinese have made substantial contributions to  Lesotho's economy, their safety and property should not be in  jeopardy, the officials said.    Meanwhile, they noted, a 17-member agricultural mission  previously stationed in Lesotho has withdrawn to neighboring  South Africa. The mission had been in the Kingdom since the  re-establishment of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Lesotho  in 1990.    The farm experts will be assigned to new jobs, they added.    Du Ling, director of the ministry's African Affairs  Department, left for Lesotho Thursday to deal with the problems  resulting from the diplomatic break.</p>

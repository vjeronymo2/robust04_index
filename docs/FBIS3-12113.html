			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 29  March.    According to a report by the Comptroller General's Office,  Panama's public debt totaled $7.228 billion on 31 December 1993.  The debt is broken down as follows: $1.916 billion, or 27  percent, is internal public debt; $3.795 billion, or 53 percent,  is external public debt; and $1.517 billion, or 21 percent, is  overdue interest and commissions corresponding to the foreign  public debt, mostly international commercial banks.  (Percentages are as published.) The document says that the  amortization of this debt demands the largest disbursements from  the state's budget, with the exception of the government  payroll. The country's public debt is 1.1 times larger than the  1993 GNP, which the Office estimates at $6.5619 billion. In an  effort to amortize this amount, the government allocated $693  million in the current fiscal year's budget to service the  internal and external public debt. This amount is equivalent to  18 percent of this year's allocation for the public sector's  operating expenses and to 23 percent of current revenues.  (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 22 March 94 p 1A)    Victoria Garibaldo, director of the Consular and Shipping  Department, has reported to ACAN-EFE that so far this year the  country has received $14.71 million from ship registrations and  that this amount exceeds by 5.5 percent the amount estimated for  the first quarter of 1994. She said that Panama leads with  12,496 registered ships and a gross tonnage that exceeded 77  million as of 15 January 1994. The department expects to  collect about $43 million in direct revenues this year. The  country received $41.33 million in direct revenues last year. In  addition, indirect revenues from ship registrations amount to  more $60 million, Garibaldo said. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish  2037 GMT 23 March 94)    The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise the daily  interbank interest rate to 3.50 percent will particularly affect  those who borrow for consumption, amortize mortages, or  refinance enterprises. In Panama, the most important effect of  this decision is that the country will now be negotiating with  private banks a substantial portion of its debt, more than $2  billion in principal and close to $1.3 billion in interest.  Since October 1993, the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy  has raised the cost of Panama's commercial debt by an estimated  $20 million annually. Arturo Tapia, president of Wall Street  Securities, has said that the higher interest rates should not  harm Panama's economic growth because such rates are taken into  consideration by investors.

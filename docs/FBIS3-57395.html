According to an appropriate  presidential decree, released in Tashkent on Saturday, the new  body will "promote economic reform, guarantee privatization, and  encourage free enterprise in the republic."    The president gave the cabinet two weeks to form the council  and one month to work out a privatization program to transform  restricted joint stock companies into private businesses where  all citizens can buy shares.    According to the document, shops and public services with  the  land they stand on can be bought by local residents and  foreigners without declaring their source of income.    The decree lifts restrictions on the amount of hard currency  and CIS money allowed for local citizens and foreigners to bring  in and out of Uzbekistan.    Joint ventures producing consumer goods will no longer be  taxed on their profits in convertible currency, if foreign  investments in their statute fund do not exceed 50%.    Custom duties on all imports will be totally lifted by July  1, 1995.    The decree also lists administrative bodies authorized to  permit the setting up of businesses and fix temporary custom  duties on exports to CIS and other countries. It also lists  commodities prohibited for export to CIS and other states. The  prohibition applies to flour, meat, butter, tea, sugar, and  artifacts of significant value.    As Finance Minister Bakhtiyar, a deputy prime minister, has  reported, in the first half of this year the republic intends to  introduce the "sum" - a national monetary unit that will replace  the temporary coupons, now in circulation.    Speaking at an international seminar on banking in Tashkent,  he declared that the main task for Uzbekistan in credit policy  today was to attract more investment in key projects, primarily  in the fuel and energy complex and in gold-mining.    He admitted that although the republic annually mined up to  50 tons of gold and nearly 90 tons of uranium, it had no policy  of managing gold and currency reserves and securities.</p>

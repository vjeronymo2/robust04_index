			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santiago, 18 May (EFE) -- Today, lawyer Juan  Pablo Hermosilla, who is defending Chilean businessman Carlos  Cardoen, told EFE that there is a risk the United States may  order the kidnapping of his client to take him to Miami to try  him on charges of illegal exportation of a mineral used in Air  Force cluster bombs.    The lawyer said that "we discussed the subject during our  conversation with U.S. prosecutors, but apparently they will try  to obtain Cardoen's extradition."    Hermosilla said, however, that the risk of kidnapping  exists,  as when the United States ordered the kidnapping of a Mexican  medical doctor accused of drug trafficking. He added: "It is a  risk, so we will therefore adopt legal measures, as that is  illegal in Chile."    The lawyer mentioned the subject when EFE consulted him  about  the trial that began today against the Teledyne company, which  is accused of having sold to the Cardoen company 100 tons of  zircon used to manufacture cluster bombs for the Iraqi Army, a  fact that was omitted when the export permit was requested.    Juan Pablo Hermosilla said "it was well known that the  Cardoen company used zircon to manufacture cluster bombs,  something that was even described in the company's advertising  leaflets at the time, and was known by all U.S. diplomats  accredited in Chile."    The lawyer said that the article published yesterday in THE  NEW YORK TIMES is mistaken in describing zircon as an explosive  material.    "That is not so. It is as if I were to say that the steel  used in the bolts holding the cluster bomb shell together is an  explosive material."    Hermosilla said that the purchase of zircon from Teledyne  was  made directly by the Cardoen company, and not by a subsidiary.  [passage omitted]</p>

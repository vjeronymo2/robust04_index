			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Confidential drug pricing information'' includes both ``best price'' and ``average manufacturer price.'' The quoted price and the actual price given by the manufacturer to the covered entity are not confidential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Duplicate Discount/Rebate Potential <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, a covered entity billing on a cost basis for drug purchases must provide the Office of Drug Pricing with a pharmacy Medicaid number (the number which the entity uses to bill Medicaid for medications). Second, a covered entity using an all-inclusive rate (either per encounter or visit) must submit its all-inclusive Medicaid number (e.g., ``FQ'' number). Third, if a covered entity does not bill Medicaid for outpatient drugs, then the entity must notify the Office of this decision. Fourth, a large facility which houses many different clinics, only several of which are eligible, must obtain a separate Medicaid provider number for the eligible clinics. For those States which cannot generate additional Medicaid provider numbers for entities, covered entities must discuss an alternative arrangement with the States to accomplish this objective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This information will be posted on the Electronic Data Retrieval System (EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug Pricing, to indicate which covered entities have elected to participate in the program. For access to the EDRS call (301) 594&hyph;4992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a drug is purchased by or on behalf of a Medicaid beneficiary, the amount billed may not exceed the entity's actual acquisition cost for the drug, as charged by the manufacturer at a price consistent with the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, plus a reasonable dispensing fee established by the State Medicaid agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Eligibility for Retroactive Discounts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Until 30 days after publication of this notice, eligible covered entities included on the initial eligibility list may request retroactive discounts (discounts, rebates, or account credit) for covered outpatient drugs purchased retroactive to December 1, 1992. Entities added to the eligibility list at a later date may only request discounts retroactive to the date of their inclusion on the list. Of the entities listed on the eligibility list, only the following may request these discounts: The covered entity that_(1) has billed for covered outpatient drugs using an all-inclusive rate (either per visit or per encounter), or (2) has not billed Medicaid for covered outpatient drugs since December 1, 1992, (or since its inclusion on the eligibility list), or (3) has submitted its Medicaid provider number and is requesting refunds for subsequent periods, or (4) has adequate documentation proving that drugs for which a retroactive discount is being requested have not generated Medicaid rebates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A DSH is not eligible for retroactive discounts for covered outpatient drugs purchased through a group purchasing organization (GPO) or any group purchasing arrangement. Any DSH outpatient clinic which is or will be eligible for retroactive discounts may preserve its rights by sending manufacturers a letter requesting such refunds and providing adequate documentation of purchases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Entity Guidelines Regarding Drug Diversion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Covered entities are required not to resell or otherwise transfer outpatient drugs purchased at the statutory discount to an individual who is not a patient of the entity. There are several common situations in which this might occur. First, if individuals other than patients of the covered entity obtain covered outpatient drugs from its pharmaceutical dispensing facility, the entity must develop and institute adequate safeguards to prevent the transfer of discounted outpatient drugs to individuals who are not eligible for the discount (e.g., separate purchasing accounts and dispensing records). Second, a larger institution which contains an eligible entity within its structure is required to establish separate purchasing accounts and maintain separate dispensing records for the eligible entity. Third, the covered entity itself may not use the covered outpatient drug in excluded services (e.g., inpatient services). If an entity offers services excluded from the drug discount program, the entity must develop a separate method for purchasing and dispensing drugs for excluded services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The covered entity may, at its option, develop an alternative system, short of tracking each discounted drug through the purchasing and dispensing process, by which it can prove compliance. If an alternate system of tracking is proposed to be used, this system must be approved by the Drug Pricing Program. The Office will develop criteria for alternative systems at a later date and welcomes all suggestions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Audit Requirement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All entities receiving statutory prices are required to maintain records of purchases of covered outpatient drugs and of any claims for reimbursement submitted for such drugs under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The entity must permit HHS and the manufacturer to audit any record of a covered drug purchase that was subject to the discount, as provided by section 340B(a)(5)(C) of the PHS Act. Manufacturer audits will be conducted in accordance with procedures developed by the Secretary of HHS. The Office of Drug Pricing is developing proposed audit guidelines which will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with public comment invited. The notice will address only audits related to purchases as a covered entity; it does not address other audit requirements related to participation in State Medicaid programs or receipt of Federal funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

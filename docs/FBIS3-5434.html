			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In another message from Beijing to National Assembly  Chairman Samdech Chea Sim and to Samdech Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, Cambodia's first and second prime  ministers, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk says that he has  plans to stay in Cambodia for two months starting from the day  he arrives on 8 April.    The king, however, says that his Chinese doctors have  prohibited him from going out of the royal palace to visit  various provinces because of his health.    In his previous message he said that he planned to visit  some  provinces in May, after his arrival in Cambodia on 8 April;  however, these visits have to be canceled because of his  doctors' instructions. The previous message also reveals that  the king also plans to mark the 90th anniversary of his late  mother, Queen Sisowath Kosomak; meet with the royal government;  and receive guests and various credentials, and so on.    The king notes that Chinese doctors have suggested that he  return to Beijing in May to continue the treatment of his bone  marrow cancer with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The Prince  Father, however, insisted that he wanted to stay in Cambodia for  two months saying that he seems to have recovered his strength.  The prince says in a moving sentence that "If I am still alive  and my health gets better, I want to visit Kratie, Pursat, Stung  Treng, Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri, and Koh Kong Provinces."    Since the king cannot visit the provinces, he has invited  delegations from over 10 provinces to see him and the royal  consort for about an hour at the Tevea Vinichhai Pavilion in the  royal palace. He has also asked that careful protection be  given to avoid incidents when these provincial delegations  travel to Phnom Penh.</p>

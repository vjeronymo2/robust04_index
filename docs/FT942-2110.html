			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: Hung, but by its own petard - This is not art but a product marketed as such In their very different ways, the two exhibitions now filling the Anthony d'Offay galleries say much the same thing of the present avant-garde, at least in its high commercial aspect. None of it is shocking, any more, and goodness knows it must sell very well or it would hardly be where it is. In one sense, at least, it makes very good sense indeed. But while none of us objects to the successful turning of an honest crust, we are left with a legitimate question hanging in the air: what has any of it to do with art? For what seems to be on offer here is not art as such but a product marketed as art, which is not quite the same thing. Perhaps it is but the cynical exploitation of a gullible market - but need we weep for those in a position to be thus exploited? No: a fool and his money, and all that. Only when it begins to take itself seriously, to seek to justify itself in high and abstract terms, does the cynicism betray itself. Of the two artists on show, Georg Baselitz is at once the more interesting as an artist and, in consequence, the more seriously dispiriting. For here is the once powerful and original painter who, in the late 1970s, adopted the bare formula of turning his pictures upside-down. He has never looked back. At the Venice Biennale of 1980 he showed a monstrous reclining and gesticulating figure. It was rudely carved but possessed even so a raw energy and primitive authority. His sculpture, like his painting, has grown ever more crude and perfunctory in both image and execution ever since. In this latest show are three large wood-carvings, though hacked rather than carved would be a better description. One is a monumental head, faintly reminiscent in its profile of the Indian tradition. The others are one-armed torsos, of which the larger retains what passes for a head. All three are presented in their raw state, but for the selective application of bright red paint to breasts, eyes and mouths. Again, to say the paint is applied is generous, for in truth it is slapped on, to stick where it hits. This is what Heinrich Heil has to say in his catalogue note: 'Baselitz is on the move, a man possessed . . . he crisscrosses the quarry of past forms, preparing the way for his pandemonic will to return in ever new formations . . . Heathenry pervades the entire body of Frau Paganismus (Mistress Paganism) - instilled in her by Baselitz, the intellectual iconoclast, not in order to cast out the Alien but to find the Other beneath the gashed smoothness of sacred sculpture.' Is it only such rubbish as this, that would have us take it so seriously, that gives cynicism its bad name; or do Heil and Baselitz themselves believe in it? The thought that Baselitz is not a cynic at all, but a true believer, would be a matter for real and lasting despair. Whichever the case, the tragedy is that he remains the artist in potential he always was. Even as they stand, these carvings are possessed of a remarkable physical presence for being the lumps of wood they are. What Baselitz offers us in such things, alas, is only the proposition of image and idea, never the resolution. Jeff Koons could never be accused of not taking things far enough. In the face of his excesses, how we wish he could. His mystery lies only in how he has advanced so far in his reputation as an artist at all. We are back to Marcel Duchamp again, and, with his urinal and bicycle wheel, to his ironical play on the nature and status of the work of art  - only the poor old innocent was not to know that his ready-made would become the byword for all that is mindless and facile in late 20th century art. Koons has made his fortune by it, first declaring himself as an artist, some 10 years ago, by showing squadrons of brand-new Hoovers in gallery cabinets, and floating basket-balls - eat your heart out, Damien Hirst  - in tanks of water. So he has progressed, as we can see, through model railway engines in stainless steel; St John the Baptist with a pig and penguin in porcelain; naked children; a pile comprising a pig, goat, two dogs and a bird in painted wood; a bear and a policeman; to vases of carved wooden flowers, and wooden poodles. Only the works from the 'Marriage Made in Heaven', to Ilona Staller, 'la Cicciolina' - now on the rocks - are missing. Here then is the celebration of the kitsch and the banal, with its circular and self-serving justification that goes back to Dada, though the wit gets ever thinner - object, and you have missed the point: accept, and still you have missed the point. What does Koons have to say about it all? 'I believe that taste is really unimportant: salesmen are today's great communicators: I believe artists must exploit themselves, and they must also take the responsibility to exploit their viewers: I am completely adaptable. In the art world I have always found everyone very weak. The art world really has been up for grabs.' He at least is an open cynic. Georg Baselitz: Frau Paganismus; until July 30: Jeff Koons: A Survey; until August 18. Both at the Anthony d'Offay galleries, Dering Street, W1.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Gatt plan is forecast to boost world tradeby Dollars 195bn WORLD SALES of goods and services would rise by Dollars 195bn (Pounds 110bn) a year within a decade if measures planned in the Gatt talks were adopted, says a report * published today by the OECD Development Centre, the Paris-based economic research unit. Member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development stand to gain the most, with sub-Saharan Africa the biggest loser. Developed countries would still be net beneficiaries even after compensating the losers, says the report. The 10-year forecasts are based on an OECD/World Bank computer model of global production and trade which evaluated three options: no change in tariffs, a 30 per cent reduction, roughly what is being considered in the protracted Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the removal of all barriers to trade. In this last case, annual world income is forecast to be Dollars 477bn higher than it would otherwise be in 2002, a gain worth more than the entire income of China, says the report. With agriculture at the centre of the Gatt talks, the report criticises protectionism as 'inefficient for supporting farm incomes'. It says that 60 per cent of the cost of protectionism fails to reach farmers, and recommends direct income support with other targeted assistance instead. Cutting tariffs by 30 per cent would raise the world price for cereals. While this would hurt net food importers, including much of Africa, what matters is their 'economic power to grow or buy food - rather than the national level of agricultural production'. The losses of food importers could be balanced by a transfer of Dollars 7bn, which is 3.5 per cent of the developed world's gains from falling tariffs and equivalent to less than 20 per cent of official development assistance. Growth in world grain production would fall slightly to 2.95 per cent a year. The share of wheat production of the US and the EC would decline, with the gap being filled by Latin America, the former Soviet Union and poor Asian and African countries. The 30 per cent cut in tariffs would 'induce structural changes in virtually all regions', the report adds. Rural parts of OECD countries would see a real 7 per cent fall in gross domestic product, while urban areas would see a real increase of 0.3 per cent. Similar shifts would occur in high-income parts of Asia and in the Gulf region, although the picture in developing countries is more complicated. Rural regions of Africa and India would benefit while those in low-income Asia would do less well than towns and cities because of local tariff structures. The full liberalisation model yields much sharper changes. Real rural GDP in OECD member states would be 21 per cent lower than if tariffs did not change. But this would be more than offset by a rise of 1 per cent in urban GDP, says the report. * Trade Liberalisation: What's at Stake, by Ian Goldin and Dominique van der Mensbrugghe, available free after May 26 from OECD Development Centre, 94 rue Chardon-Lagache, Paris 75016.

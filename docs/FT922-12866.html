			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on index-linked buying Tokyo THE Nikkei average closed higher after a volatile session dominated by index-linked activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index finally closed up 202.93 at 17,439.58. It fell below the 17,000 mark in the morning on arbitrage unwinding, declining to the day's low of 16,879.97, but later rose in the afternoon on index-linked buying and bargain-hunting, reaching the day's high of 17,607.69. Volume fell to 250m shares from 280m. Advances outnumbered declines by 563 to 411, with 160 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 19.19 to 1,288.80. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.45 to 1,047.22. Traders said the volatility was caused by last week's increase in margins on Nikkei 225 stock futures transactions by the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. Futures trading on Simex has been under criticism recently for distorting the cash stock market in Tokyo. The initial margin on futures trading on the Simex was raised from Y1m to Y1.25m, while additional margin was raised from Y800,000 to Y1m. Activity centred on speculative issues. Stocks with an Aids theme were sought by short-term investors, with Okamoto, the condom maker, up Y120 to Y1,180 and Meiji Milk Products advancing Y45 to Y775. Speculative favourites also firmed, with Nippon Carbon surging Y100 to Y651. Bank shares were higher on short-covering. Industrial Bank of Japan added Y100 to Y1,710 and Mitsubishi Bank rose Y150 to Y1,750. Sega Enterprises, the video game manufacturer, fell Y110 to Y8,840, following Monday's Y1,000 plunge. Investors sold the issue on a US court finding against Sega for alleged patent infringement. Market participants sought Nintendo, Sega's rival, which added Y290 to Y9,600. High-technology issues were higher on small-lot bargain hunting by individuals and foreigners. Fujitsu rose Y20 to Y680 and Sony advanced Y30 to Y4,110. Car stocks were mixed: Nissan Motor fell Y8 to Y590, while Honda Motor rose Y50 to Y1,630 on active buying. Traders said that rumours that an US car group was accumulating Honda shares triggered speculative activity. Mr Andrew Blair-Smith, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the company's large exposure to the US following an expected upturn in the US car market, also encouraged investors. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 238.94 to 19,344.30 in volume of 13.4m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday. Bombay was closed. HONG KONG closed weaker with the announcement by HSBC Holdings of its merger terms for Midland Bank of the UK coming after the market had closed. HSBC ended 25 cents down at HKDollars 39.25. The Hang Seng index declined 5.61 to 4,883.53 in turnover of HKDollars 1.52bn. SINGAPORE finished higher but trading was quiet in the absence of corporate news. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 3.46 to 1,377.32 in volume of 19.8m shares. SEOUL fell slightly. The composite index lost 2.63 to 575.56 in turnover of Won252.88bn. TAIWAN rose in early trading before falling back slightly. The weighted index ended 56.54 higher at 4,461.98 in turnover of TDollars 17.56bn. MANILA rose after the government announced it was cutting fuel prices. The composite index gained 13.15 to 1,149.24 in turnover of 94.6m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR extended Monday's losses. The composite index fell 3.0 to 564.51 in volume of 24.1m shares. AUSTRALIA fell slightly in quiet trade. The All Ordinaries index closed down 4.5 at 1,565.6 in turnover of ADollars 114.4m. Volume was 53.8m shares, the lowest since January 1991.</p>

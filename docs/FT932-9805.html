			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Separate development Gencor's long-awaited decision to demerge its non-mining interests looks like a sensible response to changing political circumstances in South Africa. The African National Congress has voiced strong opposition to the complex webs of cross shareholdings between South African companies. Gencor has decided to jump before it was pushed. The former chairman, Mr Derek Keys, did much to transform Gencor's insular culture. As finance minister, he has had responsibility for the legislation which will make such unbundling easier. The financial rationale for the move, however, looks more specious. While the managements of the individual businesses may have greater flexibility, Sankorp and Rembrandt will still have near-controlling stakes in each of the companies - most notably in Gencor's mining operations. Since the move has been well flagged, Gencor's discount to net assets is also unlikely to improve much. Foreign investors are still more likely to be deterred by the political risks of investing in South Africa however transparent the structure of corporate ownership. This demerger will also increase pressure on other combines. Life assurance companies which control a large segment of domestic savings may be forced to unwind their complex cross shareholdings in industrial companies. The greatest discomfort, however, will be felt in the Anglo American Corporation, which effectively controls almost a quarter of the quoted South African market. The Oppenheimer family's resistance to unbundling will doubtless continue, and the creation of De Beers Centenary in Switzerland creates a trap-door escape from South Africa. But skill will be needed if the Anglo pyramid is not to become a monument to a weakened dynasty.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 15 (XINHUA) -- The State Council,  China's highest governing body, has decided to tighten the  management of trading in property rights of state-owned  enterprises.    In a circular distributed nationwide recently, the general  office of the State Council said that such trading organized by  governments of province-level areas is subject to State Council  approval.    Governments of cities below the prefectural level may not  organize such trading, the circular said.    "Property rights of state-owned enterprises belong to the  state," it stressed.    The transfer of such rights of locally-managed state-owned  companies is subject to approval of governments of cities above  the prefectural level, it said.    The transfer of such rights of state-owned companies managed  by central departments is subject to State Council approval. So  is the transfer of large state-owned enterprises, including  those run by local governments, the circular noted.    Before transferring their property rights, state-owned firms  must evaluate their assets, including their land-use rights, and  handle necessary procedures concerning changes in their property  rights, it said.    Proceeds from the transfer of such rights must be used,  first  of all, to repay bank loans and make living arrangements for  employees of state-owned enterprises, it said.    The remainder of such proceeds then can be used by local  governments to aid structural readjustment or fund other  state-owned companies, but may not be used as regular  expenditures or to offset budgetary deficits or issue wages and  bonuses.    The circular banned the sale of such property rights at an  unrealistically low price, the free distribution of such rights  to individuals and the transfer of such rights on credit.    It mandated government bodies to take specific measures to  provide jobs and social security to workers of state-owned  enterprises.    It also asked relevant State Council departments to promptly  formulate a set of new regulations governing the management of  trading of property rights of state-run enterprises.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DENOUNCES ROMANIA OVER DEATHS OF PROTESTERS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration denounced Romania as the last police state in Eastern  Europe and vowed Tuesday to try to find a way to punish the regime for its  bloody repression of anti-government demonstrators as reports of violence  mounted.  </P> <P> The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug cited reports, which it conceded were  unconfirmed, that the death toll may have reached 2,000 in weekend clashes in  western Romania near the Hungarian border. Other news agencies reported  casualty figures ranging from a few dozen to several hundred.  </P> <P> Romania sealed its borders to the outside world Monday. Attempts to reach the  country by telephone were usually met by busy signals.  </P> <P> In a report from Budapest, United Press International said visitors returning  to Hungary from western Romania were describing a Tian An Men Square-style  massacre of pro-democracy dissidents, with morgues filled with bodies and tanks  patrolling the streets.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Washington is reviewing its  already chilly relationship with Romania in search of "actions which can  meaningfully be taken" and that it is discussing with its European allies a  range of coordinated sanctions against Bucharest.  </P> <P> Quoting from reports filed by the U.S. Embassy in Romania, Tutwiler said the  crackdown seems to have been limited to the area around Timisoara, a city of  about 300,000 people in Transylvania. She said the embassy has sent two  diplomats to the area to obtain firsthand information. She said that the  embassy has been unable so far to determine the extent of the death toll.  </P> <P> Tanjug and Budapest Radio reported more clashes Tuesday. The Associated Press,  quoting Greek students who escaped to Yugoslavia, said that shooting was  continuing in Timisoara and that fires were burning in the city.  </P> <P> The students said many children were killed or wounded "because people used  them as shields" in the erroneous belief that security forces would hold their  fire.  </P> <P> A Romanian doctor who arrived in Austria spoke of protesters stoning armored  vehicles. He said that one vehicle drove into the crowd, crushing a woman. The  AP reported that rows of people were mowed down by gunfire.  </P> <P> Tanjug reported from Bucharest that students in the capital have declared  solidarity with the protesters in Timisoara and that police guards, in  response, were posted in dormitories.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and leaders of other  governments, both East and West, joined Bush Administration officials in  condemning the Nicolae Ceausescu regime.  </P> <P> "The repressive measures undertaken by the Romanian government are totally  unjustified and stand in stark contrast to the positive changes taking place  elsewhere in Eastern Europe," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  said.  </P> <P> "The demonstrations in Timisoara and elsewhere were a result of the systematic  denial of human rights to the people of Romania, particularly to members of the  Hungarian minority," Fitzwater added.  </P> <P> Romania was once Washington's favorite member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact  because of Ceausescu's independent foreign policy, despite the regime's chronic  suppression of human rights. At one time, the United States praised Romania for  refusing to march in lockstep with its allies.  </P> <P> But with economic and political reform sweeping across Eastern Europe,  Ceausescu's continuing refusal to conform has made him a pariah on both sides  of the crumbling Iron Curtain.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, talking to reporters after an unprecedented visit to North  Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels, said the Soviet Union  "categorically opposed the use of force."  </P> <P> Referring to the brutal repression of demonstrators by Soviet troops in  Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia, earlier this year, Shevardnadze said:  "Let me remind you of the tragic events in Tbilisi, after which I had to speak  to the people. I condemned that (the use of force) in my remarks there.  </P> <P> "Our position is the same wherever it happens," he added. "Problems must be  resolved through political means."  </P> <P> In Prague, the Czechoslovak Parliament passed a resolution expressing "profound  anger" at events in Romania. The government television network showed Polish  and Hungarian parliaments also condemning the action of the Romanian security  forces. Even Bulgaria, which had never before protested the action of another  member of the Warsaw Pact, expressed "serious concern" over Romania's decision  to close its frontier.  </P> <P> Tutwiler said the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest "intends to protest in the  strongest possible terms based on what our (diplomats) are reporting to us."  </P> <P> She said the Administration is "reviewing our bilateral relationship, including  economic, scientific and other areas, to determine if there are other actions  which can be meaningfully taken."  </P> <P> However, Washington has comparatively little leverage. In February, 1988,  Romania renounced the most-favored-nation trade status that it had enjoyed for  more than a decade.  </P></p>

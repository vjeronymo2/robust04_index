Kolesnikov said these abominable publications are aimed at  splitting the leadership of the Defence Ministry and thus  weakening one of the most stable institutions of the state --  the armed forces.    In his statement for the press circulated by the Information  and Press Agency of the Defence Ministry, the chief of the  General Staff said no secret is made of the work of the Defence  Ministry. Its work can always be discussed in an open and  constructive way. Representatives of the media are informed of  every important function of the Defence Ministry or of the  General Staff. Those who are really interested in getting  reliable information about the armed forces have every  opportunity to receive this information, the statement says.</p>

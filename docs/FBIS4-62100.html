			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Today" newscast: Report from the Baltiyskiy </F> Zavod shipyard in St. Petersburg on cruiser Petr Velikiy by  Sergey Dedukh and Vladimir Spirenkov]    [Text] Despite defense budget cuts and the decline of the  arms industry, Russia continues to build warships. An NTV  camera team was able to visit the Baltiyskiy Zavod shipyard in  St. Petersburg where the nuclear cruiser Petr Velikiy is being  built -- the biggest surface ship currently under construction  in Russia. Until now no TV company has managed to visit this  ship, although interest remains high.    The building of the cruiser Petr Velikiy -- a giant ship and  a unique technological creation -- began in 1988. After the  unfinished ship was launched, difficulties with funding set in.  For some 18 months the cruiser and its builders waited for their  fate to be decided.    In his day, [Tsar] Peter I encouraged merchants to form  guilds which then built ships with their own resources. The  Ministry of Defense cannot resort to such simple solutions.  Major banks were invited to furnish the funds for the ship  which is to become the pride of the Russian Navy. But the  present-day financiers showed no interest in this project. The  money was nonetheless found, and construction and finishing  operations are to be completed by the fall of next year. The  Defense Ministry leadership regards the Petr Velikiy as a  priority project.    [Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense  minister] The Armed Forces need this ship, and so does the  country, despite the difficult situation it is in. Even in this  difficult situation the country cannot permit such unique  creations to remain unfinished.    [Unidentified correspondent] The Petr Velikiy is the latest  modification in a series of four similar ships. The cruiser is  nuclear-powered. And these are the tubes for launching cruise  missiles. Apart from them the cruiser will be armed with  large-caliber guns, torpedoes, and anti-aircraft guns and will  be able to carry two helicopters. The cruiser will have a crew  of 780, most of whom are already taking part in building the  ship. The workers, who have carried on working even after their  pay was no longer forthcoming, are promising that the St.  Andrew's flag will be hoisted on the Petr Velikiy in September  of next year in time for the celebrations of the 300th  anniversary of the Russian Navy. It is envisaged that the  cruiser will serve in the Pacific.    Apart from Russia, only the United States has ships of this  kind.

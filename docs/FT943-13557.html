			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Observer: Count on me Ignoring the fact that nature helpfully provided most people with 10 fingers, the London Stock Exchange tried to smooth the way to 10-day rolling settlement yesterday. It sent out an abacus to a select few investors. The gift - featuring black plastic beads on a steel frame - went to those in City firms who were involved in planning rolling settlement. Of course, merely a bauble; no suggestion that some types actually need aids to tot up their takings - or otherwise.</p>

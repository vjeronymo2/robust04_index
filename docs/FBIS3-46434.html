The Industrial and Commercial Bank, China's largest  specialized bank, has taken the lead in the computerization of  Chinese banks. At the end of last year, the bank signed a  contract with Unix China Ltd. for the purchase of 2,000 sets of  the Unix SVR 4.2/CE system valued at Rmb [renminbi] 3 million  yuan.    Unix China Ltd. is a joint venture between companies from  the  U.S., Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. The SVR 4.2 system  was developed by the U.S. partners.    Jia Yaoliang, president of Unix China Ltd., said at today's  press conference that the Industrial and Commercial Bank is the  first large-scale state-owned Chinese financial enterprise to  purchase licensed software in batches.    He also noted that the bank's purchase of licensed software  will reflect China's implementation of regulations for software  protection, as well as establish China's software industry and  promote international cooperation.</p>

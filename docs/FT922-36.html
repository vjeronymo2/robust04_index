			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Anger behind the township grief: The mood at Boipatong's funeral 'TERRIBLE were the things that happened here; lucky are those who did not see it.' With cadences almost biblical in their ring, and with language stark in its simplicity, Mr Simon Moloi gave a harrowing account of Boipatong's nightmare and his personal tragedy. In one of the coffins surrounded by the sombre funeral crowd before him lay the body of his wife, eight months pregnant when slaughtered. Late on the night of June 17 men carrying axes and speaking Zulu began a township rampage that has gone down in the annals of South Africa's bloody post-apartheid history, Mr Moloi told yesterday's vast Boipatong gathering. Two white men carrying guns accompanied the gang, he told the vast crowd, hushed but for the sobbing of relatives gathered around the coffins of 34 of the 42 victims. Mr Moloi was separated from his wife amid the carnage. A low moan of shared pain came from the crowd as Mr Moloi described the ghastly moment when he lifted the blanket covering a corpse and identified his wife. Later the mood changed. While Mr Moloi had had the air of detachment that sometimes accompanies intense grief, other speakers were gripped by an anger and passion which may bring a new dimension to South African politics. The anger might have been expected from the radical Mr Chris Hani, leader of the South African Communist party and head of the ANC's military wing, or the firebrand trade unionist, Mr Jay Naidoo. But their sentiments were echoed by most other speakers and they struck a responsive note that echoed beyond the crowd and into South Africa's tense townships. Archbishop Trevor Huddlestone, the veteran anti-apartheid campaigner entered into the spirit of the day, preaching the virtue of hate when applied to a virtuous cause such as the destruction of apartheid. He had always said that apartheid would be defeated in his lifetime, he reminded the crowd, and added a touch of grim humour: 'I'm in my 80th year. So get on with it, time is short.' By early afternoon, the speeches over, a long cortege made its way to nearby Sharpeville cemetery, where Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu began an emotional funeral service. Outside the cemetery, the mood had been changing as the procession inched its way through the township streets. Those streets - often no more than rutted dirt tracks - had been cleared for the occasion of the makeshift barricades blocking the way of armoured patrols. The townships' angry youths were out in strength, brandishing placards denouncing President FW de Klerk as a murderer. 'One settler, one bullet,' chanted supporters of the radical Pan Africanist Congress. Others moved in gangs, performing the toyi-toyi, a rhythmic knee-high dance of defiance and revolution. By late afternoon, the coffins were being lowered into graves. But tension was growing and one onlooker warned of trouble to come. Thankfully, those forebodings were not realised despite skirmishes between police and mourners. By late evening it seemed that the day had ended without serious incident. But as the programme of mass action gets under way, bloodshed seems inevitable. The threat of violence, as demonstrators confront security forces, is just below the surface.</p>

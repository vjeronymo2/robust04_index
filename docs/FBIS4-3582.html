			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, April 21 (XINHUA) -- China will set up an  automobile market chain in Beijing next month.    Preparations started in October 1993, and the chain went  into  trial operation last February in this capital city of Ningxia  Hui Autonomous Region.    Preparations are underway to move the headquarters of the  chain from Yinchuan to Beijing. Meanwhile, the Beijing Asian  and Pacific Auto Market Town is expected to open May 26.    The first meeting of members of the chain is to be held in  June.    Guo Jiyuan, director of the Preparatory Committee for the  auto market chain, said that its establishment is aimed at  building an auto sales network nationwide.    Guo said efforts will be made to build wholesale centers in  major auto manufacturing and distributing areas, and to bring  along a retail sales network in the surrounding areas.    So far, more than 1,000 auto manufacturers, salesmen and  customers have showed their willingness to join the market  chain, and 110 have already signed up.    With the improvement of the people's living standards there  has been a growing demand for automobiles in China.    Statistics show that China's automobile market is as large  as  one million units a year, with 80 percent domestically produced  and 20 percent imported.    Annual sales of autos will reach two million by the year  2000, Guo predicted.    In the beginning of this year the Ministry of Machine  Industry announced 1994's plan for the auto industry, saying 1.3  million automobiles will be produced.    The auto industry, as one of the backbone industries in  China, has registered high growth in recent years. In 1993  China produced 1.18 million automobiles, an increase of 20  percent over 1992.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Thailand keeps amnesty for shootings A CONTROVERSIAL amnesty exonerating Thai military officers who ordered last month's shooting of pro-democracy demonstrators remained in force yesterday after the Constitutional Tribunal said it could not make a ruling on the matter, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon issued the amnesty covering both demonstrators and the security forces shortly before he resigned as prime minister 10 days ago. Opposition groups have demanded that army officers responsible for the deaths of at least 49 demonstrators be punished, and they have warned of further turmoil if the amnesty remains. They challenged its legality because it was not issued by the cabinet.</p>

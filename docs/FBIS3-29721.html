			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a powerful figure in the ruling  coalition, on Monday [21 February] criticized three coalition  parties opposing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to  reshuffle the cabinet.    "Placing posts (of cabinet members) is the prime minister's  exclusive authority. We should speak (only) when we are  consulted or asked for our opinions. The prime minister should  do it by his own decision," Ozawa said at a press conference.    His remarks represented a rebuke against the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake [Harbinger], the three ruling  coalition parties opposing Hosokawa's reshuffle plan.    The proposed cabinet reshuffle is expected to center on  removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, leader of  Sakigake, from his post.    Ozawa, who is regarded as the chief coalition strategist,  said he will not join the 21-member cabinet upon the reshuffle.    The seven parties are divided on the cabinet reshuffle, with  the SDPJ, the largest among the seven ruling parties, DSP and  Takemura's Sakigake against it and Shinseito and Komeito [Clean  Government Party] pushing strongly for it.    Ozawa reiterated calls for merging all seven ruling parties  into a single group to compete with the major opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election for the  House of Representatives.    Takemura has opposed Ozawa's stand to set up a two-party  system in Japan, hoping instead to form a third "liberal" force  of Sakigake, the SDPJ, the DSP and reformists from the LDP.</p>

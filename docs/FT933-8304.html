			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: GrandMet wins approval for India drinks venture GRAND METROPOLITAN, the UK-based food, drinks and retailing group, is to establish a joint venture in India to produce and market liquor for local consumption and export. The group announced yesterday that approval for the venture, which will begin operations later this year, had been granted to International Distillers and Vintners, its drinks division. IDV will have a majority interest in the new company, International Distillers India. Agreement had not yet been signed with its local, unnamed, partner but negotiations were at 'an advanced stage', GrandMet said. GrandMet has spent several years researching and planning the joint venture, which will take advantage of recent liberalisation and economic reform by the Indian government in a market worth Pounds 800m a year. 'In the light of the reforms, which are most encouraging, the way is now clear to implement our investment plan for India,' said Mr John McGrath, IDV's chief executive. 'It is a country of enormous potential both for IDV brands and, subsequently, for the wide portfolio of GrandMet's branded products.' The venture will produce and market brands such as Smirnoff vodka, Gilbey's gin, Malibu liqueur and Archer's schnapps. A marketing and sales staff of between 50 and 70 people is expected to work initially from regional offices in New Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, and Bangalore. IDV has operated a company in neighbouring Sri Lanka since 1980, and has had a production plant in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, since 1981. United Distillers, the Guinness spirits company, recently announced a joint venture in India with United Breweries, one of the country's largest drinks producers.</p>

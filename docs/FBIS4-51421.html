			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui on  Thursday [26 May] called for the government and public to close  ranks so as to accomplish the goals of national development.    Li made the call before concluding his five-day presence at  the session of the National Assembly in which he solicited  opinions from assembly members on national-affairs issues.    He said that Taiwan, behind the joint effort of the  government and people, has built up its status in the  international community behind the strength of its economy, but  that to keep that status, it needs to face up to sharper  international competition economically and the threat by Beijing  to isolate it politically.    He said that regardless of party affiliation or birthplace,  Taiwan citizens "should demonstrate the spirit of solidarity to  pool together our strength and wisdom so as to accomplish  political reforms, expand our diplomatic arena and increase our  economic strength," President Li said.    During the past five days, 302 out of the 314 National  Assembly members voiced their concerns on national affairs,  especially regarding constitutional reforms, the national  identity, cross- strait relations, foreign operations, judicial  and educational reforms, and agricultural development.    The National Assembly began its three-month special session  on May 2 to consider proposed amendments to the constitution and  the nominations by Li of grand justices and the head of the  Judicial Yuan.</p>

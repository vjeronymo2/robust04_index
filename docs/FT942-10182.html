			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / CFA adjusts to devaluation: Ivory Coast imposes commodity export tax Mr N'Goran Niamien, Ivory Coast's new finance minister, is putting a brave face on the devaluation which halved the value of his currency, the West African CFA franc, last January. 'It was not an easy measure to take, but it has pulled our economy out of a recession,' he said yesterday, during the annual general meeting of the African Development Bank in Nairobi. 'Our economy should grow by 2 per cent this year, and by 5 per cent in 1995.' A new export tax on cocoa and coffee, Ivory Coast's biggest foreign exchange earners, will replenish the treasury's empty coffers with 190bn CFA francs (Pounds 223m) this year, according to Mr Niamien. This will let the government repay its debts to private sector contractors, freeing resources for private investment. Last January, 13 central and west African states devalued their CFA franc, which had been fixed at 50 to the French franc since 1948. The new parity was fixed at 100 CFA to the french franc. The devaluation was virtually imposed by western donors concerned at the loss of competitiveness of the CFA trading bloc. The CFA franc continues to be freely convertible and backed by the French treasury. The international community has stepped in to soften the blow. For Ivory Coast, whose Dollars 20bn external debt makes it the world's most indebted nation in per capita terms, donors have put together a financial assistance package worth 650bn CFA francs. The Paris Club of creditor nations have also rescheduled Ivory Coast's obligations and written off part of its debt. For the remaining CFA countries, help is at hand. France has promised to write off more than one-quarter of the FFr80bn (Pounds 9.4bn) owed by its former colonies. The IMF pledged up to FFr10bn to mitigate the impact of devaluation. The IMF is also rushing through soft-loan agreements - Senegal, Niger and Ivory Coast have already benefited - which can pave the way for debt relief at the Paris Club. The World Bank says it is fully committed to co-finance economic growth in the CFA zone now that devaluation has made genuine structural adjustment possible. Mr Mamadou Diallo, director of debt at the Senegalese Treasury, also sees some encouraging responses to the devaluation. 'The tourism sector has rebounded with considerable strength,' he said yesterday in Nairobi. But unlike Ivory Coast, Senegal has resisted slapping taxes on exports. 'We want our exports to become more competitive,' he says, 'a tax would defeat the logic of the devaluation.' Like many finance officials in the CFA zone, Mr Diallo does not see the devaluation as a panacea for their countries' ills: 'We need new investment to make our industries more competitive; but where will this money come from?' Perhaps the worst impact of the devaluation, however, is the emergence of inflation in countries which had never felt its destabilising effect because of the stability and convertibility of their currency. In Cameroon, where civil servants are already reeling from a 50 per cent pay cut, the government has increased prices for basic foods and drugs by up to 75 per cent. In Senegal police have been ordered to control hoarding by traders. They closed some shops in Dakar and seized stocks. Mr Diallo estimates inflation will rise to 40 per cent by the end of 1994. Ivory Coast has telephone hotlines to report unjustified price increases. But it too is struggling with inflation now running at an annualised rate of 30 per cent.</p>

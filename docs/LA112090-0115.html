			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EGYPT RAISES TOLLS FOR SHIPS IN SUEZ CANAL  </P> <P> The Suez Canal Authority on Monday announced increases in tolls for ships  passing through the waterway and predicted a heavy decline in revenues if war  erupts in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Suez Canal Authority Chairman Mohammed Ezzat Adel said that toll fees for all  vessels, except dry bulk carriers, will increase by 6% in January. The increase  for dry bulk carriers will be only 4% due to market slackness, Adel said.  </P> <P> Adel, speaking to reporters on the 121st anniversary of the opening of the Suez  Canal and the passage of the 500,000th ship, said he expects the gulf crisis to  reduce revenues this year by about 10%.  </P></p>

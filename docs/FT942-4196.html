			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (4): Foreign exchange bonanza Uganda's single largest foreign investment project, capable of boosting annual export earnings by 10 per cent a year over its 10-year life, is poised for take-off. And has been for a good many years, sceptics might add - ever since the potential of a vast pyrites dump at Kilembe copper mine was first confirmed more than 10 years ago. This time it is different, say the project's backers, who point out that the scheme is now well down the road to fruition, while Uganda's political and economic climate has never been more encouraging. Lying in the foothills of the Ruwenzori mountains, on Uganda's western border with Zaire, the mine once produced 17,000 tonnes of blister copper a year. But the advent of Amin, coupled with the slump in world prices, proved its downfall and its operational days as a copper mine are almost certainly over. The foreign exchange bonanza lies above ground, in the 1m-tonne pile of pyrite concentrates accumulated since the mine opened in 1956. It contains 1.4 per cent cobalt, valued at about Dollars 200m, fluctuating according to world prices, and this can be recovered. Even allowing for capital outlay (about Dollars 40m) and running costs, the net foreign exchange benefits are enormous for a country whose total exports last year were worth USDollars 184m. Efforts to start the project go back to 1991 when Bureau de Recherce Geologiques et Miniers (BRGM) of France produced for Kilembe Mines Ltd a pre-feasibility study which concluded that treatment of the pyrites by bleaching was the most economic and environmentally safe way of recovering the cobalt. In June 1992, the Ugandan government signed a joint venture agreement with BRGM and Barclays Metals Ltd (BML) of the UK to undertake the project. The new Kasese Cobalt Company wil be jointly owned by the parastatal, Kilembe Mines Ltd with a 45 per cent shareholding, BRGM (27.5) and BML (27.5). Results from a pilot plant constructed at nearby Kasese in 1993 confirmed its viability, and annual production of 1,000 tonnes over a 10 to 12 years. A feasibility study followed, which confirms the merits of the project. All being well, commercial production could begin within two years.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS HOSPICE GETS OCCUPANCY PERMIT  </P> <P> The largest AIDS hospice in Los Angeles has received its permanent certificate  of occupancy and is running "smoothly" after problems over fire and building  codes were straightened out.  </P> <P> Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Hospice Foundation, said the Chris  Brownlie AIDS Hospice in Elysian Park has met requirements for a permit that  allows it to operate as a dormitory. Before the new category was established,  the two-story wood-frame building could not meet the fire codes for medical  buildings with patients confined to their beds.  </P> <P> There are 10 residents in the facility now, and by the end of March, the 25  available beds should be filled, Weinstein said.  </P></p>

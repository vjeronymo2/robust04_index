			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (v) Cautioning HUD  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to permit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> lenders <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to pay for CLO services (arguing that any payment coming directly or indirectly from a lender should be subject to the anti-kickback provisions of Section 8 of RESPA). While the 1992 final rule addressed only the issue of fees paid by borrowers, commenters also discussed the issue of fees paid by lenders for inclusion on CLO systems, in response to the invitation for such comments in the July 6, 1993, notice. Most commenters referred to such payments as thinly disguised referral fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Requiring disclosure that particular CLO listings provide only partial information about available loans. (A few commenters urged that the CLO fee disclosure form include ``bold print'' disclosing that the same information could be acquired by the prospective homebuyer ``for free'' by shopping on their own.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Recognizing that CLO services, if performed by a real estate broker or agent for a homebuyer, create a conflict of interest and a ``potentiality for fraud'' for the broker or agent, whose fiduciary duty is to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> seller. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Unified comments from 16 State Attorneys General asserted that the use of CLOs by real estate agents is analogous to the situation once prevalent in the travel industry: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* where independent travel agents using computer reservation services steered travelers to whichever airline happened to own the computer system used by the travel agent. Those flights were not always the most convenient or cheapest for the consumer. Private antitrust enforcement actions were required to rein in these practices. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Attorneys General declared that the economic costs of these airline-industry practices are ``trivial compared to the costs to consumers if CLOs are used to steer consumers in large numbers to more expensive mortgages than are readily available [elsewhere] in the market.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Suggesting that (in defining a CLO system) HUD require equal access to the system by any lender requesting access;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) Urging that fees for CLO services be proscribed because access to lender information has, before, been a free service performed by real estate agents or brokers; thus CLO charges would ``create a new fee for no real [new] value or service provided;''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) Arguing that borrower information achieved through the CLO process was near-worthless, because lenders will have to reverify any information provided before underwriting loan applications; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (xi) Requiring that the CLO disclosure (and acknowledgement) occur before the borrower agrees to use computer loan origination services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these recommendations from multiple commenters, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) recommended specific modifications to &sect;3500.14(g)(2)(iii):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (one) Prohibiting the receipt of compensation for operating a CLO by any person who already receives compensation for the same transaction in another capacity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (two) Defining ``computer loan origination services'' in a manner that would require interactive communication with the computer systems and the listing of multiple lenders upon request and for no charge; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (three) If the first two recommendations are not accepted by HUD, requiring that the CLO fee be both disclosed and paid for before the CLO is accessed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MBA also urged that the rule set out the principle that the mere performance of ``clerical loan origination activities, most or all of which will have to be repeated by the lender'' does not constitute a service justifying the collection of a fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments Supportive of the CLO Provision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments in support of the CLO provision of the rule were varied. In general, these comments urged retention of the final rule's disclosure-based authorization of CLOs and CLO charges to borrowers. However, supporters of the CLO provision and other commenters on the provision expressed considerable sentiment that substantial clarification of the rule was necessary in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters observed that the rule was silent on the question of what disclosure (if any) would be required if the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> borrower <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was not charged a fee for access to a CLO service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter ventured that, evidently, the rule's silence on the issue would indicate that no disclosure would be required when, for example, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> lender <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  paid CLO-connected fees. While the commenter approved this result, he added that ``further clarification would be welcome.'' The comment recommended that no separate disclosure be required for lender-pay or for ``no charge'' CLO services_even where it was clear that no-fee CLO systems were being paid for out of loan origination fees or lump-sum fees that are charged to lenders and mortgage brokers to process and underwrite mortgage loan applications. In these instances, the commenter maintained, the CLO services were less like traditional settlement services and more like services purchased by a settlement service provider to help it perform its normal functions_``back office'' loan origination services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general remarks, the same commenter argued that overregulation of CLO services would stifle innovation and competitiveness. It was pointed out that one of the major advantages of CLO services was the expansion of housing opportunity ``into sectors of the U.S. economy not now adequately served by the mortgage lending industry.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that, with the very recent revision of &sect;3500.14(g)(2)(iii), the Department should not make immediate changes, but should allow the marketplace to develop and experiment with CLOs without additional regulation. However, in a number of instances commenters supportive of the final rule's treatment of CLO services joined opponents in requesting that HUD provide clarifications of the rule that would:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Define the term ``computer loan origination services'';  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Indicate whether payment for CLO services must come solely from borrowers, or whether lender-paid services are permitted; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

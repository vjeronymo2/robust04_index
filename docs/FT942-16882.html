			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (10): New ways to earn money - Profile of Gudme Raaschou The name of Gudme Raaschou has been appearing increasingly often, as co-manager or adviser on prestige Danish equity funding issues such as last autumn's privatisation issue by Giro Bank and last month's Copenhagen Airport privatisation issue. The emergence of the Raaschou name (pronounced - approximately - 'Ross-coo')is the story of a traditional brokerage business which saw the writing on the wall when the comfortable monopoly enjoyed by brokerage businesses in Denmark was shoved aside in 1985 and banks were allowed to set up their own brokerage subsidiaries. The competition became even rougher when the country was plunged into a long recession after 1986 and the markets collapsed. When the Danish Stock Exchange went electronic in 1985 there were 54 registered broking companies. Now there are only 26. The market is dominated by Danske Bank's and Unidanmark's broking operations (since January 1 this year the banks no longer have to operate brokerage in a subsidiary company), and only a handful of independent brokers have survived. 'When the market collapses, either you need a rich uncle or you find new ways of earning money,' says Mr Kaare B. Dullum, managing director of Raaschou. 'We did the latter. We had to have new business in order to ride out the storm. Brokerage alone would not keep it going.' Mr Dullum and his partners at Raashou, Mr Eigil Pedersen and Mr Knud J. Strange, mapped out a strategy to turn the traditional broking business, founded in 1925, into a combined investment bank and broking group. Mr Dullum played a key role in the transformation process. He arrived at Raaschou in 1985 from Novo (now Novo Nordisk), the pharmaceuticals group where, as finance manager, he pioneered the first international equity issue in modern times by a Scandinavian company. The position which Raaschou has tried to exploit is its independence, by virtue of its ownership, of other market participants. It is not committed to any particular source of funding and its own financial involvement is typically limited. As organised today, Raaschou operates on the brokerage side in Danish shares and bonds and foreign securities. Its investment bank operations include portfolio management, corporate equity finance and international capital markets (non-equity borrowing), and advice and consultancy in all these fields. The two sides of the business complement each other. 'We are always in the markets, so we know what is going on,' says Mr Dullum. Raaschou has raised about DKr10bn over the past two years - 'which is quite a lot for a little company.' Typical amounts raised are in the DKr300m-600m range. A considerable proportion of the money raised by the company has been for non-Danish Scandinavian companies. This side of the business is expected to become increasingly important. Raaschou has just recruited Sweden's Mr Hans Cavalli-Bjorkman to the supervisory board. Mr Cavalli-Bjorkman is a former chief general manager of Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank; his base is in Malmo, just across the straits from Copenhagen. He is a strong advocate of closer business and economic relations between the southern Swedish and Copenhagen regions. A board member of many of the big local Swedish companies, Mr Cavalli-Bjorkman is sometimes referred to in the Swedish media as the king of Malmo. Raaschou has made something of a coup. Raaschou is now earning about half its income from investment banking, and the change from brokerage to investment banking was not always smooth. 'It was not always easy to balance out the dips in brokerage earnings with earnings from investment banks. We had a few sleepless nights along the way,' says Mr Dullum. In the process, the company has undergone a complete change. Almost all the staff have changed since 1985. The education level is much higher, Mr Dullum says - a necessary requirement for a company which has made its mark in several complex mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring operations as well as capital market issues.</p>

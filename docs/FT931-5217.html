			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Service with a smile - The advantages of private company tax vehicles THE ROLE of the service company has been spotlighted this week by news stories about director-general John Birt's employment status at the BBC. Such companies are common and, although the recent debate has centred on tax advantages, it is important to realise that many do have a commercial purpose. Take, for example, a computer consultant or a sound mixer in the entertainment industry. He or she may have several different clients for whom they work at different times of the year. It is often convenient for the consultant to set up a company to service those clients rather than work through a clumsy series of employment contracts. Assuming that the service company does have commercial substance, and is recognised as such by the Revenue, then there will be tax advantages. The most important is probably the cash flow advantage which comes from being taxed under Schedule D, rather than having to submit to PAYE on salary, and the more generous rules relating to expenses which apply to companies. In addition, careful planning may mean a more significant tax deferral. Corporate tax rates at between 25 per cent and 33 per cent are significantly lower than the 40 per cent marginal rate of income tax. This means that if the service company does not pay all its income as salary to the consultant, the income left in the company will be taxed at a relatively low rate. Remember, though, that this is only a deferral. Normally, the consultant will have to pay income tax when cash is finally extracted. This could prove expensive if marginal income tax rates increase, so thought is needed. The use of a service company also has some national insurance advantages. National insurance will have to be accounted for on the salary paid to the consultant by the service company, but will not apply to fees paid to the company by the client. Again, if the service company does not pass on all its income to the consultant - or pays some out by way of dividend - there will be a saving. If the cap on an employee's national insurance contributions is raised, or eliminated in this month's Budget, the savings will be even more attractive. There is, however, a downside. Setting up a service company involves extra work. It will usually be necessary to comply with Companies Acts rules, to charge VAT and to maintain PAYE and national insurance records. The consultant will not be entitled to the employee benefits provided by his clients, so he will have to make his own arrangements about a pension and a car. There may even, in some cases, be tax disadvantages. For instance, a consultant will not be eligible to participate in approved employee share option schemes and may miss a significant opportunity to make money. The concept of the service company needs to be treated cautiously. In the right business and right circumstances, it can mean important tax advantages. The Inland Revenue is aware of this and will examine each company carefully. These are complicated but, broadly, the Revenue checks that a service company has commercial substance and that it is a proper business which carries a commercial risk. If your activities are likely to pass the Revenue test, then it may be worth considering the use of a service company. If they are not, then it is probably safer to settle for a straightforward employment contract. Michael Bishop is Head of Personal Tax at Price Waterhouse</p>

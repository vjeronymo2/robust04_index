			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Serbian leaders' dispute threatens UN peace plans AN open dispute among Serb leaders threatened yesterday to derail UN plans to deploy peacekeeping troops in Croatia, while the Croatian government continued to impose obstacles to their deployment. Mr Milan Babic, head of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in southern Croatia, accused Serb and Yugoslav officials of using 'police methods and physical torture' to gain his acceptance of the UN peace plan. Mr Babic had refused to accept the plan - agreed last month between Serb, Croat and federal army leaders - on the grounds that the peacekeepers should be deployed on current frontlines, rather than in Krajina. He also accused the Serb-dominated federal presidency and the army of planning a coup d'etat in Krajina, and of forcing the Serbs from Krajina into signing the peace document. Mr Borisav Jovic, Serbia's representative on the rump Serb-dominated Yugoslav presidency, denied plans to use the army against Mr Babic. However, he warned that 'if political measures to implement the UN plan failed, we will do it by state measures'. Mr Babic's open criticism of the leadership in Serbia shows how prominent Serbs are betraying each other in the struggle to remain in power. In his bid to gain political autonomy for Serbs in Croatia, Mr Babic was openly supported by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia. Now Mr Babic is accusing Serbia of betraying Serbs in Krajina, while the Belgrade media is saying Mr Babic is wrecking chances for peace. The UN plan envisages withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia after the deployment of peacekeepers in selected parts of the republic, but Mr Babic continued to insist that 'Serb territorial units should not be disbanded'. However, he said the government of Krajina approved in principle UN involvement, adding he was prepared to hold talks with Croat leaders to find a 'political solution' for Krajina. Even if Mr Babic accepts the peace plan, UN officials face opposition from Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia. Mr Tudjman wants troops to be deployed in such a way that they will win back for Croatia the third of its territory now under army and Serb control. However, UN diplomats said yesterday Mr Tudjman was distorting the spirit of the UN plan. 'The troops will be deployed only as peacekeeping troops. They are not there to impose a political solution. Their role will be complemented by the European Community peace conference,' a diplomat said. The EC decided yesterday to restore trade concessions to all Yugoslav republics except Serbia, but still expressed concern at lack of co-operation, particularly on Croatia's part, in international efforts to create a lasting peace, writes David Buchan in Brussels. The decision leaves only Serbia facing economic sanctions. The other five republics' tariff and quota concessions are to be restored to the level enjoyed under the old EC-Yugoslav trade and co-operation accord. EC project finance, however, remains frozen.</p>

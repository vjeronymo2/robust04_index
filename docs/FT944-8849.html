			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Milan court in bourse ruling A Milan court has made the first ruling under Italy's three-year-old law banning insider trading. The court imposed a L20m (Pounds 8,000) fine and a four-month suspended jail sentence on Mr Giuseppe Gennari, a Tuscan financier, for manipulating the market. The rules against insider trading, passed in 1991, have been criticised as cumbersome and legalistic. But Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog which brought the case, hailed the judgment as a landmark ruling which would reassure small shareholders and international investors. The development of Italy's comparatively small equity market was blighted in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a reputation for widespread insider trading. Mr Gennari was accused of manipulating the stock market, rather than profiting directly from insider information. In February 1992, he announced that he had agreed to buy control of the troubled Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura for some L1,200bn, roughly double the then market price. The news was almost immediately denied by Count Giovanni Auletta Armenise, whose stake Mr Gennari claimed to be buying. Consob was forced to suspend BNA shares and those of related quoted companies to avoid further confusion in the market. Mr Gennari's lawyers argued during the case that he made the announcement in good faith.</p>

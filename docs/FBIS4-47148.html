			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Baranowski under rubric "From the State </F> Committee for Statistics": "A Situation of Uncertainty. Some  Results of Four Months of the Work of the National Economy"]    [Text] The republic's economic situation is characterized  by the same crisis phenomena that prevailed earlier. The State  Committee for Statistics [SCS] reports that the national income  generated in the four months comes to only 66 percent of last  year's, and the same problems persist in regard to sales of  finished goods and mutual settlements. As of 1 May, the value of  stocks of finished goods stood at 3 trillion rubles (other  estimates put the figure somewhat higher). Our enterprises'  indebtedness to enterprises of other countries of the near  abroad, chiefly Russia, for goods shipped and services rendered,  is growing. Profitability is falling--i.e., the cost of  producing goods is rising faster than profits from their sale.  In January-March, profitability in industry stood at only 12.7  percent, and the lowest level was in instrument making--6.2  percent. In the first quarter, 995 enterprises and  organizations--12.3 percent of the total number--made losses.  Losses totaled 930.5 billion rubles.    According to the results of four months, production output  declined by 62.2 percent in the fuel industry (including by 66.2  percent in oil refining), 43.3 percent in the building materials  industry, 42.9 percent in light industry, 35 percent in machine  building, and 31.2 percent in the woodworking, pulp and paper  industry. The smallest decline was 15.6 in the food industry. In  industry as a whole, production volumes declined by 33.3 percent.    In April, 17 enterprises did not work at all, and 264  reduced  their work week. The SCS reports that work time losses for  various reasons in January-April--including due to lack of  material resources and difficulties with sales--were equivalent  to a 13.6-percent rate of idleness of the average number of  workers on roster (add to this a few percentage points of the  official unemployment level and we may get a figure close to its  actual level).    Inflation hit hard once more in April. In February and March  it rose by 18.7 and 10.2 percent, respectively, but in April it  hit 28.6 percent (by the way, some sources put it even higher).  Undoubtedly, as might be expected, the inflation was made worse  by unsecured "seed" credit.    The republic's economy started this month under conditions  of  the proclaimed common customs space with Russia. Our anticipated  gain from this is the lifting of Russian duties on energy, in  particular. But it must be kept in mind that even duty-free  Russian resources, however cheap, still have to be paid for with  money earned primarily on the Russian market (or currency),  money earned under conditions of competition in the market with  other foreign producers and Russians too. Sometimes, moreover,  we fall prey to that old over-confidence and say, If the price  of energy were equal, Russian producers couldn't compete with  us. We say, The Russian farmer would only buy our tractors.    Meanwhile, Russia is swiftly reforming its economic  relations  and, accordingly, "educating" strong potential competitors with  whom our producers will inevitably clash. Our measures in  response, and the results thereof, are much more modest. The  recent mission of the International Monetary Fund that surveyed  our economy pointed out that our economic policy in general is  characterized by a situation of uncertainty which, among other  things, is also being greatly influenced by persistent  uncertainty regarding the uniting of monetary systems. We can  agree with this assessment, but it is worth adding that this  situation has clearly gone on too long.</p>

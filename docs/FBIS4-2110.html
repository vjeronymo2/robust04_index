			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Speech by Abulaidi Amudurexiti at the Spring Festival </F> Greetings-Exchanging Gathering on 9 February 1994" -- XINJIANG  RIBAO headline]    [Text] Comrades, friends:    We are gathered here today to celebrate the Spring Festival.  On behalf of the regional party committee and government, I  extend a Happy New Year to all comrades and friends present; as  well as cordial greetings to all workers, peasants,  intellectuals, office cadres, retired comrades, army commanders  and fighters, armed police officers and men, and workers and  staff of the Production and Construction Corps of all  nationalities throughout Xinjiang; to all democratic parties,  mass organizations, and patriotic people in all walks of life  and of all nationalities; to comrades from the central  departments and various fraternal provinces and regions working  on various fronts in Xinjiang to help our economic construction;  and to friends in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign  countries who have cared for and helped the region's economic  development! I also extend heartfelt gratitude to comrades who  stay fast at their jobs during the festival.    In the past year, we implemented in depth Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's important speeches made during his southern tour and  the 14th CPC National Congress guidelines, actively carried out  the tasks laid by the fifth plenary (enlarged) session of the  fourth regional party committee and the first session of the  eighth regional people's congress, and relied on and united  cadres and people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to work hard  and concertedly to score gratifying achievements. In 1993, the  regional economy retained its growth momentum: In agriculture,  we overcame natural disasters and reaped a bumper harvest for  the 16th year in a row, industrial production recovered from the  stagnation at the beginning of the year and gradually picked up  monthly, basic industries and key construction projects  proceeded smoothly, and financial revenues increased by a big  margin. We strengthened macroeconomic regulation and control,  stabilized financial order, deepened enterprise reform, further  developed diversified economic sectors with public ownership as  the mainstay, and made significant progress in opening up  Xinjiang to the outside world. We earnestly safeguarded social  and political stability and brought about a noticeable  improvement in economic and social order. We scored interim  achievements in promoting clean government and fighting  corruption; further strengthened the comprehensive management of  public security; steadily promoted reform in education, science  and technology, culture, health, family planning, environmental  protection, and sports; and continued to make headway in  building socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the  legal system. An excellent situation characterized by economic  growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress  prevailed throughout the region.    This year, we will carry forward our cause and continue to  work together for still greater victories in Xinjiang's economic  construction and all fields of endeavor. It will also be a  crucial year for the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to  realize the second-step strategic goal and comparatively  well-off living standards. The recent sixth plenary (enlarged)  session of the fourth regional party committee adopted a  "decision on conscientiously implementing the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee guidelines to  accelerate reform and opening up to promote rapid and highly  efficient development of Xinjiang's economy." The principles,  policies, and focuses put forth by the session for deepening  reform, opening up wider, and promoting economic development in  the region are in line with the requirement for integrating the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  guidelines with Xinjiang's realities. Meanwhile, the session  mapped out arrangements for the work in various fields in 1994.  We should unswervingly adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  party's basic line, and work in a down-to-earth manner according  to the tasks laid down by the sixth plenary (enlarged) session  of the fourth regional party committee, so as to continuously  promote a socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and  socialist spiritual civilization.    We should continue to steadfastly make economic  construction the central task. We should strengthen the  fundamental position of agriculture and ensure its steady  development. We should invigorate the county economy by  energetically developing second and tertiary industries in rural  areas with village and town enterprises as the mainstay. We  should improve the hard environment for large-scale socialized  production by accelerating the construction of basic industries  and infrastructure, such as transportation, energy,  telecommunications, power supply, and water conservancy. We  should upgrade the technology of existing enterprises and  expedite the exploitation and transformation of resources. We  should practice multidirectional opening up and market  diversification and step up trade, economic, and technological  cooperation with foreign countries. We should promote local  economic development and all-round revitalization of the  regional economy, concentrating on prospecting and developing  petroleum and nonferrous metals.    We should accelerate the pace of establishing a socialist  market economic structure. We should change the operating  mechanisms of enterprises and quicken the restructuring of  existing enterprises in accordance with the basic requirements  for establishing a modern enterprise system. We should  energetically promote the reform of the macroeconomic regulation  and control system, readjust the economic structure, and strive  to nurture new points of economic growth. We should gradually  establish a unified, open, fair, and orderly market system to  converge the regional economy with major international and  domestic markets. We should readjust ownership structure and go  all out to develop nonstate sectors of economy. We should  implement the principle of "giving priority to efficiency while  taking fairness into account" in initiating a sound social  security system.    We must always uphold the principle of "grasping two links  at  the same time" in effectively maintaining social and political  stability and create sound social milieus for Xinjiang's reform  and development. We should go all out to improve party  workstyle, promote clean government, and fight corruption  unremittingly. We should further encourage advances in  ideological, cultural, and educational undertakings. We should  strengthen national unity and unity between soldiers and  civilians and between the army and the government. We should  correctly handle the relationship between reform, development,  and stability; and continuously consolidate and develop the  political situation characterized by stability and unity.    Comrades, friends:    The coming year has entrusted upon us a new mission. Time is  running out; and we shoulder a heavy responsibility. Under the  leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the nucleus and under the guidance of the spirit of the  14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, let us further emancipate our minds,  seek truth from facts, work hard, and forge ahead to contribute  more to the realization of Xinjiang's goal of development, the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and the  cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    May you all have a happy holiday, good health, smooth  sailing  at work, and happiness at home.</p>

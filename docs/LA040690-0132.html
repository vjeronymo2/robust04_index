			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KODAK FINED $2.15 MILLION FOR POLLUTING;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE PENALTIES LEVIED BY NEW YORK STATE INVOLVE ILLEGAL HAZARDOUS  WASTE DISPOSAL AT THE KODAK PARK MANUFACTURING CENTER.  </P> <P> Eastman Kodak Co. was fined $2.15 million in criminal and civil penalties on  Thursday for violating New York's environmental laws.  </P> <P> The photographic giant pleaded guilty in Rochester City Court to two  misdemeanor violations for illegally disposing of hazardous waste and failing  to report the spill of a toxic solvent until five days after it was discovered.  </P> <P> The $1-million criminal fine is the largest ever assessed by New York in an  environmental case and among the largest in the nation, said state Atty. Gen.  Robert Abrams.  </P> <P> The incidents occurred in 1986 and 1987 at the 2,200-acre Kodak Park  manufacturing center for film and photographic products. The illegal hazardous  waste disposal was one of a series of violations, said state Assistant Atty.  Gen. Paul McCarthy.  </P> <P> Under a plea agreement, Kodak was fined $1 million in criminal penalties for  the two violations, plus $150,000 to be paid to local emergency planning  committees.  </P> <P> Kodak also signed a consent order with the state Department of Environmental  Conservation. Under that order, the company will pay an additional $1 million  in civil penalties and begin an extensive cleanup of Kodak Park.  </P> <P> But Judge Herman J. Walz criticized the agreement for letting Kodak's officers  off the hook.  </P> <P> "When a corporation pleads guilty in exchange for an agreement not to prosecute  members of the corporation, then people who have participated in a criminal act  go unpunished," Walz said.  </P> <P> "In this court's view, so-called white-collar criminals ought to be punished as  severely as any other criminal, and because such criminal conduct frequently  results in much more serious consequences to society, perhaps more severely."  </P> <P> Kodak spokesman Ronald Roberts said the company had accepted responsibility for  the violations.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said the fines would have little effect on the company's  finances.  </P> <P> "A fine of a couple million is peanuts to Eastman Kodak," said Michael Ellmann  of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> The settlements are the result of nearly two years' investigation after  officials discovered in 1988 that chemical leaks and spills had contaminated  ground water under Kodak Park.  </P> <P> Joseph Polito, a former leader of Concerned Neighbors of Kodak Park, said he  was disappointed with the size of the penalties against Kodak. "It's equivalent  to you or I getting a jaywalking ticket," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Compatible partners at the multimedia ball: The courtship ritual of EDS and Sprint The revolution in the world's information and communications industries is like a dance of giants, with corporate heavyweights trying a range of partners in the hope of finding the perfect match. Yesterday, two of the most important US participants confirmed that their nuptial preparations were well advanced. Electronic Data Systems, the Dallas-based computing services group, has become engaged to Sprint, the telecoms group which is America's third largest long-distance carrier. Plenty of hurdles stand in the way of marriage - not least that EDS is a subsidiary of General Motors, which plans to pave the way by divesting EDS in a tax-free spin-off to stockholders. But if the merger goes through, it will create an important new contender in the battle for global business as the industries of computing, communications and entertainment merge - unified by technology which allows all types of information to be transmitted in the same digital form. This will be the biggest tie-up yet between a computing services company and a telecoms provider. It will also go a long way to solving big strategic questions looming for both Sprint and EDS. Sprint - based in Kansas City, Missouri with 1993 operating income of Dollars 481m (Pounds 321m) on revenues of Dollars 11.4bn - is unique among US telecoms groups: its business strategy and regulatory controls on rivals mean that it is the only company with big interests in all three sectors of the industry: long distance, wireless and local phone services. Some analysts think this type of nationally branded, integrated communications company is likely to emerge as one of the winners from the US multimedia revolution - provided it is sufficiently large and has a strong array of partners. Until now, Sprint has stood largely aloof from the rush to find multimedia partners, while its 9-10 per cent share of the long-distance market has put it far behind sector leaders AT&amp;T (60 per cent) and MCI Communications (20 per cent). Still, after a period of declining market share in long-distance, it is growing strongly; its cellular operations are booming and its local operations are among the most efficient in the nation. EDS was founded in the early 1960s by 1992 presidential candidate Mr Ross Perot, who sold it to GM in 1984. Capitalising on the increasing complexity of information technology, it has specialised in 'outsourcing' (running other companies' computer and communications services) and systems integration, the design and construction of information networks. It has become the world's largest computing software and services company, with 1993 earnings of Dollars 724m on revenues of Dollars 8.56bn, and has landed a series of prestigious contracts, including one of Pounds 1bn for the UK income tax authority. GM still accounts for 39 per cent of its revenues, but that is down from 75 per cent in the mid-1980s. Under the proposed spin-off, EDS would continue to provide the same services to GM under a new 10-year agreement. EDS, however, is also keen to play a role in the nascent world of multimedia. Late last year, for example, it announced a joint venture with France Telecom and US West, the regional Bell operator, to provide interactive financial transaction services to the home and business markets. But to compete effectively it requires a partner or partners: 'The scale of the investment required for these areas is mind-boggling,' one industry analyst said yesterday. Furthermore, to reach the individual consumer it helps to have an ally with a strong brand image and close commercial links to the home, which can be provided by Sprint. At the same time, EDS can give Sprint greater access to its customer base, which is concentrated in Fortune 500 international companies, whereas Sprint's long-distance strength has been in targeting small to medium-sized US companies. EDS expertise should also help Sprint provide both large and small customers with more sophisticated services, and could play an important integrating role if Sprint were to set up a national wireless network. A merger should also save costs. EDS, which runs one of the world's largest private communications networks, could cut its line leasing costs by using Sprint's network, the first all-digital fibre optic system in the US. Sprint, in turn, could reduce information technology costs. But further waltzes around the telecoms dance-floor may have to await the consummation of this marriage, which still seems months away, given the complexity of EDS's relationship with GM and the need to clear numerous regulatory hurdles. In that time, the partners could cool on each other, as has happened several times ahead of much vaunted multimedia weddings.</p>

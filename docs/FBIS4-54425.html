			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, April 27 (MTI) -- Foreign trade showed a  deficit of $757.2 million in the first three months of 1994,  with exports amounting to $2,159.2 million and imports totalling  $2,916.4 million, according to the Ministry of International  Economic Relations.    In the first three months of the year, exports were up 4.1  percent and imports were up 9.2 percent on the same period of  the previous year. According to preliminary figures from the  ministry, exports amounted to $610.7 million in January, $776.5  million in February and $772.1 million in March. The figures  are up 2.8 percent and 15.3 percent in the first two months  respectively and down 4.3 percent for March, compared to the  same months of 1993. The preliminary figure for March is likely  to be corrected as further customs statistics come in. Imports  amounted to $897.8 million in January, $958.1 million in  February and $1,060.5 million in March. The figures are 22.2  percent, 5.7 percent and 2.9 percent up respectively on the same  months of 1993. Compared to total exports in the first quarter  of $2,159.2 million, exports in the third quarter of 1993  amounted to $2,165.9 million, down 21 percent. In the fourth  quarter, exports were $2,464.2 million, down 9.5 percent on the  same figure for the previous year. Exports totalled $8,906.9  million in 1993, 16.8 percent down on 1992. Imports in the  first quarter of 1994 exceeded the same figure for the previous  year by 9.2 percent, amounting to $2,916.4 million. This can be  compared to $2,709.3 million in the third quarter of 1993 (3.6  percent up on the same period of the previous year) and $3,826.3  million in the fourth quarter (30.3 percent up on the same  period of 1992).    Imports totalled $12,530.3 million last year, 13.2 percent  up  on 1992. The country's foreign trade performance shows that the  period of decline or stagnation is over and that the economy is  facing a time of recovery. The increase in exports over the  first quarter of 1993 was more or less equally shared by the  main product groups, within which exports of farm and food  products increased by 6 percent, slightly more than the average.  Imports increased by $245 million in the first quarter of 1994  over the same period of 1993. This includes increases of about  $157 million in imports of machinery, $45 million in imports of  farm and food products, $20 million in imports of raw materials,  and $30 million in imports of consumer goods.    Roughly 50 percent of the increase in the amount of  machinery  imported can be attributed to the arrival of a Ukrainian  aircraft for maintenance and servicing. The plane has now been  returned to the Ukraine, and this is reflected in export  statistics for the first quarter. The ministry estimates that  of the remaining increase of more than $70 million, the bulk is  imports of components, with the rest imports of investment  goods. 80 percent of total exports went to only 10 countries.  Two-thirds of exports went to five trading partners, Germany,  the countries of the former Soviet Union, Austria, Italy, and  the United States. Hungary's exports to the United States and  Britain grew by more than 30 percent in the first quarter  compared to the same period of last year. This was the result  of the beginnings of economic recovery in these two countries.  As a result of the Central European Free Trade Agreement  (CEFTA), exports to the Czech Republic and Slovakia together  were up 30 percent, with exports to Poland up 18 percent.  Exports to Slovenia grew by 84.8 percent, with that country  gaining a 2 percent share of total exports. Exports to OECD and  EU countries grew by 4.3 percent and 4.2 percent respectively,  in line with the average increase. Imports from the two groups  of countries were up 7.1 percent and 13.3 percent respectively.  Exports to the former socialist countries grew by 7.6 percent,  while imports were up 14.5 percent. Within this, exports to the  countries of the former Soviet Union were up 11.4 percent and  imports were up 17.7 percent.</p>

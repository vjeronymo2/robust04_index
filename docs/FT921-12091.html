			<p>920129 FT  29 JAN 92 / Ban on shift women lifted JUST months before its 100th anniversary, a German ban on night shift work for women manual workers has been overturned by the country's supreme constitutional court as an offence against equal rights, reports Quentin Peel. Yesterday it was overturned on the challenge of a woman clerk in a bakery. She had been fined for taking on women to pack cakes on the night shift.</p>

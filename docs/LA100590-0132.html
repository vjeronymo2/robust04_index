			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Flipper Trainer Calls for Boycott: Richard O'Barry, whose disillusionment as a  trainer of the dolphin actors known as Flipper made him the best-known activist  against dolphin captivity, will announce a boycott of all Anheuser-Busch  products and theme parks on Monday, unless the company closes its  dolphin-petting facilities at four Sea World sites. The company makes 17 brands  of beer including Michelob, Busch, Carlsberg, Elephant malt liquor and King  Cobra malt liquor, as well as Eagle brand snacks. The firm also operates a  Philadelphia children's theme park called Sesame Place and Busch Gardens, a  theme park in Florida.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MATER DEI RALLIES TO BEAT SERVITE  </P> <P> Mater Dei High School overcame an early deficit to defeat Servite, 7-4, in the  Angelus League baseball opener for both teams Saturday at Mater Dei.  </P> <P> Mater Dei (7-2 and the county's top-ranked team) took the lead for good in the  fifth inning when Ryan Andersen singled with two outs and took second when the  right fielder couldn't come up with the ball cleanly.  </P> <P> Jim McCarthy drove in Andersen with a single. "We think we're a good team and  they think they're a good team and this was the game to show it," Mater Dei  Coach Bob Ickes said. "Both teams just came out tight and flat."  </P> <P> Trailing 3-1, Mater Dei scored three runs in the third.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Servite (5-3), the fourth-ranked team in the county, tried to  start a rally, but Mater Dei got a double play after Steve Sandoval opened the  inning with a single. The Friars only had three baserunners after that and none  advanced past second base.  </P> <P> Servite's Eddie Crippen hit a home run in the fifth to tie the score, 4-4.  </P> <P> Mater Dei's Jason Dietrich gave up two runs in the first inning but settled  down to get the victory. Dietrich (3-1) pitched five innings, giving up four  runs, striking out five and walking one. Lionel Hastings struck out two in two  shutout innings of relief. DENNIS KAISER  </P></p>

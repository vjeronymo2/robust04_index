			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> De Beers Raises Diamond Prices: The marketing arm of South Africa's De Beers  Consolidated Mines, the Central Selling Organization, said it was raising its  prices for rough gem diamonds by an average of 15.5%. The group, which sells  the vast majority of the world's diamonds, said the increase reflects strong  market conditions. The price increase, the fifth in three years, takes effect  at the CSO's next sale, known as a "sight," on March 28. De Beers spokesman  Andy Lamont said the market was helped by good demand from Japan, the  second-largest retail diamond market after the United States.  </P></p>

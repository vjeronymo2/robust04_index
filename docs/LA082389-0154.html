			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DRIVER TIM RICHMOND, 34, DIED OF AIDS, DOCTOR SAYS  </P> <P> Stock car driver Tim Richmond contracted AIDS "through heterosexual contact"  and died of complications from the disease at age 34, a physician close to the  driver's family said today.  </P> <P> Dr. David W. Dodson, the attending physician at the time of Richmond's death  Sunday, confirmed earlier reports that Richmond had AIDS.  </P> <P> The driver's family decided that information about the case should be released  in the hopes that it will "save others from having to endure the suffering Tim  experienced," Dodson said in a statement. The cause of Richmond's death  previously had been listed as "natural."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diagnosed in 1986  </P> <P> Richmond's condition was diagnosed as AIDS in 1986 while he was hospitalized at  the Cleveland Clinic for pneumonia, Dodson said.  </P> <P> "We would like to dispel any rumors as absolutely untrue that he contracted the  disease through intravenous drug use, homosexual encounter or a blood  transfusion," Dodson said. "Tim died of complications of acquired immune  deficiency syndrome, which he contracted through heterosexual contact."  </P> <P> Richmond's best year on the NASCAR circuit was in 1986 when he won seven races  and finished third in the Winston Cup standings.  </P> <P> Despite the illness, Richmond won two straight races in 1987. Later that year,  he missed a race because of complications from AIDS, Dodson said.  </P></p>

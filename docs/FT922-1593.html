			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Today sees the start of one of those periods on television when, if you don't like sport, you might do best to take a fortnight's holiday abroad. There will be plenty on television wherever you go, but it seems easier to avoid holiday. You are not going to have much difficulty in finding Today At Wimbledon or the European Football Championship so these notes are about the other choices. The last in C4's Female Parts series (9.00) is written by The Guardian's Nancy Banks-Smith, Britain's funniest television critic. If her script about Norah, Rose, Wynne and Dorothy has anything like as many laughs as her television column, we are all in for a treat. The four named women are described as 'real life Golden Girls', four Lancashire widows who swim, study French, and keep a weather eye open for male dancing partners. World In Action (9.30 ITV) investigates the snatching of monkeys from the wilds of Mauritius for sale to research scientists, and Panorama (9.40 BBC1) considers Middle East peace prospects. In The Dazzling Image (10.55 C4) Spike Milligan introduces seven pieces of animation by British film and video makers.</p>

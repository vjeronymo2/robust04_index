			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, June 7 (XINHUA) -- It's not personality but  performance which will have the final say in the appointment or  removal of managers or directors of state-owned enterprises in  Hainan Province, China's largest special economic zone.    As a major step toward introducing a modern enterprise  management mechanism, the province drafted stipulations for the  appointment of state-owned enterprise managers or directors this  April.    According to the stipulations, no one may be reappointed  within five years after serving prison terms or being deprived  of their political rights for economic crimes; within three  years after clearing debts following management of enterprises  which went bankrupt owing to poor performance; or for not paying  off debts on due dates.    Hainan tried the appointment system for managers and  directors in the state-owned enterprises before. However, as  there were no official rules for it, often managers who had been  removed due to poor performance were appointed again to similar  or higher positions.    The new appointment system declares that a public debate  attended by workers' representatives must be held for managerial  candidates. A public survey must also be conducted among  employees to test workers' trust in their candidates. The move,  along with other regulations, has cleared the way for an  effective appointment system for the province's management  personnel.</p>

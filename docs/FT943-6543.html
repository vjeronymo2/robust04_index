			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Management: Digging deeper and wider - BHP is moving further afield but it will not forget its Australian roots Broken Hill Proprietary's presentation to shareholders in Sydney could have been taken from a modern marketing manager's manual. Held in a giant auditorium, it had overhead slides, bold graphics and plenty of razzamatazz. Then, as the meeting was thrown open to questions, a gentlemen in the audience rose to his feet. 'I can remember when you were running the Newcastle (Australia) steelworks in the 1970s . . .' he told Brian Loton, BHP's chairman, as he launched into a long reminiscence. The BHP executive, half-charmed and half-embarrassed, listened patiently, before quickly steering the meeting back to business. The incident last year, although trivial, seemed to sum up the dichotomy which surrounds the Australian resources group. On the one hand, it runs an ADollars 30bn (Pounds 14.2bn) portfolio of businesses worldwide, ranging from coal mines in Indonesia to oil rigs in the Irish Sea. A fifth of its shares are held internationally and in key divisions - such as petroleum - much of the staff and management are outside its home country. On the other hand the tug of BHP's roots is also strong - and not always entirely welcome. There is, for example, a peculiarly Australian share structure, which has BHP owning half of another company which in turn owns almost 20 per cent of BHP. There is an ADollars 2.2bn investment in Fosters, the Melbourne-based brewing group, which is carried in the books at significantly more than its current market value and has nothing to do with BHP's core operations. 'It's a big credibility question,' says one analyst. In addition, although overseas interests are growing by leaps and bounds, the fact remains that the bulk of BHP's money is still made in its home country. About 70 per cent of group assets are held there. There is nothing unusual about a formerly domestic company reaching a point where its growing international interests create a string of dilemmas over expansion and diversification strategy, and over organisation structure. But BHP's case is interesting for two reasons. First, the company is curiously bound up with Australia's national psyche. 'For 50 years, BHP has held a dominance in Australian economic life such as no company, to my knowledge, had ever exercised over the US economy,' Geoffrey Blainey, a historian, has commented. Even now, the company accounts for 1.5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and is frequently referred to as the 'Big Australian'. This status adds quite significantly to management responsibility. 'We are always being asked to do this or that nationally by industry organisations, and government,' says John Prescott, managing director. 'It's usually far more than we can handle. We try to speak when asked.' That, however, does not mean that the group escapes criticism for not doing more. Some mining industry players, for example, wondered whether BHP should have taken the lead more forcibly during last year's debate over Australia's Native Title legislation and the issue of Aboriginal land rights. Second, BHP is the only Australian company that can fairly claim to be making a 'global' leap at present. Other groups of comparable size and status include News International, the media company, and National Australia Bank. But the former remains the personal fief of Rupert Murdoch, while NAB operates only in the Australian, Irish and UK markets. BHP admits that being out on this sort of limb brings unique pressures. The company, says Prescott, has used management consultants 'sometimes for extended periods, particularly to help us overcome the isolation of BHP in Australia, to understand what the rest of the world is doing by way of best practice'. Most of BHP's development outside Australia has occurred during the past decade. During the first four years of this period the company's management was also wrestling with rival takeover attentions from Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources and John Elliott's Elders IXL. Peace was finally bought in 1988, although the price is still evident in the controversial Fosters holding and the circular share structure. In spite of belated changes made to this last week, it could still provide takeover and management protection and hence could retard share price performance. All the same, many observers believe in retrospect that the long and complex struggle with the two entrepreneurs also brought benefits - forcing BHP to take a more aggressive management approach and shaking up a complacent bureaucracy. Whether or not this is an accurate assessment, the tussle did coincide with a sharply increased international focus at the resources group. In 1982, BHP's sales from operations outside Australia were just ADollars 87m. By 1992-93, helped by a mixture of acquisitions, investments and exploration work, they had grown to more than ADollars 5bn. Even today, however, the extent to which BHP has 'globalised' its operations varies markedly between divisions. The company has four main operating areas: steel, minerals, petroleum and 'services', which includes a range of businesses from shipping to engineering consultancy. This structure was put in place in 1985, although there have been refinements since. 'The broad thrust is to organise on product lines - generally based on worldwide groupings of products,' says Prescott. The petroleum division, which includes Hamilton Oil, is generally seen as the most internationally-focused. About 70 per cent of employees are based outside Australia and recent chief executives have been recruited from outside the company. (Peter Willcox, who stepped down earlier this year, came from Amoco; his replacement, John O'Connor, from Mobil). The minerals side, too, is highly diversified and much of the management conducted from San Francisco, thanks to the purchase of Utah International's mining interests from US General Electric in 1984. Steel, by contrast, is described by one analyst as 'more or less Australian'. The current generation of top head-office executives has also been drawn heavily from this division's ranks: Loton, Prescott and two divisional bosses all worked their way up through steel. In financial terms, BHP's structure and its range of interests has served shareholders quite well recently - in contrast to the performance a decade ago - and most pundits acknowledge that the spread of interests and their slightly different business cycles are advantageous. Earnings dipped in 1991-92, but have since risen steadily. In the latest 12 months, to end-May, operating profit after interest rose by almost 30 per cent, to ADollars 1.28bn. The BHP share price has also been strong, outperforming the Australian stockmarket by 120 per cent since 1988 and the mining sector by a similar amount. In the current year the company admits it will have its difficulties. Nevertheless, analysts seem fairly confident that another year of steady performance is in sight. Barring sudden commodity price movements, market estimates suggest that profits of ADollars 1.4bn could be achieved. Looking longer-term, much will depend on the scale and efficiency with which BHP spends its development funds. To achieve a 10 per cent profits growth and using a target rate of 15 per cent for return on equity, David Rubin at ANZ McCaughan calculates that BHP needs to commit around ADollars 1bn to new projects each year - on top of the replacement capital expenditure to replenish depleting assets. In fact, over the past five years, the total capital and investment programme has topped ADollars 12.5bn. Gearing, meanwhile, has come down about 35 per cent, and the company has been at pains to stress that it intends to avoid a 'lazy (underused) balance sheet'. 'We have the capacity to fund any substantial new investment opportunity that should arise,' Graham Heely, the finance director, told analysts at the results presentation in July, prompting speculation that a multi-billion deal could be in sight. BHP has enthused about two potential channels for expansion. The first is direct reduced iron (DRI) - a process which involves the reduction of high-grade iron ore concentrate using natural gas. The resulting iron is made into small, transportable briquettes, which can be fed directly into the new generation of mini-mills. Ideally, the production system requires high-grade iron ore and natural gas to be in close proximity - a situation that exists in Western Australia's Pilbara region, but is only becoming a feasible option with the opening of the gas market. This month, BHP announced it was seeking environmental approvals for the construction of an ADollars 750m DRI plant in the region, indicating the final feasibility studies are in progress. The second is power generation, predominantly offshore, and probably in the growth markets of Asia and South America. This attracts some scepticism, since it would take BHP into a new area of operation. The company, however, claims such a move is a fairly natural progression from existing energy-related activities. Indeed, while BHP is only examining possibilities at present, Prescott does not quarrel with the notion that power generation might eventually form a fifth leg to the business. 'It could be a self-contained entity, although it would have to work closely with the rest of the group. But it may well be a core operation,' he says. On the organisational front, Prescott recognises that some changes will probably be necessary as the company comes to terms with its growing global spread. BHP, he suggests, may need to move from its divisional structure towards a 'matrix' of the sort especially common among big US multinationals, where the product divisions and a geographical management network are superimposed on each other. Because of their complexity, such structures are often controversial and difficult to operate. 'The current structure may not give the best means of promoting BHP in a new part of the world,' he continues. 'It might be better if we had a structure which allowed us to present our credentials collectively in a country where we were not well known. Rather than have our steel business go in separately, then our minerals business, then our petroleum business . . . perhaps there should be a 'Mr BHP' who would be the single focus of contact in each particular country.' The company is already tending 'to move a little bit in that direction', Prescott adds. Its president of BHP Japan serves as a single point of contact for all businesses there, and it is implementing the same concept in China and Russia. But what nationality is 'Mr BHP Japan'? Prescott admits that he is Australian - 'well, actually a Scotsman' - but quickly adds that on the divisional side of the structure the senior iron ore, coal, transportation and steel salespeople are locals. 'It's only in recent years that I could say that - it's a bit of a change,' he remarks. For BHP, it is really a revolution.</p>

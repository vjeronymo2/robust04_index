			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEFILE  </P> <P> With talk of a possible actor's strike in July, studios have been reluctant to  start new production after May 1. But there are some notable exceptions. . . .  For the moment: Paramount has Tom Cruise to start "Born to Run" for producers  Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer in June. The drama, set in the world of  NASCAR racing, is based on a story by Cruise with Warren Skaaren currently  working on the screenplay. . . .  </P> <P> Film maker John Boorman has set Dabney Coleman as his modern-day King Lear in  Disney's "Where the Heart Is," an April start in Toronto and New York City. The  story centers on a captain of industry who decides that the best thing he can  do for his children is to cut them off financially -- "about parents giving up  their children when they come of age, and vice versa," producer-director  Boorman said. Uma Thurman and Anthony Michael Hall are the unlucky kids.  Boorman wrote the script with daughter Telsche. . . .  </P> <P> Al Pacino takes on the role of crime chieftain Big Boy in Disney's "Dick Tracy"  for producer-director-actor Warren Beatty. Meanwhile, actors are being paged to  reshoot scenes with actress Glenne Headly who replaced Sean Young in the part  of Tess Trueheart. . . .  </P> <P> John Malkovich plays an ad executive who skyrockets sales with a policy of  "honesty is the best policy" in Paramount's "Crazy People." The production  marks "Good Morning, Vietnam" writer Mitch Markowitz's directing debut of his  original story. Sydney Pollack, Tom Barad and Robert Weiss produce the April  start. . . .  </P> <P> Val Kilmer plays a low-rent detective in Propaganda Films' "Kill Me Again," an  April start in Los Angeles based on the novel by Eric Knight. Joanne Whalley  (Kilmer's real-life wife) co-stars as a woman who hires him to fake her death.  John Dahl directs and co-wrote the yarn with David Warfield. Steve Golin, Joni  Sighvatsson and Warfield produce, MGM releases. . Lou Diamond Phillips is a  good cop in Interscope/Nelson Entertainment's "Transit," filming locally in  April. Phillips brings to justice a serial killer, whose spirit goes looking  for revenge after the execution. Robert Resnikoff wrote the script and makes  his feature directing debut for producer David Madden. . . .  </P> <P> Dermot Mulroney and Joanna Pacula head for Brazil in June to star in Filmline's  "The Last Place God Made." Based on Jack Higgins' novel and adapted by Don  Miller, the adventure finds two flyers caught up in intrigue and passion along  the Amazon in 1938. N. Lee Lacy makes his big screen bow for producers Pieter  Kroonenburg and Nicolas Clermont. . . .  </P> <P> Daniel Stern is the big brother of Patrick Dempsey and Arye Gross in  Universal's "Coupe de Ville," in which the fraternal trio transport a vintage  Cadillac cross country for dad. Joe Roth directs Mike Binder's original script  for producer Larry Brezner. . . . . Also taking to the road is Jonathan  Silverman, who sets up a last trip for terminally ill buddy Jason Bateman in  MCEG's "Sketches." Neal Israel directs the Paul Shapiro screenplay. . . .  </P> <P> Brian Doyle-Murray joins the cast of Columbia's "Ghostbusters II" but not as  Bill Murray's brother. In the Ivan Reitman production, Doyle-Murray will play a  psychiatrist who must assess the spook fighters' mental stability. Also joining  the antics: Eugene Levy as nerdy Rick Moranis' nerdy dermatologist cousin  LEONARD KLADY  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dick Ljungberg report: "A Majority of Their Own for Social </F> Democrats"]    [Text] The Social Democrats would have achieved a majority  of their own with 184 seats, the four parties in the current  coalition would have taken 150 seats, and the Left Party would  have had a chance of the remaining 15 seats if there had been a  Riksdag election in May. This is the rough result of the  Central Bureau of Statistics [SCB] most recent poll on party  sympathies in the lead-up to the election.    The SCB carries out the largest opinion polls: The sample  between 2 and 24 May was 9,300 people, of whom 19.7 percent did  not respond for various reasons.    Since the last poll in November three parties show  statistically reliable changes: progress for the Moderate  Coalition Party and the Center Party, and a three-point collapse  for New Democracy. Since November New Democracy's voters have  moved -- in order of magnitude -- to the sofa (don't knows), the  Moderates, the Social Democrats, and the Center Party.    In an otherwise fairly stable situation, with a continued  large majority for the Social Democrats, interest chiefly  centers on which parties will clear the 4-percent threshold for  representation in the Riksdag. This could have a decisive  effect on the question of who forms the government after the  election on 18 September.    New Democracy and the Green Ecology Party clearly lie below  the threshold. The Left Party is balancing on the edge with 3.9  percent, but the party is no longer "reliably" under the  threshold -- which it has been since May 1992. The Christian  Democratic Party [KDS] has 4.4 percent -- something that is  hardly reassuring. The margin of error for the KDS as for the  Left Party is plus/minus 0.5 percent.    This would have been the result of an election in May, with  the changes since November in parentheses:    Center Party 7.9 percent (plus 1.2), Liberal Party 6.7  (minus  0.2), Moderate Coalition Party 21.8 (plus 2.2), KDS 4.4 (plus  0.4), New Democracy 2.3 (minus 3.0), Social Democrats 50.1  (minus 0.8), Left Party 3.9 (plus 0.4), Green Ecology Party 2.6  (plus 0.1), and other parties 0.4 (minus 0.1).    The gains from New Democracy are the Moderates' and the  Center Party's only clear net gains since November. In the past  six months the Social Democrats have chiefly made gains from the  don't know group.    In an election in May the nonsocialists -- including New  Democracy -- would have won 42.0-43.9 percent of the vote, the  Social Democrats and the Left Party 53.0-54.9 percent.    Counting only the parties that would probably have cleared  the 4 percent-threshold in May, the four parties in the current  coalition would have 42.9 percent and the Social Democrats 52.9  percent in the Riksdag. The SCB reckons that the Left Party has  a chance to take the others, but even without the support of the  Left Party the Social Democrats would be bigger than the  nonsocialists in the Riksdag.    Together the government parties have lost around 6  percentage  points since the 1991 election. However, they have increased by  around 3.3 percent since November and now have the support of  40.6 percent of the electorate.    The Social Democrats have increased by 11.3-13.5 percentage  points since the 1991 election and made net gains from all the  other parties -- chiefly the Liberal Party, the Moderates, and  New Democracy.    The Moderates are the only party that is at almost exactly  the same level as the old election result. Under the surface  the Moderates have lost voters to the Social Democrats, and also  some to the Green Ecology Party. This has been offset by net  gains from New Democracy and the Liberal Party.    The Center Party has lost 0.0-0.2 percentage points since  the  election, mostly to the Social Democrats but also to the Left  Party.    Since the election the Liberal Party has lost 1.9-3.0  percentage points. The net losses have been to the Social  Democrats and the Moderates, while there has been a small gain  from the KDS.    The KDS share of the vote has fallen by 2.3-3.3 percentage  points since the election, mostly to the Social Democrats, but  also to the Liberal Party and the Green Ecology Party. The Left  Party has lost 0.1-1.1, chiefly to the Social Democrats.    Since the election New Democracy has lost all of 3.9-4.9  percent, chiefly to the Social Democrats and the Moderates.    The Green Ecology Party has lost 0.3-1.3 percentage points.  The net losses have gone to the Social Democrats, while a small  gain has been made from the Moderates and the KDS.</p>

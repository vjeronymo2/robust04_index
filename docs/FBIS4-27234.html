			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [National Assembly Issues Communique No. 4] </F>   [Text] This morning, 30 May, National Assembly deputies  held group discussion on various draft laws. In the afternoon  the National Assembly held a plenary session to discuss the  draft law on tax levied on the transfer of rights on land use  under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha  Phan.    The National Assembly heard Ly Tai Luan, member of the  National Assembly session secretariat, report on the main ideas  on this draft law which were condensed from a group discussion  in the morning session.    A total of 19 National Assembly deputies expressed different  views on the provisions of the draft law. They are Nguyen Trong  Xuyen from Ninh Binh Province, Ban Tien Dung from Quang Ninh,  Huynh Thi Nhan from Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyen Thi Man from  Haiphong, Diep Kinh Dan from Soc Trang, Nguyen Thi No from Khanh  Hoa, Bui Van Hoanh from Can Tho, Le Phu Hoi from An Giang,  Nguyen Thanh Cao from Kon Tum, Nong Duc Manh from Lang Son, Bui  Quang Ton from Ben Tre, Do Quoc Hung from Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Danh  Ut from Kien Giang, Nguyen Khoa Kim Boi from Thua Thien-Hue,  Tran Thi Kim Van from Song Be, Hoang Xuan Dung from Yen Bai,  Dinh Hanh from Hanoi, Phung Quang Hung from Vinh Phu, and Nguyen  Van Thuan from Binh Thuan.    All the deputies expressed an identity of views on the  necessity to promulgate the law on tax levied on the transfer of  rights on land use in the current situation. This law is aimed  at enhancing the efficiency of state management over land,  increasing state revenue, and meeting the aspiration of the  masses. The deputies also contended that the draft law has been  carefully revised on the basis of the views solicited from the  people, echelons, and sectors nationwide. The National Assembly  deputies also discussed issues related to those who have to pay  tax in this regard, tax calculation, tax reduction and  exemption, and the enforcement of this law.

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television John Lill is the soloist in Brahms' Piano Concerto No 2 in the first half of today's BBC Proms (7.30 Radio 3). The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra is conducted by Kurt Masur. In the second half (8.40) they play Mendelssohn's Overture &amp; Incidental Music to A Midsummer Night's Dream. Mulberry was one of those quirky comedies which can take a long time to catch on. Karl Howman played a charming jack-of-all-trades who becomes a servant to Miss Farnaby (the endlessly watchable Geraldine McEwan). It never really had time to become a hit, so writers Esmonde and Larbey wrote a final episode which was missed by many of the dedicated band who had been watching. So today (8.30) BBC1 provides a repeat. Storm From The East, telling the story of Genghis Khan and his descendants, has had some good pictures of galloping armies and crusader castles, but has never really gripped the imagination. The last episode (9.45 BBC2) tells the story of 'the most illustrious of all the Mongol Khans' - Genghis's grandson, Khubilai who inspired Coleridge.</p>

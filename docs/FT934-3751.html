			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Three advisers get more than PM Three government advisers are being paid between Pounds 80,000 and Pounds 100,000 a year - a salary higher than the prime minister's, it was disclosed last night. The head of Mr John Major's policy unit, Mrs Sarah Hogg, receives the salary of a civil service second permanent secretary, a Downing Street spokesman said later. This would put her on more than Pounds 80,000. The prime minister is paid Pounds 76,234.</p>

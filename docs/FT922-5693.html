			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: South West Water up Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 90m PRICE INCREASES and cost-cutting helped South West Water achieve a 2 per cent rise to Pounds 90m in pre-tax profits last year, after spending Pounds 172m of a planned Pounds 2bn capital investment programme. Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said the company had achieved its capital expenditure target 'on time and on budget'. Some Pounds 2bn is scheduled to be spent on waste treatment, water supply and quality before the end of the decade. About Pounds 600m of the programme will be funded by consumers through Ofwat-approved price increases of more than 16 per cent last year and 11.5 per cent annually until 1995, when the next regulatory review is due. Mr Hill said the price increases were likely to continue at a similar level for a few years after 1995. 'Turnover will show quite dramatic growth both in price terms and in real terms,' he said. Mr Keith Court, chairman, said the rises would 'provide a firm base on which to build the long-term business'. ment programme was repairing the damage inflicted by 'a century of neglect' under government ownership. He said customers were already seeing the benefits of the investment, with no restrictions on water having been imposed during the recent hot spell. Capital expenditure for 1992-93 - the fourth year of the programme - was expected to be about Pounds 215m, with the emphasis on marine sewage treatment. SWW has provoked some controversy over its plans to release treated waste into the sea off Cornwall. Mr Hill said the company intended to concentrate on developing its marine sewage expertise to expand overseas in the medium to long-term. Last year's price rises helped turnover advance by 16 per cent to Pounds 166.5m, including Pounds 7.2m from the recently established non-regulated businesses. However, tight control of costs - which rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 102.5m - meant that operating profits for the year to March 31 jumped 25 per cent to Pounds 64.2m. A 30 per cent drop in interest receivable to Pounds 25.9m - the fruits of the Pounds 266m cash dowry bestowed by the government upon privatisation - held back growth in pre-tax profits, which advanced by Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 90m. SWW retained a net cash pile of Pounds 150m, said Mr Hill. After charges of Pounds 9m - due to write-offs on advance corporation tax - and dividend payments, retained profits actually fell by Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 54.3m. Earnings per share rose by 0.3p to 66.1p. The dividend was raised by 1.3p to 14.6p, for a total of 21.7p. The shares fell 9p to close at 437p. See Lex</p>

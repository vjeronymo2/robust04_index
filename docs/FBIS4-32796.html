			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 26 May (PL) -- The Cuban weekly GRANMA  INTERNATIONAL will be published in German for distribution in  Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and The Netherlands to inform  tourists from those countries who visit the island, the  newspaper's directors announced here today.    GRANMA INTERNATIONAL editorial director Gabriel Molina said,  at a ceremony during which Edition Zero in German was presented,  that the event was a day for celebration because a dream has  come true after four years of hard work.    GRANMA's first issue of its monthly edition to  German-speaking European countries is dedicated to Cuba's  struggle to maintain its sovereignty and the achievements of its  revolution despite the disappearance of the Socialist Bloc and  the intensification of Washington's blockade.    Molina noted that the German edition of GRANMA  INTERNATIONAL,  the first Latin American publication in that language, will at  first be issued monthly. Once it is consolidated, it will  become a weekly publication as are the Spanish, English, French,  and Portuguese editions.    GRANMA was initially published in three foreign languages on  15 February 1966, later in Portuguese, and now in German.    It now it circulates in 76 countries. For the past two years  it has been printed in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil. The  German edition will be printed in Luxembourg so that it will  reach readers faster.    Including the copies printed in various countries, GRANMA's  publishes over 70,000 copies.</p>

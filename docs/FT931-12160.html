			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Pension sellers may be hit by tax move SELLERS of personal pensions must inform their clients about changes to tax rules which will make the pensions less attractive, the Department of Social Security has said. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry, yesterday was the first to issue guidelines requiring companies to contact clients for whom it may no longer be worthwhile to maintain current personal pension arrangements when new tax rules come into effect on April 6. If the individuals follow this advice, it could mean the loss of billions of pounds of premium income for the industry. The other self-regulatory bodies, Fimbra, Imro and the Securities and Investments Board, are also to issue guidelines in the next few weeks. The guidelines say enforcement officials from the SROs (self-regulatory organisations) will be checking company records in the coming year to make sure best advice is given. 'The government and regulators are keen to ensure that anyone considering their pension provision receives the best possible advice,' the Department of Social Security said. There are roughly 5m holders of personal pensions in Britain. The product has been the life insurance industry's single biggest source of new business in the past year. Rebates of national insurance contributions (NICs) have made them particularly attractive to young people although as individuals age, the tax advantages disappear. Industry officials estimate that one half to two thirds of all personal pension holders are so-called 'rebate only'. That means that the only contribution paid into their personal pensions are the rebate from their NICs. The new tax rules cut the rebate of NIC available to those who contract out of the state earnings related pension scheme.</p>

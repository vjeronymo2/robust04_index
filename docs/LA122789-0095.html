			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEWIS, EVANS AMONG BEST AND BRIGHTEST  </P> <P> In a decade filled with stars and star-quality performances, a few stood out  above the rest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BADMINTON  </P> <P> Boys: Ferdinand Rivera (Pacifica). Rivera, a native of the Philippines, won  three consecutive Southern Section championships from 1983-85. Rivera, who was  5-feet-3 and 120 pounds as a senior, had a 40-1 record in his final year at  Pacifica.  </P> <P> Girls: Tracy Hudson (Garden Grove). Hudson had a 154-5 record in her four-year  career at Garden Grove. She won three consecutive Southern Section singles  titles, and the junior national championship triple crown (singles, doubles and  mixed doubles) in 1987. Hudson died in October 1987 in a single-car accident  the day after playing in a tournament at Arizona State, the college for which  she competed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Bill Dodd (Capistrano Valley). Dodd, a 6-3, 200-pound right-handed pitcher, was  twice named The Times' county player of the year (1983-84). Dodd had a 28-2  overall record with 300 strikeouts in his three-year career. He led Capistrano  Valley to three consecutive South Coast League titles, and in 1983 was named  the 2-A player of the year after leading his team to the 2-A championship. As a  senior, Dodd went 10-0 in the regular season with a 1.72 earned-run average,  and batted .425 with a county-leading nine home runs. He played for Arizona  State one season and then one season for Saddleback College before signing with  the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Boys: Tom Lewis (Mater Dei). In his senior year, Lewis averaged 32 points and  11.7 rebounds in leading the school to the 1985 5-A championship. That year,  Lewis received the same honor -- being named the Southern Section player of the  year -- as two other Mater Dei players in this decade: Matt Beeuwsaert (1983,  4-A) and LeRon Ellis (1987, 5-A). In addition to leading Mater Dei to the 1985  5-A title, Lewis helped the Monarchs to the 1983 Southern Section title as a  sophomore. In 1984, he led them to the 1984 title game, which they lost to Long  Beach Poly in overtime, 45-44. "He was probably the only guy that played on a  team that dominated like we did for three years," Coach Gary McKnight said.  </P> <P> Girls: Aimee McDaniel (Brea-Olinda). At 5-6, the senior point guard has become  the best player in Brea's illustrious history. McDaniel, The Times' county  player of the year as a sophomore in 1988 and the Division III player of the  year in 1989, is an exceptional outside shooter, but her greatest strength  perhaps is her tenacity. Nicknamed the Baby-faced Assassin, McDaniel has stared  down -- and outplayed -- a number of the state's older, bigger and stronger  players. "We had Carrie Egan (the 3-A player of the year in '87), but we  couldn't beat anyone (on the national level) with Carrie," Brea Coach Mark  Trakh said. "With Aimee, we've beat teams that are powers outside (Orange  County). Aimee's the best impact player we've ever had."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY  </P> <P> Boys: Jon Butler (Edison). Although Butler ran only one season in the 1980s  before graduating, that one season proved more impressive than those of any  other county runner in the next nine years. In 1980, Butler was undefeated,  winning the 4-A title at Saddleback College in 14:56. Butler went on to become  a two-time All-American at UCLA.  </P> <P> Girls: Polly Plumer (University). Plumer was plagued with injuries throughout  her career, but when she was healthy, she was nearly unbeatable. She won two  Southern Section 4-A titles (1980-81), and ran the Mt. SAC course in 17:27,  still the fastest time for any county girl. Although her best sport was track  -- a three-time state champion at 1,600 meters and she still holds the national  record in the mile at 4:35.24 -- Plumer was the most talented female prep  distance runner in the county since Mary Slaney, who attended -- but did not  compete for -- Orange High School.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Bret Johnson (El Toro). Johnson passed for 6,627 yards in his career -- 2,458  in his senior season -- but his best statistic perhaps is that he never lost a  game he started in his junior and senior seasons. As a junior in 1986, Johnson  was the county's highest-rated passer during the regular season with 20  touchdowns and two interceptions. That year, he led El Toro to a 14-0 record  and the Southern Conference championship, and was named The Times' quarterback  of the year. As a senior in 1987, Johnson, now at UCLA, missed four games with  a knee injury that required surgery, but still finished as the county's  second-leading passer (after Capistrano Valley's Todd Marinovich). He finished  with 1,369 yards and 15 touchdowns in leading El Toro to its second consecutive  Southern Conference title.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GOLF  </P> <P> Boys: Chris Tidland (Valencia). Tidland won the Southern Section individual  title in 1989, becoming only the second county player to do so in the '80s  (Matt Baugh of Huntington Beach won in 1988). Tidland was named The Times'  golfer of the year as a junior in 1989. He won the highly competitive Orange  League title that year with a scoring average of 73.6, and averaged 1.79 putts  a hole. He had only three double bogeys all season.  </P> <P> Girls: Kim Saiki (Ocean View). Saiki won the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn.  regional championship twice (1983, '84) and was the runner-up in 1982. She was  the only county girl to win the tournament.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Michele Granger (Valencia). Granger, a three-time Southern Section player of  the year (1986-88), has been called the best softball pitcher in the world on  several occasions. In high school, Granger set national career records for  strikeouts (1,635), no-hitters (36) and perfect games (nine). She set national  single-season records for strikeouts (509) and perfect games (three), and tied  national single-season records for no-hitters (11) and consecutive strikeouts  in a game (21). Perhaps her most impressive statistic, however, is her 71 high  school victories, of which 36 were no-hitters. A two-time Times' county player  of the year, Granger, who is now attending Cal, won several championships on  the national and international levels, but her high school team never won a  Southern Section title.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOCCER  </P> <P> Girls: Julie Foudy (Mission Viejo). A three-time Times' county player of the  year and a three-time Southern Section player of the year, Foudy, a 5-6  midfielder, was the key to Mission Viejo's domination from 1986-88. In that  time, the Diablos won three Southern Section 4-A titles (the '86 title was  shared with Edison). In addition, Foudy led Mission Viejo to 84 consecutive  games without a loss -- a national record. Foudy, now playing at Stanford, is  considered among the finest women players in the nation -- on any level.  </P> <P> Boys: Joe-Max Moore (Mission Viejo). Last March, Moore led Mission Viejo to its  first Southern Section title in the 3-A division. Despite being one of the  smallest players around (5-7, 130 pounds), the midfielder was nearly  unstoppable. Now playing for UCLA, Moore led the South Coast League in goals  (25) and assists (10) in 1989 and was named player of the year in the league  and the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SWIMMING  </P> <P> Boys: Darren Ward, (Sonora). Ward set Southern Section records in the 200-yard  individual medley (1:48.83) in 1987, a national record at the time, and the  100-yard freestyle (45.31). Both records are still current Southern Section  bests. Ward, who now attends UCLA, won the 3-A 200 IM and 100-yard freestyle in  1985, '86 and '87. Last year, Ward swam for the Canadian Olympic team.  </P> <P> Girls: Janet Evans (El Dorado). Many Olympic swimmers wouldn't even bother  competing at the high school level, but Evans, who won three gold medals at the  1988 Seoul Olympics, was a team player all the way. She competed in four  Southern Section championship meets at El Dorado, where she won 10 section  titles (including relays). Evans, now swimming at Stanford, set national high  school records in the 200-yard IM (1:59.96) and the 500 freestyle (4:38.34).  Even though Evans became an international swimming star, she said high school  competition offered her some things Olympic competition never could. "I got to  swim the 100 backstroke and the 100 breaststroke (in high school)," she said.  "I could never do that on the international level."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TENNIS  </P> <P> Boys: Mike Briggs (Corona del Mar). A three-time Times' county player of the  year, Briggs was a four-time Sea View League singles champion and won the  Southern Section individual title as a sophomore. Although he lost in the  semifinals as a junior and senior, those were his only losses those seasons.  Though it is not a Southern Section-sanctioned event, winning the Ojai  tournament was probably Briggs' greatest accomplishment during high school.  Briggs went to UC Irvine, where he played his freshman and sophomore years, but  left school last year to play professionally.  </P> <P> Girls: Keri Phebus (Corona del Mar). Last year as a freshman, Phebus became the  first county girl to win a Southern Section individual singles title. This  fall, she won the title again. She also has led Corona del Mar to the last two  section team titles. "She's the best player I ever saw out of this county," her  coach, Dave Heffern, said. Phebus, The Times' player of the year in 1988 and  '89, has lost only two high school matches -- she was undefeated this year --  but is considering skipping high school competition next year to concentrate on  national and international tournaments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD  </P> <P> Boys: Brian Blutreich (Capistrano Valley). Blutreich set county and state  records in both the shotput (69-feet 6 1/2-inches) and discus (210-8) in 1985.  He won the Southern Section, Masters and state shotput titles in both 1984 and  '85, and Southern Section, Masters and state titles in the discus in '85. In  the 1985 Keebler Invitational, he won both the shot and discus events, becoming  only the second athlete to win both in the meet's history. Other county  weightmen pale in comparison to Blutreich -- none have tossed the discus more  than 191 feet, and in the '80s, the athlete to come closest to his mark was San  Clemente's Jim Doehring, who had a toss of 64-11 3/4 in 1980. Blutreich is  currently competing for UCLA.  </P> <P> Girls: Natalie Kaaiawahia (Fullerton). Kaaiawahia is the only athlete, male or  female, to win four state titles in the same event, as she did in the shotput  from 1980-83. She added two more state titles in the discus in 1981 and '83.  Most impressive, though, is her national prep record in the event, 53-feet 7  3/4-inches set in 1983, which has not been threatened. Kaaiawahia owns the  nation's top 10 girls' throws of all time. Her 10th-best throw -- 51-8 1/2 as a  sophomore in 1981 -- would still be a national record by 4 1/2 inches.  Kaaiawahia also holds the county record in the discus (174-9), which is 10th on  the national list. Kaaiawahia went to Arizona State, but after failing to make  the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, she left school a year later, and is working as a  reserve police officer in Grover City.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Boys: Dan Hanan (Edison). Newport Harbor's Dan Glenn has coached some of the  county's best boys' players, but he singles out Hanan, the 1986 4-A player of  the year, as the best. Hanan, a senior playing at Stanford, never played  volleyball until high school, but quickly adapted to the game. A 6-4 middle  blocker, Hanan was an All-Southern Section selection as a junior and senior,  and was The Times' player of the year in 1986.  </P> <P> Girls: Bev Oden (Irvine). The third of three talented volleyball-playing  sisters, Oden helped lead Irvine to three Southern Section finals and two  Southern Section and state championships. In her senior season in 1988, Oden, a  6-2 middle blocker, was named the player of the year in the South Coast League,  Southern Section and state. At the state championship, she recorded a  state-record 25 kills in Irvine's victory over Davis High. Oden, who started at  Stanford this year as a freshman, also was a state finalist in the shotput.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WATER POLO  </P> <P> Chris Oeding (Corona del Mar). Oeding, the 1988 Southern Section player of the  year, was a two-time high school All-American (1986-87). He led Corona del Mar  to two Southern Section titles. In 1987, he was selected first-team  All-Southern Section, and in '86 was selected to the third team. Oeding, a  second-team collegiate All-American for Stanford this season, played for the  U.S. national youth team as a high school senior.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WRESTLING  </P> <P> Steve Lawson (El Dorado). Lawson won Southern Section and state titles in 1986  at 191 pounds, leading El Dorado to second place in the state. He had  impressive take-down abilities; his best performance might have been in the  state finals, when he pinned his opponent in the championship match. "Steve  Lawson was absolutely the most dominant wrestler and probably the toughest (in  Orange County)," Canyon Coach Gary Bowden said. Lawson wrestled for the Army  for two years before going on to Cal State Bakersfield.  </P> <P> (Note: All selections were based on accomplishments in high school only).  </P></p>

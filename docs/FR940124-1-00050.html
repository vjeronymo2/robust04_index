			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.26&blank;Required Accreditation Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 496 of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable authorities as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs only if the agencies satisfy standards established by the Secretary. Section 496(a) specifically requires the Secretary to establish standards and requires the standards to include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 496(a)(5) of the HEA provides that the Secretary's standards for recognition of accrediting agencies must require that an accrediting agency establish accreditation standards that assess 12 areas pertaining to the institutions or programs it accredits. These areas are: (1) Curricula; (2) faculty; (3) facilities, equipment and supplies; (4) fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operation; (5) student support services; (6) recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading and advertising; (7) program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees or credentials offered; (8) measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours; (9) success with respect to student achievement in relation to the institution's mission; (10) default rates in student loan programs under Title IV of the HEA; (11) record of student complaints received by, or available to, the accrediting agency; and (12) the institution's compliance with its program responsibilities under title IV of the HEA. However, under section 496(a)(5), accrediting agencies that have as their principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher education or higher education programs to enable them to participate in Federal programs not authorized under the HEA are exempt from the requirement to have standards for the areas listed in (7), (8), (9), (10), and (12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that most accrediting agencies already have standards addressing many of these areas. However, to the extent that an agency does not have standards for all of them, there is an increased cost to that agency to develop and implement the new standards. The Secretary believes that the proposed regulations minimize the increased cost by allowing agencies maximum flexibility to set their standards to best suit their needs and the needs of the institutions or programs they accredit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the ultimate purpose of section 496 is to authorize the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable authorities as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit, so that recognized agencies only accredit institutions or programs of demonstrated quality, then the Secretary believes that each agency's standard for a particular area listed in section 496(a)(5) must evaluate the quality of the effort the institution or program is making in that area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Should investors steer clear of gilts? - With prices still falling, Graham Bowley examines the risks of buying government bonds The wise investor, it seems, would do well to stay clear of the UK government bond - or gilt - market. After another battering this week, the risk that gilts will fall still lower looks just too great. But others believe differently: for them, the only way is up. Who is right will depend on what happens to inflation and interest rates. Bond markets have been in a tizzy ever since February when the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, raised short-term interest rates in a pre-emptive strike on inflation. Investors took fright, sensing a turning point in world rates, and bond prices plummeted. The UK market has been one of the worst affected: gilt prices have fallen by nearly 15 per cent since the beginning of the year. Yields have climbed 2 1/4 percentage points; long-term interest rates now stand at more than 8 per cent. The implication is clear: the markets expect inflation and interest rates to rise soon. All the signs are that the economic recovery is continuing apace and is managing to ride out the April tax increases that some thought would stop it dead. There is, however, scant evidence that inflation is beginning to rise - underlying inflation is at its lowest level since 1967. There is also little reason to believe short-term interest rates are about to increase. Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was even seen to argue for a cut in interest rates in the last published minutes of his monthly meeting with Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. His panel of independent advisers, the so-called six wise men, have said there is no need for interest rates to go up. The Bank has hardened its stance on interest rates - and indeed it would need to be brave, if not foolhardy, to try to cut them short-term in the face of rising long-term rates. The consensus now seems to be that while interest rates have gone down as far as they are going to go, they are not going to go up just yet, either. So why the nervousness in the gilt market? Calm and common sense seemed to have been restored after the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, lowered its discount rate on May 11 and the Federal Reserve raised US short-term interest rates again on May 17. The bond markets seemed satisfied that the central banks' monetary policy reflected the different stages of economic recovery in each country - the US already well into its comeback, followed closely by the UK, with the rest of Europe still growing only slowly. Investors, however, began to doubt that the US had done enough to shift interest rates to a more 'neutral' stance - one that neither stimulates nor stunts the recovery. Then, comments by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, and concern about continued explosive growth in the German money supply, combined to challenge the assumption that German interest rates would continue to fall. The final straw for the markets came this week when lack of demand forced the Bundesbank to call off an auction of German government bonds. Germany's bond market took a dive - and gilts followed suit. So, is now a good time to buy bonds? 'Gilts definitely look cheap at the moment,' says Ruth Lea, chief UK economist at Lehman Brothers. 'Long yields could easily fall from their present high levels and, with a corresponding rise in price, that means a substantial capital gain. But whether now is the right time to buy depends on whether you think interest rates are about to turn, and that is very difficult to judge with current market volatility.' Over to James Higgins, of financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe. 'It's almost the time to buy,' he says. 'Gilts are oversold at the moment but we are advising people to sit tight, at least for a few months, until all this uncertainty has been shaken out.' Richard Boyton, another adviser, adds: 'A yield of, say, 7 1/2 per cent and inflation of 2 per cent gives a real return of 5 1/2 per cent. There may be some capital loss but the return is not bad at all.' More nervous investors may want some sort of protection, such as that provided by an index-linked gilt, the value of which is adjusted for inflation. Alternatively, the new convertible bond issued by the Bank of England this week, the first since 1987, could provide the protection the personal investor needs when faced with such volatility. The Bank auctioned Pounds 2bn of 7 per cent convertible gilts which will mature in August 1997 - but which investors have the option of converting into a 9 per cent 2012 bond for the first time on August 6. A convertible gilt is a short-dated bond which can be exchanged for a specified long-dated gilt at a fixed price some time in the future. Its appeal is that it allows investors to take part in more than one area of the gilt market. So, it provides useful insurance or a hedge when yields, particularly at the long end, are volatile. If yields fall, then investors may exercise their option of converting to the longer bond; thus, they benefit from the rising market. But if yields rise, they will be protected by being exposed only to the fall in value of the short-dated bond. 'You get the best of both worlds,' as one analyst puts it. The last convertible gilt, which expired in 1990, was only a partial success: out of a total of Pounds 1bn, only Pounds 50m of the bonds were reported to have been converted. But analysts are much more optimistic about the prospects for the new convertible. They say that the auction was a success despite the general sell-off that occurred in the gilt market on Wednesday. 'You usually have to pay for the flexibility that this gilt offers but, on our estimations, the convertible was good value,' says David Boal, of the American investment bank JP Morgan. 'There was a lot of interest, mainly from long-term holders such as international mutual funds, domestic insurance companies and some bank portfolios. And we think people are going to hold on to them. The Bank has been quite clever in bringing it to the market at this time. It's the sort of thing people want in uncertain circumstances,' Boal adds. Other analysts are less convinced of the attractions of a convertible gilt. They say it is far too complicated for the personal investor to understand, which makes it risky. Nevertheless, it could be the safest place for the wise investor to put his money if he wishes to invest in a gilt market that probably has still further to fall.</p>

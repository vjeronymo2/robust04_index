			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In Zaire, the deputies of the new transitional  parliament have started voting in the election of the new prime  minister. Yesterday, the two-thirds quorum failed to  materialize. But the surprise came from Brussels this afternoon.  Herve de Guelink reports:    [De Guelink] Zairean Parliament Speaker Mgr Monsengwo and  his  first deputy, the Social-Christian Joseph Ileo, are in Brussels.  In a joint communique, both refused to endorse what is going on  at the Zairean parliament at the moment. They in fact think the  election of a prime minister by the parliament is contrary to  the new Zairean constitution which came into force on 9 April.  It took months of bargaining between the opposition and the  allies of President Mobutu to agree on this document. The  speaker of the parliament and his deputy, Mgr Monsengwo and  Joseph Ileo, have therefore refused to endorse what they  consider as illegal and they have appealed to President Mobutu  to fully respect the new constitutional act of transition.

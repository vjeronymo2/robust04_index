			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Filis Kaitatzis] </F>   [Text] The 90 tons of toxic chemical waste in the cargo of  the ship Europetrader is a threat to the Greek sea and the  Mediterranean.    According to the Turkish chapter of Mediterranean SOS  [expansion unknown], on Saturday 26 March, 90 tons of toxic  chemical waste were loaded from the U.S. Incirlik Air Base in  Turkey. The chemicals were loaded in five large containers and  a smaller one and were taken to the port of Mersin escorted by  three vehicles, two American and one of the Turkish police.    The travelling documents say "toxic chemical waste destined  for Britain for processing and destruction."    According to the Turkish chapter of Mediterranean SOS (SOS  Akedeniz), at the Mersin port the containers were loaded aboard  the Europetrader, flying the Bahamas flag, which sailed at 2000  on Saturday for Izmir. The ship was expected to reach Izmir  last night.    SOS Akedeniz asked to inspect the cargo before the ship  sailed from Mersin. However, the authorities refused on the  grounds that "Turkey did not have the necessary uniforms and  equipment to open and check the containers," which do not have  any information about the material inside them.    The Greek chapter of Mediterranean SOS contacted the Turkish  chapter and was informed that "the cargo could be radioactive  waste that will not reach Britain but will possibly be dumped  somewhere in the Mediterranean."    This view is enforced by the path of Europetrader, which  instead of sailing for Britain left for Izmir. The above was  told to ELEVTHEROTIPIA by the Greek chapter of Mediterranean  SOS, which asked the Ministry of Merchant Marine to continuously  follow the ship's path to prevent it from dumping the dangerous  waste in the sea.    The Greek chapter of Mediterranean SOS also asked the  Ministry of Merchant Marine to be in continuous contact with  authorities of other Mediterranean countries, as is required by  the international accords on the transportation of dangerous  waste.    Nikolaos Khrisoyelos, member of the Greek chapter of  Mediterranean SOS, said that now that Greece is presiding over  the European Union it should act decisively to prevent the  transfer of dangerous waste, "especially under conditions that  do not provide for inspection and clarity in the transportation  of these dangerous wastes."</p>

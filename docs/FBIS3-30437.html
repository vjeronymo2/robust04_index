			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bucharest, Feb 2 (AFP) -- A referendum of voters  in the former Soviet republic of Moldova on whether they want  the country to merge with Romania has no more value than an  opinion poll, the Romanian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday [2  February].    The Moldovan Supreme Soviet at the weekend approved a  referendum question asking Moldovans if they wanted their  country to be "an independent, integral state or to unite or  reunite with another country," meaning Romania.    But Foreign Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana said here that  for the referendum to be valid, all Romanians should be  consulted. [passage omitted]    At the other end of the spectrum, Russian nationalists in  the  self-proclaimed Dniester republic in eastern Moldova, who have  been fighting to take their territory into Russia, have called  for a boycott of the referendum.</p>

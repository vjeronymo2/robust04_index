			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Sainsbury shares plunge 48p in biggest one-day fall Shares in J Sainsbury yesterday suffered their biggest ever one-day fall, plunging 48p to 393p, as the UK's largest supermarket group signalled it was not immune to fierce competition in the grocery market, writes Neil Buckley. Sainsbury's disclosed a 1 per cent drop over the past four months in like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, against the same period last year, as well as a fall in profit margins. It warned it would achieve only a 'small' increase in profits for the year. It is also making a one-off Pounds 365m property write-down, and starting to depreciate its buildings. The statement ends a decade of spiralling profits from Sainsbury's which, along with rivals Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, are being squeezed by cut-price operators. The Sainsbury fall pulled down other shares in the sector. Argyll fell 14p to 258p, and Kwik Save 27p to 593p. Companies, Page 8; London stocks, Page 13; Lex, Page 22</p>

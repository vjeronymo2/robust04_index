			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> A LEGAL RIDDLE: CAN ACTOR WIN HIS $9-MILLION BATSUIT?  </P> <P> Holy mirror image! Ex-Batman Adam West isn't doing battle with super-villains  these days. He's fighting another Batman.  </P> <P> West, who portrayed the Caped Crusader in the campy 1960s TV series, is asking  for more than $9 million in damages from a group of advertising agencies that  filmed television commercials with a non-West Batman.  </P> <P> West claimed that the other Batman used West's "likeness, personality, voice  and mannerisms" in a way that would make viewers believe they were watching  West.  </P> <P> Attorneys for West and the agencies appeared before Burbank Superior Court  Judge Stephen O'Neil Friday. O'Neil denied a motion from the agencies' attorney  to dismiss the case and ordered the two sides to appear for trial on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> "It's a small victory for Adam West on his way to trial," said one of his  attorneys, Barbara Silcott.  </P> <P> The commercials depict the Batman and Robin characters shopping during the  Christmas season at Zayre's, a chain of discount stores, Silcott said.  </P> <P> West's lawsuit, which was filed in August, 1988, claimed that the commercials  had been shown numerous times in the United States since 1984 and that his  "reputation as an actor" had been damaged. The suit alleged that West had  endorsed several products and that his endorsement added credibility to the  products.  </P> <P> "They just hired a person to imitate him because they didn't want to pay for  the real thing," said Robert Winckler, another attorney for West. "They just  can't hire someone to look alike or sound alike."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defendants Named  </P> <P> The suit named Ian Leech and Associates, a Los Angeles firm; Ingalls, Quinn and  Johnson, a Boston, Mass., firm and BBDO New York as defendants.  </P> <P> Anthony E. Liebig, an attorney for the firms, said the agencies purchased the  rights to the Batman character from DC Comics, who originated the crime  fighter.  </P> <P> "Just because an actor does a role one time doesn't mean he has to be hired  every time you want someone to play that role," Liebig said.  </P> <P> West was passed over for the hit "Batman" movie now in theaters.  </P></p>

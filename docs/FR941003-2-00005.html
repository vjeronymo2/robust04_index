In the extraordinary event that the Borrower materially breaches its obligation to comply with this, or related, requirements, USAID reserves the right, among its other rights and remedies, to accelerate the loan. (It should be noted that since the inception of the USAID Housing Guaranty Program in 1962, USAID has not exercised its right of acceleration.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Fees: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Please note that Lenders' placement fees (if any), legal fees, and out-of-pocket expenses are to be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> included <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the rate quoted for this financing (i.e., such fees will not be deductible from the proceeds of the loan). The initial upfront fees of USAID and the Paying and Transfer Agent shall be payable at closing from the proceeds of the loan. In the event of bidding through the Financial Advisor, the Investor is required to arrange with the Financial Advisor regarding the fees to be paid, which are also to be included in the interest rate to be quoted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Closing Date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Not to exceed 60 days from date of selection of lender. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selection of investment bankers and/or lenders and the terms of the loan are initially subject to the individual discretion of the Borrower, and thereafter, subject to certain conditions required of the Borrower by USAID as set forth in agreements between USAID and the Borrower. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. The USAID guaranty will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in Section 222 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the ``Act''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lenders eligible to receive the USAID guaranty are those specified in Section 238(c) of the Act.

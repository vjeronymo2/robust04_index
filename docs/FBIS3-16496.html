"The prevailing majority of mass  media are, as before, in the hands of the executive bodies," the  statement reads. "Leaders of the government overtly declare  that media which do not support the government will not be  granted subsidies." The authors of the statement demand that  space in newspapers and even broadcasting time be issued by the  government to various parties and political associations to  allow them the opportunity to clarify their platforms during the  elections.</p>

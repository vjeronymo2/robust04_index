			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Plans for the first ever  exchange of Japanese and South Korean naval training squadrons  are moving forward, Defense Agency sources said Tuesday [14 Jun].    The two countries are working out the schedule, ports of  call  and other details for the exchange between Japan's Maritime  Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and the South Korean Navy [SKN], the  sources said.    Former Defense Agency Chief Kazuo Aichi and South Korean  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae agreed during Yi's visit to Japan  in April that the exchange would be one link in realizing  broader military exchanges.    Progress on the exchange comes as Japanese and South Korean  vessels are taking part for the first time together in the  six-nation RIMPAC naval exercises near Hawaii and as concern  over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program continues to  mount on the Korean peninsula.    According to the agency sources, South Korea proposed the  mutual exchange immediately after Yi returned to South Korea  from Japan. A South Korean squadron will visit Japan followed  by a return visit by a Japanese squadron to a South Korean port.    Japanese officials say that "fundamentally there are no  obstacles" for the exchange but add the situation in North Korea  could alter the plans.    Young officers in the MSDF training squadron have just  recently completed their land-based training and have visited  different parts of the world every year for their training at  sea.    In the Asia-Pacific region, the officer trainees have  visited  the Philippines and Guam but have yet to make a port call in  South Korea.    In the past, South Korea has suggested that its submarine  personnel train on Japanese submarines, but the Defense Agency  has never taken any action.    In its 1992-93 white paper on defense, South Korea called  for  broader military exchanges with Japan as a contribution to the  reunification of the Korean peninsula.</p>

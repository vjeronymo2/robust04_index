			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Breaks Off Government </F> Formation Talks"]    [Text] (ANSA) Arcore, Milan, April 5 -- Silvio Berlusconi,  the media magnate who emerged victorious from the March 27-28  elections at the head of the right-wing Freedom Front, this  evening announced he was "suspending all talks" on government  formation after repeated snubs against his premiership and a  part in government for the hard right National Alliance from the  third player in the loose electoral alliance, Northern League  leader Umberto Bossi.    "From today we are no longer going to the League or anywhere  else. We do not betray trust. We will wait for the president  of the republic to make a pronouncement", Berlusconi told  journalists at his villa at Arcore near Milan, wiping out  tomorrow's scheduled meeting between delegations of the League  and Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement.    Berlusconi said that if Italian President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro, at the end of his consultations with the forces that  won the election, decided to give a Forza Italia member the job  of forming a government, "the day after you would have a  government programme, a team, and without any further  consultation, we would go straight to parliament." "If that  does not happen," he added, "let there be another election to  complete the clean-up."    According to the Italian constitution, the president has  discretionary powers in deciding who should try to form a  government. On this occasion, the three right-wing leaders --  Berlusconi, Bossi, and National Alliance secretary Gianfranco  Fini -- were immediately seen as the victors, and talks began  between the first two after Bossi appeared to tone down  initially hostile remarks against the media magnate as premier  and "the reactionary right" in government.    Berlusconi persevered in talks with the League despite  Bossi's broadsides against his alleged conflict of interests,  the counter- proposal of League Lower House whip Roberto Maroni  as premier, the announcement that the League leader will this  week start separate talks with other parties, and Bossi's  no-show for a key meeting on Friday [1 April]. Bossi's  opposition to Berlusconi's lead role -- seen by some as  bargaining to ensure the League's federalist platform is enacted  -- culminated yesterday in his description of the media magnate  as "a threat for democracy".    Against this background, an SWG poll indicated that one in  four League voters want Berlusconi as premier: 38 percent, just  behind the 40 percent of National Alliance voters who said they  wanted Berlusconi to lead the government.    The poll, to be published Sunday [10 April] by Catholic  weekly FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA, gave the following premier  preferences for all those who voted the Freedom Front (Forza  Italia + League) in the north, and the Good Government Front  (Forza Italia + National Alliance) in the rest of the country:  Berlusconi 43.5 percent, 27.7 percent Fini, 9.1 percent Maroni,  8.9 percent Bossi, and 5.3 percent former Italian president  Francesco Cossiga, an ex-Christian Democrat seen by some as a  possible right-wing peacemaker. Fini even edged out Berlusconi  among young voters (18-34).    Italian futures in London fell sharply immediately after  Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi announced he was freezing  all negotiations with his election allies, Northern League and  National Alliance, indicating that talks aimed at forging a  government coalition had reached a stalemate. Ten-year futures  on the London computerized market, the only one still open, fell  70 cents to 112.50 lire from 113.20 lire a few minutes earlier.    Berlusconi, who spoke for almost an hour without once  mentioning Bossi, called the League's stance "a betrayal". "I  think what is happening is scandalous", he said in reference to  Bossi's announced decision to start talking to defeated centrist  and left-wing forces (although the two prospective bargainers,  electoral reform leader Mario Segni's Pact for Italy and the  moderate intellectuals of Democratic Alliance, by this evening  had received no formal invitation to Bossi's table). "Enough of  this duplicity, these old tricks of the old politics," he said,  stressing Italy's "urgent need" for a government to take Italy  out of this "emergency phase". "We must feel responsibility for  the mandate we have received from the electorate... If there is  a betrayal, there would be only one response from me and from  Forza Italia: go back to the polls to complete the clean-up".    Stressing that he had never "put myself forward" as a  candidate for the premiership, Berlusconi made it plain that "we  have no fear of going back to the country". "It's time to put  an end to the electorate being treated like goods to be bought  or sold," he said.    Lowering his tone slightly in response, Bossi repeated  concerns about Berlusconi's alleged "autocratic" leanings but  was optimistic that "in the end, we'll probably manage to make a  government".    His first comment on Berlusconi's decision was "it's rather  odd, I think his nerves are frayed. Instead of responding on  the grounds of the platform, he put all the accent on the fact  that he's boss. We have said clearly that giving the mandate to  Berlusconi would be like giving it to an autocrat because he  does not have a political force behind him that can mediate."    "In the end, we'll probably manage to make a government, but  it must be clear that there is a great change," said Bossi, who  has attacked Berlusconi as strongly as the left for alleged  links with the "old regime". "People can see that Berlusconi  broke off the talks over the fact that he wants to be boss. If,  with all the problems this state has he thinks the main one is  getting the premiership, then we weren't wrong to think that a  `virtual reality' party means moving towards autocracy. We now  have to save the general principles of democracy."    "I think Berlusconi lost his temper, a typical reaction in  those who are used to getting everything at once. But now he  has the people to face up to, a most powerful force." "We are  very determined, because we know how important it is for the  country to break with the party-ocracy, or the mingling of  business and politics."    Earlier, Bossi had unveiled the new definition of the media  magnate he said he was preparing for the League rank-and-file's  Sunday meeting at their historic rallying-site at Pontida north  of Milan: "Berluskaiser."    He repeated the view that Berlusconi was "dangerous" because  he had a "non-party" behind him -- a contention angrily denied  by Forza Italia clubs, who claimed the spontaneous, grass-roots  nature of the movement -- and expressed "no worries" about the  prospect of League defections to Berlusconi.    In a statement tonight, League whip Maroni -- Bossi's  proposal for the premiership -- said that yesterday's appeal by  Berlusconi to Leaguers to "keep faith" with the electorate  should not be seen as an attempt to woo them into Forza Italia,  but merely a reminder "not to make a government with the left --  something we never intended to do anyway". He echoed other  Leaguers in expressing backing for Bossi's tactics "to extract  the maximum possible" on the federalism front, while saying that  the necessary "deep change" to the Constitution required "the  widest possible involvement of other political forces."    League Senate whip Francesco Speroni accused Berlusconi of  "throwing a tantrum" so as to "get out of giving us an answer on  federalism tomorrow," while League academic and apostle of the  Swiss-style cantonisation of Italy, Gianfranco Miglio, expressed  the view that "sooner or later, Berlusconi will come looking for  us."    National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini -- who had earlier,  after a phone conversation with Berlusconi, reiterated the  neo-fascists' line that "there can be no federalism unless Italy  becomes a presidential republic," with the regions maintaining a  "residual" role vis-a-vis central government -- said that  Berlusconi's move "will help clear things up regarding Bossi,  who was tabling talks on the government or about federalism, you  couldn't tell which." "Berlusconi was right to have had enough  of it: how could he keep talking to someone who went back on his  word every day," he said. "The trick Bossi was trying on didn't  work; he broke the eggs without making the omelette. Now he has  to make up his mind what he wants to do when he grows up."    In Fini's view the current political situation threw up  three  alternatives: a government between Forza Italia, the League,  National Alliance, and Forza Italia's close allies in the  (smaller ex-Christian Democrat) Democratic Christian Centre  (CCD) and other small conservative forces; a government between  the left, the (larger ex-Christian Democrat) People's Party,  Segni's Pact, and the League; and a new round of elections.    In the event of the third hypothesis, he said that "we would  certainly be Berlusconi allies, but not Bossi," whom he said  "was elected in Milan with the help of Forza Italia" and in  another ballot "would end up like Segni, with a handful of  seats."    CCD leader Francesco D'Onofrio said that "Bossi's behaviour  may mean one of two things: challenging the government majority  up to a breaking point, which may come; or seeking an  alternative majority, something that does not concern us."    Franco Rocchetta, the League federal president who has  incurred grass-roots wrath by criticising Bossi in the past,  outlined the possibility of a "constituent government" drafting  clear conflict-of-interest laws that might enable Berlusconi to  take over the helm "in six months time, say."    Another of the more moderate voices in the League, Milan  Mayor Marco Formentini, said the issue of Berlusconi's  premiership was secondary to the priorities of federalism and  neo-liberalism, "to take Italy's state, economy and finance  closer to the European Union."    Rocchetta predicted that President Scalfaro will give  Berlusconi an exploratory mandate, voicing the hope that this  will lead to the formation of a government comprising "all the  forces in the Freedom Front" to draft "strict laws that will  enable a businessman to take on government responsibilities  without shadowy areas remaining". He said that at the same time  MPs "from all political forces, international jurists and the  presidents of the regions" should form "a sort of third Chamber"  to draw up Italy's new federalist constitution.    Berlusconi meanwhile made clear that Forza Italia had never  agreed to "constitutional federalism" as a condition for its  electoral pact with the League, and had yet to receive a  well-defined project from the League. He said Forza Italia's  position had always been "crystal-clear and correct" in  negotiating "fiscal federalism with the League and  administrative decentralisation with the National Alliance."    Berlusconi said he was in favour of setting up a committee  of  "ten wise men" to study the problem, but indicated that any  recommendation they make must be submitted to the popular will  by referendum. Berlusconi denied a newspaper report that he had  "offered Bossi a deal to run the country for twenty years" (a  reference to the duration of Mussolini's fascist regime),  saying: "I never said anything of the sort. What I did say was  that a deal on those programmes could bring ten years of  prosperity to Italy. Why turn something noble into something  ignoble, I ask."    Raffaele Costa, leader of the small Centre Union (another  Berlusconi ally) said he had spoken to Bossi and Berlusconi  before the latter's announcement and had "got the impression  that, albeit with certain conditions and despite appearances,  the government coalition could get off the ground -- and soon  too". He voiced the hope that Bossi would "accept an invitation  to concentrate on the brass tacks of government programmes,  rather than other assessments".    Influential new right commentator Giuliano Ferrara -- a  firebrand speaker from a regular slot on the Berlusconi channels  -- said that "Bossi is doing what he's good at, playing with  fire, but past experience has shown he is often the first to  reach for the extinguisher".    The (former Communist) Left Democrat party's No.2, Massimo  D'Alema said the right-wing rift showed that Berlusconi had  "deceived" the Italian people in "pretending" that his twin  electoral pacts were based on an "accord to govern Italy, while  it wasn't true". "Before talking about a new election the  country is entitled to see if its vote produces a government.  If they aren't able, the initiative should be passed to others.  This is not the only majority possible in this parliament," he  said on RAI-1 evening news.    Interim People's Party leader Rosa Russo Jervolino issued a  statement saying that "in a difficult and delicate moment,  coherence and clarity must be the unavoidable characteristics of  political action."</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Metra cuts year's target after reverse Metra, the Finnish industrial group, yesterday lowered its 1994 forecast after a 17 per cent slump in profits after financial items in the first eight months. The change, which came despite increased momentum in the second four months, means it expects full-year profits to be in line with 1993's FM472m (Dollars 99m), rather than higher. The company said its Abloy security division had not performed as well as expected earlier this year. It also noted that Wartsila Diesel, its biggest unit, had been hit by project postponements and engine line development costs. The fall in interim profits to FM224m from FM270m followed a drop in net sales to FM7.1bn from FM8.4bn. Last year's figure was distorted by Wartsila's exceptionally strong performance in early 1993. Group operating profit was down sharply at FM393m from FM529m, but the impact was cushioned by a FM88m fall in financial expenses to FM189m. Wartsila, one of the world's leading manufacturers of diesel power generators, saw sales fall 21 per cent to FM3.7bn. But its order book has grown from FM3.5bn to FM4bn since the beginning of the year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also, the provisions of &sect;23.1307(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3), are being removed from &sect;23.1307. These requirements have been previously added to &sect;&sect;23.1361, 23.1351, and 23.1357, respectively; therefore, they are redundant and may be removed. The designator for paragraph (c) has also been removed from the remaining text of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1309&blank;Equipment, Systems, and Installations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new &sect;23.1309(a)(4) would correct an inadvertent omission that occurred when the FAA issued Amendment No. 23&hyph;41 (55 FR 43306, October 26, 1990). The omitted requirement was adopted by Amendment No. 23&hyph;34 as a portion of &sect;23.1309(d) and read: ``In addition, for commuter category airplanes, system and installations must be designed to safeguard against hazards to the airplane in the event of their malfunction or failure.'' (52 FR 1833, January 15, 1987.) To correct this oversight, and to continue the single fault provision of this paragraph, &sect;23.1309(a)(4) is being proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1311&blank;Electronic Display Instrument Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise &sect;23.1311 to remove redundant requirements and to clarify which secondary instruments are required and the visibility requirements for these instruments. When &sect;23.1311 was adopted by Amendment No. 23&hyph;41 (55 FR 43306, October 26, 1990), several nonsubstantive changes were made to the proposals in Notice No. 89&hyph;6 (54 FR 9345, March 6, 1989) to remove the redundancy included in the notice. In the process certain provisions, such as the one that permitted the installation of mechanical secondary instruments, were inadvertently omitted from the final rule. Since the final rule, discussions with airplane manufacturer representatives have shown that the requirements defining the instrument panel location where secondary instruments may be installed are also not clear. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing to revise this section to correct and clarify these portions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current &sect;23.1311(a), which requires electronic display indicator installations that are independent to each pilot station, would be deleted because it is redundant with &sect;23.1321(a). Section 23.1321(a) requires that each flight, navigation, and powerplant instrument for use by any required pilot shall be located so that any pilot seated at the controls can monitor the instruments with minimum head and eye movement. As stated in the preamble of Notice No. 89&hyph;6 (54 FR 9345, March 6, 1989) regarding the proposed revision to &sect;23.1321, ``This revision also clarifies the rule relative to instrumentation that must be provided for each pilot required for type certification or by the applicable operating rules. If a pilot is required by any applicable requirement, then that pilot must be provided all instrumentation required for any operations for which the airplane is approved.'' Accordingly, the requirements of current &sect;23.1311(a) would be removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In place of current paragraph (a), proposed &sect;23.1311(a) would be a revision of current paragraph (c) that would clarify what instruments are required and the visibility of those instruments. Proposed new &sect;23.1311(a)(1) would require electronic display instrument installations to meet the arrangement and visibility requirements of &sect;23.1321(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1311(a) (2), (3), and (4) would be redesignated with no changes from current &sect;23.1311(c) (1), (2), and (3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5) would continue the requirement of &sect;23.1303(c) for a magnetic direction indicator and, in addition, would require either an independent secondary mechanical altimeter, airspeed indicator, and attitude indicator or individual electronic display indicators for the altimeter, airspeed, and attitude that are independent from the airplane's primary electrical power. These secondary instruments may be installed in panel positions other than the primary location as long as the selected location allows the pilot to properly monitor the instruments and control the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The substance of proposed paragraph (a)(5) is both a substantive change and a combination of the current &sect;23.1311(b), which states that certain electronic display indicators must be independent of the airplane's electrical power system, and current &sect;23.1311(c)(4) which requires independent secondary attitude and rate-of-turn instruments and specifies the location of those instruments. Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5) would delete the requirement for a rate-of-turn instrument (in current &sect;23.1311(c)(4)) and specify that the required secondary instruments are those that provide altitude, airspeed, magnetic direction, and attitude. The information that would be provided by a secondary rate-of-turn instrument would not appreciably add to the safe operations of the airplane if the pilot has the information provided by the secondary attitude instrument. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current &sect;23.1311(b) requires that electronic display indicators required by &sect;23.1303 (a), (b), and (c) be independent of the airplane's electrical power system. The original intent of the requirement for secondary instruments, as stated in Notice No. 89&hyph;6, was to require the installation of either mechanical instruments or independent electronic display indicators powered by a source independent of the airplane's electrical system. However, the current rule does not clearly state this and does not address the installation of mechanical instruments. Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5), would allow either secondary electronic display indicators or mechanical instruments to provide a crew with information essential for continued flight and landing in the event of failure in the airplane's electrical power system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current &sect;23.1311(c) (5) and (6) would be redesignated as &sect;23.1311(a) (6) and (7) without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1311 (b) and (c) would continue the requirements of current &sect;23.1311 (d) and (e) without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1321&blank;Arrangement and Visibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed revision to &sect;23.1321(d) would remove the wording that limits the instrument location requirement to airplanes certificated for flight under instrument flight rules or airplanes weighing more than 6,000 pounds. Instruments are for the pilot and should be located near that pilot's vertical plane of vision without regard to what flight rules are approved for the airplane's operation or the maximum weight of the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

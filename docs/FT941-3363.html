			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Macy continues recovery despite decline in sales R. H. Macy, the New York-based retailer operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, recorded a further recovery in earnings in its second quarter as cost-cutting took effect. While sales during the period ending January 29 slipped Dollars 40m from a year before, to just under Dollars 2bn, Macy's lifted net income to Dollars 60.5m, from Dollars 8.9m. Selling and other overhead costs were Dollars 68m lower than a year before. Cashflow, though still well below levels seen in the late 1980s, also continued to show a recovery. Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation in the quarter were Dollars 227m, up from Dollars 141m.</p>

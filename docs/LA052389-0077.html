			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A deal allowing a private ski resort in Vermont to cross the Appalachian Trail  was improperly struck, three environmental groups charged in a lawsuit. The  National Park Service in January approved an easement to let the Killington Ski  Area cut trees from a 200-foot corridor across a 1.2-mile stretch of the trail  and cross it twice with ski runs. The park service also waived its right to  review future development by the resort at Mendon, the Appalachian Trail  Conference, Sierra Club and Vermont Natural Resources Council said in the U.S.  District Court suit.  </P></p>

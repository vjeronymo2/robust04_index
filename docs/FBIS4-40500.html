			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric] </F>   [Text] The republic's parliament has approved two draft  laws on entering and exiting the country, and on identity cards  for citizens of Azerbaijan. Under the "entry and exit" law,  exit is restricted for those convicted of crimes, under  investigation, or drafted for military service, as well as for  persons under obligations not to divulge state secrets. Three  types of external passports have been approved: civilian,  service, and diplomatic. The law on identity cards for citizens  of the republic calls for two types of identity cards: for  those under 16, and for those past that age. The plastic cards  will include the name in full, nationality, age, marital status,  eligibility for military service, and a photograph. All the  information on the cards will be put in a unified bank of data  about the country's citizens open for use by the republic's  Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of National Security, and  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The introduction of identity cards  will be financed from the budget at a total cost of nearly six  million manats. All passports of the former USSR are supposed  to be replaced by identity cards before the end of 1996.</p>

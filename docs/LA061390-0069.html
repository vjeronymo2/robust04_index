			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVING IN TO VOCAL FOES, ITALY KILLS BID FOR VENICE WORLD FAIR  </P> <P> Surrendering to an angry opposition that ranged from international  environmentalists and art lovers to hometown politicians and gondoliers, the  Italian government Tuesday formally withdrew Venice's candidacy as site of a  world's fair in the year 2000.  </P> <P> The last-minute decision was a major defeat for Italian Prime Minister Giulio  Andreotti and Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, a persuasive and ambitious  Venetian who had spearheaded the campaign for Expo 2000 in Venice and almost  single-handedly engineered initial government backing for it.  </P> <P> Withdrawal of the candidacy brought applause Tuesday across the Italian  political spectrum, from Communists to Social Democrats to neo-fascists.  </P> <P> "It's a victory of reason over speculation," said Gianni Tamino, a Green  leader.  </P> <P> "A senseless plan has failed, and thus Venice can breathe a sigh of relief,"  said Carlo Ripa di Meana, the Italian who is the European Community's  environmental commissioner, and a member of De Michelis' Socialist Party.  </P> <P> Vocal international and domestic opposition to Venice's candidacy, which  climaxed this week with a revolt in the Italian Parliament, focused on concern  for the environmental health of the delicate, tourist-besieged lagoon city that  is universally regarded as a priceless landmark of world heritage.  </P> <P> Amid a relentless onslaught of day-trippers, 1,200-year-old Venice is being  abandoned by the Venetians. Since World War II, the population has dropped by  about two-thirds to a current 80,000.  </P> <P> De Michelis and supporters of Expo 2000 contended that the exhibition would  reinvigorate the city. The number of visitors could be controlled, they argued.  </P> <P> Venice's withdrawal leaves Toronto and Hanover, West Germany, as contestants  for the fair.  </P></p>

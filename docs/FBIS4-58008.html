			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 30 May (EFE) -- Today, Dominican  Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral advocated that  Haitians be allowed to cross the border to buy food to satisfy  their basic needs. Herrera Cabral said the ban on the entry of  Haitians to buy food "is excessive" and they should be allowed  to buy food. He added that "Haiti cannot be turned into a  prison or an immense concentration camp," seeking to justify his  position of allowing Haitians to enter to buy food.    Since last Friday, Dominican troops have been preventing  Dominicans and Haitians from crossing the border to buy or sell  products. Up to last Friday, Haitians had been allowed to enter  for several hours on Mondays and Fridays to sell their products.  They took advantage of the opportunity to buy dry goods which  are scarce in Haiti.    Increased border vigilance began after Dominican President  Joaquin Balaguer committed with UN negotiator Dante Caputo and  William Gray, U.S. Government delegate, to completely close the  border with Haiti.    Regarding UN observers who will arrive in the Dominican  Republic to supervise fulfillment of the embargo, he explained  they will not bring military equipment or troops. Herrera  Cabral said: "Military equipment is not needed to control a  disarmed and hungry people." Herrera Cabral added that the UN  observers are coming with logistical equipment to support the  border surveillance by Dominican military.    Miguel Bermeo Estrella, UN delegate in Santo Domingo, told  EFE that the observer mission will arrive in Santo Domingo after  UN Secretary General Butros-Ghali studies the report prepared by  the mission that assessed the situation two weeks ago at the  border of the Caribbean island. Bermeo Estrella said the  sending of the mission observers will depend on Butros-Ghali's  decision.    As for the scope of the total embargo, Bermeo Estrella  explained that "humanitarian aid" programs are being conducted  to prevent poverty and hunger from further destroying the  Haitian people.</p>

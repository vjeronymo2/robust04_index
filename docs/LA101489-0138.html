			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> POTENTIAL TOLLWAY USERS TO BE SURVEYED  </P> <P> Worried that toll revenue may be insufficient to build two planned tollways at  their fully designed width, the agency overseeing the projects will ask  congestion-weary motorists how much they are willing to pay to use them. The  Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency voted Thursday to conduct the  new survey after a study by Wilbur Smith Associates showed that ridership will  drop if tolls on the two new highways exceed $1.50.  </P> <P> Tolls of about $1 had been envisioned by transportation planners for both the  Eastern and Foothill tollways. Construction of the projects is scheduled to  begin in 1991.  </P> <P> However, projected revenue from anticipated traffic volumes on both highways  are about 30% below what is needed to pay for building both toll projects as  they currently are designed, Loretta Sanchez, a financial analyst with  Irvine-based Fieldman &amp; Rolapp, said Friday. The firm has been hired by the  tollway agencies to monitor the financial viability of the Eastern, Foothill  and San Joaquin Hills tollway projects.  </P> <P> "We've said for quite awhile now that there needs to be a better look at  revenues versus the cost of the projects," Sanchez said. "The numbers don't  work right now. The engineers are looking at reducing the scope of the  projects, which probably means that you would build all of the (roads) but  downsize them to begin with."  </P> <P> Sanchez said the problem is not that there won't be sufficient funds to build  the tollways, but that big construction bills arrive before toll revenues  accumulate sufficiently to pay off the bonds that must be sold to help finance  the projects.  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer, chairman of the Foothill/Eastern  board, said targets of the new survey will be commuters from Riverside and San  Bernardino counties who work in the Irvine area. He hopes the survey will show  that such drivers are willing to pay $2 or $3 to use the tollways as an  alternative to the already jammed Riverside, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana freeways.  </P> <P> Previous studies have not included those commuters, focusing instead on the  travel behavior of Orange County residents along Interstate 5 and the San Diego  Freeway.  </P> <P> "We don't really know what . . . level of frustration would cause (people) to  pay to move more quickly around Southern California or Orange County,"  Hausdorfer said.  </P> <P> No firm has been selected yet to conduct a new study.  </P> <P> The Eastern tollway would connect with the Riverside Freeway at Weir Canyon and  run to the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine. The Foothill tollway would extend from  the Eastern tollway near Irvine Lake through Rancho Santa Margarita to  Interstate 5 near San Clemente.  </P> <P> The San Joaquin Hills tollway, which is expected to have tolls of $1 to $1.25,  would extend from the John Wayne Airport area to San Juan Capistrano through  Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> The three projects are expected to cost at least $2 billion, with 48.5% paid by  developer fees and the rest by toll revenue, state and federal funds.

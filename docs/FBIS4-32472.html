			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondents' report: "Laszlo Kover Will Be Head of the </F> Fidesz Parliamentary Group Until September -- Boross To Chair  the National Security Committee"]    [Text] Yesterday the parliamentary group of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] nominated Laszlo Salamon, former deputy  head of the MDF group in the parliament, to the position of  chairman of the parliament's Constitutional Committee. Peter  Nahimi has been nominated to the only parliament clerk position  the MDF can fill. Peter Boross, departing prime minister, has  been nominated to the position of chairman of the parliament's  National Security Committee. The MDF also obtained a chairman  position in the Budget Committee: Bela Kadar, former minister  of International Economic Relations, will chair this committee.    According to the six-party agreement, the MDF is entitled to  four deputy committee chairman positions. Thus, the position of  deputy chairman of the Constitutional Committee will be filled  by Katalin Kutrucz, a former member of the committee; Gyorgy  Csoti will become deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee; the position of deputy chairman of the Cultural  Committee will be filled by the previous chairman Attila  Zsigmond, and departing minister of Transportation Gyorgy  Schamschula will be the deputy chairman of the Auditing  Committee.    At the founding session of the new parliamentary group of  the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] held on 22 June, Lszlo  Kover was given the task to head the Fidesz group until  September 1994. The deputies accepted the proposal of the party  leadership to refrain from selecting a new parliamentary group  head for the time being, because the upcoming Fidesz congress  scheduled for 9 July 1994 will also be able to express its  opinion regarding this issue.    After several preliminary consultations, the Fidesz  parliamentary group decided to divide the committee positions  given to the Fidesz. Thus, the Fidesz parliamentary group will  nominate Janos Ader and Jozsef Szajer to the Constitutional  Committee, Laszlo Urban and Csaba Sumeghy to the Budget  Committee, Zoltan Rockenbauer and Zsolt Nemeth to the Foreign  Affairs Committee, Lajos Kosa and Laszlo Madi to the Economic  Committee, and Tamas Deutsch and Gabriella Selmeczi to the Local  Government Committee. Lajos Kosa and Laszlo Urban will be  members of the Agricultural Committee, Szilard Sasvari will be a  member of the Cultural Committee, and Gabriella Selmeczi will go  to the Welfare Committee. Laszlo Madi will go to the Employment  Committee, Tamas Tirts to the Human Rights Committee, Tamas  Deutsch to the Environmental Protection Committee, Janos Ader to  the Auditing Committee, Jozsef Szajer to the Immunity and  Mandate Control Committee, and Laszlo Kover to the National  Security Committee. Viktor Orban will be nominated as chairman  of the European Affairs Committee, and Zoltan Pokorni will be  nominated to the deputy chairman of the Educational Committee  position. Tamas Wachsler will be chairman of the Defense  Committee, and Bela Gyuricza will be member of the same  committee. Szilard Sasvari and Zoltan Trombitas will be clerks  of the committee.    Laszlo Kover told us that Karoly Eperjes did not make it in  any committee because he is sticking to his earlier statement  that he will hand in his parliamentary deputy mandate very  shortly, at the best possible time for the parliamentary group.  (He will probably be replaced by Mihaly Varga, whom the Fidesz  group wants to use as a budget expert). Szekesfehervar Mayor  Istvan Balsay cannot exercise his rights as parliamentary deputy  because of the incompatibility rules, so he cannot be committee  member either. At the same time, he will accept his mandate and  will participate in the foundation session of the new  parliament. If the situation changes and Balsay accepts the  parliamentary deputy position, he will probably get into the  Local Government Committee.    Both the parliamentary group deputy heads and the new heads  will be elected at the end of this summer. Laszlo Kover and  Jozsef Szajer will be nominated to the respective positions.  However, Jozsef Szajer has not yet decided whether he will  accept the nomination or not.</p>

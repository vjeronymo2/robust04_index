			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan slips to Pounds 15.8m SHANKS &amp; McEwan, the Glasgow-based waste management company, yesterday reported only a 5.5 per cent downturn in interim pre-tax profits in spite of being unable to pass on increased costs of environmental control. However, the recession sharply increased the group's interest charge as collection of debts dramatically slowed. Pre-tax profits in the six months to September fell from Pounds 16.73m to Pounds 15.81m on sales up 2 per cent at Pounds 78.1m. The interim dividend is to be maintained at 2.24p. In the largest dry waste division Shanks made Pounds 7.43m after interest, up 2.5 per cent and with an increased margin. Mr Peter Runciman, the chairman who will be stepping down later this month, said new regulations under the Environment Protection Act were bound to benefit Shanks. 'The new environmental legislation is a powerful force in directing more waste towards high standards of disposal,' he said. In the environmental services division, which deals with high temperature destruction of hazardous wastes, sales increased 8 per cent but profits of Pounds 4.58m were down 5.8 per cent as Shanks was unable to pass on the cost of higher environmental standards. Debt doubled to Pounds 16.45m during the period, almost entirely due to later payment of work in progress in the construction services division. 'Being a Scottish-based company with a Presbyterian ethos, we would not like to see gearing go much higher,' Mr Runciman said. COMMENT It would take a brave man to call the turn in the UK's waste management sector. Ravaged by price cutting, falling dry waste volumes and higher costs of meeting stricter environment controls, investors have had ample reason to be shell-shocked. Perhaps too much hope is vested in the removal of capacity that might follow the introduction of new regulations next April. It is simply too early to judge how this might pan out. But judging by what Shanks and Biffa - Severn Trent's waste division - said yesterday about improved or maintained margins, the sector may now have found a bottom. It is premature to think multiples will return to the crazy levels of three years ago, when Shanks traded on a 46 times earnings multiple. But with Shanks likely to make Pounds 28m pre-tax at the full year, or 11.4p of earnings, the shares should probably be on a greater premium to the market. See People</p>

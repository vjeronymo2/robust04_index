			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ben Bailey falls 9% despite sales rise Increased house and land sales helped Ben Bailey Construction, the South Yorkshire-based housebuilder, lift turnover from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 9.25m in the six months to June 30. However, pre-tax profit dropped 9 per cent from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 70,000, which Mr Richard Bailey, chairman, said reflected initial site set-up costs and increased staffing. The number of new homes sold rose by 14 per cent to 136, with reservations up 20 per cent, but Mr Bailey warned there had been 'some falling away of purchaser confidence over the last two months'. Earnings per share fell from 0.51p to 0.45p, but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.3p.</p>

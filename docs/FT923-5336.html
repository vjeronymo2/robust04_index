			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Socialists reject calls for Mitterrand to quit FRENCH government and Socialist party officials yesterday rejected calls for President Francois Mitterrand to resign to ensure a 'Yes' vote in the September 20 referendum on European union. Instead, they took heart from two opinion polls suggesting that the 'Yes' vote was creeping up. In an article in the newspaper Le Monde, Mr Alain Minc, a leading leftwing liberal, suggested Mr Mitterrand should announce he will stand down once France ratifies the Maastricht treaty. The call, repeated by Mr Dominique Baudis, executive president of the centre-right CDS party, echoes earlier rumours within the Socialist party that Mr Mitterrand was considering early retirement. But Mr Mitterrand is expected to confirm that he intends to carry on as president when he appears tomorrow evening in a live TV debate with Mr Philippe Seguin, one of the main anti-Maastricht campaigners in the divided opposition Gaullist party. Mr Minc argued that if Mr Mitterrand offered to resign, the referendum would not be affected by his falling popularity. 'He alone can turn back the temptation to regicide which . . . is assassinating France,' Mr Minc said, referring to the surprise emergence of a majority against Maastricht in some recent polls. No mainstream opposition leader has called for Mr Mitterrand to sacrifice his job to the treaty. His second seven-year term runs to spring 1995. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, scorned the idea Mr Mitterrand should quit. He said: 'The president of the republic cannot put his resignation in the balance, because one cannot mix a referendum on a major question and internal political deadlines.' Officials at the Elysee palace said Mr Mitterrand had not changed his position that he saw the referendum as a vote on Europe rather than on his personal record and that domestic politics should be left to the parliamentary elections next March. Mr Mitterrand called the referendum after the Danish vote against Maastricht in June, hoping he would split the opposition and help revive the treaty. To the government's alarm, support for Maastricht has dwindled. Polls in early June showed nearly 70 per cent backing for Maastricht, but there were narrow majorities against it in three out of six polls last week. In the past few days there have been signs the tide may have turned again as the government has stepped up its previously muted pro-Maastricht campaign. Of two polls published yesterday, one showed 53 per cent in favour and the other an even split. On Monday, another poll came out with a 53 per cent majority. Both yesterday's polls showed a decline in the number of undecided voters, to 23 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, which will help assuage government fears that the treaty could fall through lack of interest. Mr Michel Rocard, a former Socialist premier, told party members he was convinced the 'Yes' vote would win. A 'No' vote would strengthen nationalist forces and would be suicidal for farmers dependent on European Community subsidies, he said. A chance to vent spleen, Page 13</p>

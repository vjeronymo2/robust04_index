			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Australis Media to acquire cable TV group THE long-running saga over the development of a pay-TV industry in Australia took a new twist when Australis Media, which was only floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in September, said that it had agreed to purchase Lenfest Group. Lenfest, a US-based cable TV company, recently acquired New World Telecommunications, provisional winner of the tender for Australia's B satellite pay television licence. Yesterday, Australis said it would issue new shares to fund the deal. It added that it expected to complete the ADollars 117m (USDollars 77m) payment for the B satellite TV licence as soon as regulatory approval was received. Australis also said a further significant equity issue was envisaged to fund the development of satellite television. The Australian government's plans to auction off two pay-TV licences were thrown into disarray when little-known companies put in high - and therefore winning bids - but subsequently failed to deliver the funds promised. However, Australis, which already operates microwave technology pay-TV services, said it had held discussions with the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Trade Practices Commission, and the Minister for Communications and that it expected the procedure for allocation of the B licence to be straightforward.</p>

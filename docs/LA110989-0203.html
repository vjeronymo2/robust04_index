			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 BENEFITS, 2 BOFFO BOTTOM LINES  </P> <P> New math: Eleven hundred guests. Ticket price $250. Net proceeds $200,000.  </P> <P> Those were the booming bottom lines on Saturday at Saint Joseph Hospital's 60th  anniversary gala, a black-tie dinner-and-show affair in the Anaheim Hilton.  Proceeds will go into the hospital endowment fund, according to event chairman  Brad Olson.  </P> <P> Olson -- who also headed last year's benefit -- attributed the phenomenal size  and financial success of the party to increased participation of doctors and  other hospital staff.  </P> <P> "What put us over the top this year was the tremendous support we had from the  medical community, both in ticket sales and in underwriting," Olson said.  </P> <P> Mel Lieberman, one of the four doctors on the party steering committee, said  including doctors was "a novel idea" three years ago.  </P> <P> "No one had ever really asked us to act as patrons," said Lieberman, a  radiologist who has been with the hospital for 20 years. "We started getting  involved three years ago, then we enriched it last year. This year, I made it a  personal goal of mine to meet Brad's goal (of $200,000)."  </P> <P> Lieberman added that the big dinner ticket was easier to sell with the promise  of a stage show -- this year, country gal Louise Mandrell.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we're here to support the hospital," Lieberman said, "so we'd be  here if the entertainment was Attila the Hun. But it's a lot easier to generate  enthusiasm if people can look forward to a show."  </P> <P> Playing to an audience that included nuns from the order of the Sisters of  Saint Joseph, who founded the Orange-based hospital in 1929, Mandrell sang,  danced, fiddled and shook her pink-culotted backside at the audience during a  show-bizzy, hour-long set. Guests then hit the dance floor to burn calories  with Barry Cole's orchestra until almost 2 a.m.  </P> <P> Chapman's new man: Also on Saturday, also big, Chapman College hosted its 8th  annual "An American Celebration" benefit at the Anaheim Marriott, drawing more  than 700 guests at $150 each and raising an estimated $250,000 for the school's  scholarship fund.  </P> <P> This year's event served as a getting-to-know-you party for new president Allen  Koenig, who reported for work at the Orange campus on Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Koenig and his wife, Judy, met with board members and other notables in a  private suite during cocktail hour. Between greetings and congratulations,  Koenig -- who came to Orange County from Boston, where he was president of  Emerson College for 10 years -- said he saw himself "first and foremost as an  academic president. That's where my priorities are."  </P> <P> While his party talk focused on college expansion -- Koenig has said he would  like to see the 2,100-student enrollment up by as much as 50% within five years  -- Judy Koenig had more modest concerns.  </P> <P> "Right now, all I can think about is getting my kids settled in their new  schools and getting them started with some new friends," she said with a laugh.  </P> <P> James Moore, a college trustee and board member for 15 years, characterized the  mood on campus as "filled with anticipation. Everyone's wondering what this  (change of presidents) portends."  </P> <P> For his part, trustee Chuck Martin is thinking positively. "In the '80s,  (Chapman) went from financial difficulties to financial strength," he said.  "The challenge for the '90s is building an institution that is recognized  academically. I think we'll be thought of as among the 10 top small colleges in  Southern California."  </P> <P> Among others in the private reception were Bob and Debbi Elliott, who  co-chaired the event; George Argyros, chairman of the board of trustees, and  his wife, Judie; Myron and Lorene Cole; Dennis and Mary Lou Savage; Paul and  Virginia Knott Bender, and Donna and John Crean, who wore a diamond hummingbird  lapel pin. (Why a hummingbird? " 'Cause I'm known to flap my wings real hard  and not go anywhere," he said.)  </P> <P> Dinner entertainment included a video-and-slide introduction to the Koenigs and  a tribute to Broadway that featured nearly 150 student singers, dancers and  musicians, as well as a 60-member student production staff. As with the seven  previous American Celebrations, the show was produced and directed by  communications professor Ron Thronson.  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Balladur pledges income tax cuts MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday announced a series of tax initiatives to increase consumer demand and help revive France's recession-hit economy. Outlining what he described as a 'new stage' in the action of his government, Mr Balladur said that income taxes would be cut by about FFr17bn (Pounds 1.9bn) following a reform of the fiscal system in the budget for 1994. Tax breaks would also be introduced to encourage consumption and housing expenditure, he said. But despite these fiscal measures, Mr Balladur said he remained committed to the government's objectives of financial discipline and non-inflationary growth. He said that the target for the budget deficit remained at FFr317bn this year and FFr300bn in 1994, and that this would be achieved by limiting the increase in state expenditure to just over 1 per cent next year. The tax measure will be combined with a five-year plan to reduce unemployment. The plan, which includes the transfer of social security payments for the lowest-paid workers from companies to the state, will be discussed with trade unions next month and submitted to parliament in October. Economists said that the various measures would have little impact on growth and unemployment in the short term, and that the French economy needed lower borrowing costs to help stimulate the economy. Gross domestic product is forecast by most economist to contract by about 1.5 per cent this year and unemployment is expected to rise to about 12.5 per cent by the end of December. The income tax cuts, which will be achieved through a reform of France's complex system of tax bands, is expected to be of particular benefit to average wage earners. Other tax measures include tax exemptions for capital gains made on selling mutual fund assets if the proceeds are used to buy houses. The time required to withdraw savings from tax-exempt savings funds may also be reduced.</p>

Ombudsman <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDEP has appointed a Small Business Ombudsman and established a Small Business Ombudsman's office which will act as the small business community's representative as required by section 507(a)(3) of Title V of the CAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Compliance Advisory Panel <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDEP established a Small Business Air Pollution Compliance Advisory Council (SBAP CAP) effective on July 7, 1993, to meet the required November 1994 deadline of section 507(e) of Title V of the CAA. The SBAP CAP is composed of seven members as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SBAP CAP has the following four responsibilities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> compliance  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the state PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these federal statutes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) To review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

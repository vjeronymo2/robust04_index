			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Capital reconstruction and new name for LIT LIT Holdings, the marketing services, investment and fund management group that has specialised in business expansion schemes, is to restructure and eliminate its Pounds 8m of bank debt. The group, which will seek shareholder approval for the proposals at an extraordinary meeting on December 22, has also settled, without adverse impact, an investigation by the Inland Revenue. The name is to be changed to Johnson Fry Holdings, its UK financial services company. The proposals include the conversion of all preference shares, the acquisition of significant minority interests and the removal of very small shareholdings. An open offer of 1.81m new ordinary shares is being made at 43p a share. It is also intending a 1,000 for 1 share consolidation and a 25 for 1 share split giving an effective consolidation of 40 for 1. The repayment of the bank debt, which had already been reduced from Pounds 12m by proceeds from the sale of LIT America, the US futures and options clearing subsidiary, will be financed by cash generated by Johnson Fry. Minority interests will be acquired for 30 per cent of the new ordinary shares. The banks' holding of Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) of Johnson Fry Holdings preference shares will be eliminated, along with Dollars 750,000 of dividend arrears. First preference shares will be converted at 37 for 1 which would give holders a total of 35.4 per cent of the new ordinary shares. Redemption premiums of Pounds 5.17m are being waived, along with dividend arrears of Pounds 151,800. Some of these shares are being made available to the employee share ownership plan and the open offer, leaving the first preference shareholders with 11.4 per cent. Second preference shares will be converted at 10 for 1 giving holders a 25 per cent stake. Redemption premiums of Pounds 14.3m and dividend arrears of Pounds 5.7m will be waived. Holders of the existing ordinary shares will be left with a holding of 9.6 per cent.</p>

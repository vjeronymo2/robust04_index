			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Pilkington cuts dividend for the second time: Profits more than halved as German market collapses PILKINGTON yesterday cut its annual dividend by a third to 4p, despite having held the interim payment in December. The share price fell 6p to 130p. Last summer the glass group, whose profits have slumped during the recession, cut its dividend for the first time since it went public in 1970. Pilkington, which makes two interim payments, last year reduced the second interim from 7.57p to 3.07p. This time it has been cut to 1.07p. The first interim has been held at 2.93p. Annual pre-tax profits for the year to March fell from Pounds 95.7m to Pounds 40.7m on sales of Pounds 2.57bn, against Pounds 2.61bn. The dividend cut saves the company Pounds 16m plus associated tax payments. Even so, the high tax charge of Pounds 46m, up from Pounds 43.8m, and the remaining dividend bill caused a retained loss of Pounds 51.4m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 20.1m. The loss per share was 2.6p against earnings of 3.5p. In December the company justified holding the dividend by saying it was 'marginally more optimistic'. Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said yesterday that most of the encouraging trends the group had seen in December had continued, but there had also been 'a dramatic collapse' in Germany, where the situation remained uncertain. Pilkington's German business contributed a third of group operating profits. In January, the German carmakers which Pilkington supplies, such as Mercedes and BMW, 'virtually shut down for four weeks,' said Mr Roger Leverton, chief executive. Sales of glass to the housebuilding industry had held up but prices were under pressure. Analysts speculated that the dividend cut showed Mr Leverton, who joined the group in July last year, had had more of a say in the decision. Sir Antony is thought to have wanted to maintain the payout. Sir Antony said that improving signs included a pick up in profits in the group's southern hemisphere operations, and the 'amazing difference' that sterling's devaluation had made to the UK operations' competitiveness. In the second half of the financial year float glass volumes were the highest they had been for three years. Costs savings had been achieved and an 8 per cent price rise in the UK was sticking. Although group borrowings had risen from Pounds 760m to Pounds 932m, Sir Antony said there was no need for a rights issue as disposals would cut debt. He added that an investigation was progressing at Libbey-Owens-Ford - Pilkington's North American subsidiary where three top executives, including the president, have been suspended after apparent breaches of company procedures. Legal proceedings against a third party had been instituted. The business was continuing normally. Lex Page 14; Details, Page 19; London SE, Page 34</p>

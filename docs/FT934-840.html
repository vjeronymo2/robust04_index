			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: FAO says 3% cereal output rise needed World cereal production must rise by at least 3 per cent next year to avoid a further reduction in the stocks that act as a safety net against famine, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation says today. Global output this year is estimated to have fallen by about 4 per cent to 1.88bn tonnes, contributing to serious food shortages in some countries and eating into world cereal stocks, the FAO says in its latest analysis of the world food situation. It says there are 790m chronically undernourished people in the developing world and a further 2bn suffering from diet-related deficiency diseases that can retard growth and lead to blindness and other serious disorders. World cereal stocks have to equal at least 17 per cent of annual consumption 'to safeguard world food security', and this should be the case next year, according to the FAO. 'Failure to boost cereal production could have a serious effect on international cereal prices, already increasing in response to tightening supplies in 1993-94, and on food security prospects, particularly of low-income food deficit countries,' says Mr Edouard Saouma, FAO director-general. Early prospects for crops next year are seen as generally favourable, except in Russia, where bad weather and a shortage of funds to buy fuel and inputs have led to a sharp drop in the area sown with winter grains. While African nations form the majority of those threatened by food shortages, nearly 1m people in Russia's war-torn neighbours Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia need emergency assistance to avoid starvation. The FAO estimates that world wheat production will remain level in 1993-94 at about 567m tonnes, while coarse grain output will fall from 871m tonnes to 791m tonnes and rice production will be down 6m tonnes at 520m, mainly because of particularly wet weather. It forecasts that world trade in cereals in 1993-94 will be 190m tonnes, about 7 per cent less than the estimated trade volume the previous year. This fall would be mainly attributable to a drop in demand for wheat and coarse grain imports. World trade in wheat and wheat flour, for example, is expected to be 93m tonnes, or 5m tonnes less than last year, mainly because the countries of the former Soviet Union are likely to import only 11m tonnes compared with 16m in 1992-93. The US, for whose grain exports these countries are leading customers, will therefore experience the sharpest drop in wheat exports, the FAO says. Against the general trend, Australia is expected to export substantially more because of a large increase in its production. Developing nations are expected to import about 67m tonnes of wheat, roughly the same as last year. But a record harvest this year in India means that it will need only negligible imports, compared with the 3m tonnes it bought last year. Trade in coarse grains is forecast to be 82m tonnes, 9m less than last year, with the drop mainly affecting maize.</p>

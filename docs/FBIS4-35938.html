			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait City, June 4 (AFP) -- Yemen's civil war will  drag on for 100 years if the international community recognises  the breakaway southern state, a northern Yemeni diplomat warned  Saturday [4 June].    Ghalib 'Ali Jamil, Yemen's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told  the Kuwaiti daily Al-Siyasah: "If the Arabs and the world want  Yemenis to continue slaughtering each other for 100 years, they  only have to recognise the secession" of the self-declared Yemen  Democratic Republic.    "We will then be two countries and for decades we will  devote  ourselves to war, instead of development," he said, adding both  sides would use oil revenues to buy arms.    Civil war broke out on May 5, four years after conservative  North Yemen was unified with the Marxist South.    Southern leaders declared the independent republic on May  21,  but it has yet to be officially recognised by any country.    Jamil also criticised the adoption of a UN Security Council  resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire.    "Yemen's affairs, which are strictly local, should not have  been brought before the Security Council," he said.</p>

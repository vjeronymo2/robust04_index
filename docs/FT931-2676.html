			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico City in Dollars 1bn water deals THREE British and two French water companies, working with Mexican partners, have won contracts worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 704m) over 10 years to improve water and sewerage services in Mexico City. The contracts, described as among the biggest of their kind, are part of an attempt to expand and upgrade the capital's water and waste water system and to improve the service to about 9m people. The government is relying increasingly on private sector enterprises to carry out work previously done by the state. North-West Water and its Mexican joint venture partner, the construction group Grupo Gutsa, won a contract valued at Dollars 400m over 10 years to provide services for five of the 16 municipalities, representing almost a third of the city. Severn-Trent and its partner Iasa won a contract valued at Dollars 350m in four municipalities in the central and north-eastern areas of the capital. A group incorporating Anglian Water and Lyonnaise des Eaux, which together have a 49 per cent stake in a joint venture with Bufete Industrial and Bancomer of Mexico, was awarded a contract for four municipalities covering 2.3m people, although financial details were not available. The contract won by a joint venture of Generale des Eaux, with a 30 per cent stake, the construction group ICA and bankers Banamex, covered three municipalities and is expected to yield turnover of FFr500m (Pounds 63m) a year after the first two years, according to the company. The first stage will involve preparing a water census for the city, installing meters and mapping the water and sewer network. New billing methods will also be put in place and a large programme of repairs and improvements carried out.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>   [Text] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has sent a  letter to European Commission President Jacques Delors demanding  that efforts to promote Cyprus' application for membership in  the European Union [EU] be stopped. According to I SIMERINI's  information, in an effort to prevent this, the occupation leader  sent a letter on the eve of the Corfu Summit (its work concluded  yesterday) asking outright that all activities surrounding the  Cypriot application be stopped.    Well-informed sources told I SIMERINI that Denktas mentioned  in his letter to the European Commission president that "for the  first time in 30 years, the Cyprus issue has come very close to  a solution." Denktas said it is a shame to undermine this  effort through such activities (by promoting the application).  At the same time, Denktas again questioned the legitimacy of  the Republic of Cyprus, claiming that it does not represent the  entire population.    In any case, Denktas called on the Turkish Cypriots to cause  unrest according to the TMT [Turkish Resistance Organization]  system, and prevent Cyprus' accession to the EU at all costs,  because something like this would mean that the island was being  hellenized.    The entire effort of the Turkish side has recently focused  on  creating a "good impression" of its intentions toward the Cyprus  issue. This was done by sending messages to the European  leaders, not the Security Council, in an effort to prevent  Cyprus' application from moving forward. At first glance, it  does not appear that the Turkish efforts have succeeded, because  the EU decided to include Cyprus in its next expansion. On the  other hand, it is believed that the Turkish side will use the  accession issue persistently and coercively during the process  of resolving the Cyprus issue.    The Turkish side, especially Ankara, which has the  capability  to intervene diplomatically, demanded that UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali issue a supplementary report during the  Corfu Summit, something that did not happen. The contents of  the letter (the supplementary report will be in the form of a  letter) will satisfy the Turkish side. On the other hand,  current efforts mainly aim at finding a formula to keep the  confidence-building measures permanently on the negotiating  table and also to satisfy President Glavkos Kliridhis on other  points.    I SIMERINI's information is that a British intervention is  expected on the Cyprus issue, which will consider that the  United States has failed (just like the United Nations) in its  efforts. The entire British philosophy will be based on creating  conditions for a discussion on various aspects to find a  commonly accepted procedure. This will be achieved at meetings  with both sides (Butrus-Ghali's fourth option). There might  also be a preparation (fifth option) with the arrival of the  Security Council representatives for talks.</p>

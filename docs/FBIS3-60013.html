			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "CMI Television Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Government Minister Fabio Villegas angrily  complained today to Valle Governor Carlos Holguin for describing  a weekend operation against the Cali Cartel as a failure. The  governor said that Villegas' complaint was offensive.    The controversy between the two ranking officials began as a  result of a letter that Holguin sent to Police Director General  Octavio Vargas rejecting the way in which an operation against  alleged drug traffickers was executed in Cali.    Villegas responded to the criticism and said that the  delivery of suspected drug-trafficking criminals cannot lead to  a decrease in operations.    In addition the minister said that in this type of operation  one cannot judge about any inconveniences caused, and he added  that he does not understand the motive of any official who  criticizes the authorities involved in these operations.    In another letter Governor Holguin has said that the  complaint was offensive and that he rejected any attempt to  disregard him, because he was not questioning the operation as  such, rather, the way in which it was executed, a way, Holguin  said, that only guaranteed the failure of the operation.</p>

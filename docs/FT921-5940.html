			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Taxation shake-up urged A SIMPLIFICATION of capital gains tax, a reform of advance corporation tax and the streamlining of the tax system's administration was urged by the Institute of Taxation yesterday. The shift to 'self-assessment' of tax, which places far greater responsibility on companies and individuals, will demand considerable change over the next five years, the tax practitioners' think-tank argued in a wide-ranging submission to the government. Capital gains tax should be abolished, or taxpayers at least allowed to defer payments on gains reinvested in assets or other qualifying deposits, it said. Taxpayers should have to deal with only one tax office and complete a single statement of taxable income and tax to be paid. Companies should be able to offset against tax any expenditure incurred in generating profits, including the costs of raising equity and other financing costs, it said, while more generous relief should be allowed for losses incurred. Advance corporation tax - payments that cannot be offset against mainstream corporation tax liabilities - is in need of reform, it argued. There should be some form of exemption for the distribution of fully taxed overseas profits. There should also be greater consistency in the treatment of relief on employees' expenses, the institute argued. Representation on the form and administration of the tax system. Institute of Taxation, 12 Upper Belgrave St, London SW1X 8BB. Free.</p>

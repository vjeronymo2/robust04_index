			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Business Law: Light at end of Europe's software tunnel SOME THREE years after the publication of its green paper on the legal protection of computer programs, the European Commission is within sight of realising its grand objective. Following an intense exchange of views involving manufacturers, Community institutions, and diverse interest groups, the Council of Ministers last December unanimously adopted a common position with regard to the Commission's proposed directive setting out the principles for copyright protection for software. The parliament has this week given second consideration to the directive embodying the council's common position. Barring accidents the proposed directive should be ready for adoption by the summer. Changes in domestic law to comply with the new standards will have to be in place by January 1993. The proposed directive is readily recognisable to anyone familiar with the UK's Copyright Patents and Design Act 1988, which itself provided the model for many of the individual provisions. Computer programs are classed as literary works, and are granted copyright protection provided they pass a test of 'originality' (ie, not copied). The copyright holder (developer) is given a clutch of 'exclusive rights', the most important of which is the right to reproduce, adapt and distribute to the public the work which the program constitutes. Control ceases, however, when a copy of the program is sold, so that post-sale distribution of that copy is left to the purchaser's will - except in the case of rental to the public, where a specific exemption is made. The piracy of computer programs will thus, under Community law, be equated with the illicit copying of books, sheet music, films or other works already regulated by copyright. Given the value of the software market to Europe - about Dollars 40bn in 1989 and employing more than 300,000 workers - this looks like a big step. However, all EC countries already acknowledge the intellectual property rights of software developers under their domestic law. Thus the real advance made by the directive lies not so much in giving protection, but in the harmonisation of these different national laws, to create the 'level playing field' judged necessary for the completion of the internal market. At the heart of the controversy over the proposed directive lies the problem of reconciling conflicting interests. The Community needs a stable legal environment in which the European software industry can continue to thrive. In particular, clear rules are needed to specify the extent to which a program developed by one software producer can be copied, adapted or limited by another developer or user. The Community institutions, like the member states and all other developed countries, have settled on copyright protection as the best mechanism for striking a fair and realistic balance between developers, competitors and users. To be sure, the accepted principles of copyright law have had to be modified to take the special status of software into account. For example, the making of back-up copies of programs (which could in principle be prohibited under the conditions on which software is marketed) is, under the proposed directive, given as an unqualified right to users where a back-up is necessary for the use of the program. But the core principles of copyright provide the basis for the regime being put forward for approval. One issue vigorously debated in the run-up to the council's common position was whether there should be a specific exception to copyright protection to allow a process called 'decompilation'. This involves taking a program to bits in order to see how it is made and works. Because decompilation means that one or more copies or translations of the program being studied have to be made, the activity could involve a breach of copyright by those who engage in it. Therefore, it has been argued, a specific exception should be enacted in the directive to legitimate such behaviour. Some believe that decompilation is necessary in order to achieve 'inter-operability' - ie, making different programs work together. At the same time, however, decompilation also makes it much easier for a competitor to develop a rival program - in effect, a disguised copy. Where decompilation is improperly used, it allows a competitor to produce a low cost imitation by avoiding the development expense that the original creator has incurred. After the Commission first published its proposal for a directive, some manufacturers and developers urged the addition of a broad exception allowing a decompilation without the permission of the copyright holder. Others argued that such an exception, lacking adequate safeguards, would have posed a great risk to both large and small innovative European software houses that are a key engine of software competition in the Community. A novel program achieves market acceptance because it satisfied a user need. That stimulates competitors to try to imitate its functions. Because the independent writing of such imitative programs takes time, the initial innovator has a window of opportunity to reap a fair return on the costs and risks of writing the original program. If competitors were allowed to take a short cut to developing imitative programs by decompiling original software, the window of opportunity for the innovators to earn a fair return on their investments would narrow. The law would favour imitation over innovation - a formula for stagnation of the sector. The compromise adopted in the council's common position is, first, to allow decompilation but, second, to limit the purpose for which it can be undertaken. Specifically, decompilation can be performed only for the goal of enabling independently created programs to interwork with each other. The copyright owner's permission is not needed where the reproduction of the code is indispensable as a means to achieving this result, provided: the act is done by the person having a right to use a copy of the program; the information necessary to achieve inter-operability has not previously been made available; and the acts are confined to those parts of the original program which are necessary to achieve inter-operability with it. Furthermore, the information so gained may not be used except for the purpose of achieving intero-perability; it must not be given to others (except where necessary for interoperability); and it may not be used for the 'development, production of marketing' of a program substantially similar to the original program. The compromise represented by the council's views on the decompilation exception continues to embody a measure of risk for software producers. Whether or not this exception to traditional copyright principles will open the door to piracy remains to be seen. Despite this, the directive should go far in providing within Europe the safeguards which are needed to sustain lengthy and expensive software development projects. Whether the council-Commission common position achieves a fair balance between competing interests remains a matter of opinion, but the time has surely come to close a debate that has raged for well over a year. No one can claim that the issues have not been properly ventilated, and the industry now deserves a rest from continued squabbling and recriminations. Should there be a case of an abuse of a dominant trading position by the industry giants, as some have argued, then the Commission has other weapons of Community law (Articles 85, 86) at hand to combat this. As far as the UK is concerned, the balanced approach of the present version of the software directive appears to be in line with the approach taken to copyright protection in the 1988 act. Thus, adoption of the directive might not require extensive legislative amendment in Britain. The author is a professor of law at the University of London.</p>

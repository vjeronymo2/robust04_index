			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Italian bank in L1,525bn sell-off SHARES in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group, will be priced at L12,200 each, making next week's initial public offering of 125m shares the country's largest-ever flotation, with a value of L1,525bn (Pounds 709m). Analysts said the price was slightly lower than expected and may have reflected the recent weakness of Italian bank shares on the bourse. Presenting the issue to domestic investors yesterday, Mr Gianni Zandano, San Paolo's chairman, said that the flotation marked 'one of the most relevant deals ever done by an Italian company'. He said restated net profits for San Paolo's banking operations, the only part of the group being floated, amounted to L553bn last year, marking a 12 per cent return on equity. Net earnings are expected to rise this year. The San Paolo group, which has 782 branches in Italy including subsidiaries, has 6.5 per cent of the domestic market for deposits and 7.8 per cent for loans. The flotation of around 20 per cent of San Paolo, is the most significant step since reforms of the Italian banking system were approved in mid-1990. The reforms allowed public sector banks to issue up to 49 per cent of shares in their banking operations on the stock exchange. Banco di Napoli was the first institution to take advantage of the new rules but the San Paolo deal dwarfs the L400bn raised by the Naples bank for the flotation of 20 per cent of its stock last November. San Paolo will use the funds for acquisitions and growth. Last year it spent L2,100bn to gain control of Crediop, the Rome-based, long-term lending institution, and it has made a string of smaller purchases abroad. The bank has given no indication of the stakes to be taken by Hambros, the UK merchant bank in which it is a leading shareholder, or Salomon Brothers, the US investment banking group, in which it also has an interest. San Paolo has a reciprocal shareholding arrangement with both companies, but the accord has been one-sided pending its own flotation. Lex, Page 22</p>

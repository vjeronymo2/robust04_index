			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Poland bids for improved UK trade and investment Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the Polish prime minister, yesterday sought to attract more UK trade and investment by stressing Poland's large market  - equivalent to the combined populations of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and former East Germany - and access to non-Russian sources of oil. Addressing a Polish business conference at the Confederation of British Industry in London, Mr Pawlak said that Poland was currently enjoying rapid export-led economic growth and broad political agreement on the development of market-based reforms. Polish-UK trade has more than tripled in the past four years. This is partly a result of growing UK investment by companies such as Pilkington Glass, British Vita, British Sugar, British American Tobacco, Cadbury Schweppes, BP and British Oxygen, and also because of rising exports of North Sea oil to Polish refineries through the port of Gdansk. In the first seven months of this year Polish exports to the UK rose to Pounds 305m (Dollars 500.2m) from Pounds 251m in the same period of 1993, while UK exports to Poland slipped back to Pounds 366m from Pounds 415m, mainly because of a fall in oil and refined product imports to Pounds 88m from Pounds 151m. Poland's diversification from dependence on Russian oil was an early priority of post-communist governments. By 1992 oil imports from Russia had dropped to 48 per cent of the total, while the UK supplied 21 per cent, Iran 18 per cent and Norway 8 per cent. Last week Russia and Poland were due to finalise an agreement on the construction of the Polish section of a gas pipeline which will eventually bring 67bn cu m of natural gas annually to central and western Europe from the Yamal peninsular. Mainly for domestic political reasons, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, called off the meeting, but the substance of the deal has not been affected. Poland will help build and finance the pipeline and take 14bn cu m of Russian gas annually. Unlike earlier Soviet gas pipelines, which terminated in former east Germany and so represented Soviet control over Poland, the Yamal pipeline will transit Poland and the main throughput will be sold on the German market. Modernisation of Poland's oil-refining and petrochemical industry, requiring a total investment of about Dollars 2.5bn, is one of the government's long-term priorities. But potential foreign investors, including UK oil and energy groups, have been frustrated by political uncertainty over what strategy will follow. Mr Pawlak said yesterday that the government was currently inclined to restructure the industry before privatisation. Officials added that Warsaw would be seeking substantial foreign investment. Developing the energy sector was part of a broader plan to restructure eight industrial sectors, including coal, iron and steel and shipbuilding, which had already had subsidies removed and were now operating profitably, said Mr Marek Pol, trade and industry minister.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Cypriot unity remains a dream now that a June 1 target date set by the United  Nations for progress in reunification talks between the Greek and Turkish  Cypriot communities has passed, officials said. A Greek Cypriot politician said  the only tangible outcome of 10 months of U.N.-sponsored negotiations was an  agreement to withdraw troops from sensitive areas in the heart of Nicosia, the  capital. The head of the Greek Cypriot community, President George Vassiliou,  and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are due to meet U.N. Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York at the end of this month.  </P></p>

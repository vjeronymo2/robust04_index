			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski by Ewa Rosolak and </F> Dariusz Szymczycha; place and date not given: "Wedding and  Marriage Are Two Separate Things"]    [Text] [TRYBUNA] Is the leader of the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] as satisfied as he was on 19 September?    [Kwasniewski] Wedding and marriage are two separate things.  Of course, the election victory gave us great satisfaction. We  proved that there is a demand for the left wing in Poland and  that, despite having been condemned to political nonexistence,  we managed to present a rational program and people who are  worthy of support.    [TRYBUNA] And the challenges that you have been facing did  not reduce your satisfaction?    [Kwasniewski] Everything we have been facing since the  elections is much harder and less pleasant than the campaign or  the elections themselves. The SLD was faced with very specific  and complicated problems, beginning with the formation of the  coalition, maintaining very weak reforms, dealing with a very  neglected social area, fighting unemployment, the poverty of  many people, and changing inefficient ways of implementing  social policies and privatization.    The SLD also had to prove that the contemporary Polish left  wing not only is no threat to democracy but that it strengthens  democracy, and we also had to prove that the victory by the SLD  and the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] does not  mean a return to the old system, undemocratic ways of ruling,  and a centralized economy.    [TRYBUNA] Do you not think that the SdRP failed to consume  the election success to a sufficient degree?    [Kwasniewski] I would like to separate these issues. I  think it is quite natural and a consequence of democratic  principles for a party that has won the elections to coform a  government, its members becoming the ministers, and the party  holding a dominating position in the state administration. And  I reject all accusations that this amounts to booty sharing or  fighting for posts.    In Poland, we must get used to victorious parties  implementing their mandate after the elections, and the mandate  is a consequence of the election results--these parties simply  build their personnel structures and look for instruments that  will allow them to act. In that sense, I do not think there is  anything wrong with replacements at the posts of voivodes [local  governmental officials] or in ministries, provided, of course,  that these replacements are not purges.    The SLD approached the election results with great  responsibility and deliberation. We are the kind of party that  imposed limits on itself. I regard it to be a virtue and not  some evidence of weakness or a mistake. The fact that we  managed not to fight for the post of prime minister--to which we  had a right--despite having won the elections, the fact that we  did not demand specific numbers of ministers and deputy  ministers in accordance with mathematical proportions but were  rather guided by the candidates' skills and human values, not  their party membership--I regard all that to be a virtue, as  well.    [TRYBUNA] We used to say that Solidarity elites acted  differently when in power and in the opposition. Can we not  apply the same saying to the SLD and the SdRP?    [Kwasniewski] I think the problem of acting differently in  the opposition and while in power is generally a big problem of  the relationship between authorities and society in Poland. That  problem is a huge burden left by a difficult historical legacy.    Today, there is a problem and a challenge at the same time:  On the one hand, the question is how to be in power so that  citizens are aware that they and their issues are at stake and  not some incomprehensible ideas or values? On the other hand,  the question is how to shape in Poland the kind of statehood  awareness under which people would identify themselves with  their own state, would respect the legal system, would be proud  of living here and now, and would be able to defend their  state's dignity in contacts with the outside world?    [TRYBUNA] To what extent have you, the SLD and the SdRP,  changed by being in power? To what extent have you abandoned  the earlier program principles?    [Kwasniewski] Right after the elections, people were being  told that the election promises were not being fulfilled. I can  see two problems here: The first is that many promises or  program principles simply cannot be fulfilled immediately. And  the other problem is that some of the promises were kind of  imposed on us--they were not written down by us anywhere. We  did not say that we will find the resources for some gigantic  social programs as early as in the 1994 budget, and that is  because we knew that the budget was going to be burdened with an  enormous deficit and that there is no particular room for  maneuver, unless the maneuver is to lead to a disaster or to a  very short-term effect in the form of inflow of money,  inflation, and a breakdown of public finances.    [TRYBUNA] What happened to the SLD's and the SdRP's  left-wing nature at the time you assumed power?    [Kwasniewski] We have been trying to show and implement that  left-wing nature in a very rational and sensible manner--first  of all by establishing budget principles. We said outright that  there can be no further cuts in expenditures borne by senior  citizens, by the budget sphere, by science, culture, the  educational system, and we also said that one must look for  additional sources of revenue. We went in the direction that  would definitely never have been chosen by liberal right-wing  governments--that is, we increased taxes.    Second, we initiated a more determined fight against the  so-called gray zone by setting in motion customs and financial  mechanisms that are designed to cause an increased inflow of  money to the budget. Third, we are in favor of comprehensive  changes in social policies. These are clear signs of our  left-wing nature.    [TRYBUNA] According to the SLD voters, what you have been  doing can be described at most as building "capitalism with a  human face."    [Kwasniewski] In my view, what we have been doing is  attempting to build a social and economic system that will be  efficient and competitive and that will bring money to implement  social programs--and that is in essence the entire  socialdemocratic or left-wing concept that can be put forward  today. I am convinced that ideological issues are of lesser  importance today.    Our left-wing nature should demonstrate itself through a  modernization of the systems of social care and assistance and  of the entire social policy, but, on the other hand--and this  may sound very liberal--we must take care of economic  development. I remind all those who are critical of us,  including those who used to occupy high posts in the past in the  Polish People's Republic, that Poland was in a state of crisis,  going on for many years, which was due not just to Reagan's  sanctions but also to inefficiencies in the economic system that  was in effect in Poland, despite various attempts of economic  reforms, which, even though they were quite bold at times, were  eventually torpedoed as a result of various political disputes.    [TRYBUNA] As chairman of the SLD and the SdRP, are you not  afraid that your parties will suddenly lose to the left wing,  like, for instance, the Union of Labor?    [Kwasniewski] One can lose to the left wing or the right  wing. I would not regard that as a determining factor, neither  in our thinking nor in our actions, and that is because, in my  view, much more serious issues are at stake in Poland right now.  What is at stake is the strengthening democratic institutions,  the establishment of an efficient economy that will help resolve  the unemployment problem and will result in increased budgetary  revenues for social programs. What is also at stake is Poland's  integration into the European arrangement, based not on asking  for mercy or various credits but on the principle of our being a  significant participant of that arrangement.    [TRYBUNA] According to critics, the SdRP is not supported by  any kind of basis but only by an unstable electorate. They also  say that the party is lacking a class nature [klasowosc]. Do  you agree with this accusation?    [Kwasniewski] I cannot see how anyone could agree with that.  A system of social classes as described in textbooks is fading  away. But the SdRP--and I am convinced of that--is a party of  employees. Modern social democracy does not offer just the  protection of social interests to employees. That function is  fulfilled primarily by trade unions. A political party that  wants to represent the interests of employees must secure  economic development and social justice in the process of  consuming the aforementioned development.    [TRYBUNA] You [left-wing activists] have always wanted to  join the Socialist International. What chances does the SdRP  have now?    [Kwasniewski] I think there is an enormous opportunity in  that regard. The stereotype perception of Poland is changing.  There is nobody around anymore to say that, in Poland, the  so-called postcommunist left wing has no social support. There  is nobody to say that we are in favor of restitution of the old  system and that we are not making efforts to adapt ourselves to  democracy and a free market.    I also think that there is currently nobody in the West who  would have doubts that there are no hopes that a social  democracy may be born out of such forces as the Democratic Union  [UD]. In that sense, there is clearly an increasing interest in  our participation in the Socialist International. I experienced  much to confirm this--for instance, during my talks in Spain,  Norway, and Germany, and also in Budapest and Bratislava. I  have faith that our case will finally be settled during a  congress in the spring of next year.    I think the issue is of mutual interest. The International  must have serious partners in East and Central Europe if it  wants to avoid being pushed into the margin by the right wing.  We also have an interest here because I think the maturity of  many Western left-wing parties makes it possible to use their  experiences.    [TRYBUNA] Two parties representing different interests and  different types of voters form a coalition. According to many  views, the coalition is quite chimerical. Why is that?    [Kwasniewski] A coalition is always a difficult creation  because it is formed by partners with different experiences,  expectations, and programs. That must be said outright. I know  of no coalition in the world that would be free of conflict.    It is a misunderstanding, which is sometimes spread in  society, to view the current problems of the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] and the SLD as having their sources in the old  relations between the Polish United Workers Party and the United  Peasant Accord. It is just a myth. We are dealing with  different parties now, different leaderships, and a completely  different generation of activists, who, in many cases, do not  even remember the old days.    Of course, our partner's temperament and ways of action are  quite different from ours. These are definitely issues that  make life difficult, but they are not insurmountable.    One must say in all honesty that both sides are only shaping  their place and position in this relationship on the basis of  common sense and conviction.    [TRYBUNA] A view is prevalent that there is "original sin"  lying at the basis of the current complicated relationship  inside the coalition. What was that sin about? Was that when  the individual members of the government were appointed? Was  it your statement concerning UD [that the SLD is closer to UD  than to the PSL]? Or was it that you gave up trying to win the  post of prime minister?    [Kwasniewski] In my view, the SLD imposed a limit on itself.  It made a decision on offering the prime ministerial post to the  PSL, and we were right in doing so. We were eager for this  government to be based on a majority, and we succeeded. I  definitely think the attempt by our partner to act through  accomplished facts was not too fortunate at a point when the  government's composition was not yet settled. As far as my  statement on UD is concerned, perhaps that was not too  fortunate, but...    I think that, given the real arrangement of forces in  parliament after the elections, only the SLD had the opportunity  to form a coalition--with either the PSL or UD. Both coalitions  could have been based on majorities. But it turned out very  quickly that UD is not ready for that and is not capable of  implementing such an idea after its election defeat....    I see no reason for the SLD, for instance, to choose just  one  partner currently. It is quite natural in politics to cooperate  loyally with your coalition partner, but there are valves open  also for others. The PSL also has such open valves.    [TRYBUNA] Political stability is a dream of society and of  representatives of elites. What is currently the greatest  danger to that stability?    [Kwasniewski] Given the unique chance that Poland has, the  dangers are inside ourselves, and they are also a consequence of  the inability to find compromise solutions and of a lack of  persistence.    The world has shrunk enormously. Those people count the most  who are able to introduce the biggest amount of the interesting  and the effective into this whole arrangement of political and  economic relationships. I think it would be bad if we were to  lose the chance among disputes and selfishness. Selfishness is  what I fear the most.    [TRYBUNA] What is your position on the "Kwasniewski for  president" idea, which has been appearing more and more often  and which is confirmed by approval expressed in public opinion  polls?    [Kwasniewski] I am happy because of that. But, to be  honest, in my view, the issue of presidential elections should  not appear in serious political debates before the end of this  year. The SLD has not made a decision on the issue, and neither  have I.    [TRYBUNA] We thank you for the conversation.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S SOLID PRECEDENT IN SEEKING OAS CONSENSUS ON ISOLATING NORIEGA  </P> <P> In 1984, Panama joined the many other Latin American countries that made the  transition from military rule to constitutional democracy during the Ronald  Reagan years.  </P> <P> But in September, 1985, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega forced his country's elected  president to resign -- the first step back from the movement toward democracy  in Latin America. As a member of the national security staff in the Reagan  White House, I was unsuccessful in efforts to bring this issue before the  President. Yet I believed then, as I do today, that the failure to help the  people of Panama restore democracy would cause ever graver crises involving  larger human and strategic costs in the future.  </P> <P> After this month's fraudulent elections and the accompanying violence against  opposition leaders, President Bush should use the full resources of the United  States to help the people of Panama restore democracy. He has a bipartisan  consensus about the facts in Panama in support of his initial diplomatic and  military steps.  </P> <P> The objective now should be the removal of Noriega and his clique of  collaborators with the installation of the newly elected government of the  Panamanian democratic opposition. The United States should take the lead to  accomplish this through the collective security instruments of the Organization  of American States.  </P> <P> The first step would be a quiet process of briefing and persuasion in order to  build a consensus among a two-thirds majority of the 32 OAS members. After that  consensus has been obtained informally -- and with competent diplomacy this can  be done quickly -- the issues should be presented for formal action by the OAS.  </P> <P> There is an important precedent, which was undertaken by the Jimmy Carter  Administration in 1979. At that time, the OAS decided that due to the "conduct  of the dictatorial regime governing the country . . . the spirit of hemispheric  solidarity . . . places an unavoidable obligation on the American countries to  . . . bring about the immediate and definitive replacement of the . . . regime  (with the) installation . . . of a democratic government . . ." Those words  resulted in the total isolation of the Anastasio Somoza regime in Nicaragua.  They should be applied to the Noriega dictatorship today. And, also following  the 1979 precedent, OAS diplomatic recognition should be conferred on a  Panamanian government that represents the democratic aspirations of the people.  </P> <P> With those steps having been taken and virtually all OAS member states having  isolated Noriega diplomatically and economically, efforts should then be made  to persuade our allies in the Atlantic Alliance and other key Free World  countries to do the same. With some creativity, it is possible to find ways of  channeling economic help through the Panamanian liberation government to the  people of Panama -- especially the poorest -- so that it is the Noriega regime  that bears the principal weight of this political and economic isolation.  </P> <P> With these first collective security measures in place, there should be a final  offer to Noriega and his clique. In the interest of avoiding further disruption  and possible violence, Noriega and his faction could resign with the promise  that there would be no retribution, prosecution or confiscation of their  current property holdings now or at any time in the future.  </P> <P> If that last offer is rejected, then the Bush Administration must be prepared  to take all necessary means to help the people of Panama -- including the  sensible majority of the Panamanian military -- accomplish the objectives of  the OAS resolution and restore democracy.  </P> <P> Failure to act until democracy is restored will consign the courageous people  of Panama to servitude under a Noriega regime that month by month has been  moving closer into the Cuban orbit. Already Cuba provides bodyguards, secret  police and military personnel who have been training a new, more politically  reliable (though still small) military force and have been helping Noriega in  his campaign of repression, harassment of U.S. military personnel and with drug  smuggling. Unless Bush acts effectively, he risks the chance of Noriega  becoming the Moammar Kadafi of the Caribbean -- a setback for the cause of  democracy in this hemisphere and a growing risk to the Panama Canal.  </P></p>

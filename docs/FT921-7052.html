			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: BSN's Exor bid rejected A LEADING family shareholder of Exor, the French holding group which controls Perrier, yesterday rejected a FFr6bn (Dollars 1.07bn) counter-bid from BSN, the food group. Mrs Corinne Mentzelopoulos, of the Franco-Greek family which made a fortune from the Felix Potin grocery chain, announced she would not tender her Exor shares to BSN's offer, made last Friday. Mrs Mentzelopoulos owns just over 14 per cent of Exor and is allied with Ifint, the Agnelli family holding company which has made an agreed bid for Exor and holds another 39.84 per cent of the shares. Separately, Nestle, the Swiss food group, is making a hostile bid for Perrier itself. The announcement confirms that BSN's bid for Exor has no chance of success, a fact which comes as no surprise to any of the parties in the convoluted three-month battle. BSN has made clear that the real purpose of its bid is to put pressure on the Agnellis to negotiate a solution, in which BSN would take over Volvic, one of Perrier's brands; Nestle would take the rest of Perrier; and in which the Agnellis would be offered a dignified and profitable exit.</p>

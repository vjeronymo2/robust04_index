			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: T Cowie launches Pounds 27.6m bid for Henlys A TAKEOVER battle broke out yesterday in the motor sector when T Cowie launched a Pounds 27.6m bid for rival Henlys Group. Henlys rapidly rejected the offer. The bid could presage other takeovers as motor dealers are expected to seek acquisition opportunities in the wake of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report in February which recommended that the UK's system of franchised dealers should be allowed to continue largely unchanged. On Wednesday Henlys saw its shares fall 22p to 55p after it warned that problems in its coach and bus building business would result in an interim loss. The shares rebounded yesterday, closing at 78p, up 21p. Cowie's bid of one new share for every two Henlys shares, is worth 73p per Henlys share with Cowie's shares closing at 146p, down 2p. Brokers said Henlys' share price suggested that Cowie would have to raise its offer or that another bidder would come in. They said Cowie might have to offer a cash alternative as well. Cowie also forecast a one-third increase in its interim dividend to 2p. Analysts are forecasting profits of Pounds 23m for the year, up from Pounds 18.2m in 1991. Henlys is expected to incur a loss in 1992 of about Pounds 2.5m compared with a Pounds 6.8m loss in 1991. Mr Gordon Hodgson, Cowie chief executive, said his company had been looking at Henlys for some time before the profit warning but the share price had been too high. He said there was a good fit between the groups in three areas - motor dealerships, bus and coach distribution and bus and coach leasing. Mr Robert Wood, Henlys chief executive, condemned the bid as derisory, unsolicited and unwelcome. He said Henlys, which recently changed its name from Plaxton, had only one problem area which the management was attacking in a resolute way. The bid was 'well off the mark' when net assets were 126p a share, he said. Cowie is being advised by Noble Grossart, Henlys by Charterhouse and Hill Samuel.</p>

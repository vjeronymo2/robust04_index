			<p>BFN     [Text] Botswana President Sir Ketumile Masire has appealed  to international donor agencies and financial institutions not  to abandon assistance to African countries in favor of Eastern  Europe. [Words indistinct] in Harare for the Frontline States'  meeting tomorrow, he said African countries which have now  endorsed democracy need the financial support of the  international community. He urged African leaders to acknowledge  their failures in the past which, he said, had led to the  current economic problems of African countries.</p>

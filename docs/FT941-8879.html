			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Auditors voice disquiet over HunterPrint debt Shares in HunterPrint, the specialist printing group, lost 20 per cent of their value yesterday after its auditors expressed 'fundamental uncertainty' over the going concern assumption used in the accounts. The shares closed down 4p at 16p after BDO Binder Hamlyn said: 'The group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its overdraft facility, which at the year end was substantially utilised. 'There is a material level of concern as to the appropriateness of the going concern basis.' In the 12 months to September 26 last year, the group incurred a deficit of Pounds 3.2m before tax, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 12.2m in 1992. Despite the apparent improvement, the auditors are understood to have expressed disquiet at the group's growing borrowing requirement. HunterPrint last year increased its bank overdraft to Pounds 8.9m from a restated Pounds 3.4m, while at the same maintaining a Pounds 6m loan secured against its Corby factory. Although Barclays, the group's banker, has extended financing facilities to September 30 this year, the loans are repayable on demand. Mr Geoff Eades, finance director, admitted net borrowings of Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 9.6m) were higher than expected, but said institutional shareholders remained fully behind the group. He said gearing had exceeded forecast levels because the group spent Pounds 6.2m on plant and facilities, including three second-hand presses. The presses were purchased to ensure capacity for new printing contracts with Associated Newspapers, Mirror Group Newspapers and the Guardian Media Group, worth a combined total of Pounds 10m a year. HunterPrint was also pursuing a cost-cutting programme expected to save Pounds 3m, Mr Eades added. 'Wages and salaries have been cut by 10 per cent, and we will be looking for further savings,' he said. Large institutional shareholders, including M&amp;G, Fidelity and Standard Life, said yesterday they were aware of the situation and welcomed moves by the group to cut spending.</p>

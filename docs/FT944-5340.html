			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 Mark Morris, by Joan Acocella (Farrar Strauss Giroux, Dollars 27.50), is not merely a lively and highly intelligent account of this acclaimed choreographer, and not merely the best book-length critical study yet written of any dance artist. It achieves the rare feat of reading the artist's mind while locating his work within the modern cultural context: all achieved with absorbing vigour and fluency and without ever becoming difficult or arcane. I am impatient to re-read it. The Complete Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Pavilion, Pounds 25) is an intoxicating plunge into the wit of the Jazz Age. Some of the lesser-known lyrics are so funny that I, reading, had to rush straight to the phone to read them aloud to friends ('It's never too late to Mendelssohn . . . We hope they'll Lohengrin and bear it'). But the best delight is to pore at leisure over familiar lyrics: I'm bidin' my time, Cause that's the kind of guy I'm; Little wow, tell me now, How long has this been going on?. Women and head waiters fawned on me. Like Hamlet, Ira Gershwin's lyrics are made up of quotations; and the quotations are now part of this century's lifeblood. On a less exalted level, Les Gussow's Conversations with Pinter (Nick Hern Books, Pounds 12.99) simply gives us Pinter talking relaxedly about himself and his work. There are no astonishing illuminations here; but I have found the book a refreshing companion during a year in which Pinter's plays have become, for me, more than ever before an absorbing pleasure.</p>

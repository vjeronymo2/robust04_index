			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Dresdner moves into private banking DRESDNER Bank is following the lead of its larger rival Deutsche Bank and setting up a private banking house aimed at creating a more exclusive service for increasingly wealthy and sophisticated German private investors. Hardy &amp; Co Privatbankiers, opening at the beginning of July, will have the characteristics of a private bank, while tapping the resources and technology of the Dresdner Bank group. While no minimum wealth criteria have been revealed, Dresdner suggested it was targeting investors with a net worth of roughly DM5m (Dollars 2.9m) or more. Hardy &amp; Co, a private bank set up in Berlin in 1880, was merged into the Deutsche Landerbank, a subsidiary of Dresdner 10 years ago. The latter sold the Landerbank to Swiss Banking Corporation in 1985, but retained the name of Hardy &amp; Co, which it is now using to set up the new bank. Dresdner will own 100 per cent of the capital, but Hardy &amp; Co's private banking identity will be underlined by two personally liable partners running the business. Based in Frankfurt, it will start operations with a staff of around 40. Mr Utz Pfannschmidt, one of the two partners, stressed the bank would work within, not in competition with, the rest of the Dresdner group, catering for high net worth investors whose increasingly sophisticated requirements could not be met as effectively in the existing structure. The so-called inheritance generation in Germany is presenting the big banks with a considerable challenge as to how to retain such clients. Deutsche Bank has, for instance, bought a stake of more than 80 per cent in the old private bank Grunelius. Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, managing board member in charge of securities and investment, estimated the operation would break even over a period of between three and five years, in what he described as a 'growth market par excellence'.</p>

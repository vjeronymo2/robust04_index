			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Prisoners Honoured for Good Deeds"] </F>   [Text] Jinan -- East China's Shandong Province is to  honour its best-behaved prisoners later this month at its  second-ever provincial meeting on inmate conduct.    About 250 inmates chosen from Shandong's 57,000 convicts at  prisons and reform-through-labour camps will be honoured for the  occasion, said Liu Zhengxin, deputy director of the Justice  Bureau.    About a third of them will have their terms reduced or be  released on parole, Liu added.    Those who excel in their work, reeducation study and daily  life in prisons usually receive better treatment than other  prisoners.    The province hopes the meeting encourages more inmates to  behave better in prisons and reform-through-labour institutions,  Liu added.</p>

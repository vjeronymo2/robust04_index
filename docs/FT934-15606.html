			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Unbending steel THE FURTHER breakdown of talks on the multilateral steel agreement (MSA) in Geneva last Friday may not have been wholly surprising, but it is dispiriting all the same. The issue's importance goes far beyond the steel industry. Until the MSA is settled, there can be no agreement on steel tariffs under the GATT: and until steel tariffs are settled there can be no conclusion to the Uruguay Round, due by the end of this year. The sticking point last week seems to have been the same as before. Although 30 countries are involved, the nub of the argument concerns the US and the EC. The US negotiators condemn EC subsidies; the EC negotiators rail against US tariffs. It is inconceivable that either tariffs or subsidies could be abolished, by the end of the year at any rate. US companies are entitled to protection under US anti-dumping legislation. EC voters will not accept massive steel closures without subsidies to ease the pain. The EC steel crisis is at the root of the difficulty in more ways than one. Mr Karel van Miert, the EC's competition commissioner, has to perform the usual Brussels juggling act between the competing claims of member states while at the same time staying within the EC rules on subsidies and state aids. On top of all that, he has to ask himself whether the result will satisfy the negotiators around the MSA table. It seems a lot to expect by Christmas. Perhaps the situation looks unduly gloomy in a European perspective. There is a view in Washington which says that agreement was scarcely to be expected this far away from the deadline: wait till next month, and it will be another matter. In any case, runs this argument, the Clinton administration has in recent weeks spent as much time listening to US steel users, who are naturally opposed to tariffs, as it has to producers. If Mr Clinton is turning his back on big steel, this certainly represents a break with tradition. This is also an administration which believes in industrial policy, at least by comparison with its two predecessors. It is therefore more likely to see eye to eye with Brussels on matters of ideology. If this proves the case, well and good. It is worth considering what steps to take if it does not. Somehow or other, the GATT negotiators seem to have got themselves into a position in which momentous issues of world trade cannot be agreed in principle until the details of one particular commodity have been hammered out in practice. This seems a peculiarly perverse mismatch, given that the commodity in question is beset by difficulties caused not merely by the world recession but by the fall of the Berlin Wall. It would plainly be preferable for the MSA to be agreed by the year end. If it cannot, it would be sensible for the GATT negotiators to be pragmatic. Fix the outlines of a steel tariff agreement, settle the Uruguay Round, and tidy up the details later.</p>

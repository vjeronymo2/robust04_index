			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Labour scents blood of a wounded government It has been a lean 15 years. But last night Labour MPs smelt the blood of a damaged government. For some, it was almost too much to bear. In extraordinary scenes as the voting figures were announced, MPs of all parties crowded into the House from the lobbies at either end, many sitting on the floor or even on the laps of colleagues. Parliamentary tradition dictates that the voting figures are always handed to a teller on the winning side. Thanks to that longstanding custom, Labour MPs knew they had won even before the result was announced. Tories looked on glumly as the cheering swelled from more than 300 opposition throats. Mr Dennis Canavan, an exuberant Scottish leftwinger, was so excited he had to be physically restrained by Labour whips as he embraced one of the tellers. As the noise grew, Mr Major sat gloomily on the government front bench, occasionally sharing a joke with Mr Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, sitting alongside him. The prime minister left the Commons shortly after the result was announced, saying nothing. Later, he emerged looking grim from a midnight meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary. Asked how he felt, the prime minister snapped: 'Don't waste my time.' Mr Clarke, as combative as ever, returned to the despatch box immediately after voting on a series of technical resolutions had finished, in order to spell out his determination to protect the integrity of the Budget arithmetic. He told MPs: 'Nothing said in the course of the debate tonight has changed our commitment to take all necessary measures to put the public finances on a sound footing, nor indeed has the outcome of the vote. 'It is only right that we listen to the views expressed here tonight and I have therefore decided not to proceed with the second stage of VAT on fuel.' Clearly determined to brazen out the government's defeat, Mr Clarke claimed that the principal beneficiaries would be people living in large houses with extensive central heating systems. Dismissively lambasting the opposition's failure to provide a costed alternative to the VAT increase, he sneered: 'I see nothing resembling an alternative government on the benches opposite.' His rumbustious performance prompted a dramatic intervention from Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who will take much of the credit for the parliamentary manoeuvring that defeated the government. The cheering broke out again, at twice the volume, as Mr Brown told the packed House that the humiliating defeat suffered by the chancellor and the prime minister would force them to listen to the British people. Shouting to make himself heard above the clamour, Mr Brown told the government: 'This is not just a defeat for the Budget. This signals a turning point in the politics of this country. 'The Conservative party may remain in office, but they are tired, they are discredited, and they are out of touch.'</p>

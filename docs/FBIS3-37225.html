			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Kalintsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Feb--The first working contact has been  established between the State Duma and the German Bundestag.  This was the main result of a visit to Moscow by Karsten Voigt,  chairman of the German-Russian group in the FRG parliament,  which ended today.    The aim of the visit was to "establish links, immediately  after the elections, with the political parties and groups in  the State Duma that might become partners for FRG  parliamentarians", Voigt noted in a conversation with an  ITAR-TASS correspondent. Virtually the entire political  spectrum in the Russian parliament, including the communists,  was involved in his meetings. "As for Zhirinovskiy's party, it  doesn't have any partners in the Bundestag. We hope that it  will have none in the future either, although the elections to  the FRG parliament in October this year might bring some  surprises," the German parliamentarian stated.    We, he continued, requested that a group be formed as soon  as  possible from among those deputies who are dealing with the FRG  on links with the Bundestag. "As vice president of the North  Atlantic Assembly--the NATO parliament," Voigt stressed, "I also  requested that a delegation be formed to take part in its work  with the rights of an associated member". This request also met  with agreement.    Representatives of the Russian parliament's committees for  international issues and defense matters, he said, would take  part in a seminar on security issues that the Assembly will hold  in February this year.    Voigt expressed the conviction that the cooperation that was  developing between the State Duma and the Bundestag would "make  a contribution toward the strengthening of good-neighborly  relations between Germany and Russia, which are not subject to  opportunism and are not directed against the interests of third  countries." He thinks it would be possible to discuss both  issues of bilateral political and economic cooperation and  pan-European security problems during regular meetings.</p>

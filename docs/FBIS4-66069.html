			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Agriculture Minister Adriana Poli </F> Bortone by Carlo Cambi on 24 May; place not given: "Hands Off  Our Wine" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- She is flying to Brussels to avert the  threat of quotas looming over Italian wine. Today she meets  with Rene Steichen, Europe's agriculture commissioner, the  author of the plan that would eliminate almost one-fourth of our  output. It will be a private meeting with a view to the next  European Union Council of Ministers session on 30 May, at which  the proposal will be officially submitted. It will be the  European debut for Adriana Poli Bortone -- one of the National  Alliance ministers -- in the same forum where our Community  partners have raised several questions about the entry of  "neo-Fascists" into the Italian Government. The new agriculture  minister had to tackle the wine problem immediately.  Immediately she sent Steichen a letter which described his  proposals as "unacceptable." On the eve of her visit she  revealed in this interview what she will say in Brussels and the  outlines of her program.    [Cambi] Minister, will you repeat again today that  Steichen's  proposal is unacceptable? Do you not think that your political  allegiance could hinder you, and therefore Italy, in the  negotiations?    [Poli Bortone] I will tell Mr. Steichen what I have already  written and what I repeated to him at our meeting in Greece.  The proposal is unacceptable, period. We say "no" to the  addition of sugar, we say "no" to quotas that would penalize  Italy's output, and to the way in which they have been set,  which in the case of wine is different from what has happened in  every other sector. For Italy, the quota was set on the basis  of the two least productive years out of seven, while in  Germany's case it was set using the average of three harvests  out of the six largest. This method must be rejected. In order  to do so we have drawn up a detailed document that aims to rule  out the addition of sugar and that intends to restore the  balance to the mechanism for calculating surpluses. With regard  to wine it is necessary to take the following fact into account:  Alcoholic strength must be created in the fields, not in the  cellars. If this principle is kept in mind, then it is possible  to engage in discussions. As for my political allegiance, it  must be understood that I represent the Italian Government, the  entire country.    [Cambi] But the Belgian minister has said that he will  refuse  to shake hands with you...    [Poli Bortone] Everyone shook hands with me in Greece. They  were very friendly and said that they wanted to cooperate with  the Italian Government. Especially over wine, we have already  reached understandings with Spain and France, which have more or  less the same position as do we. Of course, if there are any  obstacles, we will try to surmount them. This morning there  were a thousand fishermen protesting outside the ministry. I  went down to talk to them. I listened to what they had to say,  and I will try to represent their interests within the  Community. This, because the interests of agriculture are the  interests of the country.    [Cambi] Minister, you know that your appointment has been  regarded with skepticism. Why did you choose Agriculture? Are  you by any chance taking evening classes to catch up?    [Poli Bortone] I know, but I am not as uninformed as people  think; I have been in politics for 30 years, and moreover I have  found an extremely professional staff here. Evening classes? I  would like that, but I am learning fast partly thanks to the  ministry experts. I chose Agriculture because it enables me to  remain close to the problems of my land and my people, Puglia  and the South.    [Cambi] Pardon me, but there is a contradiction there. You  are a member of a pro-northern government; how can you protect  the South?    [Poli Bortone] The contradictions are more imagined than  real, and in any case by the protection of the South I do not  mean the abuse of welfarism, which has caused much harm and has  brought no benefit. What I intend to do is to promote  agriculture, ensuring that the southern regions match the pace  of the northern regions. I am convinced that the revitalization  of agriculture and tourism can be a new key to the development  of the South.    [Cambi] The National Alliance is a "nationalist" party,  whereas agriculture is the most European of sectors. How can  you keep these two things together?    [Poli Bortone] By trying to represent Italy's interests as  best as I can within the Community, in the knowledge that a  large part of agricultural policy is determined in Europe. I  also have the regional authorities beside me. I have met with  them and we have set a timetable for periodic meetings. I will  be the representative of the country's interests in Brussels.  And they must heed us.    [Cambi] You will face another thorny problem: milk quotas.  What will you do about that?    [Poli Bortone] I will tell our partners -- as I have already  told my Netherlands counterpart, and he seemed convinced to me  -- that we are in compliance with regard to milk quotas. We  have paid the fines and have come into line. They cannot  continue accusing us. In any case, this issue is by no means  closed. Furthermore, through administration by a commissioner  and the transformation of AIMA [State Agency for Intervention in  the Agricultural Market], we have proved our credibility. Let  me return to the South for a moment. We have been accused of  many kinds of fraud, but perhaps others commit more and worse  frauds, many of them stemming from a welfarist vision. Well, I  want to change this image.    [Cambi] But was the AIMA decree not drawn up by your  predecessor, Alfredo Diana?    [Poli Bortone] I found a great deal of work begun by Diana,  who is very competent, and I have no intention of wasting it;  nor do I have any difficulty in admitting that I will take the  best of it.    [Cambi] What does it feel like to be called a Fascist? Does  it irritate you?    [Poli Bortone] I am a right-winger. I am in favor of a  modern Right, and the National Alliance blueprint moves in the  direction of transcending what is now a distant past. [National  Alliance leader] Fini's speech to the lower house was very clear  in this regard. As for my allegiance, I have never had any  problems with anyone else, because what interests me is what  needs to be done. I will be meeting with women of the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left], because one of my main efforts  has been in the struggle against petty bureaucracy, and I know  that they have worked hard on that. I will ask them to help.    [Cambi] What will you do in your first 100 days?    [Poli Bortone] I do not like first 100 days. I think that  with the AIMA decree I have already achieved a pass mark in my  first 100 days. To do things properly you need time and  determination. I want first and foremost to raise the profile  of agriculture, to bring young people closer to the land. To  this end I am drawing up a plan involving education. I am sure  that 100,000 jobs can be created. Another crucial decision is  to make the best possible use of research institutions and to  provide incentives to encourage the cultivation of crops  specific to our lands.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KAL DANIELS TO HAVE SURGERY ON RIGHT KNEE  </P> <P> Two days after learning that Kirk Gibson has been sidelined for the season  because of a leg injury, the Dodgers announced Wednesday that his replacement,  Kal Daniels, will undergo diagnostic arthroscopic surgery on his right knee  Friday.  </P> <P> Daniels and infielder Lenny Harris came to the Dodgers in a July 17 trade with  the Cincinnati Reds for Tim Leary and Mariano Duncan.  </P> <P> Daniels had undergone two operations on each knee. The latest was arthroscopic  surgery on the right knee May 16 to smooth bone spurs and remove cartilage.  </P> <P> Daniels reinjured the knee after joining the Dodgers and was placed on the  disabled list Aug. 7.  </P> <P> "He felt a catch in his knee while running," said Dr. Ralph Gambardella of  Daniels' latest injury.  </P> <P> "It was in a different area of the knee, and he has continued to have symptoms.  The knee has not responded, so we thought it was best to have a look."  </P> <P> The normal recuperation from such surgery, without complications, is four to  six weeks.  </P> <P> In 11 games with the Dodgers, Daniels hit .342 with two home runs and eight  RBIs.

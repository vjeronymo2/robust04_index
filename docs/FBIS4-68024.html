			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- A large explosion  believed to be a car bomb shook the international arrivals hall  at Jan Smuts Airport on Wednesday morning. The blast was  confirmed by Witwatersrand Liaison Officer Col Dave Bruce. He  could not confirm it was a car bomb.    A spokesman for the Joint Operational Centre in Pretoria  said  although details of the airport blast were still scanty, reports  had been received that three people had been injured -- one  seriously. "There was a car bomb," said a spokeswoman at the  Operational Centre.    But police in a later official statement said "an explosive  device...as yet unknown type" exploded at the airport. Police  could not immediately confirm any deaths.    SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news  reported a "car bomb" exploded at the parking area adjoining the  arrivals facility. Kempton Park fire brigade officers were  treating several injured people who sustained injuries.</p>

We have strong desire for realization of the noble and  genuine objectives of the recently-founded USDA. Active  participation of the entire mass of people is now essential for  realization of the following five objectives of the USDA;    1. Non-disintegration of the Union,    2. Non-disintegration of national unity,    3. Perpetuation of sovereignty,    4. Promotion and vitalization of national pride, and    5. Emergence of a prosperous, peaceful, and modern Union.    These five objectives, in fact, reflect the basic welfare  for  the union nationals. It is therefore essential for the entire  mass of people to wholeheartedly support the USDA and to  earnestly take part for realization of the five objectives.    All patriotic Myanmar [Burmese] people desire perpetuity of  the union, consolidation of unity among union nationals, and  perpetuation of sovereignty. As we all encountered and overcame  suffering and misery owing to the loss of sovereignty, we all  must safeguard our sovereignty sacrificing our lives not to fall  into servitude again. The fourth objective of the USDA --  promotion and vitalization of national pride -- is specially  essential for gradual fading away of the spirit of patriotism is  inclined to incapacitate safeguarding of sovereignty. The  entire mass of people must therefore cultivate the spirit of  patriotism to a new height.    Myanmar nationals cannot help speaking in praise of the USDA  which is endowed with the objectives for emergence of an  affluent modern nation. As all know, today, the State Law and  Order Restoration Council [SLORC] is laying down foundations for  emergence of an affluent modern nation. We all are to  congratulate the SLORC for its farsighted efforts for all-round  national development spending tens of millions of money in the  education and health sectors, construction of roads, bridges,  railroads, airports, parks, gardens, and various buildings.  That is why, I would like to urge you to decide to  wholeheartedly uphold the five objectives of the USDA.    I would like to emphatically urge the entire mass of people  to cooperate and provide support for consolidation and extensive  formation of the USDA to be able to stand tall and firm as  national front that will organize national movement with noble  and genuine objectives.    Esteemed people: The National Convention, which is  comparable to the architect for emergence of a new democratic  state in Myanmar history, has been held since 9 January 1993.  On 16 September 1993, the national convention plenary session  laid down 104 basic principles for formulating state fundamental  principles to be incorporated into the state constitution.    Every observer will find vividly that all these 104 basic  principles are mirror of the welfare of the Union of Myanmar  [Burma] and union nationals in all angles at present and in  future. Evidently, 39 of the 104 basic principles are found to  be laid down as fundamental principles. They are:    1. Non-disintegration of the union,    2. Non-disintegration of national solidarity,    3. Perpetuation of sovereignty,    4. Flourishing of a genuine multiparty democracy system,    5. Further burgeoning of the noblest and worthiest of  worldly values namely justice, liberty, and equality in the  state,    6. For the tatmadaw [defense services] to be able to  participate in the national political leadership role of the  state,    7. The state is constituted by Pyidaungsu [Union] system,    8.

The three branches of state power, namely --  legislative, executive, and judicial, are separated as much as  possible and exert reciprocal control, check, and balance among  themselves,    13. The three branches of state power so separated are  distributed among Pyidaungsu, regions, states, and  self-administered areas,    14. The legislative power of the state is distributed  among the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw [parliament], Region Hluttaws, and  State Hluttaws; legislative power stipulated by the constitution  shall be distributed to self-administered areas,    15. The chief executive of the state is the president of  the state,    16. The executive power of the state is distributed among  the administrative organs of Pyidaungsu, regions and states;  self-administrative power shall be distributed to  self-administered areas as stipulated by the state constitution,    17. The judicial power of the state is distributed among  Pyidaungsu Taya Hluttaw [Supreme Court], Region Taya Hluttaw  [Region High Court], State Taya Hluttaw [State High Court] and  law courts at different levels including law courts of self-  administered areas,    18. The tatmadaw is strong, modern, and must be the sole  existing tatmadaw,    19. The defence services commander-in-chief is the supreme  commander of all armed forces,    20. All persons born of parents both of whom are nationals  are citizens; all persons who have become citizens in accord  with law on the date the state constitution comes into force are  citizens; and citizenship, naturalization, and revocation of  citizenship shall be prescribed by law,    21. Every citizen shall enjoy rights of equality, rights  of liberty and rights of justice etc. as prescribed in the state  constitution,    22. The state shall help for development, consolidation,  and preservation of national culture,    23.

The state shall enact necessary laws to supervise  economic forces' extraction and utilization of state-owned  natural resources,    25. The state practices independent, active, and  nonaligned foreign policy, aims at world peace and friendly  relations with nations, and upholds the principles of peaceful  coexistence among nations,    26. The state never initiates any act of belligerence  against another nation,    27. No foreign troops are permitted to be deployed within  the borders of the union,    28. The state shall help promote solidarity, mutual amity,  and respect and mutual help among the national races,    29.

The state shall earnestly strive to improve education  and health of the people,    36.

Every citizen shall have the right to vote and to  stand for election according to law,    38. Voters concerned shall have the right, in accord with  provisions of the state constitution, to recall elected people's  representatives, and,    39. The state shall enact necessary law for systematic  formation of political parties for flourishing of genuine  multiparty democracy system.    In addition to these 39 basic principles, the remaining 65  are also of importance in respective chapters. We must,  therefore, treasure the 104 basic principles for formulating  principles as firm foundation for our much desired new  democratic state.    All of us are responsible for protecting these 104 basic  principles against any obstruction and deviation.    It is encouraging that these 104 basic principles were laid  down as much as possible to reflect the six objectives of the  National Convention:    1. Non-disintegration of the union,    2. Non-disintegration of national solidarity,    3. Perpetuation of sovereignty,    4. For a genuine multiparty democracy system to flourish,    5. For further burgeoning of the noblest and worthiest of  worldly values namely justice, liberty, and equality, and,    6. For the tatmadaw to be able to participate in the  national political leadership role of the future state.    All desire to safeguard the basic principles for formulating  principles without losing sight of them and wish the national  convention success after procuring detailed suggestions when it  resumes.    Esteemed people: Now is the time for all nationals to make  utmost efforts for national development and emergence of an  affluent modern nation accepting it as a national task.    As the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] is  based on consolidated, united tatmadaw, it is practically and  effectively striving for the welfare of the state and the people  in conformity with its fine traditions. In the present era of  changing the economic, social, and political spheres, it is  essential for the entire mass of people to actively take part in  their respective roles zealously and intensively. Peasants have  to strive for boosting production of quality crops and workers  on their part have to prevent loss and wastage and be free from  graft while making concerted efforts for boosting production of  their factories and mills. All are urged to maintain roads and  bridges, dams and reservoirs, schools, hospitals, parks and  gardens, and buildings built by the state in various parts of  the country.    So also, I would like to urge the entire mass of people to  participate actively in the state's short-term and long-term  projects for building a modern, developed country.    As the saying "Make hay while the sun shines" goes, it is  opportune for armed groups to abandon their incurred stand and  return to the legal fold, and to join hands with the state in  all round development tasks.    The top national objective of the SLORC is "Our three main  national causes". It is essential for non-disintegration of the  union, non-disintegration of national solidarity, and  perpetuation of sovereignty. Like the Myanmar [Burmese] saying  "If the cattle are scattered the tiger seizes them", disunity  among union nationals is the opportune state for neocolonialists  and the state and the people may suffer low.    All nationals have to uphold and cherish the fine traditions  of the forefathers who defended the state against the dangers  through unity among national races and lived through weal or  woe. Now it is time to promote and vitalize these fine  traditions of our forefathers.    From this mass meeting, all armed groups are urged to accept  the invitation of the SLORC and return to the legal fold.    Esteemed people: The Union of Myanmar [Burma] is an  independent and sovereign state. As all know, Myanmar had to  strive hard in national freedom battles for over a hundred years  to become an independent state. In conformity with an  independent, sovereign state, Myanmar always upholds the  principles of peaceful coexistence among nations.    Governments of the Union of Myanmar have always taken a  constructive stand in international affairs and supported  efforts for world peace, prevention of outbreak of wars, and  general and total disarmament. It is undeniable that Myanmar  has never intended and attempted to work against the interests  of any other country. Myanmar expects reciprocal, sincere  relations from every nation.    Under prevailing political condition, the neocolonialists  have been making false allegations against Myanmar with the aim  of enabling their axe handles [henchmen] to gain power. The  traitor axe handles, who have dealings with neocolonialist  groups on economic grounds, have cooked up stories to tarnish  the dignity of Myanmar. These are the acts to ignore and insult  the sovereignty of our state.    It is human nature that a person or an organization or a  nation is liable to do good or bad. Under unavoidable  circumstances, strength is applied in some matters. Bitter  quinine has to be used to banish malaria though one knows it is  too bitter. Similarly, there are restrictions on the rights of  freedom to ensure prevalence of peace and tranquillity and for  non-disintegration of national unity. As the SLORC strives for  prevalence of peace and tranquillity and law and order, crime  has diminished considerably.    Every educated person understands that for flourishing of  genuine democracy, the state is laying down firm foundation for  the community.    Esteemed people: In conclusion, I would like to emphatically  urge all patriotic nationals at this mass rally sponsored by the  Yangon [Rangoon] Division Union Solidarity and Development  Association [USDA];    -- to support the 104 basic principles laid down by the  National Convention,    -- to uphold the five objectives of the USDA,    -- for the armed groups to return to the legal fold and  actively take part in all round national development tasks,    -- to prevent subversions at home and abroad that would  disrupt perpetuation of sovereignty,    -- to strive hard for emergence of affluent nation as a  national task, and,    -- to make concerted efforts for consolidation of Union  Solidarity and Development Associations.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Beware of an absence of hindsight The silliest and one of the most durable of all investment slogans is: 'The market is always right'. If markets had perfect knowledge and rational foresight, they would never move except in reaction to genuine and significant surprises, and there aren't very many of those. In the real world markets are far more volatile than the economy. But for that very reason, the second silliest slogan - which is in any case remembered only during ugly awakenings - is: 'You can't fight the fundamentals'. For much of the time you can and do. That is why 'active' - which means short-term - investors do much better following the charts than studying the fundamentals. Fundamentals are for the lazy, who like to review their portfolios only at long intervals or at moments of stress. Oddly enough, they often come out ahead in the long run. For the ordinary mortal, though, knowing when to follow the fundamentals, and how long you dare ignore them, is the whole art and fun of the thing. A time like now, when equities keep rising as the current situation gets worse, is the time when such a decision has to be faced. Do the markets know something ministers and economists don't know? Or is this just another of those speculative climaxes which are so easy to recognise with hindsight? If you can keep your head when all about you are indulging in wishful thinking . . . The strongest argument in favour of current values is in fact the vaguest: recessions are usually relatively short, and this one is already getting on in months. Since recoveries are normally invisible until they have been running for quite a time, the market's timing looks quite plausible. That is what you might call normalised hindsight, and it is a powerful argument; indeed, you can reject it only if you believe this is not a normal recession, or if you are seriously worried by the fact this is not the justification being offered by brokers at the moment. There is no need to spend too much space on the thesis (advanced by Lord Rees-Mogg) that we are suffering not a recession, but a debt deflation, because any regular reader of this column already knows it by heart. The two strongest arguments in favour of this idea are, first, as Mr Nigel Lawson reminded us last Monday, the recession started and persists in precisely those countries which previously enjoyed a runaway credit boom; and, second, that it was forecast only by those economists who were expecting a debt deflation, and not by those expecting a normal cycle. I find this persuasive; you may not. The more widely supported bearish thesis is based on our membership of the European Monetary System. You may believe the historical version - that we went in at too high an exchange rate, and are repeating the history of the 1920s. Or you may simply observe that every inflation-prone country that has joined the ERM has had a hard time for some years. Either way, a sense of history - the respectable name for hindsight - should make you at least question the comfortable belief in a normal, though so far invisible, recovery. But perhaps the easiest way to get alarmed is to listen to a broker explaining the market's strength. Brokers have given up talking recovery, since the government gave economic optimism a bad name, and now base their case simply on falling inflation. When inflation fell in the early 1980s, they explain, London market yields fell well below recent levels; so now a fall in yields can be expected again. Buy now while stocks last. This is the worst kind of selective appeal to history: cite the facts that support your case, and ignore the rest. It ignores most of the background to the 1980s bull market - a strong recovery in the profit share of national income, a falling pound which further boosted profits, strong economic growth (which not even the optimists now expect), and a level of profit distribution which left plenty of room for hope. We now have a weak dollar, a reasonable profits share, and dangerously high distribution levels. The falling-inflation case is not in fact a serious argument at all. It is simply a broker talking his book. (Remember Harris's Law: dealers never know why prices are moving, because they are too busy moving prices.) And it is not only sloppy as recent history; it completely ignores the more distant past. Inflation is the debtor's friend; so in a debt deflation, a sagging price trend means that things are getting worse, not better. President Roosevelt understood this well in the 1930s, and opened the champagne at the first news of rising prices. If this kind of thinking was restricted to brokers fumbling for something plausible to tell their clients, it would only be a subject for a little gentle ribbing. What is serious is that the same kind of sloppy thinking seems endemic among those we pay to think seriously - economists, banks, directors and political leaders. The whole rightwing counter-revolution in the English-speaking world has been led by conservatives (some nominally socialist) who seem to have no sense of the past. For instance, consider again Mr Nigel Lawson: 'A financially deregulated economy, while more efficient and more dynamic, is less stable . . .' This is not argument, but assertion, and arrogant at that; for it brushes aside as fools all the governments down the centuries that thought it necessary to regulate markets. We would be safer in the hands of the Prince of Wales, who has a vivid sense of the past, even if it does make him a bit timid. The claimed advantage is suspect, too. More efficient and dynamic than what? Than the highly regulated Japanese economy, or the subsidy-ridden German one? And can an economy which is less stable really be more efficient? The whole argument suggests that those who brush aside the past are also blind to the present. Mr Lawson handsomely admits that he 'greatly underestimated the demand effects' of deregulation; but that is because he wouldn't listen to the fuddy-duddies who could remember even the recent past. More hindsight, please.</p>

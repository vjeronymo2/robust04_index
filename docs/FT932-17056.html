			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Observer: Chief of speakers No one could accuse Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the redoubtable Zulu leader in South Africa, of dereliction of duty. He has just finished delivering his longest ever policy speech - so long it deserves a mention in the Guinness Book of Records. The South African chieftain started speaking to his Kwazulu legislature on March 12 and finally finished earlier this week. He spoke on every weekday and notched up a total of 90 hours without repeating himself. Members of the Kwazulu legislative assembly gave him a standing ovation when he concluded his address which included a 60-page discussion on Inkatha's constitutional proposals for Kwazulu/Natal. Members of the legislative assembly were allowed to absent themselves from proceedings if they had very urgent business, so long as a replacement was present to take notes. So you thought the Maastricht debate was boring?</p>

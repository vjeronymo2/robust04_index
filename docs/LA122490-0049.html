			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS' TAYLOR MAKES RETURN TO NFL IN STYLE  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, he was filling up his days helping out with a high school  track program and exercising at the health spa.  </P> <P> Kitrick Taylor, released by the Patriots in the exhibition season, didn't  figure he'd be playing football again this season.  </P> <P> "I'd say about the ninth or 10th game I was really counting it out, basically  looking forward to next year," he said. "Then the Chargers called and worked me  out and they like what they see."  </P> <P> Sunday, 11 days after Taylor signed with the Chargers, he took a Kansas City  punt 55 yards for a touchdown and gave his teammates cause to cheer. On the  play, he darted through two tacklers coming at him straight on, cut left and  raced to the end zone untouched.  </P> <P> That tied the game at 21.  </P> <P> "It was pretty much a turnaround because we were down," Taylor said. "You work  hard at special teams and you always believe that special teams is what can  make a difference in the game." DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

Protection Force [UNPROFOR] for transit  through Yugoslav territory for the Ukrainian and Russian  batallions which are to join UNPROFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  Federal Information Ministry said today in Belgrade. There are  already 550 Ukrainian troops on the UNPROFOR in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 160 more left Ukraine for that former  Yugoslav Republic on Monday.

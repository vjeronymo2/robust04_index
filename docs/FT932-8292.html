			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (8): Into the big time - Logistical services EMERY WORLDWIDE, one of the pioneers of international air express operations, recently announced the formation of a new subsidiary to spearhead its development of worldwide logistics services, writes PHILLIP HASTINGS. That business could eventually become its biggest revenue earner, says the US-based company. Together, those two points highlight both the most pronounced current trend in the international express service industry and the reasons for it. Basically, express companies which initially made their mark by offering a set menu of fast, door-to-door delivery services, are now increasingly focusing on the provision of custom-designed systems geared to meet the often very specific requirements of modern logistics operations. Manufacturers are developing JIT (Just In Time) logistics systems, for example, like the ability of express companies to control the total door-to-door movement of their goods but want services which precisely meet their requirements. Reflecting those trends, the world's 'big four' express companies - DHL, TNT, Federal Express and United Parcel Service (UPS) - and leading competitors such as Emery and Air Express International (AEI) are all now stepping up their involvement in the broader international logistics sphere. DHL, for example, is developing so-called Express Logistics Centres (ELCs) in various key markets. TNT and Federal Express already have well-established international logistics divisions, while UPS has set up special logistics management teams all over the world and begun establishing new bonded distribution centres. Emery's new operation is called simply Global Logistics. Mr Roger Curry, the company's president and chief executive officer, says the Emery name has deliberately been left out of the organisation's identity to reflect the intended broad scope of its activities, some of which will be outside the company's traditional mainstream operations. Global Logistics' services, he continues, will include warehousing both raw materials and finished goods on behalf of customers, taking material into inventory, maintaining computerised inventory records, updating the customers' computer files, picking from inventory, packing and shipping, and re-ordering when inventory gets too low. Over the next two years, Mr Curry says value-added logistics services could develop to contribute around 10 per cent of Emery's overall revenues. Longer term, he expects that percentage to expand substantially. 'I think we will in future see Emery earning more from that logistics-type activity than from traditional freight services. That is definitely where the future is,' he adds. DHL appears to be thinking along similar lines. Having already broadened its traditional courier image and activities to embrace packages and larger consignments, the company is increasingly promoting its capabilities as a general logistics service provider. In that context, the company has now established ELCs in Brussels, Bahrain and Singapore, plus a joint venture programme in Amsterdam. Other sites are currently being evaluated. Mr Patrick Lupo, Brussels-based chairman and chief executive officer for DHL International, says it can take some time for companies to complete the changeover to outsourcing their warehousing from suppliers like DHL. But, he claims, companies which have gone that way, have been pleased with the results. 'Our ELC here in Brussels, for instance, is proving particularly interesting to non-EC entities which have a need to distribute products like high-tech goods, medical instruments and oil industry analysis kits,' he adds. Last year also saw the launch in the UK of a DHL business unit called Interface. Basically, the idea is that Interface team members work closely with specific customers on the development of their logistics operations. UPS last year established its first bonded European distribution centre  - a 6,000 sq metre facility at Best near Eindhoven, the Netherlands - as the forerunner in a series of such developments being planned by that company throughout Europe over the next five years. The idea is that overseas goods will be brought to Europe by ship or air and held at the distribution centre in bond, under a Customs-approved licence. There, UPS will provide a range of services including warehousing, inventory management and order fulfilment, pick and pack, specialised labelling, assembly and configuration, repair and return systems, and customisation of products for individual markets. Once required in the end markets, goods will be distributed throughout Europe using the UPS air and road network. One of the main reasons for that sort of service development is explained by Mr Tony Keating, the head of European logistics for UPS. 'More than 35 per cent of the total potential package market UPS is interested in is in the hands of the multinationals. Having established that, we decided we had to do more about meeting the requirements of those customers,' he says. Responding to similar demands, Federal Express Business Logistics Europe has expanded its operations with the opening of a new logistics centre near Eindhoven airport. The 5,200 sq metre complex, which is fully bonded, will be developed as 'a strategic base for managing and running logistics operations serving global markets as well as supporting other operations in mainland Europe'. One of the most significant recent worldwide logistics sector developments by Federal Express involved a 'radical redesign' of the global logistics process for US semiconductor manufacturer National Semiconductor Corporation. According to Federal Express, the new set-up will give National Semiconductor a two business-day delivery to all its customers worldwide. Previously, its delivery cycles for international customers had ranged from five to 18 days. While the trend for express companies to develop wider-ranging logistics services is most pronounced in the international sphere, similar developments are taking place in domestic markets. TNT, for example, has a special contract logistics division in the UK working for a range of clients in industries such as the automotive, electronics and office equipment sectors. Federal Express BLS has a specialised UK division called Systemcare to handle the home delivery of furniture and electrical goods for companies such as Littlewoods and IKEA. Other domestic express carriers are still concentrating primarily on their established door-to-door delivery operations but are increasingly introducing added-value services where they can or where customers demand them.</p>

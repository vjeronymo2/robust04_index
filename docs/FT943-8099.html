			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Obdurate rulers at point of no return: Missed chances in Nigeria On Wednesday General Sani Abacha's regime passed the point of no return. The presumed winner of last year's presidential election, Mr Moshood Abiola, is in jail for claiming the presidency and a strike by oil workers is crippling the economy. And all the time the political split widens between Mr Abiola's Yoruba tribe in the south-west, who run the economy, and the Hausas and Fulanis in the north, who control the government. A nation worn down by political instability was looking for a way out of the deadlock this week and Gen Abacha's televised speech was seen as a chance to compromise. Instead the government closed the door on dialogue, hardened its stance against opponents and imposed strict controls on the striking trade unions. 'The speech reminded me of that joke: 'Let's have peace. You give in to me',' said a newspaper publisher. The two key points of the address were the government's decision to run the unions directly and the claim that it would not interfere with Mr Abiola's court case. The judiciary has been discredited by the trial and Mr Abiola's detention looks likely to be long. The government has not banned the oil unions or the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) but their leadership structure, which will be replaced by administrators reporting to the labour minister, Mr Samuel Ogbemudia. The NLC is a state-sponsored umbrella group for more than 40 trade unions, and is seen as a willing tool of military government. Three times in the past month it has delayed or postponed a general strike in protest at Mr Abiola's arrest, on the assurance of its leader that the government would compromise. Three times it has been proved wrong. The two oil unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, will be tougher nuts to crack. Mr Frank Kokori, head of Nupeng, has warned that, if proscribed, the union would go underground and that there would be violent reactions. The risk to the oil companies which operate the 2m b/d capacity oil fields in the Niger delta is increased by the hardening of positions. Industry officials say that production is already down by a third with most of the loss coming from the main producer, Anglo-Dutch Shell. The operators are minority partners with the government and are not officially revealing production figures, but they have shut down wells which are exposed to attacks on staff or equipment. Shell has refused the government's offer of army protection to keep pumping, and it is unlikely that union members will accept the offer made on Wednesday of government protection if they return at once to work. Nigeria is already acutely indebted and cannot afford to lose nearly a third of its total export earnings. The ban on the union leaders is an attempt by the government to break what it sees as the south-west's stranglehold on the economy. The crisis has hardened the view in the south that the government is run by a narrow clique of conservatives in the north, principally the traditional rulers. The Yorubas believe that the most powerful of these, including the Sultan of Sokoto who is the head of Islam in Nigeria, are manipulating Gen Abacha. However, some influential northerners are also speaking out against the government. Other more discreet moderates in the north do not want to see the nation split but fear that Gen Abacha's intransigence may make it inevitable. In Lagos, industrialists who were previously non-political now talk openly about the south-west going its own way and say the present unitary state, disguised as a federal structure, is holding back the economic development of the south. They are forming a powerful alliance with the oil workers who are mainly from the minority tribes in the Niger delta. Northerners regard the third big Nigerian tribe, the Ibos in the east, as allies. 'To us it is not as simple as northern domination,' says a veteran of the Biafran war, in which the Ibos tried to secede from Nigeria but were defeated by the north with backing from the south-west. 'Time is running out and I think we are in for a lot more trouble. People in the east were looking for some concessions from Wednesday's speech but it gave nothing.' The order to unions to return to work may lead to harsher measures and test whether the army is a united force or divided on ethnic lines like other sections of society. Such a split is the most dangerous prospect.</p>

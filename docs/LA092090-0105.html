			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GALLEGLY OPPONENT SAYS DONATIONS FROM S&amp;LS SHOULD GO TO TREASURY  </P> <P> Democratic congressional candidate Richard Freiman, seeking an  attention-getting issue for his uphill campaign against Rep. Elton Gallegly,  Wednesday called on Gallegly to give $20,000 in contributions from savings and  loan institutions to the U.S. Treasury to help pay for a massive federal  bailout of the troubled industry.  </P> <P> Freiman, an Agoura attorney and television writer, said Gallegly (R-Simi  Valley) should give the government the money to make it clear to constituents  "that instead of being part of the problem, you are part of the solution" to  the S&amp;L crisis, which regulators say will cost U.S. taxpayers $500 billion  over the next 30 years.  </P> <P> Gallegly was traveling and unavailable for comment Wednesday, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> But in a prepared statement, the congressman said that less than 1.5% of his  overall contributions have come from the thrift industry and that he supported  several bills to aid prosecution of S&amp;L fraud.  </P> <P> Freiman's poorly financed campaign has attracted scant attention so far and  political observers give him little chance of upsetting Gallegly.  </P> <P> But like other Democratic congressional challengers around the country, he is  trying to use thrift contributions as a political weapon against a GOP  incumbent.  </P> <P> A recent poll by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found that by a margin of  39% to 17%, voters hold the GOP more responsible than Democrats for the crisis.  </P> <P> And they were evenly split over President Bush's handling of the scandal, with  38% approving and 37% disapproving.  </P> <P> However, the same survey found that voters blame the situation much more on  thrift executives than federal officials.  </P> <P> Moreover, the poll showed that voters split almost evenly over whether they  trust the GOP or Democrats more to fix the problem.  </P> <P> Freiman said a recent Common Cause study ranked Gallegly 49th out of 435 House  members in the amount of contributions accepted from thrifts, although he was  in Congress for only four of the nine years covered by the study.  </P> <P> Freiman charged that Gallegly "didn't take any action" to stave off the thrift  disaster, despite having been elected to Congress four years ago. "It was his  responsibility as a member of Congress to do something about this," Freiman  said.  </P> <P> Freiman said Gallegly voted in favor of legislation that allowed S&amp;Ls to  continue to invest in junk bonds.  </P> <P> In his statement, Gallegly said he voted in favor of seven bills designed to  assist in investigating and prosecuting S&amp;L executives suspected of fraud.  </P> <P> Freiman, who left his job to campaign full time for the Nov. 6 election, faces  long odds in his struggle against Gallegly in the 21st Congressional District.  </P> <P> Republicans outnumber Democrats 177,000 to 124,000 in the district, which  covers western and northern portions of Los Angeles County and southern and  central Ventura County.  </P> <P> In the 1988 general election, Gallegly trounced his Democratic opponent, Donald  E. Stevens, by a margin of 69% to 29%.  </P> <P> In campaign finance statements filed in June, Gallegly reported having more  than $100,000 in cash available for the fall campaign, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Freiman reported having $436 on hand.  </P></p>

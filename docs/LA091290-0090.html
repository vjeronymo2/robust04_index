			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: ENTERTAINER MUSIC AWARDS TO  BE PRESENTED IN ENCINITAS  </P> <P> The ninth annual Entertainer Music Awards ceremony will be held Monday night at  the La Paloma theater in Encinitas, honoring this year's winners of the contest  for San Diego County bands and nightclub performers.  </P> <P> Last month, a panel of local club owners, deejays and other industry people  selected five nominees in each of the 12 categories. Ballots were then printed  and distributed to various locations around the county, giving the public the  chance to vote for their favorites.  </P> <P> The 10-day balloting period ended last Sunday. At the awards ceremony, the top  vote-getter in each category will be announced and presented with a solid  bronze "Jolson" statuette, cast in the likeness of legendary pop singer Al  Jolson and designed by former Charger Ed White.  </P> <P> Trying to predict the people's choices is a risky proposition, but here goes:  </P> <P> * Best Contemporary Solo or Duo (nominees are Ray and Lainie Correa, Gary  Lehman, Bobby Arvon, Billy Fowler, and Fantasy, featuring Elizabeth Webb and  Don Tennison): Ray and Lainie Correa. They've got great voices, great harmonies  and a great repertoire of pop oldies and current hits.  </P> <P> * Best Contemporary (nominees are Hut-Sut Ralston, the Bob Long Band, Second to  None, the Cat-Illacs and B-Natural): The Bob Long Band. Excellent musicians and  lots of charisma.  </P> <P> * Best Rhythm and Blues (nominees are the Rhumboogies, the Forbidden Pigs, the  Blonde Bruce Band, the Rick Gazlay Group and the Nightcrawlers): The Blonde  Bruce Band. A bunch of white guys who play the electric blues with as much  intensity and as much passion as any black roadhouse band in the Deep South.  </P> <P> * Best Reggae (nominees are Dr. Chico's Island Sounds, the Cardiff Reefers,  Burning Bridges, Tribal Lunchbox and Limbo Slam): The Cardiff Reefers. Again, a  bunch of white guys -- surfer dudes, in this case -- who really put their  hearts and their souls into black music.  </P> <P> * Best Jazz (nominees are Peter Sprague, the Mark Lessman Band, the Easton-West  Band, Fattburger and Aubrey Faye): Peter Sprague. Years ago, Downbeat magazine  called him "an awful hot little comer." He's since grown up into one of the  hottest jazz guitarists around, not just in San Diego, but in the country.  </P> <P> * Best Vintage Jazz (nominees are Tobacco Road, the Dick Braun Orchestra, the  Chicago 6, the Chicago 15 and the Sue Palmer Trio): Tobacco Road. Their weekday  afternoon dance concerts at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach are always well  attended, and they're adept at handling a variety of vintage jazz styles, from  stride to swing.  </P> <P> * Best Country (nominees are the Savery Brothers, Dakota, Char Carroll and  Crossover, North 40 and Scary Mary): the Savery Brothers. The longtime house  band at the Pomerado Club in Poway plays traditional country twang laced with  elements of Cajun and rhythm and blues.  </P> <P> * Best Vintage Rock (nominees are Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love,  Rockola, the Big Fins, the Redcoats and the Nostalgics): Rockola. They play the  most faithful renditions of classic rock songs from the 1960s I've ever heard.  </P> <P> * Best Rock 'n' Roll, Top 40 (nominees are Notice to Appear, Big Bang, Flyweil,  the Siers Brothers and the Heroes): Flyweil. They've been plying the local  nightclub scene for nearly a decade, and they've amassed quite a sizable  following. And for a cover band, these guys sure know how to rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> * Best Rock 'n' Roll, Original Music (nominees are the Beat Farmers, the  Paladins, Usual Suspects, Private Domain and Comanche Moon): the Paladins. This  trio has released three albums of infectious, foot-stompin' rockabilly, the  last two on the nationally distributed Alligator Records label, and their local  shows are almost always sold out.  </P> <P> * Entertainers of the Year (nominees are the Beat Farmers, the Savery Brothers,  the Paladins, Rockola and Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love): the Beat  Farmers. Anyone who caught their riveting performance at last weekend's  Michelob Street Scene '90 will know why.  </P> <P> * Entertainer of the Year (nominees are Country Dick Montana of Beat Farmers,  Char Carroll, Paul Shaffer of Private Domain, Bob Tedde of Rockola and "Bogie"  of Dr. Chico's Island Sounds): Country Dick Montana. He's the Foster Brooks of  the local music scene, with a voice even deeper than Johnny Cash's and the  overwhelming presence of a backwoods preacher.  </P> <P> Tickets to Monday night's Entertainer Music Awards ceremony are $10 (reserved  VIP seating, $25). All proceeds will go to the Mary Lou Clack Center for  Handicapped Children, a nonprofit organization in Vista.  </P> <P> The best description of what Nick Lowe does is found in the title of his debut  solo album, 1978's "Pure Pop for Now People." Lowe, who will appear Thursday  night at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa, writes clever little pop ditties with  simple, instantly memorable melodies, all sorts of catchy hooks and openly  sardonic lyrics. He honed his talents in the early 1970s, during a five-year  stint with British pub-rockers Brinsley Schwarz. The group broke up in 1975 and  Lowe formed his own band, Rockpile, with rockabilly revivalist Dave Edmunds.  </P> <P> Rockpile was primarily a touring band; in the six years the group was together,  only one album was released. Still, Lowe frequently set foot in the recording  studio. He cut a handful of critically acclaimed solo albums (including his  1979 breakthrough LP, "Labour of Lust," which spawned his only Top 40 hit,  "Cruel to Be Kind"). He also produced albums by such fellow pop-meisters as  Elvis Costello and Graham Parker and the Rumour.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Lowe released his first solo album in three years, "Party of  One." He also produced the debut album by the Katydids, a London pop-rock band  fronted by expatriate San Diegan Susie Hug.  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: Boom Crash Opera's Sept. 22 show at Rio's in Loma Portal has been  canceled. Songwriter-bassist Richard Pleasance was diagnosed as having  tinnitus, the ringing of the ears that also plagues the Who's Pete Townshend,  and was told to take the rest of the year off. The Australian dance band has  canceled all touring plans until a replacement can be found. . . .  </P> <P> Club of Rome, one of San Diego's most talented original-music bands, will  perform at Saturday's Environmental Awareness Fair on Moonlight Beach in  Encinitas. . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m. for Billy Joel's Nov. 7 concert at the  San Diego Sports Arena, this time at all TicketMaster outlets, even May  Company. On Monday at 10 a.m. tickets for Santana's Oct. 11 show at Starlight  Bowl in Balboa Park will be available. . . . Look for a late November or early  December appearance by veteran heavy metal band AC/DC at the San Diego Sports  Arena. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: Nick Lowe, Thursday at the Bacchanal in  Kearny Mesa; Screamin' Jay Hawkins with the Subdudes, Thursday at the Belly Up  Tavern in Solana Beach; Anson Funderburgh and the Rockets with the Forbidden  Pigs, Friday at the Belly Up; the Average White Band, Saturday at the  Bacchanal; Little Feat with John Hiatt, Sunday at the Starlight Bowl, and  Albert Collins with Charlie Musselwhite, Monday at the Belly Up.  </P></p>

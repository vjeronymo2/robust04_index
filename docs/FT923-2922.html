			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (1): Defying the downturn? - As growth slows in most of Japan, Kyushu is still experiencing patchy progress. While the pessimists argue that national trends eventually filter down to the island, others hope it will escape unbruised WHEN a local banker in Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's four main islands, explained the region's ability to avoid the worst of the economic downturn which is afflicting the country, he alluded to a chapter in history. In the late 13th century, Japan was under threat of invasion from the Mongol army. Initial landings were made and battles were fought in Kyushu. Defeat seemed imminent in the face of the all-conquering Mongols until a sudden storm, or kamikaze (divine wind), wreaked havoc among their vessels, forcing a retreat. Kyushu now hopes that a divine wind of a different kind will enable the island to avoid the damage which has been seen in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's two largest cities. There is a general sense that the emergency economic package of Y10,700bn, announced in late August by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has come in time to make sure that Kyushu will maintain its momentum. The island, which is about the size of the Netherlands, has a long list of public works projects, such as 'Bullet' train lines and motorways, which will provide an important source of stimulation for an are that accounts for about 10 per cent of the national economy. The investment average for Japan is 80 per cent private to 20 per cent public, while the ratio in Kyushu is 70:30. However, the island's prefectural governments have attempted to lessen their reliance on Tokyo money and have been highly successful in luring in new car and electronics factories over the past few years. Mr Hachiji Okuda, the governor of Fukuoka prefecture in the north, says that capital spending has continued to expand in the region, while contracting elsewhere - investment in manufacturing industry rose by 39.9 per cent in 1990 and by 6.9 per cent last year, after a rise of 31 per cent in 1988. 'Compared with the rest of Japan, we are in a good condition. There has been a decline in land prices in Fukuoka, but no abrupt fall. The economic package will have a good psychological impact here, but we are still catching up. Our economy took off only 10 years ago and we have room for growth,' Mr Okuda said. Fukuoka city is fast becoming the Tokyo of Kyushu, sucking in investment and attracting young workers from rural areas. It has an urban dynamism absent from most of the island, with interesting indulgences in post-modern architecture. Its stance is that of an Asian regional centre rather than simply the biggest city on the island. The bright lights and rapid expansion have also attracted speculative property investment, leaving the city with around 3,000 empty apartments and several troubled developers. However, the locals argue that Fukuoka's financial 'bubble' was never pumped up to the daunting proportions of that of Tokyo and say that the banks which are now suffering most are the larger Tokyo-based banks. Lending patterns in Kyushu provide evidence of the difficulties facing Tokyo and Osaka-based banks in Kyushu. It was presumed that the deregulation of Japan's financial system would allow the bigger banks to grab regional market share, but lending by these banks in Kyushu for the first half was about 3 per cent lower than a year earlier, while that of locally-based banks was 6 per cent higher. Mr Tatsuta Goto, president of Nishi-Nippon Bank, insists the region's own banks are very strong. Fukuoka-based banks have certainly profited from the city's growth. Nevertheless, there are concerns that other Kyushu banks were overly ambitious during the easy money era of the late 1980s and that mergers and takeovers will be inevitable. And less optimistic forecasts argue that trends take their time to trickle down to Kyushu and that the pain of recession will be felt before the year is out. But Kyushu has benefited from the rapid expansion of manufacturing during the late 1980s, as has been reflected in the capital spending surge. Toyota Motor is building a new car plant on the island and Nissan has an assembly facility, while the two makers' suppliers are establishing local bases. NEC has a liquid crystal display panel factory in Kyushu and most semiconductor makers have established a presence on the 'silicon island', which offered cheap land and a supply of workers when companies were worried about labour shortages. The investment has quickened the transition of the Kyushu economy, heavily reliant on coal and agricultural output during the 1950s and 1960s. Coal production fell from 26m tonnes in 1960 to 6.6m tonnes in 1985, while integrated circuit output quadrupled between 1980 and 1985 and almost doubled between 1985 and 1990. And while other countries' shipbuilding industries have collapsed, Kyushu's industry, highlighted by the huge Mitsubishi Heavy Industries facility in Nagasaki harbour, is now prospering from an upturn in orders and from a lack of international competition. Having weathered the South Korean challenge, Japanese builders are now expected to take more than 50 per cent of all orders over the next decade. The increase in manufacturing capacity, combined with the slowdown in the domestic economy, has prompted a more embarrassing change. Kyushu once boasted that it was Japan's import base, playing an important role in reducing the politically-sensitive trade surplus. But, confronted by weak domestic demand and the need to justify recently completed plants, manufacturers are sharply increasing their exports. Exports rose 10.2 per cent in the first half of this year, while imports fell by 4.2 per cent. Local trade officials said the increase was a natural result of Kyushu's proximity to thriving Asian economies, yet exports to Asia fell 3.3 per cent during the first half and those to the EC rose 25.9 per cent. Most significantly, car exports rose 23.4 per cent, a not surprising outcome given the 6.5 per cent fall in domestic car sales during the second quarter. In the longer-term, Asia will be the focus of Kyushu's attention, a point made clear by Mr Okuda, who points out that Fukuoka is closer to Seoul and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Dalian than it is to Tokyo. This week, Fukuoka is hosting an Asian film festival, with works from Vietnam, China and, appropriately enough, Mongolia, while other prefectural governments are gradually expanding their network of offices in the region. In Nagasaki, the government is trying to cultivate an image beyond that of a memorial to atomic bomb victims. The governor, Mr Isamu Takada, has reached deeper into the city's history, highlighting its traditional role as Japan's gateway to western and Chinese culture. 'We see ourselves as a good base for the software industry. We must find more jobs for our young people because they are still being lured to Tokyo,' Mr Takada says. But he is not expecting much help from the central government, seen by the prefectures as a hindrance to their grand ambitions - ambitions which are yet to feel the effects of a recession. 'There has been a lot of talk about decentralising government functions, but we have received nothing in the past decade and we are unlikely to get anything in the future. It's too convenient for the bureaucrats and politicians to keep everything bottled up in Tokyo.'</p>

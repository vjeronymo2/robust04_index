			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / China closes HK store Giordano, one of Hong Kong's most successful retailers in the China market, was forced to close its Beijing outlet, because, China says, certain licensing requirements had not been completed, Louise Lucas reports from Hong Kong. But the closure follows a highly unusual and very critical open letter, addressed to Chinese premier Li Peng by the company's non-executive chairman, Mr Jimmy Lai, who is apparently contemplating resigning as a result. Mr Lai's attack on Li Peng, which included highly insulting language, was written in Next Magazine, the outspoken weekly he started in 1991 partially in response to the crushing of democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square two years earlier. Giordano's share price fell sharply closing at HKDollars 3.99, down 20 cents.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Technology: Robots get the dirty work - Japan is developing intelligent systems to help an ageing population A nifty little robot darts down a street, picks up the rubbish and puts it into a truck. Inside a power station, another robot carries out vital maintenance work. A hard-pressed nurse uses robotic help to move beds and patients. Hard to imagine though it may be, Japanese research experts are working on such applications - and on robots for the home - although it will probably not be until well into the next century that they can be put into practice. Labour will be in short supply in coming years. The 125m population is ageing and will slowly decline as the birth rate falls. 'Such systems are necessary for coming generations in Japan,' says Kazuo Asakawa, head of the intelligent systems laboratory at Fujitsu, the Japanese computer group. 'We have to develop intelligent systems to replace young people.' Most people do not want to do the so-called '3K' jobs - denoting the Japanese words for 'dirty, difficult and dangerous' - such as working in hospitals, collecting rubbish, maintaining power stations and cleaning. Asakawa foresees robots also being used in the office, for handling mail and other straightforward tasks and eventually in the home. The key to such developments will be neural networks - complex computer systems that can learn to recognise patterns and react accordingly. The robots will be equipped with an array of sensors that will enable them to adapt to their surroundings. 'In 10 years, we hope to develop autonomous systems using neural networks,' says Asakawa. In the view of Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, president of the University of Tokyo, robots could be the answer to many of Japan's economic and social problems. 'It is necessary to use Japan's highly educated labour force to invent these kinds of things.' He believes that Japanese industry must look ahead to new products such as these to prepare for a future in which over-production and over-capacity will inhibit industrial growth. Japan's car industry is already plagued by over-capacity, as well as high costs; the surge in the yen is eating further into export profits. In common with other academics and industrialists, Yoshikawa warns of the danger of 'hollowing-out' as lower-cost countries in Asia and elsewhere take up production of goods which have become too expensive to make in Japan. The electronics companies are already big producers in south-east Asia and car makers have been expanding their overseas operations. 'We must change the direction of endeavour,' adds Yoshikawa, a specialist in engineering design theory. He thinks industry should lean towards more automation of services such as healthcare and cleaning. He talks of the need for greater 'amplification of services', with intelligent, computer-controlled machines doing much of the awkward and dirty work now done by humans. In other countries, where unemployment is high, this is less of an issue. But Japan's unemployment rate is less than 3 per cent, kept low by the tradition of lifetime employment and the high level of consensus and discipline in Japanese society. This is despite the recession after the bursting of the 'bubble' economy of the late 1980s. Japanese companies already use robots far more widely than the rest of the world. In 1992, there were 350,000 robots in Japan, of which more than 280,000 were advanced (operating in different axes, or with sensors or learning controls), according to latest statistics from the United Nations and the International Federation of Robotics. This compared with 47,000 (42,000 advanced) in the US and 39,000 (35,500) in Germany. The electronics industry is the biggest user of robots in Japan, followed by cars. But the advanced applications envisaged by Asakawa, Yoshikawa and others are still at the pilot stage. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry supports some of them. Work is progessing on robots to take the backache out of nurses' lifting work and on micromachines to help doctors operate and even to carry tiny doses of medicine to certain parts of the body. The rubbish-collecting robots described by Yoshikawa - he calls them 'social robots' - are still at the basic research stage. 'I can't say when they will be ready. The direction of research is to invent new robotics for use on the roads and streets of a city. I hope this will be completed in five to 10 years.' A programme to develop robots to enter the containment vessels of nuclear power plants and carry out maintenance work began in 1978, he says. The first prototype was too heavy at 400kg. Toshiba then made a more sophisticated one, which was suitable for the work. But power companies are reluctant to rely on robots rather than humans for work in which safety and reliability is essential. 'My idea is first maintenance, then social and then home robots,' says Yoshikawa. All these areas, he feels, are ripe for 'amplification' through intelligent automation. Ultimately, the home could be the biggest market for robots. But to do household cleaning and other work, they must be made of softer materials than metal and have more flexible gear systems to fit in with the random pattern of life in the home. Yoshikawa says there are no prototypes of the home robot yet. But he adds that robot manufacturers such as Fuji Machine and Matsushita have shown considerable interest. Asakawa says Fujitsu is also working on computer programs for domestic use. Thus, sometime around 2010, robots could be scurrying around Japanese streets, homes, offices and hospitals doing routine jobs and taking some of the strain out of daily life.</p>

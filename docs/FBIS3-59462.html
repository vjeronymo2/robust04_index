			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, president of the </F> Polish National Bank, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet  studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Mrs.  Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, president of the Polish National Bank  [NBP]. Good morning to you.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Good morning.    [Woyciechowski] When will we see the new, beautiful money  about which we hear so much?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We can see the new and beautiful money  at  the beginning of next year. One can say that to some extent we  have been deliberately preparing the public for the fact that  the redenomination must take place, so as not to catch the  public by surprise. A draft of the law is already prepared and  let us hope that the parliament will debate it, then I hope the  new money --that is the elimination of a few zeros--will take  effect at the beginning of next year.    [Woyciechowski] How many zeros will that be?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Four.    [Woyciechowski] Okay, four zeros which means that 10,000  zlotys today will equal 1 zloty then. Why did it take so long to  conduct the operation? Why was it not done on 1 January of this  year?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] First of all, it is a very serious  operation--as you might imagine--which must be conducted by NBP  along with the government, or practically speaking with several  of the government's ministries. Completely different statistics  must be introduced adjusted to the new money, and that applies  to every economic unit. So this kind of operation cannot simply  be implemented just like that, because someone says it is time  to do it, but instead, there would have to be a combined  government effort. Well, it so happened that this  government--practically speaking--was officially established at  the end of last year, and that would be....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And that was the main reason  for the delay--the fact that there was no one to talk to? Or  was it the risk that this government would cause an increase in  inflation and so forth? Was it a political risk, or....    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] There is of course always  the risk of fueling inflation,but we try not to think about it,  rather we think about convenience, so to speak, for people who  use the money, the banknotes. We take into account the fact that  currently various machines refuse to deal with the number of  zeros that big, so we tend to concentrate our attention on the  technical side, and we do not think that inflation has increased  in Poland.    [Woyciechowski] You mean it will be dropping?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I hope so--such are the assumptions made  by the finance minister in the budget bill, and we also share  [word indistinct].    [Woyciechowski] Who makes the decision on  denominations--you,  the government, or the president? Who decides?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] From a formal standpoint, it is the NBP  that makes the decision, since according to a law on NBP its  chairperson is responsible for introducing new banknotes and  [word indistinct]....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So practically speaking, you  could make the decision all by yourself?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Formally speaking--yes, but you know,  some laws should be changed, such as the Penal Code and the  Commercial Code since the figures included there will have to be  changed, so from a formal standpoint, it would be a good thing  if....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean fines and various  other monetary amounts included in various laws?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, so changing these laws I would say  requires legislative action.    [Woyciechowski] Is it true that the new money is beautiful  to  look at? You have seen it.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] I guess one could say that,  but  that is a matter of state secrecy.    [Woyciechowski] I know and I understand that. Is the money  already printed and ready to be used?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, hesitating] That is also a state secret.    [Woyciechowski] It is? But my understanding is that the  money is already printed because if it was not, you would say  so. But storing all this money must require using some  incredibly huge warehouses, some incredibly vast amount of  space. Is the money being stored in Poland, or somewhere like  Switzerland or a Caribbean island?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] You know, of course I cannot reveal that  either, but you have to keep in mind that we have some space for  storing the money currently in circulation, I mean the  million-zloty banknotes, as well as all the 500,000-zloty  banknotes [laughing] if I got it right ....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And these probably take up  more  space than the new banknotes?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] That really takes up a lot of space and,  by the way, I must say that practically speaking, ever since I  took up this post, high-denomination banknotes have not been  printed--I mean during my term of office--and sometimes we have  to take upon ourselves the consequences of previous printing  issues, and I mean not just a few times, but in the majority of  cases.    [Woyciechowski] What will happen to the dollar, I mean its  radical devaluation [dewaluacja skokowa]? There is a  lot of talk about it now--some would like to see it, others  would not. Will it happen, and what does radical devaluation  mean? And who needs it at all?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Well, I would say that is always the  biggest problem to me and I do not like it very much when  various lobbying groups--and also sometimes representatives of  governments, unfortunately, take part in this, that was the case  both with the previous government and this one--I mean I do not  like it when they speak of a necessity for such a devaluation,  since first of all, that decision is in the range of powers of  the NBP chairperson....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is you.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes.    [Woyciechowski] And do you want to see such a radical  devaluation or not?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, I do not want to devaluate....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So will it happen or not?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think there are no reasons whatsoever  for this type of measure in the immediate future, and I will  explain specifically why I believe that to be the case. It is  not because I said so, or that [laughing] my word is the  determinant factor here, but the fact is that since October of  last year, there has been a process of very high increases in  foreign-currency reserves. Let me give you an example: At the  beginning of last year, we were planning to have an increase in  foreign-currency reserves in the range of $200 million whereas  in fact we already have $300 million at this point....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Foreign-currency reserves are  represented by those dollars which [words indistinct]?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The dollars which are in the banking  system.    [Woyciechowski] Where does that money come from? The  situation is so bad, and suddenly we have more dollars?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I mean, fortunately--as in every country  with a market economy--the foreign-trade balance is just one of  the indicators, and just one of the sources of reserves. We  happen to have a foreign-trade deficit, but there are many other  sources of [word indistinct] I would say, for instance through  privatization--for example the two recent bank privatizations  mean big amounts of foreign-currency reserves, in this case the  money is coming into Poland from abroad. And there is also the  [words indistinct] that some people have savings in dollars....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So this is a kind of  individual  import--people bring dollars from abroad and they deposit them  in banks, then exchange those dollars into zlotys....    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] Yes, that is a kind of  individual import. So I would say there is a lot of concern in  Poland about the Eastern border, but we know that there are  constant purchases made from beyond the Western border, and that  means an influx of foreign currencies into our country, like the  German mark, which naturally is included on the list of hard  currencies. So we are having an increase in foreign-currency  reserves, and the previous devaluation in August took place only  because reserves were decreasing....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But let me go back to the  issue of the foreign-trade deficit for a moment. People say that  the foreign-trade deficit is enormous, that imports exceed  exports by huge amounts, and the recent figures are $2.5 billion  per year--these are huge figures--but my understanding is that  there is no problem because we have the money?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We have the money. The most important  thing for a central bank is its level of reserves, and not the  most recent foreign-trade balance, I would say. The current  balance of payments is more important. That payment balance also  includes other sources apart from just the foreign-trade  balance. That is quite a natural thing to happen. Let me give  you an example that is perhaps spectacular: The United States  has been having a [word indistinct] negative foreign-trade  balance, and nothing bad is happening to that country as a  consequence of that, and nothing bad is happening to the  dollar--on the contrary, it keeps rising on foreign markets. So  it is important not to link the foreign-trade balance to  foreign-currency reserves. That is the popular thinking in  Poland, but it is a relic of a centrally planned economy--at the  time there were no other sources of income whatsoever....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean, of the socialist  economy?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Correct.    [Woyciechowski] So that means the situation is good?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, it is, from the standpoint of....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] We have a lot of dollars.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Besides it is a very good thing that we  have the imports of technology, because an economy that is  already reviving--we will have an increase of 4.5 percent in the  gross domestic product--needs new technologies and it needs  imports, whereas on the other hand consumption  imports--according to data from the Central Office of  Statistics--have been declining. So that is a natural and normal  phenomenon for an economy that was behind other economies, in  terms of technology, and that is now developing.    [Woyciechowski] So there will be no devaluation of the  dollar?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] For the immediate future, there are  no....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What does immediate future  mean?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] You know, that would be going  into details. I can say this much: If we were to see a sudden  decrease of foreign-currency reserves which would go on for a  substantial period of time, then we would think about it. But  what we do have even now is constant devaluation--and let us not  forget that--every month, or practically speaking every day, the  zloty is devalued by between 10 and 20 zlotys in relation to a  foreign- currency index where 45 percent is taken up by the U.S.  dollar.    [Woyciechowski] That is simply a result of inflation.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Exactly. And it is our view that there  will be no need for an additional devaluation during this entire  year, providing the foreign-currency reserves keep rising the  way they have been since October of last year, and even if the  rate of increase is slower, there will be no need for a  devaluation, either.    [Woyciechowski] How do you feel about the draft budget?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Generally speaking, it is good in the  sense that the budget deficit is not too big--that is the most  important thing to me--and also that the level of financing the  budget deficit planned to be implemented by the NBP is  acceptable to us, I mean the 30 trillion zlotys....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The budget deficit will be 83  trillion zlotys--according to plans--and you will supply 30  trillion zlotys of that amount.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, I will lend the money, that is  exactly [words indistinct]....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How will you lend the money?  Will you charge interest?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, I will lend the government money at  the standard market interest rate, and the market interest rate  is in the range of approximately 30 percent....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So you will actually make  money  on the loan?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Correct, and the government will also be  happy to see 80 percent of NBP revenue being transferred to the  budget by me....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Wait a minute, it has gotten  terribly complicated here. The government faces a budget  deficit. You loan 30 trillion zlotys to the government charging  a very high interest rate....    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] It is a normal market  interest rate, not a very high interest rate at all.    [Woyciechowski] And that 30 trillion is our money, belonging  to all of us --our savings, our public money so to speak, is  that right?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, what you said is included in  there since the money I collect within NBP accounts are banks'  mandatory reserves, whereas it is society that deposits money in  the banks.    [Woyciechowski] So in a word, you loan the 30 trillion  zlotys  charging a high interest rate, but the interest rate is then  taken over by the government indirectly since the government is  NBP's owner, as it were?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, the government is not the owner of  NBP, but even despite that, I have to transfer 80 percent of  NBP's revenue. The government is not the owner of other economic  units that are legal entities either, but these units still have  to pay a 40-percent income tax.    [Woyciechowski] So this is like that pre-World War II Jewish  anecdote: Somebody loans money and everybody benefits. The  government loans money to itself, and it is our money--can one  say that it is our money?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] Yes, one can say that. The  method has been accepted in all those countries with market  economies facing a deficit problem, and we must say here that  even Germany is facing the problem of a budget deficit, and it  is a usually accepted practice that citizens--or economic  units--finance the budget deficit by lending money, and of  course they make money on the transaction.    [Woyciechowski] And if the Sejm increased the deficit, would  you lend more money? I mean more than 30 trillion zlotys?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I must admit that for the time being I  am  not taking that possibility into account since the 1994 budget  bill is the government's draft, the government enjoys a stable  Sejm majority, and despite the debates or some complaints that  various needs were not satisfied, I am strongly convinced the  budget will be passed in the form it was proposed by the cabinet.    [Woyciechowski] What is domestic debt? Recently there has  been talk that our foreign debt--reaching into the billions of  dollars--is really peanuts, and that what is really important is  domestic debt. But few people know what the term means. Who  lends whose money to whom?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Well, our foreign debt is not exactly  peanuts. But it is true that the problem of domestic debt has  been completely ignored up to now, simply because people thought  that somebody gives money to finance the deficit--just like you  used the word give here--it could be the central bank, or  somebody else. The truth of course is that nobody just gives  money to anybody. The government borrows the money and has to  repay it later. And on top of that, in Poland the government  borrows money for relatively short periods of time--if you take  the United States for instance, there are treasury bonds there  which are for as long as 30 years, for example. In Poland of  course, no citizen or economic unit makes that kind of economic  investment for that kind of time period, and that is why such  instruments are impractical in Poland. As Finance Minister  Borowski nicely described, the domestic debt has been  snowballing, which means the more money you borrow, the more you  have to repay. That is also a warning in terms of the magnitude  of the budget deficit--there was talk that it could exceed 5  percent, or that we can allow to have it at the level of 6 or 7  or 8 percent--naturally, you can have such amounts if you have  the money with which to pay it back. But it turns out that the  problem is not that simple and that a government in debt simply  has to repay its debt, and since the financial instruments in  Poland are of a short-term nature--that is generally speaking up  to one year and only some government securities are for three  years, for which there is less demand than for the one-year  securities--therefore the government has to plan in every  subsequent budget the amount of money it will repay. Which is  several dozen trillion zlotys.    [Woyciechowski] And the figure keeps rising.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Exactly.    [Woyciechowski] So the domestic debt is about treasury  bills,  government securities, and what else?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Those are the two instruments--treasury  bills purchased by banks, including NBP, and government  securities purchased by the public at large. More and more  people know now that if one buys government securities, one can  deduct over 12 million zlotys from taxable income with regard to  income tax, and that is why we had those lines of people at  banks to buy securities, even on New Year's Eve. So you see,  citizens lend money.    [Woyciechowski] Do you gamble on the stock exchange?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] No, but I purchased government  securities.    [Woyciechowski] And is it worthwhile to gamble there? What  is your view on all these jumps in share prices at the stock  exchange, and on this massive demand to buy shares? Is it a  normal phenomenon, or are we so preoccupied by this beginning of  the stock exchange and the beginning of capitalism, that we  spend too much money?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think you are right on both counts  there. I would say the question you posed is very good, but it  should be addressed by Stock Exchange Chairman Rozlucki, not me.  The exchange is a new institution of our market economy which is  going through its development, and I would say the more economic  units there are, the more stable and reliable the exchange will  be. And then one will not be able to say that some profits made  there are inflated or unrealistic, because the basis for the  functioning of this whole capital exchange will be widened, that  means speedy privatization. By the way, the government is  heading in that direction.    [Woyciechowski] Recently you gave customers of private banks  quite a scare by saying that not all of them have NBP guarantees  and that one should take a good look at a bank before depositing  money there since it could go bankrupt. Could you explain a  little bit on how [words indistinct]...?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] The problem is that this  is  the way Panorama put it. But all I said was that it is a wise  thing to keep money in different banks, just like it is a wise  thing to keep it in different places as well. That applies to  banks, but also to the stock exchange, for instance, or to trust  funds. Simply put, it is not a wise thing to keep all the money  you have in one place, or all on one shelf in a closet. But I  would not caution generally against private banks because there  are some of them that are very good and they are very active on  the stock exchange, but even those that are not there can still  be very good, and on the other hand there are state-owned banks  that are very bad. According to the law, private banks do not  have guarantees with regard to deposits the way state-owned  banks do, except we will shortly have a law on securing  deposits, but even despite that NBP, of course, pays out up to a  certain amount in case a bank like that goes bankrupt, except  that currently, basically speaking, because the Baltic Bank,  which has declared itself insolvent, is being taken over by  [name indistinct] Bank, so people will not lose any money in  that case, and we hope that the other bank--which is  Interbank--will manage to be saved nevertheless, so there is no  such danger. But it is beyond dispute that there is also a bad  situation in the cooperative sector, and in those cases, even  though the state practically provides guarantees to all  cooperative banks, unfortunately I had to declare one of them  insolvent the day before yesterday, and that was the 18th case,  and that despite the fact that there are guarantees by the  state. One will still have to wait because the way the finance  minister interprets his guarantees is that he will begin paying  out, but only after the insolvency proceedings are over, which  may last up to two years ....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So these customers face the  danger of not being able to use their accounts for two years?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In a way, it is really a danger, but the  civil rights spokesman spoke out in defense of those customers  and now the Supreme Court will issue a decision on that.    [Woyciechowski] How does one tell a good bank from a bad  one?  You say there are good and bad examples both among private banks  and state-owned ones, so the ownership question cannot be the  way to tell. So what is it? Is it beautiful furniture, a lot of  computers, and nice ladies waiting to serve you?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] No, that is not the way to  tell that, either--oftentimes they are banks that used to have  problems in investments because they actually invested  customers' deposits, not the banks' own capital. That is  undoubtedly not a simple issue for an average man on the  street--I mean the bank's balance or the solvency  coefficient--it is like secret information, as it were. When  interest rates are very high, that becomes dangerous. But the  question is: What are extremely high interest rates? There used  to be banks where there were extremely high....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean Grobelny's bank, or  other cases as well?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Not just that, but also even Bogatyn's  bank which we have taken over and now NBP is its owner. There  was also the case of Prosper Bank of which NBP also became the  owner now--they used to apply such flagrantly high....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And that becomes suspicious?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Only if they are flagrantly high. There  have to be some differences among banks--that is what  competition is all about. So I stress it that they have to be  flagrantly higher than on the average in the banking system.    [Woyciechowski] When will Polish banks be all beautiful to  look at, stylish, and very efficient? When will they have a  network of computer connections, when will they eliminate lines?  There is a lot of talk now that making the banking system  healthy is a major step toward the market economy. How much time  will it take?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I am sure it is hard to predict that  with  precision, but I think the establishment of the National  Clearing Chamber--which is a system of clearing accounts among  different banks and currently more than 40 banks participate in  it--represents major progress. I can say that the time required  to have financial means transferred between banks was cut short  from a week to about two days. I know that there are complaints  voiced sometimes--indeed, some banks procrastinate, and we try  to intervene, but that is not the fault of the connection system  but of specific banks, I would say. I think that competition  continues to be the best advancing factor. Besides, we also have  the TellBank network, which also serves the purpose of settling  accounts among banks. It is very modern and we currently even  use a satellite--I say we, because NBP is the majority  shareholder in TellBank, and it seems that there are really  banks out there with which customers are satisfied, and where  clearing accounts takes a very short time, and the others will  unfortunately not survive the competition--that is just life.    [Woyciechowski] And when will we have a situation like it is  the world over, where everyone has a credit card, with all the  money coming into the account, and one does not have to deal  with all those huge amounts of cash?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Some measures have already been  initiated. The PKO Bank has introduced such a card--I do not  have one, but my colleagues there have shown it to me--and that  also constitutes part of the competition. The banks that  introduce such measures and make the customers' lives easier  will gain customers. The products are already on the market.  There are Visa and American Express cards all issued by....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But not by Polish banks?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] By Polish banks [as heard]. The most  important thing is...[changes thought] Well, there is a Polish  card issued by PKO BP whose extent is rather limited, but we are  an open country, we can use foreign credit cards. Let us hope we  will have Polish ones as time goes by.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the conversation.  Radio Zet's guest today has been NBP President Hanna  Gronkiewicz-Waltz. Thank you very much.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Thank you.</p>

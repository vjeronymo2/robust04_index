			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's With rules for the admission of corporate capital now on the table, investment bankers can start to hawk their Lloyd's insurance funds in earnest. But even assuming the rules are approved by disaffected Names next month, committing capital to Lloyd's is an act of faith. There can be no guarantee that corporate members will not be asked to meet the cost of old claims. Litigation could yet ruin the members' agents on which corporate members will depend for advice and access to the best underwriting syndicates. With insurance rates hardening, the lure of rising profits will doubtless overcome these fears. Yet picking winners among the range of investment vehicles likely to be paraded this autumn will be no easy matter. Underwriting success turns on the choice of syndicates, so the quality of analysis employed by each fund is clearly crucial. The danger is that all the analysis will point in the same direction. Since Lloyd's does not benefit from a price mechanism to allocate new capital, the ability of a corporate Name to elbow its way to the front of the syndicate queue may be just as important. Listed Lloyd's investment companies will be the easiest route for many investors. The prospect of a 25 per cent return on capital is enticing even if - thanks to Lloyd's three year accounting - return by way of yield will be modest until 1997. Still, that does not justify sending the shares to a premium to net assets without proof the managers can pick the right risks.</p>

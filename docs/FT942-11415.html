			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (6): Making the most of growing opportunities - In spite of continuing obstacles such as protected sectors, pent up consumer demand is a magnet to exporters / Country profile, Brazil Exporters to Brazil have one person to thank for new market opportunities: former president Fernando Collor, who resigned amid corruption allegations but began the process of opening up the economy to world markets in 1990. Since then tariffs have continued to fall and imports in many sectors have boomed. With a population of 150m, 'the potential here is enormous and there's a lot of pent up consumer demand', says John Byers, general manager for Land Rover in Brazil, which expects to treble its vehicle sales to nearly 400 this year. But in spite of the continuing tariff reduction, duties of 35 per cent for products including computers and some machinery are still higher than neighbouring countries. And obtaining export financing for more than a year can be difficult because of Brazil's high country risk, mainly because of political instability and inflation of 40 per cent a month. Last year Brazil's trade totalled Dollars 65bn, about 15 per cent of gross domestic product. Imports increased by a quarter to about Dollars 26bn. According to Tullo Vigevani, a political scientist, trade is expected to reach Dollars 100-Dollars 110bn by the end of the decade. This growth will depend partly on the future speed in lowering tariffs, which in turn will may be affected by presidential elections at the end of this year. A victory by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, believed to favour protection for certain sectors, could slow the process down but, 'there is a consensus in favour of internationalisation', says to Mr Vigevani. Another example of Brazil's move to a more open economy is its planned membership of the Mercosul trading bloc, which will also include Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Although the Mercosul is not scheduled to come into effect until the beginning of next year, Brazilian exports to Argentina have soared in recent years. The Mercosul has spurred many Brazilian companies to import equipment and technology, not just in the industrial heartland of Sao Paulo but also southern states such as Rio Grande do Sul and Parana. Other capital investment has been taking place in the pulp, auto, petrochemical and steel sectors as Brazilian industry restructures after the economic opening. Capital goods accounted for imports worth Dollars 5.3bn last year and consumer goods Dollars 3.3bn. Brazil imported 23 per cent of total goods from the European Union, particularly from Germany, Italy, France and the UK, although the US remains Brazil's biggest trading partner. With such an inflation-ravaged local currency, bankers advise exporters to Brazil to be cautious of sales to companies that do not have a dollar cash flow. Another potential problem is sudden changes in regulations. Mr Byers says: 'I've got a 1992 import guide but it's already completely obsolete because of changes in regulations.' As an example, he points to an attempt last year by the national fuels council to ban sales of diesel for imported off-the-road vehicles, a decision later overturned in the courts after a challenge by vehicle importers. This uncertainty means that exporters to Brazil should have a local representative to hear of changes before they happen, says Mr Byers. Another problem is the existence of protected markets in sectors such as telecommunications. AT&amp;T, the US telephone company, was blocked last year from selling imported equipment to the government-controlled telecom company Telebras after pressure from the local manufacturing operations of international rivals. In spite of these drawbacks, business people say a taboo surrounding imported goods has been broken and that local bureaucracy is more manageable. There are other positive signs such as a planned reduction in port charges this year. One company trying to take advantage of the opening is UK chemical firm Allied Colloids, which opened an office in Brazil just over a year ago to increase its exports of polymer-based products for water treatment. General manager Granville Miers says the company expects sales of Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m this year but faces strong competition, not just from other foreign companies such as BASF, but also from local firms. Tariffs for Allied Colloids' products are a maximum of 20 per cent, says Mr Miers, who adds that many Brazilian exporting companies prefer to import the chemicals directly from the UK because they can then claim back the tariff under a drawback system. The US Eximbank and most of the large European export credit agencies (ECAs) provide cover for sales to Brazil. The UK's ECGD, however, is not active. According to Carlos Brigagao, a manager at Banco Frances e Brasileiro, which is linked to Credit Lynonais, ECA financing has been increasing in the past two years, although from a very low base. He notes that a large part of capital goods imports is second-hand equipment, which is not usually covered by ECAs financing. Many Brazilian companies are rejected for ECA cover because of the country risk. 'A company seeking a loan for more than a year or two has a tough job in today's environment,' says a banker. Most importers are forced to pay in cash, usually with a documentary letter of credit, or obtain 360-day financing. Credit for more than 360 days runs into uncertain territory because it is regarded by the central bank as medium term financing. This means a deferred payments system may be adopted, causing the exporter problems. According to a British banker in Sao Paulo, most ECAs are not that active in Brazil and ECA financing will not increase substantially until Brazil becomes more stable and reschedules its debt to the Paris Club of creditor nations. The US Eximbank rate for export financing, including charges such as the exposure fee, works out at about Libor +5 per cent, says Denis Mori, a director at Banco Itamarati in Sao Paulo. Eximbank tends to work more with bank-to-bank credit lines than the European ECAs, he says. A director at the Sao Paulo office of a large German commercial bank says that usually Brazilian companies only use ECAs for imports of very large equipment. But he says commercial banks cannot provide financing for more than a year, or in some cases two, because of the country risk. Commercial banks offer rates of Libor + 3-4 per cent, he says.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / French weaponry secured win in battle for franc: William Dawkins explains how France managed to defend its currency against heavy speculation where Britain failed The French government's decision to cut official interest rates for the first time in just over a year signals that the six-week battle to save the franc from devaluation has been won, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said yesterday. If so, this invites the question of how France managed to save its currency against the heaviest speculative selling for years, when Britain, faced with the same plight, failed and had to devalue. The answer is partly that the French economy is in less poor shape than Britain's, partly that Germany lent France a hand and partly that French monetary authorities have more tools at hand than their British neighbours. The markets believed in France's ability to survive among the highest real interest rates in Europe  - true even after yesterday's cut  - because its economy is still strong enough to deliver growth expected at roughly 2 per cent this year, and something around the same next. France's economic resilience is the legacy of nearly a decade of budgetary and monetary discipline practised by successive left- and right-wing governments, a continuity that does not exist in Britain. Admittedly, that legacy can no longer be taken for granted at a time when France has nearly 3m out of work, which is one reason why the crisis happened in the first place. The latest evidence of that is a recent newspaper article by influential opposition Gaullist rebels Mr Philippe Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, urging a revaluation of the D-Mark, which would amount to a franc devaluation. Another sign of disquiet is a paper by the Economic and Social Council, a cross-party think tank, suggesting that competitive disinflation, the aim of all the economic rigour, is showing its limits. Yesterday's rate cut will provide a small amount of relief to those who fear that high interest rates are stifling the economy. However, the right-wing leadership, likely to take power next March, remains wedded to much the same budgetary and monetary toughness as the Socialists. 'If the dissent were to be magnified, there would be a risk. But we don't see the right making any major changes in economic policy,' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London. Yesterday was the moment for the French government to move because the Banque de France has just stopped having to sell francs to balance its books in the wake of the crisis, so removing what had been a source of pressure on the French currency. The French central bank spent FFr160bn (Pounds 19bn) on buying francs to keep the French currency within its EMS range since late September, with the help of a FFr130bn to FFr140bn loan from the Bundesbank, according to returns from both banks, disentangled by Paul Hammett, French economist at Paribas Capital Markets in London. The rest, around FFr20bn, came from the French central bank's own reserves, estimates Mr Hammett. Since then, the Banque de France has sold around FFr160bn of francs into the open market, for D-Marks, enabling it to repay the Bundesbank and rebuild its own reserves, even turning a small profit  - of the order of FFr1.5bn believes Paribas  - on the franc's appreciation in value during the process. Help from the Germany came not so much from the Bundesbank loan, under standard ERM rules, as from the joint statement by both countries' central banks and finance ministries at the end of September that they saw no reason to break the franc/D-Mark link. While this whipped up British resentment of the special relationship between France and Germany, it did at least convince the markets that the franc was going to be defended hard. France's tactics in the battle for the franc differed from Britain's actions. The French central bank tends to intervene earlier and harder than the Bank of England. Second, the French central bank has a lever at its disposal which has no direct equivalent at the Bank of England, the five- to 10-day repurchase rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow short-term money from the central bank as a last resort, similar to the Bundesbank's Lombard rate. The Banque de France increased its repurchase rate from 10.5 per cent to 13 per cent in late September, thereby pushing up money market rates  - at which commercial banks lend to each other  - but without triggering an increase in the commercial banks' base rates, at which they lend to companies and individuals. In effect, this allows it to raise rates to defend the franc without harming the economy. That tool was harder to use this time because money market rates shot up unusually high, to more than 20 per cent at one stage, which meant that commercial banks were lending, at a base rate of 9.85 per cent, at a big loss. Thanks to an unofficial understanding between the government and the leading banks, French base rates stayed unchanged through the crisis until yesterday, so most borrowers have felt no pain. The commercial banks, of course, lost heavily. Money market rates have fallen steadily over the past fortnight, to around the same level as base rates, and the repurchase rate is nearly back down to the same level as a year ago, so the pressure on the commercial banks is now off. Economic analysts expected them to wait to recover some of their losses before dropping commercial base rates but four leading banks went ahead yesterday and cut their base lending rates from 9.85 per cent to 9.65 per cent.</p>

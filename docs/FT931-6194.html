			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Clarke outlines proposals for young offenders New secure training centres for 12-15-year-olds - part of a government response to mounting public concern about juvenile crime - may be operated by the private sector, the public sector or voluntary organisations. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, in a joint news conference with health secretary Virginia Bottomley yesterday, said that all three sectors will be invited to bid to operate the centres, which would be 'different from anything that has been offered before'. About six centres, providing accommodation for up to 300 persistent reoffenders, are likely to be developed initially. Details, Page 20</p>

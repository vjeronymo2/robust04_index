			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): A safety-net may mean that the show is less spectacular Guaranteed Products - Loss of capital is the saver's biggest fear, and a range of equity-based products, devised to counteract this understandable nervousness, promises you your money back. But you can't get something for nothing IT HAS been hard to persuade cautious British investors to buy shares, except where they are offered a 'one-way bet' as with the privatisation issues. Loss of capital is the British saver's biggest fear, and the crash of 1987 still looms large in investors' memories as an example of the stock market's volatility. Now, a new generation of savings products has been devised, with the aim of counteracting this understandable nervousness. Guaranteed products offer an equity-based investment, with a promise of your money back. Many are based on the options and futures market. The bulk of the fund is invested in fixed-interest securities which grow so that the capital can be paid back. The rest goes into options and futures, in order to provide exposure to the equity market. A typical product will offer the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over five years, or your original investment, whichever is the greater. Countless variations can be played on this basic structure in order to provide products which appeal to different types of investor. For example, rises in the market can be 'locked in', to avoid the danger of a sharp fall in share prices at the end of the investment period. Sensible investors realise that they should place their savings in the stock market, if they want the best long-term returns. A guaranteed bond would therefore seem to be an ideal way of enjoying equity-style profits, at little risk. But these products are rarely flawless. The most common limitations are: Fixed investment periods. Most products have to be held for five years for the guarantee to apply, and are only on offer for a limited period (accordingly, some of those mentioned in this article are no longer available for investment). Those who withdraw early may face extra charges, and returns will depend on the market level at the time of the withdrawal. There are exceptions, however. Abbey Life's Protected Growth Bond, for example, offers year-on-year protection unless world stock markets fall by an average of 16 per cent. Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Capital Protected Plus offers guarantees on a quarterly basis, with withdrawals possible at the end of each three month period. Lack of income. Most products pay no income at all; nor do they match the dividend yield on the index, an important component of equity returns. Thus performance would lag behind an index-tracking unit trust over five years. Again, some products have proved exceptions to the rule. Scottish Amicable, for example, offered a yield-inclusive return on its Capital Guarantee Bond, although this was partly offset by high charges. Tax. Many products are insurance bonds, with the result that they fall under the income tax regime. Basic rate tax is deducted by the company. Higher-rate taxpayers may face a further charge (the difference between basic rate and top rate tax on encashment), although there is the possibility of using top-slicing relief. Most equity products normally offer the bulk of their return in the form of capital gain, and since most people do not use up their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93), a conventional unit or investment trust will normally be more tax-efficient than a guaranteed product, especially for a higher-rate taxpayer. The problem of providing a 'rolling guarantee' has made it difficult for unit and investments trusts to offer a cash-back promise. However, Legal &amp; General has produced a personal equity plan, based on its Recovery unit trust. If the value of your Pep has fallen over five years, Legal &amp; General will send you a cheque to make up the difference. The product is therefore highly tax-efficient; however, the Recovery trust is not an indexed fund, and there is always the risk that the investment performance could substantially underperform the market. Charges. Indexed unit trusts often have quite low front-end and annual charges. But guaranteed products tend to have bid-offer spreads in line with the bulk of the unit trust/insurance industry - at around 5 per cent. Since it is normally the bid price of the units which is indexed, this means that, on most guaranteed products, indexation only applies to around 95 per cent of your money. Inflation. Most products promise to repay your initial capital after five years. But this takes no account of the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of the investor's money. Some products promise slightly more than your capital back after five years, but usually compensate by offering less than 100 per cent of the index's rise. Confusing claims. Some companies have offered products which offer to beat the performance of the FT-SE 100 index. However, this may be a mirage; Laurentian Life, for example, promised 115 per cent of the Footsie's rise. But this figure is before tax, which is automatically deducted, which means that investors will not, in practice, receive this rise. The guarantee is only as good as the company which is offering it. While this is not much of a problem in many cases, because most products are sold by the UK's biggest insurance groups, it is worth remembering when considering an offer from a little-known company. To sum up, you cannot get something for nothing. Investors have to make some sort of sacrifice in order to get the guarantee, whether it is lack of income, flexibility, or tax inefficiency. Sophisticated investors may find these products unnecessary. If they believe the market will rise over the next five years, they should consider a low-charging index unit trust such as Gartmore's; if they feel the market is set to fall, they should avoid equities altogether and stick to gilts or the building society. That said, there are many British investors who will only be tempted into equities by a money-back guarantee. These products may well prove one of the financial services growth areas of the 1990s.

Qiao came at the invitation of Heinz Fischer, president of  Austria's National Council.    Austria is the last leg of Qiao's three-nation West European  tour, which has already taken him to Germany and Switzerland.    Qiao, who is the first NPC chairman to visit Austria, was  greeted at the airport by Fischer.    In a written speech released at the airport, Qiao spoke of  the all-round development of the friendly relations and  cooperation between the two countries in various fields since  the establishment of diplomatic ties more than 20 years ago.    Contacts between China's NPC and the Austrian National  Council are on the increase, he said.    "I hope my visit will be conducive to promoting mutual  understanding, deepening friendship and expanding cooperation so  as to give a fresh impetus to Sino-Austrian relations," he said.    Qiao will hold talks with Fischer and meet other  parliamentary leaders. He is also expected to meet Austrian  Government leaders.</p>

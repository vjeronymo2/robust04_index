			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Khachatphai Burutphat, National Security </F> Council Deputy Secretary general, by unidentified correspondent;  place and date not given]    [Excerpts]    Correspondent: Does the recent spate of bombings  indicate the country is having a security problem?    Khachatphai: [passage omitted] I wish to give the  assurance that the country enjoys complete security. All the  officials concerned have worked together closely to find the  culprits and gather information to prevent the future occurrence  of these problems. Security at various installations has been  strengthened to prevent acts of terrorism. [passage omitted]    Correspondent: Does this mean that the performance  of the officials concerned has not been effective?    Khachatphai: One must realize that there are  people who look for opportunities to create trouble. They will  carry out their work whenever an opportunity arises. Therefore,  it is difficult to absolutely prevent every problem.  Intelligence operations and security vigilance have been  responsible for preventing many incidents. These types of  operations, however, cannot be publicized. So, people do not  know about the performance of such operations. Therefore, it is  unfair to say that officials have been ineffective.    Correspondent: What are the causes of the bombings  perpetrated by local or foreign elements?    Khachatphai: There are many causes for the bomb  attacks carried out by Thais. Among them are personal conflicts  and deliberate attempts to create a situation. [passage omitted]    Correspondent: Do international terrorist groups  pick Thailand for their operations because they find it easy?    Khachatphai: Thai society, like in other liberal  countries, is open. Tourists can travel where they please.  Several million foreign tourists visit every year, in addition  to more than 100,000 illegal arrivals. This is a weak point,  but it does not mean that international terrorists pick Thailand  because it is so easy to stage an incident.    Correspondent: Compared with Singapore and  Malaysia whose societies are also open, why do terrorists pick  on Thailand to carry out their sabotage activities?    Khachatphai: There are several factors  international terrorists consider in choosing a country for  their sabotage. One factor is their intended target. It is  probably not true that security in those two countries is so  good that it is impossible to carry out terrorist activities.  The elaborate counterterrorist measures in the United States  and the UK have not been able to completely prevent terrorist  activities there.    Correspondent: In addition to foreign terrorist  groups, are there local groups which complicate the sabotage  picture?    Khachatphai: Possibly both. That is, there could  be foreign terrorist groups which have targets in Thailand.  Meanwhile, there are some local groups which aim to create  public disorder. So, incidents affecting national peace and  order could be created by any of these elements. Therefore,  officials concerned must not relax and must be ready to prevent  an incident and timely solve it if it happens.    Correspondent: What about groups which seek to  topple the current government?    Khachatphai: The results of initial investigations  have not linked groups seeking a political change to the  disturbances. Normal incidents of disturbance are probably  linked to personal disputes or to intimidation with some purpose  in mind. Officials concerned are trying to verifying the  causes. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Billy Paddock] </F>   [Text] Zulu chiefs are believed to be considering a mass  action campaign over the election period which would require  their subjects to attend the campaign, preventing them from  going to polling stations. A senior Inkatha source said at the  weekend he had heard this speculation, but denied it was an  Inkatha plan. He said Inkatha wanted to prove that the  constitution was unacceptable by ensuring its members backed an  election boycott.    Traditional chiefs might take action to frustrate the  Independent Election Commission's (IEC) efforts to ensure free  elections. The rumoured mass action campaign was one of these  actions. He also denied rumours that Inkatha leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi had called on all kwaZulu public servants to report to  Ulundi on April 27 in an attempt to prevent them from going to  polling stations. He said it had become clear that government  and the ANC were prepared to bulldoze the election regardless of  opposition.    "(ANC president Nelson) Mandela keeps saying that the  elections cannot be postponed because the people will be too  angry and will revolt. Well, the fact is that the majority of  people in this region are angry that the elections are going  ahead and their concerns are being ignored."</p>

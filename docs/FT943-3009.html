			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Trade in weapons harder to regulate Trade in highly sophisticated conventional weapons is increasing and becoming harder to regulate, according to a paper published this month by the International Institute of Strategic Studies. The paper, written by a Canadian scholar, Mr David Mussington, says the old restraints on the transfer of militarily sensitive technology are breaking down, and new ones are difficult to impose. The decline in domestic arms procurement in both the West and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War has made arms producers more dependent on other export markets, while weakening the political case for co-ordinated restraint, the study says. Heightened commercial pressures mean policy-makers in the US and the main Nato allies are becoming less likely to worry about the effects of arms deliveries on regional stability, preferring to focus on the preservation of a defence technology base, and the related employment issues. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in its 1994 journal, said a decline in the volume of conventional arms imports is continuing among industrialised countries but has bottomed out in the developing world (see graphic). However, the picture may be even more alarming than the SIPRI figures suggest. The data understate the extent of technology transfer in the international arms trade, Mr Mussington argues, because they fail to take account of offsets and local production under license. The arms industry as a whole has becoming harder to police thanks to the emergence of a 'second tier' of producers, capable of producing intermediate versions of the advanced countries' weapon systems. Such producers range from traditional customers of Western arms companies, such as Turkey and Israel, to 'rogue nations' like North Korea, whose arms exports were viewed by the West as highly destabilising. The second-tier producers improved their position by supplying to both Iran and Iraq during their 10-year war, although they had to give ground in Middle Eastern markets to the leading Western companies in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf conflict. Western efforts to persuade Russia to practise self-restraint are likely to be countered by accusations of hypocrisy, when the West is engaged in a vigorous export drive of its own. Heavy-handed discrimination might simply force middle-ranking countries to develop weapon systems that were outside any international system of regulation, the study maintains, citing the examples of South Africa and India. It calls for second-tier producers to be drawn into a new system of controls on the export of 'weapon-specific' technologies, which do not block their chances of industrial development, or their access to a reasonable supply of weaponry.

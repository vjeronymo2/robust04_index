			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (12): The address is an asset now - In Scotland, partnership is transforming a deprived area of Paisley / James Buxton has seen the scowl leave the face of Ferguslie Park IT USED to be said in the west of Scotland that anyone who put an address in Ferguslie Park on their job application form would instantly have it rejected. This housing estate in Paisley, 10 miles west of Glasgow, had until very recently a reputation for being among the worst in Scotland. The unemployment rate among its 6,000 population was around 40 per cent; many of the people lived in poverty and squalor; and there were exceptionally high levels of violence, housebreaking and assaults. Two years ago, the most powerful impression a visitor to Ferguslie Park came away with was of the wretched housing: even the best of the dark-grey harled houses and flats looked damp and run-down, while many were derelict and boarded up. Some of the open spaces were literally knee-deep in refuse. The few shops were shuttered and daubed with graffiti. The wide roadways with ample verges created an impression of emptiness and neglect, which was reflected in the sullen faces of the inhabitants. Suddenly, Ferguslie Park looks different. Hundreds of new houses built of yellow brick have sprung up in one part of the estate. Some are owned by housing associations and housing co-operatives; others have been bought by owner occupiers from private developers, an astonishing development for this area. The passers-by in Ferguslie Park are often friendly and helpful. These physical changes are the most obvious fruits of a concerted attack on the evils of Ferguslie Park. In 1988, the estate was chosen as one of four very deprived urban areas for a new approach to urban renewal by the Scottish Office entitled 'New Life for Urban Scotland'. This programme, whose other projects are the Castle-milk estate in Glasgow, the Wester Hailes area of Edinburgh and the Whitfield estate in Dundee, is aimed at bringing new leadership to urban renewal in Scotland, which was previously led by the Scottish Development Agency. Its key features are: partnership between different agencies, an emphasis on involving local people and the engagement as far as possible of the private sector. Ferguslie Park is the smallest of the four projects. Started in the 1920s, it suffered almost at once from the decline of the Paisley spinning industry. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the ill-fated Linwood car plant lived and died on its doorstep. The Ferguslie Park Partnership, headed by Mr David Dickson, a Scottish Office official, is implementing a multi-faceted strategy, of which the improvement of housing and the environment is only one part. It includes policies aimed at getting the people of the estate into jobs, improving education, making the area safer from crime and tackling ill health and poverty. About 45 people now work in the partnership offices in the centre of the estate. It is a one-stop shop in which representatives of government and local agencies offer their services, ranging from Scottish Homes (the government's housing agency in Scotland, which funds housing associations) to the Department of Employment which operates a job centre. Seven of the 20 places on the board of the partnership are held by local representatives. The emphasis, explains Mr Wylie Cunningham, of the partnership, is on 'avoiding a top-down approach to urban regeneration, and ensuring that the people of the community are consulted and involved all along.' In the past three years, about Pounds 40m has been spent. The biggest single expenditure has been on the Glencoats area, where between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m has been spent, of which Pounds 12.5m came from the private sector, much of it by a joint venture of Miller Homes and Bellway in building private houses. About 1,000 of the 2,500 houses or flats on the estate have been, or are being, renovated, with the bulk of the work taking place in the past year. Development will now move out to other areas in the 10-year project. But away from Glencoats it becomes clear how much more there is to do. A grim shopping parade at Top End is largely unchanged, and one sees a burnt-out car and supermarket trolleys lying in the road. But much of the refuse has gone. Although the building work is the most obvious evidence of the project, much of the work of the partnership has been on the 'software' side of training and persuading employers, including the building contractors working on the site, to employ people from the estate. The partnership claims credit for finding full-time or temporary jobs for almost 1,000 people in the past three years, although it is reluctant to put forward a headline figure to compare with the original 40 per cent unemployment, because of the difficulties of definition. A number of projects have been launched with local schools to improve education and, in the words of Mr Cunningham, to 'convince the youngsters of the estate that being unemployed is not the norm and that there is work out there.' A new road has been pushed through to the Phoenix buiness park, which has been built on the ruins of Linwood; and the estate benefits from being close to Glasgow airport, expanding as international flights to North America develop. As Ferguslie Park's image begins to improve, its location increasingly becomes an asset. The partnership denies that effecting a turnaround in the estate's fortunes was in any way easy, but it does acknowledge that the estate's small size has been an advantage. The burden of criticism recently voiced about the New Life for Urban Scotland projects, by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland, is that the schemes are excellent as far as they go but that they only involve 100,000 people and that there ought to be be more of them, under a comprehensive funding and delivery mechanism. The Ferguslie Park experience suggests that success is within reach there, and that the experience should be repeated.</p>

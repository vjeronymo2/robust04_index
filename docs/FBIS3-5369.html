			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The February 17 shock  brigades of scientists and technicians dispatched to different  sectors of the national economy of Korea have succeeded in  important researches.    Last year they introduced some 700 items of the achievements  of science and technology such as new coal-cutting method, rice  harvester combine and developer for the electronic duplicating  machine, thus making a sizable contribution to the development  of the national economy and the improvement of the people's  standard of living.    The scientists and technicians dispatched to the Sunchon  District coal mining complex introduced a method of cutting coal  layers downwards so that the coal output per cutting face could  be raised 1.5-2 times. A coal mine under the complex produced  an extra 210,000 tons of coal last year by introducing this  method.    Those who are active at the Pyongyang thermal power complex  resolved some 40 problems of science and technology in raising  the combustion rate of boilers and keeping a steady rate of  electric production to increase the annual generating capacity  by 200 million kwh.    Those dispatched to the sector of light industry built a  production process of super-plastic material, new shoe moulds  and lasts so as to diversify the variety and increase  productivity.    The February 17 shock brigades of scientists and technicians  have solved a large number of scientific and technical problems  of great importance to the chuche orientation, modernization and  scientization of the national economy. Among them are  note-worthy successes such as development of 300 kinds of micro  and hi-fi electronic elements and NC devices, completion of the  method of laser heating and massproduction of precision alloy  steel and micro alloy steel.    They also solved many problems in such advanced science and  technology as cell engineering, genetic engineering and  ultracryogenics.    Thanks to their activities in recent years, the remote  control and computerization of production processes have reached  a higher stage at many industrial establishments including the  Hwanghae iron and steel complex and the Puryong alloy steel  complex, and many coal and ore mines nearly doubled the  production.    The shock brigades, which play a big role in developing the  national economy, were organised on February 17, 1978 by dear  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Comrade Kim Chong-il laid down the policy of dispatching  scientists and technicians to work sites in order to solve  problems arising in production and actively develop new  technologies in reliance on the collective strength of the  producers, and took all necessary measures including the action  programme, guidance system and supply conditions for the shock  brigades.    Last year, he dispatched such shock brigades to 19 new  important units of the national economy and provided them with  good conditions for scientific research.    The shock brigades total more than 60 and involve some 8,000  competent scientists and technicians.</p>

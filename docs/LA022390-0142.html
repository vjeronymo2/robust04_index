			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> POLL REFEREES: Rep. Robert K. Dornan, a veteran monitor of seven foreign  elections, says independent observers can make or break public confidence in  election results. . . . In Panama and in the Philippines, U.S. observers'  reports of widespread fraud led to governments' being overturned, he noted. Now  awaiting permission to enter Nicaragua for Sunday's elections, Dornan says:  "The only thing more enjoyable than voting yourself is to watch other people  vote when it gives them freedom for the first time."A16 Dana Parsons and  Kristina Lindgren  </P></p>

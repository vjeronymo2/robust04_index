			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: Mark Murphy and Eurodance - Dance If you knew the new-dance scene but not who choreographed Mark Murphy's Headshot, you might well assume that it had been made across the Channel. But if you didn't know the new-dance scene, you wouldn't think that Headshot was a dance anyway. The dancers of Mark Murphy's V-Tol Company, performing the 70-minute Headshot at the Place, London, last weekend, are attractive and fit, but dancing is hardly what he asks them to do. Though his choreography is authoritative, it is much too important to have mere dance on its mind. Why should it concern itself with petty things like showing you how these dancers respond to music; or what kinds of rhythm and phrasing they can develop; or the degree of virtuoso articulation of which they are capable? All that has been out of date for years. In this respect, Murphy is like scores of choreographers on the new-dance scene. The two things that make Headshot unusual are first, that in one or two moments he reveals an instinct to make these dancers (of whom he is one) really move commandingly across the stage, turning and/or jumping; and second, that otherwise it has been very smartly organised as a perfect example of Eurodance - ie non-dance physical theatre, full of aggression and irony, with deliberately 'controversial' flashes of sociology. Men and women get hit, brutalised, and shot by one another. Every aspiration to tenderness or romance is to no avail. As for the episodes of brutality, when they are fitted to rock or jazz music, they actually start to look droll, even hip. The mixture of elegance and violence is part of the work's deliberate irony. This sour world view - albeit despondent and cynical - has been expressed with apparent conviction by a host of cross-Channel choreographers: notably Pina Bausch. It has even produced a few works of art. But Headshot does not appear sincere, or like an attempt to make art. It is a mere exercise in audience manipulation, in slick modishness. Murphy has mastered every trick  -even the cliched Kamikaze jump now widely known as the Eurocrash, in which the dancer lands bang on the floor, rolls over, picks himself up, and dives splat back on to the ground. Yet I suspect that Murphy's dance instincts are more innocent and lively than Headshot would have us believe. Though there is very little here that should be dignified by the name of dance, that little has a sweep, an attack and a pleasure in precisely controlled energy that are all welcome. But so what? Does Murphy have the courage to follow his dance instincts when the prevailing trends from the Continent blow so strongly in the opposite direction?</p>

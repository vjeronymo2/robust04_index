			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EXXON CALLS ALASKA CLEANUP A SUCCESS;  </P> <P> OIL SPILL: DESPITE SOME CRUDE REMAINING ON ONCE-PRISTINE BEACHES, ITS CREWS ARE  GOING HOME.  </P> <P> Exxon today declared its Alaska oil spill cleanup a success and said it is  demobilizing the cleanup crew after a second summer of work, despite some crude  oil remaining in the once-pristine environment.  </P> <P> "In general, the shorelines look good," Exxon cleanup manager Otto Harrison  said Tuesday night at the final cleanup operations meeting of the year.  </P> <P> "That does not mean that all the oil is gone or that every bit of shoreline  looks good," Harrison said, predicting that winter storms will pick up where  Exxon left off, leaving oiled beaches in better shape when Exxon returns next  spring to survey the condition of the shores.  </P> <P> Some work crews were taken off beaches today and all others were to be finished  for the year by Friday. Harrison said Exxon will leave a skeleton staff in  Alaska over the winter and the company will reopen its Alaska cleanup office  next April.  </P> <P> A standing-room-only crowd packed a city auditorium to hear Exxon's last formal  pronouncements about the summer cleanup.  </P> <P> State officials reserved comment and let Exxon have the spotlight during the  meeting. Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper scheduled his own news conference for today,  but commented that "there's still a lot to do."  </P> <P> The tanker Exxon Valdez hit a charted reef in March, 1989, and broke open,  spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound and the Gulf  of Alaska, coating 1,200 miles of shore with crude, ruining fishing and killing  tens of thousands of sea birds, eagles, otters and other animals.  </P> <P> The spill was the worst in American history and triggered the greatest cleanup  mobilization ever mounted for an oil spill.  </P> <P> "Everything that could have been done in a sound environmental manner has been  done," Harrison said. "Fishing, tourism and biological restoration have been  good in 1990. Debris has been picked up. Tar mats have been removed."  </P> <P> Harrison noted that fishermen this summer caught a record number of salmon in  Prince William Sound. He noted that tourists returned and he said no animals  were killed by oil this summer.  </P> <P> However, Harrison acknowledged that, 18 months after the spill, some beaches  look worse because Exxon pulled apart storm berms above the high tide line in  order to expose buried oil.  </P></p>

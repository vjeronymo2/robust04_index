			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Mr. Golestaneh, deputy director of the Ministry of  Mines and Metals' Office of Mines Exploration, announced in  Tehran: Since the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan more  than 90 percent of the government's mines have been transferred  to cooperatives, legal entities and real individuals and  relevant industries. Based on the same report, in the first six  months of the current year [21 March-23 September 1993] 338,000  tons of ores valued at $22 million and various types of  concentrated metals valued at $320 million have been exported.  In the same interview Golestaneh added that the number of  exploitable mines in the country increased from 800 at the  beginning of the First Five-Year Plan to 1,400 mines at the  present time.    In this interview Mr. Golestaneh did not announce what mines  were transferred to the nongovernment sector. In recent years it  has been the policy of the Islamic Republic to auction the  nation's mines without proper planning to make real use of the  nation's natural resources, which are considered the wealth of  our people.</p>

The two countries--the former Soviet Union and China--used  to  be of great importance to North Korea if not for providing it  with economic assistance, then for the moral support they  afforded it. These two countries gave North Korea the feeling  that it was part of a greater cause, or a greater game, namely  the now extinct game of communism.    What brings the long-term or continued existence of the  North  Korean regime specially under question is the fact that it is  surrounded on all sides by a number of countries with dynamic  economies by world standards; countries which are continuing to  experience growth despite the debilitating and lingering world  economic recession. Even Vietnam with its former moribund  economy is registering great economic improvements and  attracting foreign investments.    Therefore, if the realities in East Asia are any indication,  the North Korean regime won't exist for long in its present  political isolationist form. But the change or changes in the  North Korean regime will not come, no matter how much the  pressure from without or within, as long as its present  leadership is alive. President Kim Il-song is a well  established political institution in that country. He is, and  will always be, the liberator of the "fatherland" from Japanese  and American colonialisms.    This latter qualification, the fact of being a political  institution and a liberator also applies to President Fidel  Castro of Cuba. The two are leaders with unshaking unwavering  popular support behind them which no amount of foreign  propaganda can weaken. The past heroic struggles of these two  leaders for the "liberation" of their countries are reasons  enough for their continued rule, just as long as they live.    As far as North Korea's other half, i.e. South Korea, is  concerned, there have been tension and sporadic friction between  the two, but everything considered they have managed to bear one  another and coexist for some half a century.    But now, all of a sudden, it has been about a year maybe,  that the question of North Korea's nuclear arms possession has  become a hot, menacing and destabilizing issue. Despite being a  topic of frontpage controversy and accusations, Washington has  not given any concrete proof on what it claims and the whole  thing seems to have been based on conjecture.    The whole crisis surrounding the possession of nuclear arms  by North Korea looks like a continued and artificial one. And  there can be a number of reasons why the Americans are raising  tension in the Korean Peninsula, and for that matter in East  Asia, and in the meantime worrying everyone. Japan seems to  have taken the whole deal seriously and is deeply concerned.    Washington is subjecting the North Korean regime to so much  pressure, it is good Pyongyang has not gone berserk. And if it  goes berserk it should not surprise anyone. The idea of  regarding the application of sanctions by the Americans and  their allies as a "declaration of war" might be an indication of  that.    Washington is putting pressure in North Korea to open up its  nuclear sites to inspection to make sure Pyongyang is no threat  at all and that it is one hundred percent helpless. But to the  North Korean regime, the idea of possessing nuclear arms is  tantamount to prestige and a means of having its existence  recognized.    Therefore, no matter how much the threat of force and  application of economic sanctions, North Korea will not open up  its nuclear sites to inspection. For what is North Korea in the  absence of even the perceived possession of nuclear arms?</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 1 DEAD IN ORANGE COUNTY CRASH  </P> <P> Orange County had one traffic death during the five-day Christmas holiday  period that ended at midnight Tuesday, law officials said today. Officers said  the Christmas-traffic fatality rate this year is obviously low given that the  county has more than 2 million residents.  </P> <P> The Orange County coroner's office said the sole traffic death during the  five-day period was on Saturday. Deputy William King said a 19-year-old  Fountain Valley youth lost control of his car while southbound on the San Diego  Freeway near the Magnolia Street on-ramp. King said the car struck a call box,  and the driver, Major J. Johnson, was fatally injured.  </P> <P> Despite thousands of vehicles on the county's freeways, highways and surface  streets, there were relatively few major traffic accidents during the holiday  period, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department and the California  Highway Patrol.  </P></p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Castlegate chief gets five years Mr Roy Wharton, the former chairman of Castlegate Securities, a Reading-based loan management company, was yesterday sentenced to five years' imprisonment for fraudulently mishandling Pounds 35m of investors' funds. He was convicted last month at Oxford Crown Court of two charges of fraudulent trading. Having given assurances about the security of investments, Mr Wharton pursued a speculative strategy which meant investors bore most of the risk while he reaped the financial benefits.</p>

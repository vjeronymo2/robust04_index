			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: EC cool to calls for end to arms ban APPEALS to lift the Bosnian arms embargo found little sympathy among European Community leaders and foreign ministers in Copenhagen last night. President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia made an urgent plea to the EC to lift the United Nations arms embargo so that the Bosnian Moslems could better defend themselves against Serbs and Croats. Chancellor Helmut Kohl later tried to win over other EC leaders to the idea at a dinner of EC leaders, after he was reported to have received a letter from US President Bill Clinton reiterating US sympathy for such a move. Mr Izetbegovic, who flew to Copenhagen on the opening day of the EC summit, renewed his often-sounded appeal on the arms embargo at a meeting with a 'troika' of EC foreign ministers. But he received no encouragement from the 'troika' - the foreign ministers of Britain, Denmark and Belgium representing the former, present and next presidency of the EC. Chancellor Kohl pressed his fellow EC leaders on the subject in what diplomats described as tense and heated debate as the EC struggled with the failure so far of its efforts to resolve the war in war in Bosnia. Mr Kohl was reported to have run into tough opposition from countries such as Britain and France which are worried about the safety of their troops serving with the UN humanitarian mission in Bosnia. Diplomats said Mr Kohl had received a letter in Copenhagen from President Clinton reviving White House suggestions that the UN arms embargo should be lifted so the Bosnian Moslems could defend themselves. Mr Izetbegovic said: 'We request that the arms embargo be lifted to import a limited quantity of defensive weapons.' But Mr Niels Petersen, Danish foreign minister, said: 'In my view it is not a sound idea to lift the weapons embargo; it would require a Security Council resolution, which is not forthcoming, it would lead to more fighting, and there would be great danger that United Nations forces would have to be withdrawn.'</p>

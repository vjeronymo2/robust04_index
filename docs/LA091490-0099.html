			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ACC APPROVES MOVE TO INVITE FLORIDA STATE TO BECOME MEMBER  </P> <P> The Atlantic Coast Conference voted Thursday to invite Florida State to join  the eight-team league.  </P> <P> Officials said the details of membership will be communicated to Florida State  over the next few days, but no deadline has been set for a decision by the  school.  </P> <P> "Our conference has deliberated at length about expansion," ACC Commissioner  Gene Corrigan said. "The process has been comprehensive and thorough. We feel  comfortable this decision is in the best interests of the member institutions  of the ACC."  </P> <P> Corrigan said Florida State had been an attractive candidate from the outset.  "The more we learned about the institution, the more we felt they were a  natural fit," he said. "Their academic and athletic programs are nationally  recognized, and their addition would be a plus to our conference in every way.  It would allow us to continue in a leadership position in intercollegiate  athletics."  </P> <P> ACC members are Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, North  Carolina State, Clemson and Georgia Tech.  </P></p>

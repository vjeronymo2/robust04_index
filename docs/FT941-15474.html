			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Murdoch in temporary move to Hong Kong Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corporation, plans to move temporarily to Hong Kong next month to oversee a reorganisation of Star TV, his troubled Asian satellite television company. Since Mr Murdoch's USDollars 525m purchase of 63.6 per cent of the broadcaster six months ago, Star has encountered difficulties in three of its main markets - Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. Industry experts say Star is running at an annual loss of between USDollars 60m and USDollars 80m. It is not known how long Mr Murdoch plans to live in the colony but a house has been acquired for his use. Mr Murdoch prefers his acquisitions to be close at hand. He moved from Australia to the UK in the late 1960s after he bought the News of the World and settled in the US in the 1980s after a string of media acquisitions. Mr Gary Davey, Star's third chief executive in six months, was appointed eight days ago. He has said a priority will be to improve relations with Wharf Cable - which is meant to transmit Star's TV programmes in Hong Kong - and China. Wharf began its cable TV operation in Hong Kong at the end of October last year. As part of its exclusive cable licence, it is required to carry Star. However, the two companies have not been able to agree terms and the government may have to be called in to broker a deal. In China, officials are intensely suspicious of western media companies. An article by Mr Murdoch in The Times last September, where he wrote of the threat posed by satellite television to totalitarian regimes, caused concern in Beijing. China has since said unlicensed satellite dishes will be banned and is pushing ahead with cable networks in major cities. Cable TV, because it is a terrestrial system, is easier to control than an unregulated extra-terrestrial broadcaster.</p>

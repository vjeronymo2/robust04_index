			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xia Jun (1115 0193) and XINHUA </F> reporter Chao Wen (6872 2429)]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Apr (XINHUA) -- Wen Jiabao, alternate  member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of  the CPC Central Committee, today pointed out at a discussion by  some delegates attending the eighth national conference on  experimental areas for rural reform: Rural reform, a major  component of establishing a socialist market economic structure,  is extremely important for our country's reform of the economic  structure as a whole. We should further deepen rural reform  according to the general objectives of establishing a socialist  market economic structure.    Since the experimental areas for rural reform were  designated  in 1987, tremendous achievements have been made in  institutionalizing and standardizing the results of rural reform  and in exploring some major issues in this regard.    Wen Jiabao said: After the Third Plenary Session of the  party's 11th Central Committee, rural areas took the lead in  carrying out reform, scoring achievements attracting world  attention. Reform effectively promoted the development of  agriculture and the rural economy, bringing about historic  changes in the countryside. At the same time, this also laid a  foundation for the reform of the national economy as a whole.  As the national economy is making the transition to a socialist  market economy, new requirements are set for deepening rural  reform. This calls for us to continue our arduous exploration  in this regard. Compared with the past, the rural reform at the  present stage has the following new features: 1) Rural reform  touches more and more on deep-seated problems; 2) rural reform  interweaves more and more with urban reform. This requires us  to be more careful in making plans, choosing times, and  determining the pace of reform. In deepening rural reform, we  should not only define our objectives and tasks but also pay  close attention to methods. We have gained a lot of experiences  in rural reform over the past decade and more, which we should  carry forward and develop.    Wen Jiabao pointed out: Our rural areas are in a  transforming stage from the current level of sufficient food and  clothing to a better-off level of moderate prosperity and from  traditional to modern agriculture. The development of  agriculture and the rural economy is now faced with two  extremely arduous tasks: 1) It is necessary to ensure the  adequate supply of farm products; and 2) it is necessary to  ensure the steady increase of peasants' incomes. To achieve  these two objectives, we must uphold and deepen rural reform  according to the general plan and requirements for the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure. The  current major tasks in deepening rural reform are: First, while  stabilizing the household contract responsibility system with  remuneration linked to output, we should promote the rational  flow of production factors and the optimum distribution of rural  economic resources. Second, we should vigorously develop  professional market intermediate organizations and connect rural  household production and management with the market in various  ways. Third, we should strengthen the government's  macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture and  effectively support and protect agriculture.    Wen Jiabao stressed: In the course of developing a socialist  market economy in the countryside, we should strengthen the  building of basic-level rural organizations and the development  of a spiritual civilization and the legal system. We should  "grasp two links at the same time and pay equal attention to  both" and develop a material and a spiritual civilization  simultaneously. This is something we should not overlook in  doing research on rural reform and development. He called on  comrades who are engaged in rural work and research on rural  policy to strengthen their spirit and confidence and to make a  fresh contribution to rural reform and development.</p>

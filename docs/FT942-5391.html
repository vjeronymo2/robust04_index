			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Magnet loses attraction On going through my investments, I find I am the holder of 300 'non-voting A convertible shares' in Magnet Group plc. These were issued in July 1989 and I think were related to the management buy-out that occurred at that time. Are they worth anything or should I consign them to the dustbin? Our investigation shows that Magnet Group changed its name to Airedale but that these shares are now worthless and, therefore, available to you only as a loss to offset against gains elsewhere.

All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

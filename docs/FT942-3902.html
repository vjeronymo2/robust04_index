			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Shortage of top talent willing to move A recent international survey* conducted by two Harvard University professors found that fewer than half the corporate participants were training their executives for international assignments, even though 94 per cent said such expertise would be of vital importance to the company in the future. Instead, they relied heavily on recruitment from outside for vacancies abroad. That and similar trends revealed in the research mean the 'global executive' should be able to name his price. The survey for Amrop Partners, the international executive recruitment firm, was based on interviews with 1,000 senior executives in 30 countries, including Australia, and conducted by Robin Ely at John F. Kennedy School of Government and Janice McCormick at Harvard Business School. It found that in general there is an acute shortage of internationally-mobile managers, and that the problem is most severe for multinationals attempting to operate in fast-developing regions such as south-east Asia or eastern Europe. Only 35 per cent of respondents said their companies offered access to international management courses, while fewer than half provided opportunities to develop language skills. Half those surveyed said fear of losing touch with the company's central activities made them reluctant to go abroad. Financial considerations seem to be the strongest motivator for people to work abroad. The three top 'strategic inducements' were relocation assistance, a comparable benefits package and an attractive expatriate financial package. Australia was the only area in which the success rate in attracting international executives outstripped the perceived need by a very wide margin (over 20 percentage points) - perhaps because of the sandy beaches and sunny climate. *The New International Executive, Amrop International/Harvard University.</p>

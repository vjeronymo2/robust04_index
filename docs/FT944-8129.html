			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Brussels warns on German power deal The European Commission is threatening to seek an injunction to prevent work starting on a DM400m (Pounds 164m) German power station contract, following complaints of unfair competition. Germany has been identified by the European Union as one of the worst offenders for failing to apply directives designed to ensure equal opportunities for foreign companies bidding for public sector contracts. The Commission, separately, has started legal proceedings against the Bonn government in the European Court for failing to incorporate properly into German legislation two of eight EU public works directives. Brussels is also understood to be considering court action against Germany for failing to apply four other directives correctly. It has asked Veag, the recently privatised eastern German electricity company, to reopen the bidding to supply a DM400m steam turbine for a DM5bn power station at Lippendorf, near Leipzig in Saxony. The contract was awarded to a German subsidiary of Swiss-Swedish group Asea Brown Boveri. However,the German offshoot of General Electric of the US has complained that it was 'unfairly excluded from the final round of price negotiations'. The Commission, which believes tender procedures were unfairly applied, has warned it may seek a European Court injunction to prevent work starting unless the bidding is reopened. The issue may be complicated by GE's failure last month to persuade the Berlin district court that the relevant EU public works directives should have applied, although these had not been transposed into German law when the contract was awarded. This judgment is likely to be challenged by the Commission. GE told the Berlin court that the invitation to tender for the turbine contract had been tailored by Veag to favour the European companies ABB and Siemens, which traditionally had been treated by the German power sector as 'court suppliers'. It claimed Veag had changed its requirements after putting the contract out to tender. Ms Patricia Sherman, counsel to GE's international trade department, said yesterday: 'As we found out in the past in trying to enter the German market, there will always be technical reasons for not awarding the contract.' Veag, which was recently sold to a German energy consortium led by RWE, Preussen Elektra and Bayernwerk, said it had adopted an 'open' attitude in its negotiations with GE. Mr Gerhard Braunlein, of Veag's legal department, said GE failed to win the contract 'for technical reasons' and its bid had been considerably higher than ABB's. The Commission has increased its efforts to ensure the public works directives are applied properly. It is currently taking legal action in nearly 250 cases of alleged breaches of the directives, double the number of cases being pursued at the same time last year.</p>

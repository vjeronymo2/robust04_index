			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: Gidon Kremer - Queen Elizabeth Hall Beyond his worldwide career as a soloist, violinist Gidon Kremer has been running his own chamber music festival in tiny Lockenhaus (Austria) for ten summers now, and on Thursday he brought some regular colleagues with him to the Queen Elizabeth Hall under this new label. Their music was Messiaen's Quatuor pour la fin du temps and Schubert's great Quartet in G, D887; the friends were the clarinettist Sabine Meyer (once a famous bone of contention between Karajan and his Berlin Philharmonic) and the pianist Oleg Maisenberg, just for Messiaen, and three notable young strings for Schubert. Though Kremer led both works, he was at pains neither to domineer nor even to show off a little. He simply applied himself to the ensemble music with intense sympathy, and immensely polished technique. And so did they all. Composed and premiered in a prisoner-of-war camp, Messiaen's seminal Quatuor wears its heart - and its devoutly Catholic soul - on its sleeve, but with less calculated flamboyance than much of his later music. The rapt, angular dance movements are swift, but hardly virtuoso stuff (Kremer's team were if anything a bit mild with them). The real challenges are in the hypnotically slow solo movements, where any fault in the elevated line will be cruelly exposed. Kremer and the cellist Clemens Hagen sustained their twin 'Louanges' faultlessly, and in the 'Abme des oiseaux' Miss Meyer's bated-breath pianissimo and subtle rhythmic spring were astonishing. The Schubert quartet was a marvel of lucidity, but it should have been more. Doubtless in the interest of delicate precision, Kremer &amp; co. (Hagen, Annette Bik - another original member of the Hagen Quartet - and Catherine Metz) mostly chose tempi at the bottom end of the plausible range and stuck to them. Everything - everything, including every possible repeat - had a lovely, silvery ring, at considerable cost to the black dramatic thrust of the whole work. If its most jagged junctures don't sound disruptive and dismaying, one isn't hearing it properly. Of all performers, it was odd of Kremer to let that be smoothed away. I wondered whether he wasn't deferring too modestly to the Hagen ethos: those young Salzburg players made their name early by precocious, ultra-educated assurance, but they have never been gutsy - which is what this last Schubert quartet absolutely requires.</p>

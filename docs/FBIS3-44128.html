			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African  National Union-Patriotic Front], has begun a nationwide  restructuring exercise in the run-up to the election of  provincial officials and the full national party congress later  this year. But the exercise has uncovered divisions and  personality clashes and rivalries within the party at the local  level. One of the worst scrabbles has been in Masvingo  Province, where rival government ministers and their followers  have been involved in a good two months of mudslinging, but now  the party top brass is stepping in to heal the rift, as Rachel  Rawlings reports from Harare:    [Begin Rawlings recording] The vice president, Simon  Muzenda,  has called for an end to what he called this nonsense about  factions and ordered the two sides to sit down and thrash out  their differences. The bickering is between Minister of Mines  Eddison Zvobgo and Provincial Governor Josiah Hungwe, supported  by Minister of Higher Education Stanislaus Mudenge. They and  their followers have been battling for control of ZANU in  Masvingo since October, accusing each other of being political  (?upstarts) bent on hijacking the party.    Mr. Muzenda's peace effort didn't appear to get off to a  good  start. At yesterday's meeting governor Hungwe's supporters  turned up in force, but only managed to [words indistinct]  faction. There are rumors in the Mashonaland West. A false rape  charge brought against the local party candidate could have been  politically motivated, while Manicaland Provincial congress had  to be postponed because some delegates claimed local party  elections had been rigged. In the eastern town of Mutare, the  party restructuring exercise was postponed because of apathy  amongst eligible delegates, and there have also been problems in  Matabeleland.    Despite the widespread local bickering, the party's  hierarchy  has until recently made little comment. It appears Mr. Muzenda  who comes from Masvingo, had intervened in a row there to  prevent a coordinated attack from provincial level against the  national hierarchy. There were reports of a secret meeting  between one of the Masvingo factions and a local politician from  Matabeleland, where they discussed lack of development in the  two provinces, and the formation of a common front to push the  government to provide more resources. Mr. Muzenda criticized  such talk as very dangerous, saying what it really means is the  government, which you are part of, has done nothing and,  therefore, should be removed. It appears the party doesn't mind  local scrabbles, but when dissents threaten those at the top,  something has to be done. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen has sworn in  banker Marcel Laniado as new president of the National Council  of Modernization, Conam. This institution will oversee the  privatization process. It is expected that with this  appointment Ecuador will embark on an aggressive state  modernization process by reactivating the sale of state-run  companies. This process lost steam in the past few months, as  Conam has not had a president since mid-1993.    Laniado said that a common effort must be made to achieve  our  nation's social and economic well-being. Laniado noted it is  impossible to develop unless all the community's sectors  participate. He thus stressed: I invite you all to cooperate.    The government will submit the rules of the State  Modernization Law approved in December 1993 by the Congress  after an eight-month study.    Conam was created in 1992 at the conservative government's  initiative. But is has been in serious crisis since the  resignation of its board of directors last year.    [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2335 GMT on 4 April, in a  Quito-datelined report on the same topic, adds: "Finance  Minister Cesar Robalino announced that the first state-run  company to be privatized will be the telecommunications company  (Emetel), a public sector giant. Defense Minister Jose Gallardo  gave the assurance that while companies operated by the Armed  Forces are diverse, the military will agree to any required  sales. Also in line to be privatized are important petroleum  and energy companies considered strategic by previous  governments."]</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Super-Bere, socialist with a steady hand: France's new PM has the best left credentials for right economic rectitude THE ARRIVAL of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as France's new prime minister, signals a shift back towards the right and solid endorsement of the policy of competitive disinflation he has pursued as finance and economy minister for much of the past eight years. It also marks President Francois Mitterrand's formal acceptance that the attempt to introduce a fresh elan to government, with the nomination of Mrs Edith Cresson last May, has not worked. Mr Beregovoy can be expected to follow policies very similar to those of Mr Michel Rocard, who preceded Mrs Cresson as prime minister, and with whom Mr Beregovoy gets on very well. So, in the space of just under a year, the government has turned full circle. Yet anybody glancing for the first time at the life history of the genial Mr Beregovoy might be forgiven for thinking he would be the last man who might be expected to promote liberal economic policies at the head of a Socialist government. He was the only truly working class member of the Cresson administration, otherwise dominated by alumni of the elite civil service colleges, and rich bourgeois Socialists, dubbed the gauche caviar by satirical newspapers. Mr Beregovoy is anything but that. Of Ukrainian descent, the 66-year-old prime minister started work as a milling machine operator, then a railwayman, and made his way into politics as a management assistant at Gaz de France, the state utility. His formal educational qualifications are limited. He got a certificate in metal working from technical college and did not go to high school. Yet as finance minister on and off since 1984, Mr Beregovoy more than made up for his lack of grounding in the conventional elite by skilfully packing his private office with some of the finest minds in the public administration. He will undoubtedly pick a heavyweight staff for the Matignon. Mr Beregovoy's success in holding to his policy of firm budgetary and monetary control for so long has made him more closely identified with France's economic health - in foreign investors' minds - than any of his European finance ministry counterparts in relation to their own economies. The results are, as Mr Beregovoy never ceases to remind the public, much lower-than-average inflation, respectable growth, and an economy that has so far escaped a formal recession. The importance of 'Super-Bere', as he is nicknamed, is underlined by the gyrations that used to hit the capital markets during sporadic rumours of his resignation, and the corresponding strength of the markets as rumours of his promotion grew in recent days. So President Francois Mitterrand's choice of Mr Beregovoy puts the country in the hands of someone with a steady hand as well as undeniable Socialist credentials. A secondary advantage is that Mr Beregovoy has no presidential ambitions, one of the factors that led to the falling out between Mr Mitterrand and the ambitious and effective Mr Rocard. This will also avoid further splits in a Socialist party already riddled with rivalry over how to repair its electoral disasters and who will one day replace Mr Mitterrand. It might seem surprising that Mr Mitterrand hesitated for several days before appointing Mr Beregovoy. One reason might be the president's annoyance at the fact that Mr Beregovoy prepared his own ministerial team before even being nominated - and without consulting Mr Mitterrand. What is more important, Mr Mitterrand has had to balance his need for Mr Beregovoy's skills against the demands of an important Socialist party faction, led by Mr Lionel Jospin, education minister in the Cresson government, for a relaxation in Mr Beregovoy's policies of monetary and budgetary rigour. As Mr Mitterrand's chief adviser from 1981-82 he has the socialist credentials to steer through the party's sometimes conflicting demands. The Jospinists argue that less budgetary rigour would help curb unemployment, one of the Socialists' biggest political problems, and to stimulate the economy. Mrs Cresson shares those views, which is one reason her relations with the former finance minister - who often outmanoeuvred his old boss - were strained. When questioned by critics, Mr Beregovoy has always come up with the same answer: he will never devalue the franc. Mr Mitterrand has had to come to terms with the fact that his new prime minister does not plan to abandon that rigour for political, or any other, reasons. Safest hands take the controls, page 14</p>

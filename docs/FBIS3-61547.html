			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vera Romanova: ``On the Eve of the Election the </F> Presidium of the RAS Is Displaying Inertia. Only `Yabloko' Is  Prepared To Think About Basic Science'']    [Text] Perhaps, the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) has  become one of the few organizations that are not taking an  active part in the election campaign. Of course, individual  representatives of it are members of various parties and blocks.  But here they are directing attention not at all to the  interests of their colleagues. As for candidates directly from  the RAS, it as a public organization does not have the right to  nominate them.    In principle such a situation is very convenient for the  leadership of the academy, which does not tire of repeating at  every opportunity that the RAS is far from politics.  Nevertheless the academy simply needs to have "its own" people  in the new parliament. In its present financial situation and  given the uncertainty of the future of many institutes and  associates it is important as never before to have a lobby in  the legislative body of power, and not simply good relations  with its representatives. Therefore, the traditional  conservatism of the RAS and the reluctance to take part in the  political struggle in this case exceed a certain bound and can  be interpreted as passivity, which subsequently can adversely  affect its fate.    Of course, no one is making an appeal to break laws and to  nominate candidates from the academy. However, the members of  the Presidium, who are very tempted, cannot but know of other  possibilities. An attempt was also made to use one of them.    At the meeting at the Institute of General and Inorganic  Chemistry of the RAS Vice President Oleg Nefedov and Chief  Scientific Secretary of the RAS Igor Makarov presented to the  associates the candidate from the Universitetskiy District of  the capital for the State Duma, Vice Premier of the Government  of Moscow and Chairman of the Science Council of Moscow  Aleksandr Braginskiy. The 45-year-old candidate (in recent times  he has been known as a person, who was in the captivity of the  supporters of Rutskoy and Khasbulatov during the events of 3-4  October) has already done much for the RAS. In many respects the  adoption of the program ``Science for Moscow,'' under which the  city authorities are financing projects that are of interest for  them, depended on him. This program has already been in effect  for several months and has yielded a profit both for scientists  and for the capital. Moreover, owing to the efforts of Aleksandr  Braginskiy the rent for a number of scientific institutions was  fixed at the level of the operating expenses, preferential terms  for the payment for electric power were introduced, several  scientists received apartments, and new health care institutions  were put into operation.    The channeling of state budget assets not only into ``the  reform of the judicial and law enforcement system and the army  and the support of culture,'' but also into ``the strengthening  of basic science and education'' is mentioned in Braginskiy's  election program. Therefore, such a member of the State Duma is  very important for the presidium of the RAS, although he will  devote not all of his time to the defending of the interests of  the academy. For the present it is not clear how in the future  the RAS will support Aleksandr Braginskiy.    However, one member of parliament, of course, is not enough  for the academy. Some more global actions are needed. And what  is the most amazing thing, they have been carried out, true, not  by the leadership of the RAS.    Candidate of Physical Mathematical Sciences Aleksey  Zakharov,  deputy chairman of the council of the trade union of workers of  the academy, prepared proposals on the preservation of Russian  basic science during the period of economic reforms, in which he  evaluated the present situation and examined the problems of  financing, property, legal space, and personnel. This document  was sent by the author to all the election blocs. However, only  the ``Yablinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin'' bloc agreed to use it.    There now appear in the draft of the election program of  this  bloc: ``the establishment of a fixed share of the revenues of  the state budget as the lower limit of the financing of science,  using the mechanism of the coordination of the interests of all  budget-carried sectors; the use of the selective support of  scientific collectives during the competitive selection of  projects and their independent examination; the adoption of a  special program of the privatization of state property in the  sphere of science; the introduction of the preferential taxation  of the assets, which are channeled into funds for the support of  science and the higher school (including from abroad).''    One question arises: Why is the chairman of the trade union,  who, though he is defending the interests of scientists, does  not supervise them, preparing his own proposals on how to  preserve science? Why has the presidium, in whose hands are  power and a large number of other opportunities, thus far not  taken the same or a similar step? What is this--indifference,  the loss of hope for the solution of problems at the  parliamentary level or, through inertia, the desire as before to  stew in one's own juice and in necessary instances to use  personal contacts?</p>

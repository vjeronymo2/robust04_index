			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps report from Sarajevo] </F>   [Text] The chetniks are continuing to violate the  cease-fire flagrantly. They have again today provided enough  evidence of the fact that they have not removed all the weaponry  to the distance required.    This morning they fired with an antiaircraft machine gun  from  (Kromolje) at Brekin Potok, and small arms fire could be heard  all day. This was particularly evident in Brijesce, Sokolje,  Mijatovica Kosa, and Hotonj, while an antiaircraft gun from  (Nadvozici) fired at (Visocje).    The Chetnik snipers have been active in various locations,  where they have been seeking out victims using weapons with  silencers. According to reports, there have been no casualties  so far, but this behavior by the aggressor warrants extreme  caution.</p>

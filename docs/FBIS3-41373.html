They will now  face a ministerial commission of inquiry set up to probe the  agency. In her ruling today, the chairman of the tribunal, Mrs.  Justice Olufumi Layo Oniokpako, said she agreed with the defense  counsel that the officers be discharged in order not to hinder  the progress of the ministerial inquiry. She, however, ordered  that the findings of the probe panel be submitted to the  tribunal. The officers include the director general of the  agency, Dr. Yusuf Digbai.</p>

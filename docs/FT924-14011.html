			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Colliery closure details out today BRITISH Coal is expected today to announce the closure of 26 pits in a sweeping rationalisation plan involving the loss of thousands of jobs. The closures represent more than half British Coal's remaining 50 pits, and are part of the reshaping to prepare the company for privatisation. The closures will cost more than 20,000 jobs, one of the largest set of redundancies ever announced at once. The government will try to soften the blow with promises of aid, although the prospects for that are slim given the present state of the budget. Although the bulk of the job losses will affect the mining communities, there will also be many lay-offs among administrative staff. The announcement will come even though British Coal has yet to sign new supply deals with the electricity industry on which its prospects now depend. Negotiations have been delayed by disagreements among the electricity distributors. However, the government is keen to press ahead with the privatisation schedule. British Coal refused to confirm that the closure programme would be announced today, but Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, are both due to spend the day at their London offices. Union leaders in the biggest coalfield decided yesterday to press for a strike in protest at the planned pit closures. The Yorkshire executive of the NUM mineworkers' union said the demand was made 'with great reluctance'. Mr Ken Capstick, NUM Yorkshire area vice-chairman, said: 'We feel industrial action is needed to protect jobs and mining communities and especially because many of the redundancies will be compulsory, We are likely to lose 30,000 miners' jobs and another 60,000 in related industries. 'We also envisage 17 coal-fired power stations having to close very rapidly,' he said. The NUM Yorkshire area said it would put a motion calling for industrial action to a special delegate conference in Sheffield on Thursday. British Coal has been fined Pounds 20,000 with Pounds 6,410 costs for breaches of the Radioactive Substances Act 1960 relating to radioactive material held at Marine Colliery, Cwm, Gwent. The Pollution Inspectorate said that, after the closure of Marine Colliery there was no record of the fate of a caesium source used on a bunker level gauge and investigations had failed to discover its fate after the site had been cleared.</p>

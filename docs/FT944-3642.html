			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Warsaw - Other Markets Poland's state-owned Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH) goes on sale today, with the government offering 50.2 per cent of the equity to private investors at a minimum price of 700,000 zlotys a share, writes Christopher Bobinski. The offer comes as the local stock market continues in the doldrums, with the government taking the unprecedented step of telling investors buying up to 16m zlotys worth of BPH shares that they can offset the purchase against income tax next year. Officials are also looking to foreign investors and underwriters to salvage a sale worth 4,130bn zlotys (Dollars 170m), if the minimum price is accepted. This compares with the 8,500bn zlotys worth of new share offers and rights issues absorbed by the market in the first half of this year and overall new equity sales worth 5,300bn zlotys in the third quarter. Mr Krzysztof Kalicki, the deputy minister responsible for the sale, has said he is talking to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as well as two other foreign institutions about guarantees for the offer. The privatisation of the bank by mid-January is a condition, set by western governments, of a Dollars 600m grant to help finance a domestic corporate debt reduction scheme which last year allowed the state banking sector to improve its balance sheets. Polish Life Improvement, a privately-owned provincial retail chain going public today with an offer of 5m shares has, by contrast, slashed its share price to 55,000 zlotys from the original 110,000 zlotys. This comes after an initial public offer by the Jutrzenka chocolate maker was largely left with the Bank Handlowy and the Bank Zachodni, which underwrote the issue. Also, the Vistula garment maker in Krakow has reported scant interest in its latest rights issue, which looks likely to go to underwriters. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INTERCHANGE PROJECT  </P> <P> I read with interest and indeed, some amusement, the article which ran April 17  concerning the Mulholland/Valley Circle Interchange.  </P> <P> Caltrans, in its dying gasp, still does not see the big picture.  </P> <P> Typical of all government operations, they say, "If we had the money, we would  go ahead."  </P> <P> Ken Nelson, Caltrans' project design director, chooses to ignore the fact that  the four homeowners' groups and the Leonis Adobe Assn. were, as the article  stated, "annoyed" by the proposed interchange plan and demanded an  environmental impact report on this project.  </P> <P> The fact that Nelson chose to ignore the community's feelings about this plan  resulted in the pending lawsuits and was the determining factor behind  Caltrans' decision to drop this project. Nelson should realize that community  sentiment is the voice of the voters. It is that "voice" that will provide  Caltrans with the funds it seeks.  </P> <P> Then, of course, we have Hunt Braly, a representative of state Sen. Ed Davis,  and his statement, "If people next time don't support the preferred  alternative, it will be very difficult to keep Caltrans involved in the  project." Braly goes on to add to this already ridiculous statement: "We need a  renewed commitment from the citizens to work for an improved interchange."  </P> <P> These statements, one from an official at Caltrans and one from a  representative of a state senator, prompt one question: Has there ever been any  consideration given to what the people think about this project?  </P> <P> The answer to that question is an obvious and resounding "No!"  </P> <P> BRYCE H.

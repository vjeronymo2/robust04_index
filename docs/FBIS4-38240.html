			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 28 Jun (INA) -- The forces of the legitimate  Yemeni Government have seized control of significant areas in  the northern part of Jabal Hadid, the most heavily-fortified  stronghold of the separatists in Aden, which overlooks the city  of al-Ma'ashiq, in which the house of archseparatist 'Ali Salim  al-Bid is located.    An IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Sanaa today quoted  reports and military sources in Aden as saying that the forces  of the legitimate Yemeni Government have managed to completely  control the area of Khawr Maksar on the eastern side of greater  Aden, and impose their control in the northern and southern  parts of Khawr Maksar. These forces also controlled Aden airport.    The military reports originating in Aden added that the  forces of the legitimate Yemeni Government also controlled the  bridge that links the areas of al-Sha'b, al-Mansurah, and  al-Shaykh 'Uthman in 'Adan al-Sughra with greater Aden, and  reinforced their presence in the courtyard adjacent to Aden  International Hotel in downtown Aden.    The reports went on to say that 250 separatists, along with  their weapons, surrendered to the legitimacy forces after their  fortified positions inside the city of Aden had fallen.    The separatists today acknowledged that the coastal Port of  al-Mukalla, in which archseparatist 'Ali Salim al-Bid is holding  out, had come under intense shelling.    Observers in Sanaa expect the al-Mukalla Port to have been  neutralized by the artillery of the forces of the legitimate  Yemeni Government to prevent the arrival of the supplies being  shipped to the separatists via this port by some Gulf regimes.    The forces of the legitimate Yemeni Government seized  control  of 'Adan al-Sughra at midnight on Sunday [26 June].</p>

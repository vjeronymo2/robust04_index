			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Polish newspaper launches scathing attack on Walesa PRESIDENT Lech Walesa was yesterday subjected to a scathing attack in one of Poland's most widely read newspapers. The Gazeta Wyborcza published a six-page, no-holds-barred account of Mr Walesa's time so far in office. The account is based on interviews with former members of Mr Walesa's staff and paints a picture of a man whose responsibilities have far outgrown his abilities, and who is surrounded by a kitchen cabinet led by Mr Mieczyslaw Wachowski. The newspaper alleged, for example, that Mr Walesa was dissuaded only at the last minute by Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the then prime minister, from sending a congratulatory letter to the leaders of the coup in Moscow last August. It also alleged that Mr Wachowski, who was an aide to Mr Walesa in the heyday of the Solidarity movement in 1981, was protecting communists in the armed forces. The publication of the report is seen as a blow to Mr Walesa's attempt to win control over the armed forces. Meanwhile, a seven-week effort to enlarge Poland's centre-right minority coalition government headed by Prime Minister Jan Olszewski broke down yesterday, ahead of a key budget vote next month in parliament. The end came when Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, head of the Democratic Union and a former prime minister, said the three opposition parties he represented would not co-operate with the government. The talks had centred on the free-market Democratic Union, the Liberal Democratic Congress and the PPG - a business pressure group - joining the seven-party government. The aim was to build a strong parliamentary base capable of supporting austere budget policies. Differences over the division of ministries among the potential partners as well as opposition by the farming lobby to taking the Liberals into government put paid to the attempt. The result leaves Mr Olszewski and Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance minister, with the problem of putting a number of crucial issues to parliament without any certainty of a majority. The first test will take place this week when parliament must find a two-thirds majority to overturn a constitutional tribunal ruling that a pensions and wages cut for public employees last year was illegal. Should the court ruling be upheld, some Zl 30,000bn (Pounds 1.3bn) will have to be paid in compensation. That would shatter this year's budget calculations and lead to the government's resignation. The budget for the last three quarters of the year is to be voted on next month followed by laws enabling welfare spending cuts built into the budget to be implemented.</p>

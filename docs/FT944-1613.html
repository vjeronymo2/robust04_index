			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (8): Setbacks lead to reassessment - Foreign investment The Czech Republic's political stability and a consistent economic policy, pursued by a group of technocratic politicians with the zeal of true converts, has made the country a favourite of foreign investors. The government of Mr Vaclav Klaus has created a pro-reform consensus that has seen markets deregulated, state enterprises wholly or partly sold off, and the completion of a huge privatisation programme that has turned the Czechs into a nation of budding bourgeois capitalists. One of the rewards has been the granting of coveted investment grade status to the country by the international ratings agencies. The Czech Republic is rated BAA3 by Moody's and BBB-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's. Since 1990, and especially since 1992 when Mr Klaus became prime minister, foreign buyers have taken substantial stakes in the country's automotive, tobacco, food and construction industries. A total of Dollars 2.7bn in foreign direct investment was committed by the end of September this year, with expectations of Dollars 3bn by the year-end. This is less than half the levels seen in Hungary, where privatisation has moved much more slowly, but more than Poland, which has four times the population but is seen as more politically unstable. Significantly, the Czech Republic has attracted this level of investment without offering tax breaks or other incentives. On the contrary. 'Why should we subsidise foreign companies to compete unfairly against Czech companies?' Mr Klaus provocatively asks those who urge such measures. It is an approach that is paying off. CzechInvest, the agency for foreign investment, says that serious foreign investors appreciate the absence of incentives, seeing this as further evidence of the government's commitment to the law of the market. The biggest and most crucial foreign investor to date is Volkswagen, which bought 31 per cent of Skoda, the Czech carmaker, in 1991. Europe's biggest carmaker is due to raise its stake to 70 per cent by the end of 1995. Confirmation of the eventual handover of control to Volkswagen was agreed this year after a difficult renegotiation of the original 1991 agreement. This followed the German carmaker's embarrassing abandonment of earlier plans to invest up to Dm9bn in Skoda by the end of the decade. Other big investors include Philip Morris, which spent Dollars 420m buying 80 per cent of Tabak, the Czech tobacco monopoly, and modernising production at its Kutna Hora facility; BSN and Nestle. The latter bought into Cokoladovny, a confectionery maker, in a joint venture in 1992 and now controls the company. Another big investor is ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant, which employs 6,000 people in Brno, the country's second city, in a range of power engineering and electronics products ventures. US multinationals have also been substantial investors in the fast food and consumer goods sectors, but investment is not confined to the household names. Earlier this year, for example, the small US pharmaceuticals group Ivax bought majority control of Galena, the second biggest pharmaceutical company. Success is now bringing new problems for foreign investors. Czech attitudes, especially in political and business circles, have altered as company managers come to terms with the mechanics of restructuring. Some high profile deals with foreign investors have come spectacularly unstuck. The trigger was Volkswagen's scaling back of its plans for Skoda, which threatened to make the Czech venture a mere sideshow in the Volkswagen group and cause large-scale redundancies at its Mlada Boleslav plant. Putting a brave face on what has undoubtedly been a severe embarrassment for the government, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the trade and industry minister, defends the renegotiated agreement, though its terms have not been revealed. In hindsight, he says, the original deal was too optimistic. 'There were mistakes on both sides in signing the original agreement,' he adds. The Volkswagen setback was followed in March this year by the withdrawal of Air France from Czechoslovak Airlines. Air France and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development each bought 19.1 per cent stakes two years before in a Dollars 60m investment. After a lot of haggling, an exasperated government bought out the French stake and began looking for Czech backers to provide support for the heavily indebted airline. These setbacks, and controversy over the future of the petrochemical industry, have led many Czechs to reassess the merits of foreign investment. The country's success in other areas of economic reform, especially in coupon privatisation, sent expectations soaring, but the foreign investment controversies were a blow to national pride. There could be danger ahead. 'We are now in a period of euphoria over our own success - we risk overestimating our own capabilities,' says Mr Jan Havelka, chairman of CzechInvest. Western bankers in Prague dismiss the notion that the Czechs can complete the task of restructuring without foreign capital. Huge areas of the economy, including such industries as banking, brewing, energy, mining and metallurgy, are heavily undercapitalised and unable to finance restructuring on their own. A big test of the new mood towards foreign investment will come early next year when the government decides on a strategic partner for SPT Telecom, the telecommunications company in which the state is selling a 27 per cent stake for around Dollars 1bn. The deal is shaping up to be the biggest one-off investment yet in the country, as well as the biggest telecoms deal in eastern Europe. Mr Karel Dyba, the economy minister, is overseeing the tender and has promised to run an open and transparent process, partly to restate a commitment to foreign investment and partly to shake off allegations of shady dealing in earlier privatisations where transparency took a back seat. Away from the big deals, some private Czech companies are looking to raise new capital directly by wooing international institutional investors. Mr Ivo Lurvink, head of CS First Boston in Prague, says foreign investors are looking increasingly at emerging industries such as media and entertainment rather than at established sectors which still have much restructuring ahead of them. An additional factor that will enhance the Czech Republic's attractiveness as an investment location may come about as early as next year when the koruna, the national currency, is expected to become fully convertible. The Czech National Bank is pushing for the move early, but is facing opposition from Mr Klaus. The currency, widely considered undervalued, is expected to jump against the dollar and D-mark in the event of full convertibility, hurting the country's booming exports in its newly-won and valuable western European markets. 'Czech goods compete on price, not on quality,' says Mr David Svojitka, head of treasury at Bayerische Vereinsbank in Prague. Large inflows of speculative capital attracted by high interest rates and the chance of koruna appreciation sent the money supply soaring to 20 per cent by October and are threatening to push inflation above the CNB's target of 10 per cent for the year. This type of capital inflow, with its destabilising potential, has received the particular wrath of the government. Mr Klaus is understood to want to leave the question of convertibility until after general elections in 1996. By then, the proposed sale of the SPT Telecom stake and a potential Dollars 700m investment in oil refining by a consortium of Shell, Agip, Conoco and Total will have been decided. Future attention is expected to focus on the hundreds of newly privatised and start-up companies which are in desperate need of fresh capital and good management to turn the promise of privatisation into a reality. Potential investors are now scouring the provincial towns and villages for hidden jewels whose turnaround will be profitable for them, and good for the continued health of the economy.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mystery over gold market glitch SOMETHING STRANGE is going on in the gold market but, as usual in this secretive business, no-one is admitting responsibility. The indication that all is not normal is that the cost of leasing gold has risen sharply, traders say to the highest level for 18 months. The last time something similar happened to the leasing rate it later emerged that Portugal's central bank had lost 288,000 troy ounces of the precious metal, then worth about USDollars 100m, which had been lent to Drexel Burnham Lambert, the financial services group that collapsed in 1990. According to the Reuter news agency, the present glitch might have been caused by a very big central bank unexpectedly taking back from the market 1.4m ounces (about 43.5 tonnes) of gold. This represents about 5 per cent of the pool of 800 tonnes of gold which some analysts suggest is usually available to the market. Central banks and other financial institutions lend gold to the market in order to earn a very modest return on an asset that otherwise would yield no interest. They swap gold (sell with a commitment to buy it back again at an agreed price and date) with commercial banks and other intermediaries who take a commission before passing it on to clients such as gold producers or jewellers. The system has facilitated the forward selling by gold producers that some analysts suggest has been putting a 'cap' on any price rise. Usually central banks roll over these loans to the market but the Reuter report suggests that one bank decided to take back its gold instead. Traders say demand for leased gold is being stimulated at present by Australian producers selling forward because the price in Australian dollars has been rising, reflecting a strengthening of the US dollar. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, recalled that in 1990 at the time of Portugal's embarrasment, lease rates were kept down because Russia had gold to lend. 'The implication is that today there is no spare metal to lend which is notable. But we will have to see how long lease rates stay up to see if something really important is happening in the gold market.'</p>

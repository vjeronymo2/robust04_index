			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Heseltine calls for new partnership MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, on the last day of the Confederation of British Industry's conference yesterday brushed aside fears over his pledge to intervene in industry and called for a new partnership to rebuild Britain's industrial base. After listening to criticisms from delegates about the effect of government policies on business, Mr Heseltine told the conference that the debate on the real meaning of any partnership between the government and industry was sterile. The only important factor was that any new climate of understanding between the two sides produced positive results. Avoiding comment on the detail of tomorrow's Autumn Statement, he stressed that it would set in place the government's policies for stimulating economic growth. The recession, he said, meant Britain needed clear, stable policies, and not the 'quick fix' or short-term measures which had failed in the past. His responsibility, he told the conference, was to promote long-term, effective assistance to business and he intended to ensure it was provided. His ambition was to provide a business support network that was the best in the world. Mr Heseltine told a still-sceptical audience that the promotion of industrial competitiveness was at the heart of the government's industrial policy. He added: 'We need to build up the impact of industry across Whitehall. That can only be done if we know what we are talking about. We need facts, not assertions. We need to know what is happening in the marketplace.' Mr Heseltine said he had asked Mr Walter Eltis, his chief economic adviser, to ask large companies for their views on the economy, adding: 'If such information can inform or alert government then we should have it available'. Calling for tight control on industrial costs, Mr Heseltine said that wage settlements at recent levels could not be afforded. Pay rises had consistently run ahead of inflation, and the government and business had an obligation to ensure that excessive pay rises were stopped to help Britain's international competitiveness. Speaking in the industrial policy debate, Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive of Fisons, the pharmaceutical group, said: 'The much talked-of economic recovery of manufacturing in the 1980s did not happen'. He feared another large slice of manufacturing industry would be 'just wiped away in the early 1990s'. Mr David Fyfe of Hickson International Fine Chemicals warned that British industry could not be world-class unless it attracted some of the best brains. Mr Keith Dutton of Medway Packaging said that although the UK was the most patriotic of nations this patriotism did not extend to the purchase of domestic products. 'UK customers are willing to switch to foreign suppliers for a very small price advantage.'</p>

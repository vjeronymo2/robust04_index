			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10-YEAR WAR DISFIGURES A NATION AND ITS PEOPLE;  </P> <P> AFGHANISTAN: AMPUTEES FLOOD DAILY INTO KABUL FOR HELP. MANY MUST WAIT MONTHS  FOR ARTIFICIAL LIMBS.  </P> <P> Roshan Gul and Anar Gul are not related by blood, only by tragedy.  </P> <P> They bear the same last name, and their villages were not so far apart in the  days before both were bombed to rubble. Yet it took the same war that has been  destroying their homeland to bring the two women together recently -- at the  Red Cross limb factory in Kabul, where they patiently waited for their new  artificial legs.  </P> <P> The Guls are among the ranks of what experts say is Afghanistan's  fastest-growing population -- war-wounded amputees who are perhaps the starkest  metaphor for a civil conflict that continues to disfigure an entire nation.  </P> <P> Every day, amputees fill the urban bazaars of Kabul, hobbling around bomb  craters and rocket holes on the capital's ramshackle streets. At virtually  every intersection in every city, they can be seen struggling through traffic  and clinging to buses.  </P> <P> After more than a decade of bombing runs, rocket and missile barrages and  massive mine-seeding programs, these legless men, women and children -- whose  total is estimated at 100,000 -- represent what experts believe to be the  world's largest war amputee population. In fact, the number of amputees is so  large that almost every shoe shop in Kabul has a section selling half-pairs  only.  </P> <P> And the numbers may climb as Afghan refugees begin returning to their villages,  which are still heavily mined.  </P> <P> "There is nowhere else in the world with a problem of these dimensions," said  Claude Alain-Amiet, the Red Cross orthopedist who built the state-of-the-art  Kabul limb factory from scratch two years ago.  </P> <P> Anar and Roshan Gul are typical of the amputees.  </P> <P> Anar, who still has the face of child, was 13 when she tripped a hidden land  mine three years ago. Her right leg was blown off at the knee. Her parents had  sent her to explore their family grazing land on the once-idyllic shores of  Kabul's Karga Lake after it was vacated by a military regiment.  </P> <P> Roshan, a 40-year-old whose face already is deeply lined, was home in her mud  hut when her village, eight miles north of Kabul, was caught in an artillery  barrage between government forces and the moujahedeen rebels. A rocket hit the  hut, and the blizzard of shrapnel sheared off her right leg at the thigh. That  was five years ago.  </P> <P> Finally, early last month, the two women found their separate ways to the Red  Cross limb factory.  </P> <P> Amiet, the Swiss project director, already has worked with amputees for the Red  Cross in Lebanon and Angola and contends that the fundamental problem in  Afghanistan is underdevelopment, compounded by the sheer numbers.  </P> <P> Most of the amputees interviewed at the Red Cross center had lost their limbs  at least two years earlier, an indication of the length of time it takes a  wounded villager to reach the Kabul center.  </P> <P> Barbaric surgery practices, poor logistics and acute shortages of medicine have  deepened the crisis, Amiet said. Now, he said, his factory is producing and  fitting a record 105 custom-made artificial legs every month -- and still there  are 3,000 amputees on the waiting list, with each month of war adding scores  more.  </P> <P> In Angola, he recalled, "the amputations were done better than here. When mine  victims came in, the Cuban surgeons tried to save at least one of the legs.  Here, they just cut them both. They just don't care. So we have about 8% double  amputees here."  </P> <P> Lecturing Afghan war surgeons a year ago, a Red Cross surgeon, Dr. Kenneth  Barent, spent nearly an hour detailing proper triage procedures that can  prevent infections of war wounds, and he appealed to them to try save limbs  rather than try to save time in the operating room.  </P> <P> Still, legless civilians and soldiers alike continue to come in. First, they  are fitted for a pair of crutches and are given a number on the waiting list;  several months later, they get an appointment to begin the long process of  fitting and manufacturing new legs.  </P> <P> At first glance, the scene in the center's courtyard is depressing: Dozens of  hobbling men, women and children; women like Anar and Roshan Gul sitting idly  on the floor; old men stumbling as they try to walk again, and double amputees  from isolated villages struggling with sophisticated wheelchairs.  </P> <P> But beneath the surface there is something different about these war wounded --  something that Red Cross workers say is as extraordinary as their huge numbers.  </P> <P> "There is one thing that sets these amputees apart," said one British  physiotherapist at the center who has also worked with amputees in Cambodia and  Lebanon. "With very few exceptions, they never seem to go through the stage of  depression that most amputees experience. There's just a whole different spirit  in these people -- stoic will to go on."  </P> <P> Indeed, in interviews with more than a dozen legless, it was clear that they  have retained their dignity and hope.  </P> <P> Mohammed Younis, for example, refused to give up when he stepped on a mine in  Kunduz province four years ago. His face lit up with a proud, toothless grin  through a yellowing beard as he rolled up his tattered trousers to show off an  artificial leg that he made himself out of scrap metal and discarded bicycle  parts.  </P> <P> Younis, 68, is a bicycle repair man by trade, so, he explained, he fixed his  leg the same way he would a crumpled bike.  </P> <P> Raz and Lal Mohammed, 13-year-old cousins, are even more extraordinary, Red  Cross workers said. Both boys lost both their legs a year ago when they stepped  simultaneously on two land mines while walking to their uncle's house.  </P> <P> The boys have been walking on their new Red Cross legs for several months now  and have become role models for other amputees, helping every day to run  physiotherapy classes at the limb factory.  </P> <P> When asked what they want to do when they grow up, both respond, "I want to be  a doctor."  </P> <P> In the women's dormitory at the factory, where Roshan and Anar Gul fill their  time sewing prayer scarfs and chatting about their families, the same spirit  came through.  </P> <P> "I am a seamstress by profession," Roshan explained. "When my husband was  alive, we had a fine field of crops. We had children. We had a life.  </P> <P> "Now, I've lost everything. No money; my husband is dead; my children are gone;  my leg is cut, and I have forgotten everything because of this war," she said.  "But what I have lost, I have lost. I only pray that God will keep others from  losing their lives, and that is what I live for -- for those prayers."  </P> <P> Anar, the 16-year-old, said she has the same prayer. But for her, the future  appears to be more difficult. Perhaps it was her age; many Afghan girls are  preparing for marriage at 16.  </P> <P> But when asked to tell her dreams for her life, a tear formed at the corner of  Anar's right eye.  </P> <P> Looking down, she said quietly, "Every night when I am sleeping, I dream that I  have my leg back."  </P></p>

Papoulias, current chairman of European Union's Ministerial  Council, told reporters here the Council may be asked to provide  European troops to an international protection force for the  Israeli-occupied territories.    Papoulias, a long-time friend of 'Arafat, is to brief the  Council next Monday to report the results of his tour of  Tunisia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Syria.    The minister said he contacted several European colleagues  after his talks here late Tuesday with the PLO chief to tell  them of 'Arafat's demands.    An aide to Papoulias added that 'Arafat was "in agony" over  the massacre and its consequences for negotiations aimed at  launching the autonomy accord, which is almost three months  behind schedule.    He "was not very talkative, kept hammering his  preconditions"  for restarting the autonomy talks, particularly "security  guarantees and the disarming of the settlers."    Papoulias told 'Arafat that the European Union was "making  every effort to ensure that the dialogue goes on."    "The tragic events of Hebron have created a new situation.  It will have to be overcome through new measures," Papoulias  said.    The Greek foreign minister also discussed the Hebron  massacre  and the autonomy talks with Tunisian President Ben Ali and  Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahya.    Papoulias was to visit Tel Aviv later Wednesday to meet with  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who has held several  negotiating sessions with 'Arafat.    The PLO has spurned a call from U.S. President Bill Clinton  to hold snap negotiations to finalise an autonomy deal with  Israel, while Jordan, Lebanon and Syria broke off talks with  Israel in support.    'Arafat said Tuesday he would insist on UN guarantees to  protect the Palestinians before resuming peace talks.    'Arafat's "bottom line" included the dispatch of  international peacekeepers, disarming the settlers and  dismantling some settlements.    In New York, the UN Security Council was still struggling  over a resolution on the massacre while Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali pushed for a UN presence to keep the peace in the  territories.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATION: SEARCHING FOR NATIONAL POLICY ON SCIENCE  </P> <P> Somewhere, stumbling aimlessly between Pennsylvania and Constitution avenues in  Washington, is $18 billion-plus in search of a policy.  </P> <P> That's roughly what the federal government plans to spend on  non-defense-related science and technology this fiscal year. Only in our  nation's capital, where a dash of politics sweetens unpalatable taxes into  tasty revenue enhancers, can a phrase such as "science policy" be an oxymoron.  That's not healthy and it's not smart.  </P> <P> The irony is that, after an initial delay, the Bush Administration seems to  have made all the right moves in setting up a policy infrastructure. The  appointment of Yale physicist D. Allan Bromley as White House science adviser  was well received -- as was the upgrading of the post to Cabinet-level status.  Bush even reconstituted an Office of Science and Technology Policy to further  assure that intelligent policy advice and technical expertise wouldn't be total  strangers.  </P> <P> "I couldn't have hoped for much more," says William Golden, president of the  New York Academy of Sciences and a longtime player in science policy circles.  </P> <P> Moreover, the speech writer who penned candidate Bush's campaign commitments to  emphasize science and innovation is now deputy to Office of Management and  Budget Director Richard G. Darman, overseeing the science and technology  budget. At 32, Robert Grady is one of the younger Turks shaping the dollar flow  to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science  Foundation and the nation's universities, as well as brokering some of the  budget trade-offs between Congress and the White House.  </P> <P> "Investments in science and technology are a priority," says Grady, who is less  than thrilled with the way that Congress has trimmed Bush's initiatives. The  Administration's rationale is crisp and well defined: A dollar spent on science  and technology is an investment; a dollar spent on "entitlements" is a dollar  destined for consumption.  </P> <P> Darman has publicly decried what he describes as America's "I want my Maypo . .  . NOW!" culture, and it is clear that boosting the science budget sends a clear  signal that this Administration wants to bias the budget toward investment and  away from consumption. Investing in science and technology becomes a symbol.  </P> <P> Yet the trick is matching the symbolism with substance. Spending money is easy.  Making intelligent investments for the long term is not. Despite having sharp  people in the right places, the Bush Administration has yet to articulate a  real policy to deal with the difficult trade-offs involved in funding this  area:  </P> <P> * Are the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health  structured the best way for funding research?  </P> <P> * Should the government fund more "Little Science" efforts as opposed to "Big  Science" projects, such as the superconducting supercollider?  </P> <P> * What should be the balance between basic and applied research?  </P> <P> * Should the government spend more on science equipment or science education?  </P> <P> * How much science should be funded with an eye toward global competitiveness?  </P> <P> These are precisely the questions that aren't being answered -- and yet, these  are precisely the questions that are getting lost amid the budget battles. They  are also the questions that will determine what kind of return America's  taxpayers get for their multibillion-dollar investments.  </P> <P> Grady freely acknowledges that "there will be a very healthy debate -- maybe  even a tension -- about 'investment in emerging technology' versus 'industrial  policy.' " When does one blur into the other? The answer is politically charged  because Republican free traders/free marketers loathe "industrial policy" with  a passion. They don't want Washington to be "picking winners." Instead they  want to rely on, as Ronald Reagan put it, "the magic of the marketplace" to  determine what emerging technologies are best.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Grady says Darman is interested in "competitiveness inducing  investments" in science and technology. "We're prepared to push that envelope a  little further than our predecessors," Grady says.  </P> <P> What about the high-definition television technology consortium that Commerce  Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher pushed to get U.S. industry back into consumer  electronics? Or other consortia to encourage state-of-the-art science and  technology? What is the policy guiding the budgeteers? "We'll decide that on a  case-by-case basis," Grady says.  </P> <P> Which is precisely the point: Case by case means that there is no policy. What  you find instead are themes impersonating initiatives. The Bush Administration  has expressed intense interest in promoting space exploration. The  Administration is also intrigued by establishing a supercomputer network to  link up universities and industry. And for good old-fashioned scientific pork  barreling, there's the superconducting supercollider -- a high-energy  physicist's dream that will be located in (surprise!) Texas, a state that has  more electoral votes than quality physicists.  </P> <P> It's not that these efforts lack merit, it's that they lack focus, coherence  and context. What is so troubling about the Bush Administration's approach to  science and technology policy is that there seems to be no center. The people  that Bush has are, I think and hear, top notch. Unfortunately, you can't tell  this by what's happened so far.  </P> <P> National Science Foundation Director Erich Bloch, who has seen his agency's  proposed budget double under the new Administration, argues that the  Administration's emphasis on education is a cornerstone of its science policy  and that its commitment to science is a necessary precursor to whatever new  policies emerge.  </P> <P> Bromley, Darman, Grady and Bloch will perform a great public service if,  instead of simply discussing initiatives, they sit down with leaders in  industry and science to explain what they think science policy means -- and  should mean -- in an era of deficits. They should talk tough about which  priorities of theirs are partisan and which priorities are motivated to keep  this country the global leader in basic science.  </P> <P> What's more, they have to have the guts to be bipartisan. An Administration  that gets America's science and business establishments to explore ways to get  more bang for the science buck -- instead of just more bucks -- will have made  a contribution to this country that leaves science in better condition than it  found it.  </P></p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (16): Big productivity increase - Manufacturing industry Management and employees in Swedish manufacturing industry deserve much of the credit for a transformation in the country's industrial competitiveness since the early 1990s, but their own efforts and government policy will dictate whether further progress can be made. Two important factors have transformed the competitiveness of Swedish industry, according to Mr Magnus Lemmel, director-general of the Federation of Swedish Industries. The first is the Swedish krona's de facto devaluation of 25 per cent in the past two years, which has restored manufacturers' ability to compete in the European market. The second change, says Mr Lemmel, is a big increase in industry's productivity over the past few years. In the long term, this is more important, he says. The krona may rise in value, but the effects of increased productivity will endure. The increase in productivity has come through a mixture of government and industry efforts. Cuts in sick-leave benefits made by the former, pre-1991 Social Democratic government had a very important effect, reducing absenteeism by about 20 per cent. Since then, the recession across much of Sweden's industrial sector - whether export-oriented or reliant on the domestic market - has led to big reductions in employment. 'We are now producing more, with much less labour,' says Mr Lemmel. Prompted partly by the downturn, important internal improvements in manufacturing have come, with better management, logistics, and flow of goods, all designed to raise productivity. Labour-management relations are much improved, and discussions are conducted in a good atmosphere, he says. Mr Lemmel might be expected to promote Swedish industry's achievements but his views are corroborated by observers of the Swedish industrial scene. Mr John McDowall, a British Steel executive director, has been making monthly trips to Sweden in the past year as chairman of Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer. He says he is very encouraged by the company's productivity improvements and the positive attitude of workers and trade unions. Mr Lemmel is now looking to Sweden's new minority Social Democratic government to 'do the right things' to ensure that the business climate remains favourable. A crucial factor, he says, will be the extent to which reductions in the budget deficit are achieved through spending cuts rather than increased taxes, and 'judgment day' will be January's budget. 'So far, the emphasis has been on raising taxes, but the balance needs to be changed,' he says. Increased taxes on employment, for example, would hamper industry's ability to grow. The recent retrenchment and reorganisation in Swedish industry, and the current attitude of multinational companies to manufacturing there, is well illustrated by the experiences of two companies with deep Swedish roots, but whose global headquarters are abroad. Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, employs about 27,000 people in Sweden, a reduction of about 3,000 since 1990-91. The reductions, it says, took place mainly in those businesses affected by the domestic recession, notably in the construction market. As a manufacturing base, it says, Sweden's situation is now very favourable. 'We have a cost base that makes us very competitive in the international market, not least thanks to the krona situation.' But it stresses that the weak krona is only part of the story. A special export campaign, and Swedish ABB's much-admired T50 customer focus programme, presided over by Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, its chief executive, have laid the internal foundation for success. As an example of what the process has achieved, it cites ABB Stal in Finspong, which in 1990 supplied six gas turbines worth about SKr500m. Next year's target is deliveries worth SKr2bn, equivalent to 25 gas turbines, with a workforce that has increased by only 15 per cent. ABB Sweden echoes Mr Lemmel by calling for the public finances to be put on a sound basis, and warning of the vital importance that the continuing positive development of industry is not hindered in any way. Meanwhile VME Group, the Brussels-based producer of construction equipment, has reduced its Swedish workforce from about 6,500 in 1989 to 4,400, and closed three plants, at Landskrona, Lund and Karlskrona (the last two came with the acquisition in 1991 of Akermans, the hydraulic excavator producer). The closures were part of a worldwide reorganisation in response to the recession, says Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief executive. They were accompanied by significant restructuring of the factories that remained, to increase productivity and shorten lead times. With a reduced manufacturing base, the recent upturn in sales has lead to a dramatic improvement in profitability, in the form of a Dollars 200m turnround out of the red over the past two years. Mr Johannesson says that Swedish industry was 'completely lacking in realism' in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and 'only started to sober up during the recession.' Now, he says, there is good reason to be 'fundamentally positive' about Sweden as a country in which to invest and manufacture. He too, though, is worried by the new government's attitudes to business taxation, and the possibility of increased income tax. Another concern, says Mr Johannesson, is the possibility of renewed 'imported inflation' because of raw material shortages and the present weak currency. Increased inflation would automatically stimulate a renewed debate on wages, and a return to bad habits. Any rise in the krona over the next few years - as a result, perhaps, of tough action to control the budget deficit - would reduce the cost of industry's imported raw materials. That would partially offset the reduced benefits for exporters, which in turn would encourage manufacturers to continue raising their productivity. The bright outlook for manufacturing, notwithstanding the concerns about government policy, has been enhanced by last month's referendum on Sweden joining the European Union. Large international companies such as ABB and VME say the positive result has removed a risk that would have had to be assessed when making a long-term investment decision. Slowly, investments in Sweden would have declined in favour of EU countries. In terms of business opportunities, though, the real beneficiaries are likely to be Sweden's smaller engineering sub-contractors, says Mr Thomas Older, president and chief executive of Svedala Industri, the big mineral processing and construction equipment group. 'It would have been very easy for us to have slowly moved more manufacturing into other countries,' he says. 'Our sub-suppliers at home would have been the ones to suffer.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SWEDEN'S INDUSTRIAL REVIVAL (percentage change per year)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Industrial     Unit labour     Industrial                 productivity           costs     production  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1985                    +1.6            +9.0           +2.0 1986                    +1.9            +6.2           +1.2 1987                    +1.7            +4.5           +2.4 1988                    +1.4            +5.2           +2.9 1989                    +3.1            +7.2           +1.0 1990                    +1.6            +8.5           -0.6 1991                    +0.9            +7.6           -5.5 1992                    +6.7            -3.6           -0.7 1993                    +9.1            -6.7           +1.8 1994*                   +3.6            +0.1           +9.0 1995*                   +2.9            +2.6           +7.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: * Forecast  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: National Institute of Economic Research.

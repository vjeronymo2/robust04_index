			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / BT directory probe is halted The Office of Fair Trading has suspended its investigation into claims that British Telecommunications manages its telephone directory business in a way unfair to customers and competitors. But Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was doing so only to allow Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, to investigate the issues first. Sir Bryan said he remained concerned about BT's policy of obliging customers to buy directories and including the cost in the line rental charge. He also wanted Oftel to examine the cost and other obstacles faced by competitors in getting customers' telephone numbers into BT directories.</p>

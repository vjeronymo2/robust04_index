			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Japanese Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa held a news conference following their  talks at noon today. Musa said the talks dealt with many  bilateral, regional, and international issues. They also dealt  with the peace process and issues of concern to Asia, Africa,  and the Arab world. The Japanese foreign minister said he was  happy that Egypt was the first country he was visiting after the  formation of the new Japanese Government. The visit, he said,  comes at an important time, with the peace process witnessing  the major development of the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli  Agreement. He said he would be glad to attend the signing  ceremony.    Kakizawa said Egypt and Japan are playing roles to help  solve  regional and international problems. He said today's talks were  an important step toward boosting bilateral ties and entrenching  the international role of the two countries. He stressed the  importance of Egypt's African and Arab role and said Japan is  eager to hold the necessary consultations with Egypt.    The Japanese foreign minister expressed regret at the  postponement of President Mubarak's scheduled visit to Japan  last month. He said Japan hopes the visit will take place as  soon as possible and at the right time. He said he would meet  President Mubarak today to tell him that Japan is willing to  renew the invitation to his excellency to visit.    [In a related Cairo-datelined report, Cairo MENA in Arabic  at  1210 GMT on 3 May cites Dr. Yusuf Butrus Ghali, minister of  state for international cooperation, as saying that today he  signed two agreements with the Japanese foreign minister. Under  the first, Japan will provide a grant of around $40 million of  equipment to Luxor Hospital. Under the second, Japan will  provide about the same amount as a grant to repair a tunnel.  The minister also said that in a step reflecting Japan's  confidence in Egypt's economic reform program, "the Japanese  foreign minister also announced that Japan would guarantee  Japanese investments in Egypt."]</p>

Earlier, Russian President Yeltsin, in a  letter to the Indian Government, expressed his concern over the  blatant violation of human rights by the Indian security forces  in occupied Kashmir and urged the Indian rulers to stop the  atrocities. It was not only the United States and other Western  countries that had kept patting India on the back for not  implementing the UN resolutions on holding a plebiscite on the  Kashmir issue, but Russia, too, which, during the Soviet Union  era, openly supported India on the issue. This had been the  Russian posture all along--from vetoing Security Council  resolutions against India to Nikita Khrushchev's outright  rejection of Kashmir as an issue.    Recent statements by personalities holding the most  important  positions in Russia on human rights violations in occupied  Kashmir and in support of the Kashmiris' right to  self-determination indicate the emergence of a positive change  in the Russian foreign policy after the disintegration of the  erstwhile Soviet Union. This can be termed as a welcome  development for the resolution of this long-standing issue. The  shift in the Russian stand on occupied Kashmir --no matter  whether due to a greater awareness in the United States and  other Western countries of the human rights violations in the  valley, or to the tough resistance by the Kashmiris -- is a good  and welcome change that will help secure an early solution to  the Kashmir problem.  *</p>

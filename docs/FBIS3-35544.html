			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Israel does everything it can to conceal the name of  Jerusalem from the march [words indistinct] under the cover of  darkness, and when the name of the city of peace surfaces, the  Zionists' reality is exposed by their shouts and allegations  that Jerusalem is Israeli and will remain the permanent capital  of the State of Israel. Despite the frank international  resolutions and the rejection of most countries, including the  big powers, of the legitimacy of the decision to annex issued in  June 1980 to annex Jerusalem, Israel continues to reject any  discussion of the fate of the city of peace. It threatens to  obstruct the whole peace process if this issue is raised. By  this, Israel is exercising every kind of blackmail and  Judaization.    All these methods cannot change any of official documents  and  treaties, despite Israel's control of the land, its daily  Judaization measures, and its continued settlement operations to  change the face of the flower of cities. These documents stress  something no one can ignore or hide from. No one has free  disposal over Jerusalem or can relinquish any inch of its holy  land. No leader, organization, or official alone can negotiate  with the Israelis on the decided, irrevocable facts that  Jerusalem is Arab and will remain Arab despite all intrigues and  conspiracies. It is Islamic and contains the first of the two  qiblas, the third of the holiest shrines, and many Islamic holy  sites, the foremost of which are al-Aqsa Mosque, 'Umar Mosque,  the holy Rock of the Dome, and the place from which the prophet  ascended to the throne. It also contains Christian sanctities,  including the Holy Sepulcher, but does not contain any Jewish  sanctities, contrary to Zionist propaganda allegations.    Israel has pursued a well-studied strategy to reach its  goals. It began by oppressing Arab residents by confiscating  their land, arresting men, damaging the sanctities, demolishing  houses, denying construction licenses, waging economic war, and  imposing an unethical and inhuman siege on Arab Jerusalem to  force its residents to leave it and hand it over to Zionist  settlers as an easy morsel. As a result, the character of the  old city changed. A series of settlements and brute-like  colonies that distort the spiritual and aesthetic face of  Jerusalem have been established.    The Israeli Government also insisted on separating Jerusalem  residents from their brothers and families in the West Bank and  Gaza. It prevented any citizen in Jerusalem from joining the  Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. What is worse is the  agreement the Israeli Government recently signed with the  Vatican. This has provoked fear that this Catholic edifice may  retreat from its resolute rejection of the annexation of  Jerusalem and from its insistence on finding a solution ensuring  everybody's rights, even through the internationalization of the  whole holy city, as demanded by the former pope.    The Madrid peace formula suspended the issue of Jerusalem,  in  accordance with a U.S. demand to postpone complicated and  difficult issues until after deciding matters and defining the  concept of land for peace, namely, the concept of total peace  and total withdrawal in accordance with international  resolutions, foremost of which are Resolutions No. 242 and 338.  Israel alleges and brags every day that Jerusalem is excepted  from total peace and total withdrawal and that it will not sign  any final agreement that stipulates a change of the present  situation. Therefore, it has resorted to tricks, dividing the  solution and demanding partial agreements with each side.    Despite all this, the Israelis know they have not been able  to impose a fait accompli. Therefore, they are building more  settlements, oppressing Jerusalem residents, and [words  indistinct]. Some specialized gangs call for the destruction of  al-Aqsa Mosque and building the Temple in its place. Despite  these difficulties, Jerusalem's residents have proven their  ability to defend the den of Arabs and Muslims and have asserted  to the whole world that Jerusalem is Arab and will remain so  forever. Its current ordeal is not the first. It was subjected  to the crusaders' occupation and was liberated at the hand of  victorious commander Salah al-Din al-'Ayyubi.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Now TV mouths match words Thanks to computer technology, Robert Redford and Meryl Streep may soon be able to speak Japanese effortlessly. A new system, developed by a Chicago computer specialist, should remove the main flaw with dubbing television programmes into different languages - the lips move in often ludicrous and inappropriate ways in relation to the words. The flaw has prevented the broadcasting of thousands of hours of high-quality programmes, because English-speaking TV audiences are hostile to sub-titling, and do not much care for work that is too obviously dubbed. The new system, developed by Mr Richard Blomstein and his small company, Dynamic Refilming, bridges the gap between the words and lip movements. The process, which has been patented in leading markets, will be marketed and distributed worldwide by Primetime, a leading UK independent producer and programme distributor. Richard Price, the Primetime chairman, said yesterday the first commercial use of the new dubbing technique would come within the next six months in London. The mouth of the actor dubbing a programme is filmed as he or she records the new sound track. The tape is then fed through a computer program that lines up this film with the original actor's mouth movements. 'The original actor's mouth is moved electronically so that the lip movements are in sync with the mouth movements of the dubbing actor,' says Price. Existing dubbing techniques are fine for long- and medium-range shots. On Average, the close-ups which would be electronically reworked make up about eight to 10 minutes of an hour-long drama. Using the new technique would typically double the Pounds 20,000 dubbing costs of a 90-minute film. 'What I am hoping is that this will open up a vein of marvellous German, French and other foreign-language programmes, so that we can put them into (English-language) TV and cable channels,' says Price. The technique could also be used to make dubbing more realistic in any language. At the moment, Price is concentrating on TV, but the same principle could be used for feature films, although high-definition tape would probably be needed to get prints of sufficient quality. 'You are going to have the opportunity to move programmes between languages more easily and open up this mine of material to meet the increasing requirement for quality programmes,' says Price, who plans to start marketing the technique in March.</p>

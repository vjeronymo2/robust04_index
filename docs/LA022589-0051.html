			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 INDUSTRY SMOG PLANS WON'T WORK, AQMD SAYS  </P> <P> Regional air quality officials, stepping up their drive for quick approval of  their own clean air plan, disclosed Friday that a new analysis shows that the  South Coast Air Basin would never meet federal clean air standards under two  controversial alternatives proposed by industry.  </P> <P> Officials of the South Coast Air Quality Management District said that claims  by Southern California Edison Co. and the Western States Petroleum Assn. that  their less-costly alternatives would bring the nation's smoggiest urban area  into compliance with the federal ozone standard are based on questionable  assumptions and in many cases are undocumented.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Not Work  </P> <P> "They would never meet the standards," AQMD Executive Officer James M. Lents  said.  </P> <P> "We went line by line, assumption for assumption, measure by measure . . . and  found a number of points where the facts simply did not support the conclusions  they reached," said Pat Nemeth, AQMD deputy executive officer for planning and  rules.  </P> <P> It was the first time that the district had publicly stated that the Edison and  Western States Petroleum plans would fail to meet the federal ozone standard,  which is 0.12 parts per million. The district has previously said that the  indus try plans would fail to meet federal standards for nitrogen dioxide,  carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter.  </P> <P> The district's analysis was quickly disputed by both Edison and Western States  Petroleum. They repeated earlier arguments that their proposals would not only  clean up the air basin 10 years sooner than the AQMD but at far less cost.  </P> <P> The AQMD's analysis, released at a press conference at district headquarters in  El Monte, comes just three weeks before a scheduled showdown vote March 17 on a  far-reaching clean air plan to bring Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and  Riverside counties into compliance with federal clean air standards by the year  2007.  </P> <P> The AQMD's proposal is roundly opposed by business and industry as too costly.  Business interests have warned that the plan would cost tens of thousands of  lost jobs, a charge denied Friday by the district.  </P> <P> The AQMD's plan was originally scheduled for a vote last December. But the vote  was delayed after legal problems with the plan's environmental impact report  were discovered. Since then, the district has reviewed its plan, as well as  those offered by industry.  </P> <P> It was clear Friday that the AQMD staff had not retreated, and Lents said he is  now convinced that there are enough votes on the board to approve it.  </P> <P> "I think the case is strengthened, not weakened," Lents said. "We are calling  for action now."  </P> <P> The AQMD said Friday that its plan would cost $2.79 billion a year, compared to  $1.59 billion annually under the Edison plan and $1.63 billion under the  Western States Petroleum plan. The costs are for air pollution control measures  proposed only in the first five years under what the district calls Tier I of  its control measures. The costs do not include between $37 billion and $40  billion in new freeways and mass transit systems that would largely be built  even without an air quality plan but are nonetheless a factor in meeting clean  air standards.  </P> <P> AQMD officials said the industry contention that their plans would meet the  ozone standard were based on the incorrect assumption that each air pollution  control measure they endorsed would result in greater emission reductions than  the district thought likely.  </P> <P> District officials also said a new analysis of recent data disproves Edison's  claim that the federal standard for microscopic particulate matter, known as  PM10, could be met with fewer controls. Neither industry plan would meet the  standard for oxides of nitrogen, one of the key ingredients of photochemical  smog, the district argued.  </P> <P> Fine particulate matter is largely responsible for poor visibility and appears  as the brown haze often seen in the basin. Particulate matter can also bypass  the human body's defenses and lodge deeply in lungs and cause respiratory  illness.  </P> <P> Ozone, which accounts for about 95% of photochemical smog, has been shown to  reduce lung capacity, causes coughing, burning of the eyes, impedes the body's  immune system, results in reduced lung capacity and damages trees, crops, and  buildings.  </P> <P> The AQMD's conclusion that the Edison plan failed to meet the ozone standard  "is not based on Edison's latest submittal to the district in January, 1989,"  Edison said in a statement.  </P> <P> The company also said its PM10 proposal "is consistent with U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency guidelines." Both Edison responses, offered by Nader Mansour,  the firm's environmental regulations manager, were disputed by Nemeth.  </P> <P> Michael Wang, manager of operating and environmental issues for Western States  Petroleum, said, "I don't feel that their analysis is reflective of our plan. I  don't know how they're running the model . . . but we have double- and  triple-checked our runs."  </P></p>

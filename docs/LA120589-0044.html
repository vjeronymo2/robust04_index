			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> POLICE OFFICER'S TRIAL DRAWS TO A CLOSE  </P> <P> Both sides rested their cases and closing arguments were scheduled to begin  today in the trial of a Miami policeman charged with manslaughter in the deaths  of two black men that sparked three days of race riots in January. The defense  rested its case after rolling a motorcycle into the courtroom to show jurors  how the vehicle looked the day the defendant, William Lozano, 31, shot and  killed its driver, Clement Lloyd, 23. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24,  died later. The prosecution claims Lozano killed Lloyd unnecessarily as the  Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle, fleeing from a pursuing police car, sped past the  officer in the opposite lane. The defense says the motorcycle was bearing down  on Lozano, who shot in self-defense.  </P></p>

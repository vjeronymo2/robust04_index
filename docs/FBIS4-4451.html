			<p>BFN     [Text] The special joint meeting of the National Assembly  for 1994 began deliberating the draft constitutional amendments  at 0940 today. National Assembly President Marut Bunnak chaired  the session. After various matters were acknowledged, Praman  Adireksan, the opposition leader in the House, proposed that the  agenda be changed by advancing the ninth item on the agenda to  the beginning. The ninth item dealt with the draft  constitutional amendments of the combined opposition parties.  Originally, the first item on the agenda was the draft  constitutional amendments of the government parties. The  government parties' draft calls for amending eight points in the  Constitution, while the opposition's motion involves amending 25  points. The government parties opposed the change in the agenda  order, but the change was approved by a vote of 342 to 199.    Extensive debate by Assembly members continued without a  break. In the afternoon, the prime minister, sitting among the  Democrat Party's seats, stood to counter the allegation by  certain senators about the government's violent and excessive  suppression of the people. The prime minister said the  government does not have a policy of resorting to violence and  administers the country according to law. It intends to  preserve democracy and prevent disunity. Regarding the alleged  suppression, the prime minister said the officials on duty were  working under extreme pressure and had to protect themselves.    The debates continued until 1800, when the session was  adjourned by a vote of 351 to 176. A procedural roll call was  then taken on the first reading on whether or not to accept the  amendment proposals in principle. The voting ended at 1920 with  a count of 369, with 194 abstentions, to accept the draft  constitutional amendment of the opposition parties. The session  ended at 1930.    The National Assembly totals 625 members -- 360 members of  parliament and 265 senators.    The session will reconvene at 1000 tomorrow to consider the  government parties' draft constitutional amendments.</p>

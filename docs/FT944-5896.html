			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Buzzacott acts to meet charity rules Buzzacott Investment Management, a firm of chartered accountants which also manages funds for charities, has turned over Pounds 60m of its clients' monies to Mercury Asset Management, largely in response to new rules on charity investment. Mr Brian Regan, a senior partner of Buzzacott, said: 'This is a natural development in view of the new audit requirements for charities which are expected to come into force towards the end of 1995. Buzzacott said it would continue to act as financial adviser for its auditing clients and continue its performance monitoring function of client portfolios. From next year, auditors to charities face tougher requirements under the Charities Act of 1993. A further statement of recommended practice from the Accounting Standards Board says that those who audit the investment portfolio of a charity should not also be responsible for making investment decisions.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Berlusconi narrowly wins vote in Senate Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's new prime minister, last night cleared a major hurdle when his rightwing cabinet narrowly won a vote of confidence in the Italian Senate. Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance lacked an absolute majority in the 326-seat senate, and he was forced to rely on the absence of some senators and the abstention of others during the motion, which he won by a handful of votes. With the vote behind him, Mr Berlusconi can now begin to flesh out the details of deregulating the economy, relaxing Italy's rigid labour laws and reforming taxes which he announced earlier this week would be the centrepiece of his first 100 days. The closeness of the vote yesterday underlined the difficulties facing the media magnate turned politician in sustaining his government in office over the medium term. The three-day debate in the senate showed many politicians were concerned about the composition of the new government with its five ministers drawn from the neo-fascist MSDI/ National Alliance and the presence of the populist Northern League. The small but influential group of senators belonging to centrist parties spawned by the demise of the Christian Democrats were those most clearly caught in a dilemma. They did not wish to be seen responsible for bringing down the government before it started operating. Equally they did not wish to be seen giving Mr Berlusconi a helping hand. It was thus convenient that some chose to be discreetly absent. Before yesterday's vote, the combined strength of the opposition in the progressive block led by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the centre headed by the Popular Party (PPI) was 152 against the government's 156. The debate produced few surprises with the parties defending already well publicised views. However, Mr Berlusconi went some way to reassure trade unions that he would respect a wage and productivity agreement signed with the employers and government last July.</p>

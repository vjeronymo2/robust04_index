			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (3): Recovery seems likely - David White considers the economic outlook It is a fair bet that unemployment in Spain will cross the 25 per cent barrier this year. No doubt the official rate, as measured by the National Statistics Institute's quarterly survey, includes several percentage points which correspond to people who work on the black market. Still, to citizens of most other European countries facing half that unemployment rate or less, it might well seem beyond tolerable limits. It is a testimony to the resilience of Spain's extended family-based society that it can bear it. Last year the figure rose by more than 600,000 to 3.68m, by far the largest-ever increase and the most telling evidence of Spain's most horrible economic year of recent memory. Gross domestic product fell by 1 per cent, the sharpest recession in three decades. Only once in that period had the economy shown an annual decline - in 1981, and then by 0.2 per cent. In the first four years of Spanish membership of what is now the European Union, it had grown by an average 4.8 per cent a year. Mr Pedro Solbes, the independent technocrat promoted last year to economy and finance minister, says he is confident that Spain is on its way to recouping last year's slide and achieving positive growth of more than 1 per cent, possibly close to 1.5 per cent. With domestic demand depressed, the impetus for renewed growth is coming from exports and tourism. Spain's competitive position has improved in the wake of the three peseta devaluations between September 1992 and May 1993. Exports have been showing strong growth - not only to the rest of the EU, with which Spain was in surplus in January for the first time since it joined, but also to Latin America and emerging Asian economies. Tourism looks as if it may enjoy a boom year, helped by exchange rates - and by political violence in a number of other traditional Mediterranean destinations. The number of visitors to Spain this year is expected to surpass last year's 57m. Of the total, it is reckoned about 40m can be classified as tourists, roughly equal to the resident population. This combination can be expected almost to wipe out the traditional deficit in Spain's balance of payments current account, which fell last year by two-thirds to Pta632bn. Some analysts believe the figure could move into surplus for the first time since 1986, the year of Spanish EU accession. Mr Solbes, however, believes that expectation would be 'excessive'. Encouraged by a slight reduction in March in the number of unemployed registering with the National Employment Agency - a figure which in the past few years has shown a wide discrepancy with the quarterly survey - Mr Solbes believes unemployment will peak, beginning to fall towards the end of the year, and more sharply in 1995 and 1996. Most private forecasts are less optimistic on short-term growth than the government's, however. Mr Jaime de Pinies, head of research at Santander Investment, the merchant banking arm of Banco Santander, predicts GDP growth of 0.7 per cent for the year, or roughly half the official forecast. But he sees the economy picking up speed, growing towards the end of the year at an annual rate of 1.6 per cent. Next year he predicts 2 per cent growth, reaching an annual rate of 3 per cent late in the year. The climate is now favoured by a stable peseta and the lowest interest rates for many years. Last month the Bank of Spain's benchmark rate was reduced to below 8 per cent for the first time since 1977. The 12-month inflation rate stubbornly stuck at 5 per cent in the first three months of this year, slightly higher than 1992 levels, but is generally expected to fall below 4 per cent for the year, with the government target set at 3.5 per cent. Wage growth is for the moment contained. The risk which Mr Solbes recognises, however, is that in two or three years, with wage pressures undermining competitiveness and domestic demand pushing the current account deep into deficit, Spain could find itself once again having to devalue its way out of trouble. 'There is no doubt we have to be very careful,' Mr Solbes says, emphasising the need for wage moderation and control of government spending. Average wages last year rose by 2 per cent above inflation - 'a paradox' in a period of soaring unemployment. It makes no sense, he says, that the only option for Spanish companies wishing to become more competitive should be to shed jobs when there is such a large reserve of spare labour. He also argues that the government needs to 'go further' in steps to control spending, and is running out of leeway to increase tax revenues. The overall public sector deficit rose by 69 per cent last year to 7.3 per cent of GDP. Mr Solbes says it would be 'very hard' to bring this down to 3 per cent by 1997, one of the targets set in the EU's convergence programme for the third phase of economic and monetary union. He advocates welfare reforms and reduced subsidies to loss-making state companies. But all these measures are politically difficult. Although the ruling Socialist party, at its March conference, endorsed government free-market policies and a 'rigorous choice' in public spending, these policies are unlikely to please the party's grass-roots supporters. Last month, the government launched a series of television, radio and newspaper advertisements to persuade Spaniards to be public-spirited and pay their taxes. As a public relations exercise, however, it backfired: on the morning of the launch reports appeared alleging that the former governor of the Bank of Spain had avoided taxes on profits from stock investments while in office.</p>

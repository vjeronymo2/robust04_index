			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Petitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In many situations in the baseline determination, a refiner or importer is required to petition EPA in order to be allowed to account for a variance from a requirement. In other situations, the refiner or importer is required to ``show'' that it meets certain criteria. In either of these situations, approval will be given by the Director of the EPA's Office of Mobile Sources, or designee. As will be discussed below, all petitions must be included in the baseline submission_in fact, in most cases, baseline calculations have to be determined both with and without the requested variance, since the outcome of the request would be unknown. Although not previously proposed, EPA is allowing petitions and ``showings'' to be submitted prior to the baseline submission deadline although an early decision on the request is not guaranteed. Nonetheless, the baseline submission must be submitted by the applicable deadline, whether or not EPA has decided to approve or disapprove the request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Submission Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on comments to its proposals, EPA has determined that a number of its proposed baseline submission requirements were not pertinent to a baseline determination. EPA is thus requiring that, at minimum, the information described in &sect;80.93 be included in the baseline submission. Information on crudes and refinery unit operations is still required because EPA may wish to evaluate baseline submissions using a refinery flow simulation system. EPA plans to develop a sample baseline submission document which should be available soon after today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not previously required in the baseline submission, the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for each calendar year 1990 through 1993 must now be included. The blendstock-to-gasoline ratio is discussed further in Section IX, and is defined in &sect;80.102. Determination of this ratio is also subject to auditor verification, as is the entire baseline submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA may require submittal of more extensive data if such data is required to aid EPA in its review of the baseline submission, or if discrepancies in any part of the baseline submission are found. Additional information that may be useful to EPA in its evaluation of the baseline submission may be included, at the refiner's discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is slightly expanding the content required in the statement signed by the chief executive officer which is included in the baseline submission. The statement must state that the data submitted is the extent of the data available for the determination of each of the required baseline fuel parameter values, that sampling methodology and baseline calculations meet the requirements and intentions of the rulemaking, and that the final baseline parameter and emission values listed represent its 1990 gasoline, to the best of his or her knowledge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a refiner or importer desires that certain information in the baseline submission not be publicly available, it must a assert a claim of confidentiality, as discussed below, and include this request in the baseline submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Baseline Approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will approve baselines and upon approval publish, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the standards for each applicable gasoline producing or importing facility of a refiner, blender or importer. Because a party's baseline will become its standard for compliance with the anti-dumping and early reformulated gasoline requirements, EPA believes the standard should be publicly known, and as discussed below, there are no compelling reasons not to publish such information. Additionally, such standards are not entitled to confidential treatment (40 CFR 2.301(e), special confidentiality rules applicable to Clean Air Act cases). Thus, upon Agency approval of a baseline, the baseline exhaust benzene, exhaust toxics and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions values and 125 percent of the baseline sulfur, olefins and T90 values shall be published. This information is required on a refinery or facility basis because the reformulated gasoline requirements are on a refinery-basis, and because this information needs to be known in the event a refinery changes owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA previously proposed that it would publish baseline parameter values by refinery, it now believes that no substantive comments could result from publishing such information because of the complexity of the baseline determination. Additionally, EPA realizes that certain aspects of the baseline determination must necessarily remain confidential in order to prevent serious, negative competitive effects. Thus EPA is allowing any person or organization providing information to EPA in connection with the determination of a baseline, including establishing a baseline or investigating possible baseline discrepancies, to assert that some or all of the information submitted, except the baseline emissions or parameter values which are the standard for a refiner, refinery or importer, is entitled to confidential treatment as provided in 40 CFR part 2, subpart 2. Such confidential information shall be clearly distinguished from other information to the greatest extent possible, and clearly labeled ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information covered by a claim of confidentiality will be released by EPA only to the extent allowed by procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. Failure to submit a claim of confidentiality with submission of the baseline, however, may lead to release of information by EPA without further notice to the submitter (40 CFR 2.203 (a) and (c)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most comments on this topic addressed the publication of individual baseline information. Several commenters suggested publishing a refiner's or importer's anti-dumping index (ADI), a ratio of the individual baseline emissions to the statutory baseline emissions. However, there is little difference between this value and the actual value if the statutory baseline emissions are known. Another suggestion included providing such information only upon request. Again, there is little difference between ``on request'' and publishing such information at one time. One commenter stated that no where in the statute was publication of baseline data required. While that is true, EPA must release the standards (and any other non-CBI information) upon request, and there are benefits from publishing them, e.g., citizen suit enforcement, more information to the general public about EPA's standards, better deterrence to noncompliance. Commenters did not provide any clear or compelling reason for not publishing the standards, and there are benefits from publishing them, as discussed. Additional comments, which did not affect the final rule, and EPA responses can be found in the RIA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

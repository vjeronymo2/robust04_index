			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. PROBING DONATIONS BY DEVELOPERS TO PICUS AND WOO  </P> <P> Investigators are looking into multiple developer contributions accepted by  recently reelected City Council members Joy Picus and Michael Woo as possible  violations of Los Angeles' strict $500-per-person limit on campaign  contributions, city officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Since voters passed the campaign limit in 1985, there have been repeated  accusations that candidates and contributors are seeking to circumvent the law  through various strategies.  </P> <P> City Clerk Elias Martinez confirmed Tuesday that his office is investigating  both Picus' and Woo's campaign statements at the request of the city attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Although Martinez would give no details, Woo campaign manager Steve Afriat said  the investigation centers on 14 contributions of $500 each accepted by the  councilman from seven executives of the Lycon Group, a development firm, and  from their children.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Returned Some Donations  </P> <P> "We returned half of the contributions, those from the children, because they  seemed to go against the law, because the money actually appeared to come from  the parents," Afriat said.  </P> <P> "But Mike didn't catch it right away, so the returns didn't show up on our last  campaign statement in late March. So I guess someone complained."  </P> <P> He expressed confidence that investigators would drop the case once they  examine the cancelled checks by which the seven contributions from children of  executives were returned.  </P> <P> The Picus inquiry stems from a letter sent to City Atty. James K. Hahn by Paul  McKellips, one of five candidates whom the councilwoman edged out in the  election April 11.  </P> <P> McKellips said Tuesday that he urged investigators to look into $500  contributions from Sherman Oaks developer Edward L. Saunders, his wife and son  Brad, who lives at the family home in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raises Question  </P> <P> "When a child lives at home, it raises the question of whether he put up the  money or whether his parents did it using him as a figurehead," McKellips said.  </P> <P> "Brad is swimming in money," Anita Harkavy, an executive assistant at Saunders  Development Corp., said Tuesday. "He is very wealthy on his own without mom and  dad."  </P> <P> She termed Brad Saunders, 22, an "enthusiastic supporter of Picus in his own  right."  </P> <P> Also questioned by McKellips were three $500 contributions from Selleck  Properties Inc., a Woodland Hills development firm.  </P> <P> Two of the checks were sent in the name of other firms with the same address --  Sherman Way-White Oak Associates and Tampa-Saticoy Associates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Separate Businesses?  </P> <P> Noting that the law also limits business entities to $500 each per candidate,  McKellips asked, "Are these really separate businesses? I think that should be  checked into."  </P> <P> Bob Selleck, managing general partner and brother of actor Tom Selleck, said  Tuesday that he is convinced that the three firms, each of which is a different  partnership, "are separate under the law's definition.  </P></p>

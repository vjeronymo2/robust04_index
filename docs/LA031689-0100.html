			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART-MINDED CROWD FETES LAUNCH OF NEW MAGAZINE  </P> <P> As Robert Crothers said, this was the last audience he had to convince about  the importance of contemporary art in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But the art-minded crowd listened patiently anyway as Crothers, publisher of  the new Artcoast magazine, gave his pitch about L. A. as the new center for  modern art at a party to kick off the magazine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Main Attraction  </P> <P> The setting was the R. M. Schindler house on North Kings Road in West  Hollywood. The rarely seen house, surrounded by high hedges, was a key draw for  the guests who attended the cocktail reception Monday night. Museum curators,  artists, gallery owners, art scholars and art appreciators wandered through the  house, which is owned by Friends of the Schindler House, admiring its  minimalist architectural design and warming themselves by the pressed sawdust  logs in the fireplaces.  </P> <P> Guests strolled out on the lawn for drinks and Chinese hors d'oeuvres, part of  the Pacific Rim theme of the evening. The magazine, after all, is subtitled  "Contemporary Art East and West," and uses Los Angeles as a focal point for  exploring "visual culture," according to the premiere issue.  </P> <P> Darkness made perusing the magazine next to impossible, but guests did their  best anyway to leaf through the heavy volume, which makes its debut this month  at a hefty $6.  </P> <P> "We thought about having the reception in a restaurant," Crothers said, "but I  think people appreciate the fact that we did something different."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Guest List  </P> <P> Among the appreciative were artist David Hockney (with his two dachshunds in  tow); magazine editor Kay Larson; Schindler house curator Robert Sweeney;  producers Ray Stark and Douglas Cramer; Museum of Contemporary Art curator Mary  Jane Jacobs; Stephanie Baron and Maurice Tuchman, curators at the Los Angeles  County Museum of Art; gallery owner Margo Levin; MOCA board member Fred  Nicholas and wife Joan; Henry Hopkins, director of the Frederick R. Weisman Art  Foundation; Al Nodal, city cultural affairs department general manager, and  artists John Baldessari and Don Bachardy, who talked about his upcoming book of  portraits of writer Christopher Isherwood.  </P> <P> Said Bachardy of the portraits, done in the last six months of Isherwood's  life: "It was the most extraordinary experience of my life -- so far."  </P></p>

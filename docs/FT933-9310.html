			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold rise saves Australian firms GOLD'S RECENT price rise came just in time to save 30 to 40 junior Australian exploration and mining companies, said Mr Ross Louthean, managing director of the Australian mining publishing and research company, Resource Information Unit, yesterday. Many junior companies 'were hanging on by the knuckles', without cash to explore and a poor climate for joint ventures. Now they had been able to raise cash and money spent on minerals exploration would jump by at least 40 per cent this year, he said, at the launch of the latest edition of the Register of Australian Mining which lists every mining, oil and gas project from Admiral Hill to Zeolite Australia. Every available drilling rig was at work - including some that should have been retired years ago - and Australia was on track to maintain its position as the third or fourth-largest gold producer in the world.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- Parliament today passed on  second reading the Judiciary Act. It regulates the structure of  the judicial system on the basis of the 1991 Constitution.  Under this act, the judiciary will consist of three independent  parts: law courts, prosecutor's offices, and investigative  bodies.    The act provides for the setting up of courts of appeal, a  Supreme Cassation Court and a Supreme Administrative Court,  beside existing regional, district and military courts. Thus  the presence two-instance system is replaced with a  three-instance one.    The Supreme Cassation Court (SCC) is the final authority on  criminal and civil proceedings. It will exercise supervision  over all law courts. The court will also exercise appellate  jurisdiction over all judgments and orders of the courts of  appeal. The SCC will have a civil, criminal and military  divisions.    The Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) will exercise  supervision over administrative proceedings. It will be the  court of last resort to rule on the legality of administrative  acts. It is the only authority to rule on the legality of acts  issued by the executive.    So far the functions of a Supreme Cassation Court and a  Supreme Administrative Court have been performed by the Supreme  Court.    The structure of the prosecution will be analogous with the  structure of the court authorities: Bulgaria will have  district, military-district regional, military-appeals, and  appeals prosecutor's offices and a Prosecutor General's Office.  The prosecutors will be independent of the court.    Investigators will carry out preliminary investigations in  criminal proceedings. The act provides for centralized  supervision of investigative services by a National  Investigation Service. The National Investigation Service will  investigate especially complicated cases on the territory of  this country, crimes committed abroad and cases opened under  legal assistance treaties with other states. In the course of  debates some MP's spoke against the existence of a National  Investigation Service, citing the Constitution, which does not  provide for a centralized investigative body.    The act regulates the status of judges, prosecutors and  investigators. They will be appointed, promoted, demoted, moved  and dismissed by the Supreme Judicial Council. Judges,  prosecutors and investigators become irreplaceable following  three years in office and are granted immunity. Immunity may be  lifted by the Supreme Judicial Council, if there is enough  evidence of the commitment of a public law offence.    The act sets an experience requirement for judges,  investigators and prosecutors. Heated debates were caused by a  text in the act requiring the presidents of the Supreme  Cassation Court and the Supreme Administrative Court, the  Prosecutor General and the director of the National  Investigation Service to have served for at least 14 years in  the legal system, of which at least 5 years as, respectively,  judges, prosecutors or investigators. According to Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) MP's, this text was aimed against  President of the Supreme Court Ivan Grigorov and Prosecutor  General Ivan Tatarchev, who have served only as lawyers. SDS  MP's described the text as a step toward recommunization.  Describing the provision as unconstitutional, they said they  would refer the matter to the Constitutional Court.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Veslo report under the "Recipes" rubric: "A </F> Detailed Reply by the LDPR to Mr. Svanidze. Zhirinovskiy  Faction's Innovations Run Up Against `Russia's Choice'"]    [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democrats, outraged  by television journalist Nikolay Svanidze's statements that the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] has not submitted a  single draft to the Duma, told the public about their lawmaking  activities and their economic research efforts.    LDPR deputies explained that all of their innovations run up  against "Russia's Choice" opposition in the Duma Council and at  plenary sittings. For this reason the draft laws "On Regulation  of Ownership in the Russian Federation," "On Russian Federation  Property Abroad," "On Trust," "On the Restoration of Property  Rights of Russian Federation Citizens Violated in the Period 17  March 1917 through 12 December 1993," and "On the Brain Drain  From the Russian Federation" have not become full-fledged state  acts after all.    The journalists' close attention was drawn to the first  three  draft laws. The law "On Trust" was drafted by Deputy Aleksey  Zuyev, who, before his election, was adviser to the president of  the "GMM" trust company, whose activities drew complaints from  the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. The other two laws  are devoted to the implementation of the party's economic  program. The one regulating the rights of ownership puts an end  to the voucher privatization that is nearly completed anyhow.  Instead of this robbery, all citizens of the Russian Federation  are supposed to open Savings Bank accounts marked "NP" (National  Property), "PP" (Privatized Property), and the "RNP" (Regional  National Property). The various owners -- the state, the  regions, and private owners who have snapped up their share of  the generous LDPR handouts -- are supposed to put their earnings  in these accounts. It has been decided to name this process  privatization. That, the Liberal Democratic innovators have  calculated, would make for a comfortable life for 60 percent of  Russia's citizens.    It is even easier with investments in industry -- one only  has to mortgage all Russian Federation property abroad in  Japanese banks, to pour all the earned yen into the needy  enterprises, to ban without fail liberalization of external  trade, to stir the concoction and have Mr. Zhirinovskiy and his  economic advisers drink it up with a feeling of deep gratitude.  A sudden drain of healthy brains, if the program gets  implemented, can be prevented by the corresponding law drafted  in the committee on geopolitics.</p>

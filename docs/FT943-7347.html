			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Turkmen gas accord with Iran The presidents of Iran and Turkmenistan were yesterday due to sign an agreement to allow the building of a Dollars 7bn pipeline to carry Turkmen gas via Iran and Turkey to Europe, said Iran's oil minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Reuter reports from Tehran. Presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran and Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan met yesterday to put the final touches on the deal. They were today due to 'break the ground at a site along the pipeline route south of Tehran,' said Mr Aqazadeh, in a symbolic start to the project. Mr Aqazadeh said the pipeline would take six to eight years to build, with the 1,450 km section in Iran costing Dollars 3.5bn, half of which would be financed by Iran. The Iranian section would be transferred to Iranian ownership after 25 years, he said. The pipeline, which will have an initial annual capacity of 15bn cubic metres, to be expanded to 28bn cubic metres in a second phase, is crucial for Turkmenistan whose former gas export routes through Russia were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union. It will be by far Iran's biggest joint project with Moslem ex-Soviet republics.</p>

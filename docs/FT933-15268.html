			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace British Aerospace's refinancing of its banking arrangements is a predictable surprise. The net worth ceiling of the old facilities was a well-known constraint on the management's capacity to shuffle its assets. BAe has enough headroom to provide against its aircraft leases in this year's figures, but insufficient to provide for putting its Jetstream aircraft business into a joint venture. That constraint will be gone once the changeover is complete in six or nine months. The new arrangement usefully lengthens the life of BAe's banking lines, and allows managers to focus on issues such as cash flow as well as net worth. The ratchet up of the interest cover and gearing covenants also illustrates the banks' faith in a profits recovery over the next few years, while the facility is even large enough for BAe to be able to lose a few syndicate members along the way without causing it any problems. Still, when a company buys itself elbow room, one wonders what it will do with it. Jetstream is almost certainly heading into a joint venture, but Rover will probably stay. Given the effort BAe has put into the company, and the poor state of the car industry, it will want to run Rover for profits. Property looks fairly valued, so further write-downs are unlikely. If the Matra missile deal is eventually struck, there may be some rationalisation costs, but that is not yet in the bag. Indeed, the sub-plot of the abortive GEC talks may have been pressure from Lord Weinstock for a BAe/GEC missile deal instead of a BAe/Matra joint venture. However, more wholesale surgery on the BAe balance sheet seems improbable. While the formal constraint has gone, the company hardly has net worth to burn.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson increases first-half profits to Dollars 151.8m JARDINE MATHESON, the diversified Hong Kong trading and investment company, yesterday posted a 12.4 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 151.8m in the six months to June 30 from Dollars 135.1m in the same period last year. Profits were struck on a 12.6 per cent rise in turnover to Dollars 3.8bn from Dollars 3.38bn. The directors declared an interim dividend of 3.7 cents a share, up 9 per cent on the 3.4 cents last time. Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, underlined the advantages of the company's geographical spread and the strength of its balance sheet. He said these gave the board confidence that satisfactory results would be achieved in 1992. Although the company's results were broadly in line with predictions, there was surprise at the better-than-expected performance of Jardine Pacific, the core of the restructured Jardine Matheson. Earnings for the subsidiary rose - mainly because of the strong performance of its motor vehicle offshoot - in spite of a weak performance in Japan, where the recession affected profits. The company said Jardine Pacific's financial services and security divisions performed well, but engineering and construction - of which its half-ownership of Gammon is the core - performed less well. JIB Group, the company's UK-listed insurance broker, made Dollars 19.3m in the first half. Unfavourable market conditions and the as yet unresolved problems at Lloyd's will mean that full-year profits are likely to fall short of earlier hopes, the company said. Jardine Fleming, its joint venture brokerage, increased its operating profit during the first half. Funds under management grew 8 per cent to Dollars 10.5bn at June 30.</p>

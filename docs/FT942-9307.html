			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Top car dealers' profits up sharply The top 200 car dealer groups substantially increased their profits last year as sales began recovering from their deepest recession since the second world war. However, the improvement was more the result of tough cost-cutting measures than increases in sales volume, according to an analysis of the sector's performance by motor trade monitoring group Sewells International and the trade newspaper Motor Trader. The analysis shows that the top 200 groups, which between them account for about one-third of new-car sales, collectively earned pre-tax profits of Pounds 294m, a 75 per cent increase on 1992. The total value of sales, at Pounds 17bn, was only 21 per cent higher than the Pounds 14bn achieved a year earlier. The figures were achieved against the background of an 11.6 per cent rise - to 1.78m - in the UK new-car market last year. This was still well below the 2.3m achieved in the record year of 1989. The analysis shows that even dealer groups with a return on sales of 2.6 per cent did well enough to warrant a top 20 place in the profitability stakes - 'which once again shows the terribly low margins in the motor trade compared with other sectors', according to the analysis. Top performer by this yardstick was the relatively small Hanro group, which made a 10.15 per cent return on sales. AFG Holdings was second with 7.5 per cent. The UK's biggest motor retailer with 134 outlets, Lex Retail, achieved a ninth-placed 3.27 per cent return on sales. The analysis also shows a sharp increase in takeover activity, with the 20 largest groups now controlling some 950 of the UK's 7,400 franchised car dealership outlets.</p>

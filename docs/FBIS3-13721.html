Speaking to reporters after meeting Vatican Foreign Minister  Jean Louis Tauran, 'Arafat said that what is needed is a  response by the U.S. Administration, the United States [as  received], and Russia, who are the cosponsors of the peace  conference, and the Security Council to the just demands of the  Palestinian people, namely, international protection for our  children, women, men, masses, and the Islamic and Christian  sacred places. He added: I ask the U.S. Administration to  release the Security Council resolution it has been detaining  for 19 days by not allowing a vote at the Security Council. He  added: Our people and the rest of the world have a right to  hear the Security Council opinion on the massacre at the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    'Arafat noted that this massacre committed by extremist  settlers against worshippers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque for no  reason cannot be the work of a mentally disturbed person, as  Israel says. He asked: The commission of inquiry noted that  the murderer fired 111 bullets, but how could 111 bullets kill  or wound over 200 people?    'Arafat stressed that more than one person must have  participated in the crime. He asked: Why didn't the Israeli  army, which was stationed in front of the mosque when Israel  took over the place and turned it into a Jewish synagogue,  interfere? Where were the Israeli guards, who are present night  and day, at the time of the crime?    'Arafat added another question: Are we facing a new secret  organization within the Israeli Army or is the entire Israeli  Army involved? I want a clear, explicit answer before I give  any answers about the Palestinian position, he concluded.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NYC BALLET OPENS WITH BALANCHINE;  </P> <P> FIRST NIGHT: BEGINNING A NEW ENGAGEMENT IN COSTA MESA, THE DANCERS SHOW BOTH  AUTHORITY AND INCONSISTENCY IN FOUR WORKS BY THE CELEBRATED CHOREOGRAPHER.  </P> <P> Who owns the ballets of George Balanchine? Is the obvious answer the most  truthful?  </P> <P> The issue of ownership, of primacy, loomed large Tuesday, when New York City  Ballet brought to the Orange County Performing Arts Center four Balanchine  masterworks familiar to local audiences from performances by other companies.  </P> <P> Linked by his bold and often profound musicality, here was the unsurpassed  purity of form Balanchine defined in "Concerto Barocco" (1941), the charming  vivacity of impulse in the Gottschalk "Tarantella" (1964), the startling  modernistic innovation of "The Four Temperaments" (1946) and the imposing  affirmation of academic tradition in "Theme and Variations" (1947).  </P> <P> As the House of Balanchine -- the touchstone of his style -- City Ballet should  have looked equally authoritative in each of these classics. In fact, only "The  Four Temperaments" escaped the imbalances in casting and deficiencies of  production that plagued the program.  </P> <P> Capped by Peter Boal's brilliant performance of the Melancholic variation  (intensely private yet filling the stage with his sense of need), the "4 Ts"  also boasted the superbly sharp, forceful legwork of Diana White in the  Choleric section, the nearly visionary gestural eloquence of Adam Luders in the  Phlegmatic sequence and the drop-dead exactitude of Melinda Roy and Jock Soto  in the Sanguinic duet. In addition, the Hindemith score inspired the best  playing of the night from the company orchestra conducted by Hugo Fiorato.  </P> <P> However "Concerto Barocco" found the orchestra sounding slovenly in the Bach  double violin concerto and Heather Watts looking both mannered and heavy  (clenched balances, labored phrasing) opposite a conscientious Otto Neubert and  a dutiful Judith Fugate.  </P> <P> Fugate appeared no more distinctive in "Theme and Variations," making her debut  as the prima in place of the indisposed Merrill Ashley. No gaffes, no lapses of  taste, but no majesty or presence either. And though Lindsay Fischer brought a  measure of suavity to the demanding solos of her cavalier, the sublime pas de  deux went nowhere.  </P> <P> After performances by San Francisco Ballet, the Kirov and American Ballet  Theatre, "Theme and Variations" had virtually become the official ballet of the  Orange County Performing Arts Center -- but the City Ballet version scarcely  measured up in either overall dancing finesse or production values. Nicolas  Benois' costumes proved particularly unfortunate . . .  </P> <P> Immediately preceding "Theme": three short, relatively unfamiliar neo-Romantic  ballets that Balanchine choreographed in 1970 and wrapped together with the  earlier work as "Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3." Each of these prequels featured a  lone male and a minicorps of women in long, filmy, scooped-neck gowns, their  hair worn loose, their movement style restless and fluid.  </P> <P> In "Elegie," a brooding Kipling Houston pursued and lost the very glamorous  Maria Calegari. In "Valse Melancolique," an effortful Nilas Martins danced with  the deft Lauren Hauser as if both were under a spell or lost in a dream.  </P> <P> Finally, in "Scherzo," Nichol Hlinka and Gen Horiuchi flew through a virtuosic  coda to this three-part distillation of 19th-Century vision scenes: those  poetic fantasies of yearning that contrast with the aristocratic formality of  the ballroom (or wedding) acts represented by "Theme."  </P> <P> Completing the program: that zesty "Tarantella," with the highly accomplished  but overbearing Damian Woetzel mismatched with the technically uneven but  magnificently kittenish Margaret Tracey.  </P> <P> This company may not always be equal to its ambitions, but dancers like Boal,  White, Luders, Calegari and Tracey do make the choreography their own and share  their discoveries with a generosity that remains a City Ballet hallmark. They  own Balanchine's ballets and, when they dance, so do we.  </P> <P> Performances will continue through Sunday afternoon.  </P></p>

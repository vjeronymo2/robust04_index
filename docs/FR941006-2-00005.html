Samples shall be analyzed at a laboratory approved by the State regulatory agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Milk shall be tested for bacterial estimate by using one of the following methods or by any other method approved by Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Direct microscopic clump count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Standard plate count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Plate loop count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Pectin gel plate count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Petrifilm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> TM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  aerobic count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Spiral plate count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Hydrophobic grid membrane filter count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Impedance/conductance count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Whenever the bacterial estimate indicates the presence of more than 500,000 bacteria per ml., the following procedures shall be applied:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The producer shall be notified with a warning of the excessive bacterial estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whenever two of the last four consecutive bacterial estimates exceed 500,000 per ml., the appropriate regulatory authority shall be notified and a written warning notice given to the producer. The notice shall be in effect so long as two of the last four consecutive samples exceed 500,000 per ml.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) An additional sample shall be taken after a lapse of 3 days but within 21 days of the notice required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If this sample also exceeds 500,000 per ml., subsequent milkings shall be excluded from the market until satisfactory compliance is obtained. Shipment may be resumed and a temporary status assigned to the producer by the appropriate State regulatory agency when an additional sample of herd milk is tested and found satisfactory. The producer shall be assigned a full reinstatement status when three out of four consecutive bacterial estimates do not exceed 500,000 per ml. The samples shall be taken at a rate of not more than two per week on separate days within a 3-week period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Sec. C7. is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

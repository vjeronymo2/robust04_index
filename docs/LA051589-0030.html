			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TO ASK $1 BILLION FOR NEW PRISONS, NO ASSAULT RIFLE BAN  </P> <P> As part of a sweeping anti-crime package to be unveiled today, President Bush  will seek $1 billion in funding for prison construction to house 26,000 new  federal prisoners over the next four years but has decided to postpone any new  attempt to outlaw assault rifles, Administration officials said Sunday.  </P> <P> A senior White House aide told reporters traveling in Kentucky with the  President that the Administration would advocate a "hard look" as to whether  additional steps might be needed to restrict domestic production of the  weapons. Other officials said that in the meantime the Administration will rely  on an existing law that bars entry only to foreign-made weapons not suitable  for sporting purposes.  </P> <P> The exclusion of an assault rifle ban from the package represents a decision by  the White House to emphasize traditional programs aimed at reducing crime  rather than more controversial forays into gun control.  </P> <P> Officials said White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu had played a central  role in blocking efforts to address assault guns directly, which had initially  been advocated by national drug policy director William J. Bennett and other  Administration officials.  </P> <P> The decision also represents a victory by the National Rifle Assn., which had  lobbied ferociously in an effort to block any new assault gun legislation. In  the face of that effort, a number of members of Congress had warned the White  House that they would have difficulty supporting any initiative opposed by the  powerful organization.  </P> <P> "I think you could say that politics won out," one source said.  </P> <P> In settling on the final terms of the crime package, White House officials also  decided not to declare a national "crime emergency," as had been seriously  considered. "The crime figures just didn't support that kind of declaration,"  one Administration official said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Prosecutors, Agents  </P> <P> The dramatic boost in prison space sought by the Administration is the central  element in a proposal that also calls for 1,600 additional federal prosecutors,  800 more law enforcement agents and a widening of the federal death penalty to  include hard-core repeat offenders convicted of using firearms to commit  murder. The 800 new personnel include 300 FBI agents and 150 U.S. marshals.  </P> <P> The package would also toughen the penalties for a number of firearms-related  crimes, including crimes committed while using an assault weapon. All are part  of an effort to deter criminals by making more certain that they would face  stringent penalties if convicted.  </P> <P> Officials put the overall cost of the package at $1.7 billion but said the  initiative would require no new funds to be allocated by Congress. "This is  just money being moved around," one source said.  </P> <P> The bulk of the proposal is to be funded through sales of federal properties  and the use of funds generated by the sale of assets seized from criminals,  officials said.  </P> <P> As an additional cost-saving measure, they said the Administration would seek  to convert some recently shut military bases into the new penitentiaries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Called Cheap  </P> <P> Only with such innovative measures, one official indicated, could the White  House hope to create 26,000 jail spaces for $1 billion. Under a generally  accepted formula for the cost of prison construction, the price tag would be  about double that amount.  </P> <P> In addition to emphasizing prison construction and other crime deterrence  measures, Bush will address the assault gun issue indirectly by calling for  restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines that can be sold, one official  said.  </P> <P> Assault rifles are known in part for their large magazines, some of which can  hold up to 30 cartridges, which help to give them a paramilitary appearance.  </P> <P> In addition, officials said, Bush plans to advocate mandatory minimum sentences  for criminals who use guns and a five-year ban on sales of weapons to anyone  convicted of a crime punishable by six months or more of incarceration.  </P> <P> Officials said Bush also plans to declare that the current temporary import ban  on more than 30 types of assault weapons -- imposed March 14 at the urging of  Bennett -- will be made permanent after the Treasury Department's Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms completes an investigation into how the weapons  are generally used.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1968 Law on Importation  </P> <P> But they said Bush would favor an import ban only on the weapons that the  agency determines are not generally used for hunting, target shooting and other  sporting purposes.  </P> <P> Such action is required under a 1968 law, which authorizes the importation into  the United States only of weapons "generally recognized as suitable for  sporting purposes."  </P> <P> "We'll see what definitions these weapons fall under," Andrew H. Card Jr.,  deputy White House chief of staff, told reporters in Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Although officials provided few specific details about the package Sunday,  their identification of seized criminal assets as a major source of prison  funding raised questions about how other agencies that now rely on the funds  would be affected.  </P> <P> Of the $220 million in funds generated last year from assets seized from  criminals -- most of them drug dealers -- $110 million was returned to state  and local agencies as a reward for their law enforcement role. Another $90  million went to federal efforts by the FBI, the Drug Enforcement  Administration, U.S. attorneys and other agencies.  </P> <P> Beginning next year, about $115 million of the fund will be directly controlled  by Bennett's office, which has already agreed to divert it to prison  construction. But other agencies might have to look elsewhere for funding if  prison construction is given top priority.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government will hold a trade conference (to be  chaired by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata) on 15 June to discuss  import-increasing measures at both the government and  private-sector levels in an effort to reduce Japan's trade  surplus. It will invite financial representatives from foreign  countries to Japan for the first time to hear their opinions on  such issues as deregulation measures in connection with foreign  firms' access to the Japanese market. The Japanese industrial  circle will also brief on its efforts to expand imports and will  make requests to the government. In response, the government  plans to reflect their opinions and requests in concrete  measures in an outline of reforming external economic relations  to be worked out at the end of June.    The government has decided to invite foreign representatives  to Japan because it has concluded that it is necessary to hear  opinions directly from foreign businessmen in order to increase  imports.</p>

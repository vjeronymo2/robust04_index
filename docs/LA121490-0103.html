			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: TWO DUNN ONE-ACTS UP FRONT WITH INNER LIVES  </P> <P> Most playwrights like to keep that most precious of narrative devices -- a  character's back story -- in the wings. For his one-act pair, "The Sterile  Shadow" and "Coyote Summer," at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood, writer/director  Harry Dunn brings his back stories out on stage.  </P> <P> "Shadow" is much cruder in this regard than "Coyote," as it shows us a young  man named Bobby (Tanner Parsons) talking to an offstage shrink about his  identity crisis. It's imprisoning dramatically, since the piece can't be  anything more than Bobby revealing a past dominated by a now-dead older brother  and deep confusion over women. This is only as theatrical as the actor doing  the monologue, and Parsons lends Bobby a quiet desperation that never once  indulges in emotional excess.  </P> <P> Some may carp that "Coyote's" depiction of two female strangers meeting in a  campground -- unkempt, earthy Margie (Melissa Berger) and delicate, prissy  Rydell (Denise Cochran) -- is more of the same schematic and formulaic stuff  that passes for comedy these days.  </P> <P> But they would be missing the wonderful intangibles here: how Margie projects  her disgust for her own jilting boyfriend onto Rydell's (Christopher Turman,  who lacks a dominating edge) or how Rydell swings back and forth between her  need for male security and Margie's call for independence. Their back stories  may be front and center, but Berger and Cochran uncover some sad and touching  mysteries.  </P> <P> "The Sterile Shadow" and "Coyote Summer," Theatre/Theater, 1713 N. Cahuenga  Blvd., Hollywood, Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Jan 5. $10; (213) 871-6985.  Running time: 2 hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Masked Angel' Declines at Cast  </P> <P> Bruce Dale's "Masked Angel," at the Cast Theatre in Hollywood, is a fable that  seems lost in continental drift. It depicts the effect a young Danish  Adonis-type who's new to the States (Alexis Arquette) has on an American  gallery owner (Ian Ross) with a bloated ego and a taste for sadomasochism.  Ross' cynical assistant (Peter Gregorycq) shares his boss' corruption but not  his girlfriend's (Shandra Beri) careerism. Meanwhile, Ross' key American patron  (Marianne Bergonzi) acts like an aesthetic Mafioso and Ross' favorite artist --  a Russian (Alexa Hunter) -- feels used.  </P> <P> It's the sick, fetid Americans against the idealist Europeans, which is an odd  spin on history. This isn't as bothersome as how Dale's play starts out with a  complex rhythm and wit and gradually declines into obvious metaphors swirling  around the warping of love into pain and the betrayal of beauty. Similarly,  director Paul Warner's initially stark imagery gives way to posings and a  mannered Pieta tableau at the end.  </P> <P> "Masked Angel," Cast Theatre, 804 N. El Centro, Hollywood, Wednedays-Thursday,  8 p.m. Ends Jan. 15. $10; (213) 462-0265. Running time: 1 hour, 15 minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Sexual Confusion in 'High Strung Quartet'  </P> <P> You feel underdressed sitting down to Leslie Irons' production of Evan  Bridenstien's "High Strung Quartet (for Unstrung Voices)" at West Coast  Ensemble in Hollywood. There's John Ballowe's glistening drawing room set, and  then Irons' handsome quartet of actors elegantly sit down in their best black  evening wear.  </P> <P> But, like "Tamara," things soon get messy between the characters, all nicknamed  by David (Stefan Kalinka), who calls himself "Spoon": "Lash" (Chuck Marra),  Spoon's roomie who swears too much that he's not gay and likes "Sheets" (Yvette  Heyden), who dislikes Lash but has her eye on "Brush" (Ron Houck), who has his  eye on Spoon.  </P> <P> Sounds confusing, but unlike "Tamara," "Quartet" isn't messy enough. Lash's and  Brush's confusion over their sexual identities triggers the four-way roundelay  with the straight Sheets and gay Spoon as poles, but Irons fails in his  deliberately static staging to make the confusion truly giddy and dizzying.  While Houck nicely suggests a fine chap who can't make up his mind and Kalinka  infuses warmth into a hopelessly goody-good caricature, Heyden isn't bitchy  enough and Marra is hardly the effeminate-looking guy we're told about in the  text.  </P> <P> "High Strung Quartet (with Unstrung Voices)," West Coast Ensemble, 6240  Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends  Feb. 2. $12; (213) 871-1052. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Hunger After One-Acts at West Hollywood  </P> <P> Three courses of one-acts -- or "Trois Entrees," as it's pretentiously called  at the West Hollywood Playhouse -- do not always make a meal.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Hatcher's "Downtown," for instance, concludes with a gimmick that  undercuts what had been a slightly biting, cagey depiction of three young  writers (Alexander Apple, Ray Ivey and Justine Madero) trying to out-do the  Bret Easton Ellis/Jay McInerney crowd. The cast relishes tossing out Hatcher's  mean zingers; now, they should ask for a rewrite.  </P> <P> Lori Goodman has neither a gimmick nor an ending for her "Reservations for  Two," about a calm guy (Cooper Layne) trying to dine with his frazzled date  (Veronica Blak). Blak loses control over her woman losing control, and all  Layne can do is leave.  </P> <P> At least there's a little more going on in Bob Krakower's "4 AM (Open All  Night)," such as whether Riley Wood's married man will quit moaning to the  diner owner (Richard Fast) and hit up on Molly Lorenz' clearly single woman.  There's a potential sexual tension that completely escapes the cast and renders  the scene vaporous.  </P> <P> Deborra-Lee Furness directed.  </P> <P> "Trois Entrees," West Hollywood Playhouse, 666 N. Robertson Blvd., today, 8 and  10 p.m.; Saturday 8 p.m. Ends Saturday. $8; (213) 962-7056. Running time: 55  minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wide Torsos' Leaves a Gap at igLoo  </P> <P> Any show that promises music by Yello, Mantovani, Throbbing Gristle, J. S.  Bach, Jon Hassell and Brian Eno and a title like "Of All the Wide Torsos in All  the Wild Glen" already sounds interesting.  </P> <P> But what our ears get with Paul Peditto's play at igLoo in Hollywood is a  meaningless assault, like a rattling heater blowing too much hot air. Peditto  intends to give grotesquely comic heft to the American obsession with fame and  physical make-over: Thus, his obese famous playwright Maxwell (David Robinson,  in a numbingly nattering performance) is in a plastic surgeon's waiting room  before he goes under the knife. For no particular reason the doctor's assistant  (Maria Tirabassi) takes an interest in the plump scribe.  </P> <P> The rest is a tiresome duet, filled with musings about Esquire magazine's  values and the parallels between eating and sexual disorders. Chris Peditto  didn't so much direct as steer traffic, which really becomes a nonsensical jam  when a delivery man from a hamburger joint brings in a pizza. Let's add theater  disorders to the list.  </P> <P> "Of All the Wide Torsos in All the Wild Glen," igLoo, 6543 Santa Monica Blvd.,  Hollywood, Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 4. $7; (213) 962-3771. Running  time: 1 hour, 5 minutes.  </P> <P> </P></p>

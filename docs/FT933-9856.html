			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Jump in German unemployment: Short-timers laid off over holidays WEST Germany's unemployment rate jumped from 7 to 7.5 per cent last month as companies took advantage of summer breaks and vacations to lay off employees working on short-time schedules. The number of west Germans unemployed reached a seasonally adjusted 2.3m in July, an increase of 159,000 over June. Nearly half a million more people were unemployed last month than in July 1992. The number of people on short-time work in the west decreased by 41.5 per cent, from 879,191 people to just over a half a million, last month. Short-time workers are defined as employees who stay on their companies' payrolls but work less than the normal 38 hours per week. Part of their salary is covered by the federal labour office. 'This shows that hidden unemployment in Germany is now increasingly turning into real unemployment,' Mr Michael Fuchs, president of the German Association of Wholesale Exporters, the BGA, said. Economists have warned that unemployment statistics do not take account of workers who remain on payrolls through short-time work or retraining schemes. Many say this so-called 'second labour market' would considerably boost the unemployment rate if the recession continued and these workers were made redundant. The number of workers in retraining programmes and job creation schemes also dropped slightly in the west to 369,797, continuing its downward trend since the beginning of the year. Similar figures surfaced in east Germany, where the unemployment rate jumped to 15.3 per cent, compared with 14.4 in the previous two months. An additional 66,800 people were reported to be jobless, bringing total unemployment to 1.16m. The number of people on short-time work fell by 22.5 per cent to 155,331. People in retraining programmes and job creation schemes also decreased by more than 60,000 to 601,713. The overall number of people leaving these schemes is likely to continue to increase steadily this year after the federal labour office announced in February it could no longer finance new programmes because of the widening deficit between contributions from the employed and unemployment benefit payments. German inflation rose by 0.2 percentage points in July to 4.3 per cent year-on-year, confirming provisional figures indicating a modest rise in the cost of living due to high rents and service costs as well as an increase in taxes on insurance premiums, introduced on July 1.</p>

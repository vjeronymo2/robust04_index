			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commodities' underlying trend remains strong The overall trend remained strong in the commodity markets yesterday. Gold continued its rise while leading base metals touched fresh peaks before running into profit-taking. Oil prices rallied after sustaining early falls. The biggest losers were coffee and cocoa, which surrendered some of last week's advances in thin trading. Gold prices surged upwards in London following the pattern set in New York, where in late trading on Friday the precious metal moved up sharply. According to dealers this US lift-off for gold was caused by a combination of higher grains, oil and base metals prices coinciding with weakness in the US dollar and bond markets. The gold price reached Dollars 391 a troy ounce at the London morning 'fixing', the highest 'fix' for three months. But it opened weaker in New York and a wave of fund selling on the New York Commodity Exchange caused uncertainty during the London afternoon 'fixing' session. Instead of lasting only a few minutes the session went on for 40 minutes, according to one dealer the longest 'fix' since August 1992. However, the volume of trade was not big. The London price closed at 390.40 an ounce, up Dollars 2.20 from Friday's close. Analysts said there was very strong technical resistance between Dollars 392 and Dollars 395 an ounce and gold would have to work hard to break through that level. Copper reached a 21-month peak of Dollars 2,477 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange in early trading but then some investment funds decided to take their profits after the metal's recent heady performance and halted the rise. However, the important technical support at Dollars 2,420 a tonne held firm and copper for delivery in three months closed only Dollars 7 a tonne down at Dollars 2,438.50. Aluminium was affected by copper's weakness but dealers said speculative interest was still being attracted to a market whose fundamentals were improving daily. Three-month metal closed yesterday another Dollars 4 a tonne up at Dollars 1,474.50 on the LME. The International Primary Aluminium Institute helped to steady the market when it reported that average daily production in countries outside the former Soviet bloc fell by another 500 tonnes in May to 38,900 tonnes. That was the third successive monthly fall. The fall has followed the agreement reached between some of the big aluminium producing countries early this year to cut output so as to reduce the huge stocks that have been depressing prices. Oil prices weakened somewhat in early trading before recovering most of their losses. The price of the benchmark Brent blend was Dollars 17.40 a barrel in late London trading, near its Dollars 17.41 closing level last Friday. It fell to Dollars 17.18 at one point in the day, but traders said bullish factors still dominated the market in spite of an apparent easing of tension with North Korea, the main factor behind last week's price rally. Coffee and cocoa futures fell sharply on profit-taking after last week's gains. But trading volumes were thin, and there were bursts of buying in coffee at lower levels. At the London Commodity Exchange, the robusta contract for September delivery ended Dollars 52 lower at Dollars 2,282 a tonne, well below the morning peak of Dollars 2,362 but off the low of Dollars 2,257. LCE Cocoa prices followed coffee's fall. The second position finished down Pounds 14 a tonne at Pounds 1,022 after trading in a Pounds 30 range.</p>

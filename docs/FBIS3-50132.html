			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Neykov commentary: "So What"] </F>   [Text] Two years have passed since we recognized the  independence of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Tracing the road toward its consolidation in the international  arena, we assumed the risk of incurring the hostility of close  and remote countries. So what?    Unfortunately, there was no turning point in relations  between our two countries. The lies and insinuations that were  insistently spread by Skopje and Belgrade in the past 50 years  did not stop. The various obstacles and barbed wire still exist  along the border. Our citizens continue to feel like "white  crows" in Skopje, Bitola, and Ohrid. Almost nothing has been  done to establish direct railroad communications or modernize  the roads between the two countries. The possibilities of  intensifying trade-economic cooperation and implementing  initiatives related to scientific and cultural exchanges were  not fully utilized, and God knows there are such possibilities.    It is true that joint efforts are needed to melt the ice  that  has accumulated in the last 50 years. It also is true that the  authorities in Skopje are still loyal to the ideas of Titoism  and fear everything Bulgarian, just like a vampire fears the  daylight. One cannot expect from them any initiatives or total  cooperation. However, what did our representatives do during  those 730 days? Did they trace any new paths that could now be  widened? They did nothing, or almost nothing at best.    Instead, we saw President Zhelev smiling with satisfaction  when he was handed a translation of his "fascism" in some  "language." We were puzzled when we saw how easily Prime  Minister Berov swallowed his unease with the presence of a  translator during his talks in Skopje. We also had to suffer  the blunder with the commodity credit, which was promised  ostensibly by [former Deputy Prime Minister] Neycho Neev. We  blushed when President Kiro Gligorov confused us with his speech  in the UN General Assembly, with not a single representative  Bulgarian institution expressing its indignation. No one paid  any attention to the report of the "Helsinki Watch" on the  violations of the minorities' rights in Macedonia. That report  mentioned the Albanian, Turkish, Gypsy, Serbian, Muslim, and  many other minorities. Only the Bulgarians remained  unmentioned. They simply do not exist, they disappeared. The  Miladinov brothers, Dame Gruev, Gotse Delchev, and tens of  thousands of revival figures would have blushed and burned with  shame if they could assume that we will keep silent when it is  broadly claimed that there are no Bulgarian elements in Vardar  Macedonia.    It is high time to take a clear and categorical stand on  those failures. Dirty hands or incompetent people could mar  both the past and the present. What we probably need is a brief  document of approximately 2,000 words, which, after holding a  referendum and receiving the general support of the public,  could once and for all clarify to the world our position on the  Macedonian issue.    No one in our country lives in a dream world, nor is anyone  striving to change political borders. We only want to protect  our glorious past from someone's dirty hands.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Tenneco set back by poor Case performance TENNECO, the US conglomerate undergoing a significant restructuring, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 26m as its troubled JI Case farm equipment business continued to operate heavily in the red. Mr Michael Walsh, the group's new chief executive, said the first quarter was likely to continue being difficult, due to lingering recession and because sales of farm and construction equipment were traditionally weak during the period. However, for the year as a whole the chief executive expected significantly stronger results, because of the restructuring programme and new sources of revenue, which include income generated by newly completed pipeline projects. The fourth-quarter loss, which worked through at 24 cents a share, included Dollars 65m of pre-tax provisions for claims and litigation. The quarterly deficit compared with income of Dollars 130m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, in the same period of the previous year. Revenues dipped from Dollars 3.88bn to Dollars 3.64bn. For the full year Tenneco reported a net loss of Dollars 732m, or Dollars 6.09 a share, which included Dollars 552m of restructuring charges, compared with net income of Dollars 561m, or Dollars 4.37, in 1990. Case, which has been suffering from weak markets for its products and poor inventory control, had a Dollars 22m operating loss in the fourth quarter, against income of Dollars 54m in the year-earlier period. Mr Walsh said the company had held its total debt to capital ratio, on an industrial basis, to 59 per cent at the year-end, compared with 69 per cent at the end of September, thanks to the restructuring plan. This was just the beginning of plans to improve its credit posture, he said.</p>

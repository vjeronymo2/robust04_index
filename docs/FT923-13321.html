			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Careers Service is urged to raise its profile THE CAREERS Service should consider launching a campaign to raise its profile among employers, according to a report by the Institute of Manpower Studies. A survey of 2,200 employers showed that while the majority knew the service existed, a much smaller proportion used it on a regular basis. Only half of the employers who were active in the young persons' labour market were involved with the service. The report says that if companies knew more about the service and how it could assist them they might consider using it. Use was greatest among larger employers and manufacturing companies and least among smaller companies and the service sector. Those companies that did use the service were generally happy with it, most using it as a junior Jobcentre to find young people to interview. In a number of these cases the local service provided the additional service of pre-selecting people. It was in such screening that the survey encountered the highest level of dissatisfaction among employers, with complaints about the inappropriateness of the people put forward. Some employers said they wanted to see the Careers Service expanding the element of its activities aimed at the adult workforce. A small percentage said they would be willing to pay for services such as aptitude testing and potential assessment of their employees.

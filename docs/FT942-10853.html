			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Finland, Sweden join peace alliance An important new link in the security structure of post-Cold war Europe will be set in place today as Sweden and Finland, moving away from their long-standing neutrality, join the Partnership for Peace devised by Nato. At the same time, the Western European Union is expected to upgrade links with nine former communist nations as well as drawing Turkey, Norway and Iceland more closely into its embryonic efforts at military planning. The moves come at a time of mounting uncertainty over the intentions of Russia towards both Nato and the three Baltic republics, which are among the nine nations that the WEU will elevate into associate partners. While it still operates in the shadow of Nato, the WEU is expected to grow in importance as the US scales down its involvement in Europe. Moscow stated last week that, in matters of co-operation with the Atlantic alliance, it insists on having a role in drawing up the menu, as opposed to selecting dishes that have already been cooked at Nato headquarters. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, also sent shudders down Baltic spines by hinting that the Russian garrison in Estonia, whose withdrawal has been promised by August 31, might actually be reinforced. Unlike the 15 members of the former Eastern bloc which have become 'partners for peace,' the two Nordic states that sign up are expected to be givers rather than takers of military expertise. Both Sweden and Finland have already been lending a discreet hand to efforts by the Baltic states to build up defence forces. Moscow's effort to influence the Partnership from within will be aided by the fact that it remains a fluid arrangement. Only 10 days ago the Partnership received a provisional headquarters, in the shape of a modest green building at Mons, near Brussels, previously used for planning the reinforcement of Berlin in the event of an East-West crisis. Of the 15 former communist states that have signed up to the Partnership, only Poland is certain to assign officers to the Mons premises. Even they cannot take up their duties until Belgium clarifies their legal status. Two, and possibly three, war games within the framework of the Partnership should take place this year, including one naval exercise, and an exercise in the Netherlands that will focus on peace-keeping. But participants have yet to be announced. The emphasis on peace-keeping is one of the reasons why Russia does not want to be left out. Russia remains hungry for international approval of its 'peace-keeping' activity on its borders. Moscow's aspirations include Russia's acceptance as a full partner in Nato's deliberations on Bosnia; Russian participation in other forms of co-operation between the top western nations, such as the Group of Seven; an upward revision of the troop numbers Russia is allowed by the treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe; and a veto on the elevation of other Partnership members to full membership of Nato.</p>

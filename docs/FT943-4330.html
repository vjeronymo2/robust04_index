			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Arts: Unifying sounds - Proms Berlin, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Dresden and Pittsburgh: the visiting orchestras marking the climax of the Proms' 100th season have assembled from the world's musical capitals. It is not entirely a coincidence that they all come from either Germany or the US. Between them those two countries can boast an enviable proportion of the top international orchestras. This year the Dresden Staatskapelle followed hard on the heels of the Berlin Philharmonic, and making comparisons between them is inevitable. In a unified Germany the orchestras of east and west have found themselves rivals for the country's accolade as number one. Usually one would expect the Berlin Philharmonic's uniquely rich sound to make it a clear first choice, but that was not how it seemed after the Dresden Staatskapelle's concerts on Tuesday and Wednesday. The two cities are fortunate their orchestras are so different. Berlin represents the future capital's proud self-confidence; Dresden is old-world grace and quiet authority. There was a natural sense of scale in the Dresden players' music-making, which allowed every point to register easily, not just the big, barnstorming moments which made an impression with Berlin. The first of the Dresden concerts opened with understated performances of Weber's Overture to Euryanthe and Dvorak's tone-poem The Wood Dove. Colin Davis has become an ever subtler conductor in recent years, and the unforced musicality of the Dresden orchestra makes them well suited to each other. In works which the players know backwards, like Beethoven's 'Pastoral' Symphony in the second Prom, he is content to lean back and leave them to play. The peasants' dance was more a bucolic minuet. The thunderstorm movement was music first, storm second  - all of impeccable quality. As a young man, Davis was renowned for his fiery championing of Berlioz, but one would not immediately have recognised that here. Maybe the orchestra has the upper hand in the relationship, for the Dresden Staatskapelle does excel at bringing a classical sense of order and proportion to everything it plays. Unfortunately, Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique is music at the other extreme, the outpouring of a fevered and irrational mind, flirting with chaos. This Dresden performance never surrendered to its passions. It was immaculately controlled and unexciting. The second Prom was the better of the two. As well as the Beethoven, there was Brahms' First Symphony, an honorary classical symphony if ever there was one. Davis worked the orchestra harder in this and there was more drive and tension to the playing. Even so, the symphony has never sounded less like an old warhorse, thanks to the elegance of the wind playing, the subtlety of the balance, the refusal to countenance noise or bombast. Among the ranks of international orchestras the Dresden Staatskapelle ranks as a thoroughbred. Appearance of the Dresden Staatskapelle sponsored by Dresdner Bank</p>

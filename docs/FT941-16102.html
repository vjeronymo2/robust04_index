			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / BBC's cost-cut drive attacked BBC unions yesterday attacked plans to end comprehensive collective bargaining across the corporation as part of a drive to save Pounds 50m this year. The package outlined to unions and staff yesterday includes: Personal performance reviews which will influence pay levels. An end to near-automatic incremental pay rises for everyone who joins the BBC from April. Freedom for individual directorates to negotiate their own conditions in areas such as payment for unpredictable working patterns. The BBC's director of personnel, Ms Margaret Salmon, promised yesterday that BBC pay would remain competitive and that collective bargaining would continue on basic pay and a raft of 'core' conditions such as the length of the working week, annual leave, sickness and pension provisions. Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the main technical broadcasting union said yesterday: 'Their line of least resistance is to cut the wages of the people who do the work.' He warned that the unions may take industrial action. Mr Lennon said that the BBC was being forced to make cuts to balance the books of the business units created by Producer Choice - the internal market system under which producers can buy in services from the outside market. Producer Choice, Mr Lennon said yesterday, had created some of the cost problems that the BBC was now trying to tackle. For example, it meant more peaks and troughs in the flow of work, thereby increasing costs by not using staff evenly. Mr Rod Lynch, managing director of resources, engineering and services, the largest directorate with 11,000 out of the BBC's 21,000 staff, said yesterday that existing terms and conditions appeared to be based on old film-making traditions. 'That is singularly inappropriate, not only for 1994 but the competitive environment that the BBC finds itself in,' he said. The number of grades is to be reduced from 20 to 11 and consistently high performers may receive more than the standard increase and move more rapidly through grades.</p>

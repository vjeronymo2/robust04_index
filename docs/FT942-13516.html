			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Solicitors warn on insolvency reform The Law Society has welcomed proposals for a creditors' moratorium period for insolvent companies making voluntary arrangements with creditors, but warns against radical change to existing insolvency laws. The number of extra companies likely to be rescued by the proposed system would be small, the society says in its response today to Department of Trade and Industry proposals on amendments to insolvency laws to ease the rescue of troubled companies. Company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), which leave the existing management in charge rather than handing control to an outsider, have been available as an alternative to liquidation since 1986, but have been used infrequently. The DTI has suggested a moratorium period in CVAs during which debt collection and insolvency proceedings against the company were suspended, while possible rescue plans were worked out. The Law Society is concerned that a moratorium could encourage directors of companies which are beyond rescue to use CVAs to stay in control, and says there is a need for supervision by a qualified insolvency practitioner. It also says that the changes should not be allowed to have an adverse effect on holders of floating charges over all or most of a company's assets.</p>

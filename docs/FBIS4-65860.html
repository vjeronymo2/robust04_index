			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- Bosnia's warring  factions will meet Wednesday [25 May] in the French town of  Talloires with a contact group trying to restart the Bosnian  peace process, a French diplomatic source said Wednesday.    The source said that the Moslem-led Bosnian government would  be represented by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and the Serbs  by the speaker of their self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo  Krajisnic.    In Zagreb, radio reports said Kresimir Zubak, the top  Bosnian  Croat leader, planned to attend the talks.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe earlier announced that  the contact group would meet in Talloires, in the French alps,  but he did not mention that the warring factions would attend  the meeting. [passage omitted]    Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb speaker, arrived in Geneva later  Tuesday, according to sources close to the contact group.    The Geneva sources said Silajdzic and Zubak had already  arrived in the Swiss city.    Diplomatic sources in Geneva said preliminary talks would be  held later Tuesday in Talloires in preparation for the meeting  Wednesday.    Before leaving Belgrade, Krajisnik was quoted by the  Belgrade  news agency BETA as saying that the resumption of negotiations  on Bosnia were "hitting up against some big problems."    He did not specify what these were, however.    Krajisnik was accompanied by his his self-proclaimed Serb  republic's "foreign minister" Aleksandar Buha.    The BETA agency, quoting an official communique, had said  Krajisnik would outline the Bosnian Serb position to  international mediators David Owen for the European Union and  Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations.    It said the Serb side would ask for a "final" stop to  fighting throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina and demand to be "treated  the same" as other parties.    This was taken to mean that the Bosnian Serb negotiators  would link their participation in negotiations to lifting  international sanctions decreed against the rump Yugoslavia in  May 1992.</p>

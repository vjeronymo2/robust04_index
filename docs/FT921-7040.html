			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank Austria in Sch5bn charge BANK AUSTRIA, formed by the merger Landerbank and Zentralsparkasse last year, is to take a Sch5bn charge against 1991 earnings because of losses at Landerbank. Austria's largest bank said a deficit of at least Sch1bn arose through the acquisition of Sovereign, a British leasing company, in 1990. The losses are expected to depress the bank's 1991 partial operating profit by 10 per cent from Landerbank's and Zentralsparkasse's combined 1990 profit of Sch2.25bn. Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's mayor who also acts as Bank Austria's supervisory board chairman, said he may initiate legal procedures against some of the managing board members of former Landerbank.</p>

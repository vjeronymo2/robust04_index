			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: AFTER 18 YEARS, RED SOX NO LONGER WANT EVANS  </P> <P> Dwight Evans, mainstay in right field at Fenway Park for almost all of his 18  seasons, won't be back with the Boston Red Sox in 1991.  </P> <P> Evans, one of the most popular Red Sox, has one of the most respected throwing  arms in baseball.  </P> <P> He learned Wednesday that Boston was not going to exercise an option on his  contract at $1.3 million for next season. The buyout cost the Red Sox $200,000.  </P> <P> Evans, who turns 39 on Nov. 3, has been plagued by a persistent lower back  problem for about a year, and it limited him to a designated-hitter role this  season. He batted .249 in 123 games with 13 home runs and 63 runs batted in as  the Red Sox won the American League East title.  </P> <P> Evans' 2,505 games with Boston were second only to Hall of Famer Carl  Yastrzemski. He has 379 home runs and 1,346 runs batted in.  </P></p>

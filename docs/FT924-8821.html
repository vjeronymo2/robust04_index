			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Advisers to companies are accused of overcharging MANY solicitors, accountants and banks are overcharging their corporate clients and providing an inadequate service according to a survey by Gallup, the polling organisation. The survey of 200 senior executives from large and medium-sized UK companies for Eversheds, the national law firm, showed that 25 per cent had recently considered or were considering changing their professional advisers. Banks were the most heavily criticised. Only 12 per cent of the executives said their banks had provided better service than solicitors and accountants over the past year. Almost half the executives said their accountants were the best professional advisers, and 36 per cent rated their solicitors as the best. Complaints focused on overcharging, repeated mistakes and lack of personal contact. Only just over half of the companies felt they were being charged reasonable fees for professional advice. Accountants were considered to be overcharging by more than 40 per cent of the sample, banks by 47 per cent and solicitors by 48 per cent. A third of the companies covered by the survey have changed their solicitors in the past, with smaller companies being more likely to have made a change. The most common reasons cited were poor service, the need for specialist advice and cost. For those companies thinking of changing their lawyers the reasons most cited were poor advice or inefficient service and high and rising costs. The survey found that executives felt regional law firms provided the best value for money, the most efficient service, the best working relationship between solicitor and client and the most speedy responses to problems. The survey also showed that only 23 per cent of companies felt London firms understood the issues facing clients' businesses even though they are traditionally regarded as providing the best quality and expertise. Only 6 per cent felt London law firms provided the best value for money. More than half of those companies using a London-based solicitor said they would consider using a regional firm for the main part of their company's legal work.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges lower as Pacific Basin consolidates Uncertainty over the fate of the government's political reform bill prompted profit-taking, and the Nikkei average receded 1.3 per cent in light trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index closed 248.33 down at 18,725.37. The Topix index lost 9.71 at 1,515.91, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.18 to 1,256.37. The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 18,911.89 and retreated to the session's low of 18,646.06 in the morning. Traders also blamed the fall on weakness in the bond market. The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark finished at 3.205 per cent, the highest for 1 1/2 months. Worries of oversupply, caused by last week's announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it would sell bonds outright for the first time in 11 years to finance the forthcoming economic stimulus package, triggered profit-taking. The Finance Ministry, which usually sells bonds with repurchase agreements, is expected to supply the market with some Y900bn in outright bonds. Volume shrank to 280m shares from 468m, falling below the 300m mark for the first time in eight trading days. Declines led advances by 701 to 333, with 133 issues unchanged. In spite of the fall in share prices on the first section, the second section saw continued firm demand from short-term investors. The second section index advanced 17.64 to 2,017.36, rising for the 13th consecutive day to recover the 2,000 level for the first time since November 16 last year. Bank stocks were lower on arbitrage selling. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y30 to Y2,870 and Fuji Bank declined Y40 to Y1,960. Profit-taking depressed gas companies, which had previously gained ground on hopes of higher profits due to industry restructuring. Tokyo Gas slipped Y10 to Y540. Buying by foreign investors supported Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which firmed Y13,000 to Y833,000, and East Japan Railway, Y7,000 higher at Y476,000. Sega Enterprises jumped Y320 to Y9,500 on reports that the video game maker has tied up with Microsoft, of the US, to develop game programs. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 75.25 to 20,711.86 in volume of 47.2m shares. Roundup The region saw a less active day's trading than for some time. HONG KONG ended a featureless session slightly higher, the Hang Seng index gaining 18.67 at 10,792.9, as turnover drifted back to HKDollars 5.6bn, its lowest level in three weeks. Bank shares did well on expectations that Bank of East Asia would report good earnings today. HSBC Holdings moved up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 108 and Hang Seng Bank added 50 cents at HKDollars 72. SEOUL lost ground for the third consecutive session, the composite stock index shedding 5.40 to 863.25. Reports that Sungkyong had given up its second mobile telecom bid and would try to buy stakes in the existing network boosted the shares of other companies involved in the project. Yukong and Kolon International went the day's limit up, adding Won1,300 each to close at Won36,500 and Won33,500 respectively. TAIWAN saw the weighted index swing widely, after a 5.6 per cent gain on Saturday, closing 12.19 off at 6,054.93. Turnover was TDollars 105bn. Reports that a proposal to raise the Dollars 5bn ceiling on combined foreign investment in the market had been postponed dampened sentiment. Among financial stocks, China Trust rose by its daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 74.50 and ICBC surged TDollars 4 to TDollars 81.50 in heavy trade. Among the banks, First Commercial advanced TDollars 12 to TDollars 231. SINGAPORE fell back in a consolidation phase. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 25.82, or 1.12 per cent, to 2,277.04. Volume came to 275.7m shares as declines led gains by 314 to 40. KUALA LUMPUR reversed Friday's strong gains and the composite index fell 30.0, or 2.65 per cent, to 1,104.14. Turnover amounted to MDollars 1.7bn. AUSTRALIA ended the session at its highest level since 1987 as the All Ordinaries index climbed 31.8, or 1.4 per cent, to 2,238.2. Turnover totalled ADollars 679m. News Corp followed Friday's rise of 51 cents with another 44-cent gain to ADollars 10.20. Westpac saw 20.6m shares traded and moved ahead 7 cents to ADollars 4.82. Elsewhere in the banks sector, NAB advanced 28 cents to ADollars 12.38, CBA was 4 cents higher at ADollars 9.20 and ANZ firmed 2 cents to ADollars 5.02. BHP put on 38 cents at ADollars 18.70 after its petroleum unit said that oil production from the Griffin project was expected to peak at 80,000 b/pd. NEW ZEALAND increased its performance to set its highest level since October 1989. The NZSE-40 capital index rose 15.97 to 2,241.96. Fletcher Challenge added 8 cents at NZDollars 3.48 and Carter Holt Harvey 4 cents at NZDollars 3.84. BANGKOK declined nearly 3 per cent, led by weakness in the finance, property and banking sectors. The SET index lost 42.56 at 1,474.11. Communication issues were down in spite of expectations of gains ahead of today's listing of Shinawatra Satellite. TelecomAsia shed Bt7 to Bt127. BOMBAY saw profit-taking erode early gains, but the BSE index still ended 84.17 higher at a provisional 4,022.91. KARACHI finished at a record high, the KSE index adding 14.90 at 2,405.42.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (15): Still in courtship phase - Japan ALTHOUGH Japan has long been a significant trading partner for South Africa the strength of that relationship has not been matched by high levels of investment. 'There is an awareness that South Africa is a promising market,' says Mr Sota Sakai, manager of the Middle East and Africa Section at Marubeni, the trading house. 'But when it comes to investment, this is like a marriage so it will take more time to reach that point,' he notes. While Japan was South Africa's fourth largest trading partner in 1990 after West Germany, Great Britain and the US, due to international sanctions there has been no Japanese direct investment in South Africa for at least the past 10 years, the ministry of finance says. The political situation is still a strong concern. The Japan Bond Research Institute, gave South Africa a 5.9 general rating in its latest July report, which was up from 5.4 in January and 4.0 in January, 1989. The Institute attributed the higher ranking to the positive aspects of the government's fiscal and monetary policies as well as enhanced international trust in South Africa. Geography is also a problem. 'Japan is not that internationalised yet,' explains Mr Sakai. Japanese businesses also believe that the entire business environment in South Africa needs to be improved before the country can expect to see a significant influx of investment from Japan. Greater communication between the two countries is also necessary before Japanese businesses are likely to feel comfortable with the idea of investing in South Africa. For much the same reasons, there is little interest in Japan in South Africa's capital markets. Meanwhile, the activities of Japanese banks with regard to South Africa have been frozen since the country declared a debt standstill in 1985. It is believed that no new lending will be forthcoming from banks, Japanese or other, until that situation is resolved.</p>

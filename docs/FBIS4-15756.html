			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry's Africa Department has  informed us that the Russian Embassy in Rwanda was totally  evacuated today due to the unpredictable situation in the  capital of that African country. Embassy staff, Aeroflot  representatives, and their families were taken to the capital of  Burundi. Only women who are Russian citizens married to  Rwandans remain in Rwanda. Interethnic clashes which started  six days ago in Rwanda have left at least 10,000 people dead.</p>

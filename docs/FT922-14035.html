			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood reduces deficit to IPounds 2.7m WATERFORD Wedgwood, the Dublin-based crystal and ceramics group, reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds 2.7m (Pounds 2.5m) for the 1991 year. The previous year's deficit was was IPounds 21.4m. Operating profits showed a 9 per cent decline to IPounds 9.1m (IPounds 10m). The outcome was helped by a halving of the interest charge to IPounds 6.5m (IPounds 13m) and lower exceptionals of IPounds 5.3m (IPounds 18.4m). Without the exceptional item this year, relating to 'initiatives taking place in late 1991 and 1992 to reduce manufacturing costs' the group would have broken even. Waterford Crystal cut operating losses to IPounds 1.2m (IPounds 4.8m) on turnover of IPounds 73m (IPounds 76.7m). Operating profits in the Wedgwood division fell to IPounds 10.3m (IPounds 14.8m) on turnover of IPounds 219.1m (IPounds 231.2m). Mr Richard Barnes, chief financial officer, said that the exceptional item has been split 60:40 between the Wedgwood and Waterford divisions. At Wedgwood it related to the closure of 'three ancient plants' and their consolidation into other factories which would be completed by May, and 'a small number of redundancies in the first half of 1992'. The Waterford division exceptional was a provision for redundancies during 1992. Group turnover fell 5 per cent to IPounds 292.1m (IPounds 307.9m). The recession and the Gulf war were blamed for a 13 per cent drop in sales volume. Losses per share amounted to 0.73p, against 4.29p last time, close to market predictions.</p>

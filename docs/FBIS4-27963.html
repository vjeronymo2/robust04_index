			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP Report from Geneva] </F>   [Text] North Korea made it clear yesterday hat it had test  fired a missile in the East Sea, stressing that it was a routine  exercise.    In a news conference, (Han Cha-won), North Korea's permanent  representative to the United Nations, said that the test firing  of the missile was a regular and routine exercise and that North  Korea's missiles are completely for defensive purposes.    The Japanese and U.S. Governments revealed at the end of  last  month that North Korea had tested a missile -- an improved model  of China's Silk Worm missiles.    Until now, North Korea has not confirmed that it had test  fired a missile.</p>

At least as regards the DPRK's nuclear program, nothing came of  the Sino-South Korean talks.    All Kim Yong-sam's attempts to persuade PRC President Jiang  Zemin and the other Chinese leaders to exert pressure on  Pyongyang came to nothing.    In response President Jiang reiterated the previous Chinese  formula, which states that there is no point in transferring the  issue of inspections of all North Korean nuclear installations  to the UN Security Council, much less in taking sanctions  against Pyongyang.    Moreover, referring to the U.S. intention to site Patriot  missiles in the southern part of the peninsula and to resume the  "Team Spirit" military maneuvers, the PRC leader said that such  measures could only exacerbate tension still further. Jiang  took the same tone on this issue as the DPRK Foreign Ministry,  which has described the reinforcement of U.S. and South Korean  forces as a step toward war.    While they found no common ground on the key subject of  finding a way to resolve the present crisis, Beijing and Seoul  were unanimous in ignoring Russia's proposal to convene an  international conference on removing nuclear weapons from the  peninsula. Neither side even mentioned the suggestion in their  exchange of opinions.    The PRC president considered it necessary to stress that the  nuclear problem should be resolved not at a conference but  within the framework of quadrilateral talks between North and  South Korea, the United States, and the International Atomic  Energy Agency.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 21 (XINHUA) -- The Cultural  Ministry has decided to give high-tastes in arts a notable place  at its Spring Festival evening party.    At the party to be staged during the traditional holiday  next  month, a repertoire which lauds the ongoing reform and opening  or reflects traditional culture or serious arts will be  emphasized, Zeng Qinghuai, planner of the show from the Cultural  Ministry, said here today.    However, the event will leave room for a few pop singers.  And a piece written by a Taiwanese composer will be sung.    The programs are aimed to help promoting serious culture  while promoting artistic forms which can be received by ordinary  people.    In recent years China's cultural market has been hit by  growing pop arts while traditional and classical arts have  fallen into a slump. More television cameras have been lured  away for commercial singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan.    This has triggered conflicting opinions among the fans. Some  complained that their rights to watch various artistic programs  were denied, according to Zeng.    Since last year, Chinese leaders have repeatedly urged  supporting traditional and serious arts, and letting the arts  serve the people and socialism.    The ministry's evening party, which will be broadcast on  state television, will give a potential audience of 600 million  a chance to enjoy symphonic music, ballet, acrobatics and  traditional opera.    But almost at the same time, another more famous evening  party will be organized and televised by the same TV station.  It will feature a more popular repertoire and is viewed as  regular family fare during every Spring Festival.    These events may revive people by providing them with a  healthy and vivid cultural atmosphere, the Cultural Ministry  hopes. And they set a "right tune" for the Chinese arts this  year, experts said.    "The evening party is not mere entertainment. It shows our  policy, the achievements and prospects of the field, as well as  the whole reform and opening process in the country," Zeng said.</p>

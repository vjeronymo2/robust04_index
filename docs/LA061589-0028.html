			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMELESS GRAINS;  </P> <P> AFTER CENTURIES AS FEED FOR BIRDS AND ANIMALS, SEEDS SUCH AS QUINOA AND  AMARANTH ARE FINDING AN INCREASINGLY SIGNIFICANT PLACE IN A HEALTHIER AMERICAN  DIET.  </P> <P> The so-called "new grains" are not really new at all; neither is oat bran. But  in the American quest for better health, oat bran was delivered from the  barnyard to the breakfast table. And, likewise, the new grains may be liberated  from the bird cage.  </P> <P> Although vegetarians and health-food enthusiasts long have known of the virtues  of whole grains -- experimenting with them as a means of achieving an  alternative source of complete protein -- most others considered them best  suited for horse and bird feed.  </P> <P> That may be changing.  </P> <P> Ethnic cuisines have paved the way for widespread interest in whole-grain  cookery -- familiarizing partakers with couscous, arborio rice, polenta and  bulgur. And today, as more and more Americans proceed from good taste to good  health, a fascination with ancient forms of fiber -- including such "new  grains" as amaranth, quinoa and triticale -- has begun to develop.  </P> <P> According to Food Marketing Institute's annual nationwide shopper survey,  "Trends/Consumer Attitude and the Supermarket -- 1989," Americans have grown  increasingly aware of the correlation between good nutrition and good health  and have undertaken a variety of behaviors to ensure that their diets are  healthful. This includes eating more fruits and vegetables and more fiber, the  report states.  </P> <P> The survey reported that 76% of the American shoppers queried indicated that  nutrition was a very important factor when they purchased food -- up 4% from  last year's data.  </P> <P> The American Cancer Society, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in its  "Dietary Guidelines for Americans," and the National Cancer Institute all have  emphasized a high-fiber diet. They point to a low incidence of cancer and other  degenerative diseases in populations where this type of diet is maintained.  </P> <P> One of the most widely emphasized ways to increase intake of dietary fiber from  what specialists in the field say is the current average adult intake of 11  grams per day to the recommended 25 to 30 grams is to add whole grains --  products that contain the entire grain or as much of it as is edible -- to the  diet. That's where the new grains come in.  </P> <P> Although there is an assortment of familiar whole grains available in  supermarkets -- whole wheat, cracked wheat, bulgur, oats, whole cornmeal,  popcorn, brown rice, whole rye and barley -- some health watchers are turning  to the local health-food store or the health-food section of the supermarket  for supplies of unusual whole grains.  </P> <P> Triticale, quinoa (pronounced keen-wah), millet and amaranth are just a few of  the equally versatile and delicious whole grains that have begun appearing on  shelves next to the barley, bulgur and buckwheat as well as in recipe books.  </P> <P> Triticale is a hybrid grain, the offspring of wheat and rye. Its kernels are  larger than those of either parent and they retain their crunch even after  soaking and cooking. Triticale can be purchased flaked, a form very similar to  oats or wheat flakes, or as flour.  </P> <P> Quinoa, a tan-colored, birdseed-like grain is popular for its high protein and  calcium content. It is high in the amino acid lysine, which most other whole  grains lack, making it a complete source of protein. Quinoa seeds have a  distinctive flavor upon cooking, and the grain is excellent in savory dishes.  Because of a natural coating called saponin, quinoa requires thorough rinsing  before cooking.  </P> <P> Millet is probably the most familiar of the new grains. In this country it is  used as the basis of birdseed mixtures. In Ethiopia, however, millet flour is  made into a spongy, crepelike meal accompaniment -- injera. This fine-textured  grain has a long shelf life and an endless array of uses from pilaf to stuffing  to salads. Use millet anywhere rice can be used as an ingredient. It may even  be toasted before adding to recipes.  </P> <P> The only real newcomer of the group is a commercial product, Kashi, a  combination of seven whole grains and sesame. It is found in supermarkets where  cereals and grains are sold. It is available in puffed form for eating out of  hand or as a cold cereal, or in its original state as a pilaf that can be  cooked and eaten as cereal or mixed with other ingredients in savory dishes.  </P> <P> These and the other whole grains are basically seeds that are eaten whole or  are sprouted, cooked, milled, cracked, rolled or ground into flakes. They are  highly nutritious, excellent sources of protein, carbohydrates, some B  vitamins, Vitamin E, magnesium and zinc.  </P> <P> In their whole form, these grains have three major portions, although most  contain a dry, rough outer covering -- the husk or hull. Located just under the  husk is the bran, a darker outer layer that serves as a protective coating. The  region toward one end of the kernel is the germ, which contains most of the  oil, vitamins and minerals needed for growth of the new plant. The lighter,  larger, starchy inner portion of the kernel is called the endosperm. This is  the region used for making flour.  </P> <P> In health-food stores, whole grains can be purchased in just about all forms.  </P> <P> As whole berries, kernels or groats, the grains have been husked only and take  longer to cook than processed grains -- about twice as long. They should be  soaked before cooking. After cooking, they can be added to savory ingredients  or sprinkled over salads. They don't cook into a soft cereal and are best  reserved for other uses.  </P> <P> Bran is the ground husk of a berry and is usually available either from wheat  or oats. Its primary feature is its high fiber content, although some protein,  vitamins and minerals may be present. While wheat bran is too tough to cook  into a cereal, it is ideal for baking into muffins, breads or bagels. Oat bran,  however, cooks quite nicely into a hot breakfast cereal.  </P> <P> Whole grains that are labeled "cracked" have undergone a grinding with steel  blades or millstones that cuts them into several small, rough pieces. Unlike  bulgur, they have not been precooked. But cracking the kernels makes them cook  more quickly than they would as berries. The bran and germ may, occasionally,  be left intact. Cracked rye and wheat are made from whole grains. Others such  as barley grits and hominy grits are polished first, then cracked.  </P> <P> Meals and milled or ground whole grains are commercially known as ground flour.  Since the bran and germ layers do not break down as readily as the endosperm  during processing, they are easily separated from the powdered endosperm -- a  process known as refinement. The remaining powdered endosperm is sold as flour.  </P> <P> Though whole grains, vegetables and fruits provide different kinds of fiber --  each with a different protective function -- they do have one thing in common.  They contain materials that are either not digestible or only partially  digestible by the human body and, therefore, help move other foods and  byproducts of digestion out of the body. This is believed to help reduce risk  for colon cancer, heart disease, diabetes, diverticulosis and constipation.  </P> <P> Fiber fits into the category of carbohydrates that are important for providing  bulk to the intestinal contents. Adequate amounts of insoluble fiber in the  diet teamed with sufficient water intake make the feces bulkier and forces the  muscles of the colon to exercise more. This makes them stronger and able to  function better, thus relieving constipation and its related maladies.  </P> <P> Increased fecal bulk and decreased transit time also reduce risk for  gastrointestinal tract complications such as diverticulosis (an out-pocketing  of the intestinal wall) and colon cancer.  </P> <P> But the importance of reducing risk for these diseases appears to pale compared  to the value placed on water-soluble fiber and its role in lowering blood  cholesterol and risk for cardiovascular disease.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's talked about enough," said Evelyn Tribole, a dietitian and  spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn., who explained the value of a  fiber-rich diet in reducing risk for inflammatory diseases.  </P> <P> "The importance of whole grains has to do with increasing the fiber in the  American diet, so we're really looking at the importance of fiber (not  necessarily whole grains) in the diet. And there's been a real problem with  Americans not getting enough fiber in the diet."  </P> <P> She complained that there's been "an explosion of information" on the effects  of soluble fiber and its cholesterol-lowering properties but that we may be  solving one problem and creating another. "We need to look at the whole  picture, not just what the craze is at one time," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Sources  </P> <P> Tribole emphasized that the recommended intake of 25 to 30 grams of fiber each  day be derived from a variety of sources, adding, however, that too much fiber  has been associated with other complications.  </P> <P> "Too much fiber," she said, may promote "decreased availability of minerals --  especially iron" and may create a syndrome known as "bran block" in which  intestines become clogged and form a "dam." She recommends a minimum intake of  8 cups of liquid -- preferably water, although juice and milk also will  eliminate the problem.  </P> <P> A way to meet the requirement is to consume two to three servings of whole  grains per day, choosing from the grains mentioned above as well as other  varieties such as corn and rice -- each with its own broad category of  byproducts.  </P> <P> An easy way to use whole berries, Kashi and firm-textured whole grains such as  bulgur and buckwheat is to let them steep overnight in hot water then use them  in tabbouleh or other salads, Tribole said.  </P> <P> "Fiber does keep you full and satisfied; it tends to absorb liquids and form  gels . . . which really add bulk to the intestines," Tribole said.  </P> <P> "There's another theory that if the intestines are moving slowly, there's more  opportunity for contact with carcinogens in the body. But if everything is  going out rapidly, there's less opportunity."  </P> <P> </P> <P> KASHI-STUFFED CORNISH HENS  </P> <P> 1 cup Kashi (commercial combination of grains, not kasha)  </P> <P> 1 pound Italian turkey sausage, casings removed  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups chopped celery  </P> <P> 1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon dried sage  </P> <P> 4 Cornish hens  </P> <P> Heat nonstick skillet or saucepan over medium heat and cook and stir Kashi  until dry, about 3 minutes.

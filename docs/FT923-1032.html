			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: IMF sees lower German rates GERMANY is headed towards a fundamental change in its economic policy that will bring lower interest rates, International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. At the end of the IMF's joint annual meeting with the World Bank he said that German interest rates were 'extremely high'. To bring them down underlying policies must be changed, he said in an apparent reference to the need for a tighter fiscal stance to relieve pressure on monetary policy. 'We are headed in that direction,' he said. Mr Camdessus rejected suggestions that capital controls were the answer to the currency crisis. Spain and Portugal have taken such action this week to shelter their currencies from speculative attack. The IMF chief said that such moves were understandable but added that the controls should be dismantled 'very rapidly' as the countries are obliged to do under the European treaty setting up a single market. He saw the risk that the use of such capital controls might spread but said that should be resisted.</p>

On  Monday [14 February] he chaired a Cabinet of Ministers meeting,  which was, appropriately, mainly devoted to health care problems.    Referring to the famous saying that "every cloud has a  silver  lining", the president stressed the importance of his stay in  the U.S. in terms of establishing further contacts, especially  in the field of medicine. According to Niyazov, that would help  Turkmenistan soon begin implementing its health care programme.  The current level of medical services is poor and makes such a  programme necessary.    The Turkmenistan president, who had an operation done on his  legs, was able achieve agreement on the establishment jointly  with American specialists of a clinical centre of health care in  Ashgabat.</p>

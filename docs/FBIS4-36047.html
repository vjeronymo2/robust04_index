			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 1 Jun (INA) -- Official talks between the  Iraqi Ministry of Interior and the Jordanian Ministry of  Interior began today.    The Iraqi side to the talks was headed by Interior Minister  Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan, while the Jordanian side was led by  Jordanian Interior Minister Salamah Hammad.    Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan paid tribute to the noble pan-Arab  stand taken by the Jordanian leadership and people in support of  Iraq in the course of its confrontation of the conspiratorial  and hostile schemes targeting its sovereignty and national  unity. He added that the honorable Jordanian position  epitomizes the real position of the Arab nation's masses, as  well as their faith in the inevitable victory of goodness and  right embodied by Iraq against all imperialist and Zionist  threats in defense of dear Iraq.    The minister asserted that Iraq and Jordan are standing in a  single trench to vindicate the Arab nation's fateful causes. He  noted that the fraternal bilateral ties have always been strong  and excellent in all areas.    For his part, the Jordanian minister of interior expressed  his pleasure, as well as the pleasure of his delegation with  their visit to their second home, Iraq. He commended the strong  fraternal ties between the two countries.    Salamah Hammad added that the development witnessed in Iraq,  as well as the principled and firm stands of its leadership in  defense of the Arab nation's rights have angered the imperialist  and Zionist quarters, which used all their conspiracy potential  to undermine the steadfastness of the Iraqi people and achieve  their hostile political ambitions in the Arab region.    The means of promoting and enhancing cooperation between the  two ministries were discussed at this session of talks. The  talks were attended by several officials of the ministries of  interior in the two fraternal countries and the Jordanian  ambassador in Baghdad.</p>

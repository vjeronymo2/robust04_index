			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poor view Sir, Your obituary of Kurt Cobain (Arts, April 11) was offensively insensitive to the death of a 27-year-old man with a young family. Perhaps the choice he made was wrong, not as evidence of weak character, but because of what he had created and could have produced. Mark Phillips, 200 West 15th Street, New York, NY 10011, US</p>

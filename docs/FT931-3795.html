Heated mirrors sound like one of those simple ideas that leave one wondering why nobody thought of it before. We all know that irritating moment after a good hot bath or shower when we find the mirror is all steamed up, making shaving or putting on make-up becomes hazardous. Now Malcolm Syme has developed a range of heated mirrors - as pictured below right - which solve the problem. Connected to the lighting circuit, each mirror has a heating element which starts warming the glass when the light comes on and so prevents it steaming up. They come with or without primed, pine or 'old gold' frames, with their own Razorlight, or plain so that you can choose a surround of your own. Sizes are 420 mm wide by 500 mm high, 515 mm wide by 590 mm high or 420 mm wide by 565 mm high. Prices start at Pounds 99.95 and include instructions, two screws and one electrical connection. The mirrors are available at Solaglas of Coventry and Dawson &amp; Gibbons, 55 Red Lion Street, London WC2 as well as by mail from The Heated Mirror Company, Sherston, Wiltshire SN16 OLW. Tel: 0666-840003. Traditional Belfast Sinks - solid, plain, sturdy, as pictured above right - are much sought-after in certain decorative circles. Some prefer them plainest of all in white but there is now a range of colours and sizes to choose from. From the smallest, 24 in by 18 ins by 10 to the largest, 36 ins by 18 ins by 10, they come in Delft blue, ivory, stone and cane. Prices range from Pounds 72.64 to Pounds 180. For details contact Ceramic Traditions, Bullers Lane, Hoddlesden, Lancashire BB3 3 NX. Tel: 0254-761500. For those who love antique linens but have neither the time nor the know-how to track them down Penny Kempton has the answer - she has a range of bedlinen made to her specifications in China, all based on authentic antique designs. Many are replicas of Edwardian and Victorian designs, all are hand-worked and most include hand-embroidery, drawn threadwork or crochetwork. Penny Kempton started commissioning antique designs because of ever-increasing prices and the difficulty in tracking down original antiques. Everything is pure linen, which means they are not cheap but they are good value - a linen top sheet costs Pounds 199 and a linen pillowsham with drawnthread work and crochet edging is Pounds 34. There are embroidered duvet covers (from Pounds 94 for a double) with matching pillowcases (from Pounds 22 for standard, or Pounds 28 for continental size of 26 ins by 26 ins) as well as hand towels, place mats, napkins and the like. They can be bought by mail (a free brochure is available from Penny Kempton, Antique Designs, Orchard Farm, Antrobus, Cheshire CW9 6JY, tel: 0565 777376) or from 50 stockists in the UK.

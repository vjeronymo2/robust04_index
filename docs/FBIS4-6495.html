			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Members of the  Pyongyang-visiting group consisting of former heads of state and  government and politicians of different countries gave their  impressions of Korea after their 8-day visit to Korea.  Ex-president of Costa Rica Rodrigo Carazo Odio, heading the  group, said beautiful Korea and its industrious and valiant  people gave them great inspiration and strength. He said he  would make sustained efforts in the future for the peace and  reunification of the Korean peninsula.    Former Egyptian Prime Minister Aziz Sedky stressed all the  functions held in Korea this time on the occasion of the 82nd  birthday of His Excellency President Kim Il-song well showed how  high the international position of Korea is.    "The Western clamour about your country's war preparations  is  a lie," he said, adding that the people of Korea are expediting  peaceful construction, not war preparations.    Senior Vice-president of the CNN International Eason Jordan  said he was deeply concerned for the situation on the Korean  peninsula when he was coming to Korea, but, his feelings of  strain and apprehensions have evaporated while witnessing the  life of the Korean people.    Executive director of the summit council for World Peace  Antonio Betancourt said he expresses deep thanks to the great  President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  for the warm hospitality accorded them. The Korean people are  well aware of wherein their life lies, he said, and added that  their life lies only in defending the ideology of the great  leader and the dear leader and upholding their leadership.</p>

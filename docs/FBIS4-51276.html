			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States  supports the resumption of China's GATT membership on condition  that the latter's trade regime conforms to GATT (General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), U.S. Deputy Trade  Representative Booth Gardner said here today.    "The United States strongly support China's accession to the  GATT and membership in the WTO (World Trade Organization). But  we support China's accession on the basis of China's willingness  to enter the GATT on the terms of the GATT. Where China's trade  regime is not consistent with the GATT, it must change," Gardner  told a session of the 27th international meeting of the Pacific  Basin Economic Council (PBEC).    He said the U.S. wants to "see China emerge strong,  prosperous and stable" and is seeking a "balanced way for our  two countries to develop a sound, cooperative relationship".    "We are working with China over our differences so we can  move forward together. We want that effort to succeed," he  added.    To a question whether he sees it reasonable for China to be  requested to undertake the obligations similar to that of the  developed countries regarding China's reentry into the GATT,  Gardner said the U.S. thinks that "there can be a transition  time" and the U.S. is willing to negotiate about the matter.</p>

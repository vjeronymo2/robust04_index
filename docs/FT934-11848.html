			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Exports approved 'on eve of Gulf war' THE CABINET approved defence-related machine-tool exports to Iraq two weeks before the invasion of Kuwait and a week after its main intelligence arm warned of a significant Iraqi military build-up, it emerged yesterday. Documents made available to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry show that Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, personally approved, following a cabinet meeting on July 19 1990, the issuing of the export licences for the last batch of machine tools made by Matrix Churchill. A report prepared by the Joint Intelligence Committee dated July 12 1990 warned that Iraq was well advanced in developing chemical and nuclear capabilities and in its conventional weapons programme using western components. The report highlighted Matrix Churchill as an important supplier to Iraq and involved in a weapons system programme code-named K1000. Mr Ian McDonald, an MoD official responsible for vetting defence exports to Iraq, told the inquiry the report was 'highly relevant' and should have influenced subsequent decisions on the granting of licences for the machine tools. He said he should have seen the report at the time, but did not. Instead it went directly to his minister, Mr Alan Clark, who was among ministers who later approved the licences. Mr McDonald told the inquiry that by 1990 the perception shared by ministers was that the time had come to 'cut the cackle' and accept that guidelines restricting defence exports to Iraq were no longer relevant. 'It was a situation in which we were losing control of reality,' Mr McDonald said. The hearing continues on Monday.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOHL COMMITS HIS UNIFIED NATION TO EUROPEAN UNITY;  </P> <P> GERMANY: IT IS FIRST SUCH MEETING IN REICHSTAG SINCE HITLER'S ASCENDANCY. PLANS  ARE PRESENTED TO SPEND BILLIONS REBUILDING THE FORMER COMMUNIST REGION.  </P> <P> In a setting heavy with history, Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday addressed  the first session of an all-German Parliament since the collapse of Nazism and  affirmed his newly united country's commitment to European unity.  </P> <P> "The completion of German unification provides a great chance -- I'd like to  say the chance, to accelerate the process of European unity," he said. "Let  there be no question, we want a political union in Europe, not an enlarged  customs union."  </P> <P> The statement, made in what was effectively the Kohl government's first state  of the union message to a united Germany, is likely to further ease worries  that problems in absorbing the shattered former East region might erode German  commitment to the ideal of European political union.  </P> <P> Kohl also formally presented plans for billions of dollars in new government  spending to extend new telephone, electricity and road networks into what was  East Germany.  </P> <P> The chancellor spoke in the 19th-Century Reichstag building, where so much of  Germany's checkered history has unfolded.  </P> <P> Although the old West German Parliament had held brief, symbolic sessions in  the Reichstag annually from the mid-1960s, Thursday's sitting was the first  there by an all-German legislative body since December, 1932, the month before  Hitler came to power.  </P> <P> After its initial session, the Parliament will return to Bonn, where it will  stay until a decision is made after elections scheduled for Dec. 2 on whether  to relocate to Berlin.  </P> <P> Kohl's comments on European unity were considered important, especially to the  many representatives of Germany's European neighbors who were guests at the  session. Among them, and introduced at the start, were the commanders of the  U.S., British and French forces in Berlin, whose presence guaranteed West  Berlin's security from the end of World War II until last Tuesday.  </P> <P> Through the long years of division, West Germans were among the strongest  emotional as well as financial backers of the European Community, often  re-channeling any sense of national patriotism into European idealism.  </P> <P> Germany has by far the largest population in the 12-nation community, and any  wavering of its commitment would have a significant impact both on the  integration process itself and the manner in which other member states view  Germany.  </P> <P> The timing of this renewed commitment is also important because the community  plans to set up formal commissions in December to begin substantive work on the  task of building an economic and political union among the 12 countries.  </P> <P> In language more decisive than at any time in recent weeks, Kohl also pledged a  united Germany's continued cooperation with France in the push for this deeper  European integration. Strong Franco-German cooperation is considered essential  to progress in this area, but the close ties in recent months have been  disturbed by French apprehensions over German unity and a personal rift between  Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand.  </P> <P> Departing from his prepared text, Kohl described the Franco-German relationship  as of "existential importance."  </P> <P> "This was one of the decisive prerequisites for the progress of the last 30  years," Kohl said. "For the next five years, it will be more important."  </P> <P> In his hourlong address, Kohl urged Germans to join together to overcome the  difficulties presented by unification.  </P> <P> He announced plans to spend $4.5 billion over the next 18 months for 1.5  million new telephone connections in the eastern regions, $6.6 billion for  local community improvements and a $13-billion, five-year program to modernize  the electricity network.  </P> <P> Addressing critics among the main opposition Social Democrats who have  complained about the costs of unification, the chancellor asserted that the  cost of continued division would have run far more.  </P> <P> "If anyone takes these gigantic sums into consideration, isn't it more sensible  to invest . . . in the unity of our fatherland," he challenged.  </P> <P> Despite the sense of occasion that accompanied the Reichstag sitting, the mood  in the chamber remained remarkably informal and light.  </P> <P> Although the Reichstag is associated with Hitler's years of infamy, Parliament  never met in the building during his years in power. The final session came six  weeks before Hitler won the chancellorship in January, 1933. Less than a month  later, fire swept the Reichstag, and the arrest of a Dutch Communist in  connection with the incident was used by Hitler to obtain greater law-and-order  powers.  </P> <P> He quickly forced through a law enabling him to suspend basic individual  rights.  </P> <P> Heavy fighting between German and Soviet forces in the final days of World War  II destroyed the building, which was rebuilt in the late 1950s as a home for a  future united German parliament.  </P></p>

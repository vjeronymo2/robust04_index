The NVIC has no regulatory force; it simply provided guidance until the issuance of this regulation. The Coast Guard also issued Change 1 to NVIC 2&hyph;93 on July 28, 1993, providing shipowners with the current list of national operational contact points adopted by the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC). On February 17, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 8086). The Coast Guard received 36 letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> MARPOL 73/78  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (the Act) authorizes the Coast Guard to administer and enforce Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 is entitled ``Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil'' and is designed to prevent the discharge of oil into the marine environment. MARPOL 73/78 defines oil as petroleum in any form, including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and refined products; it does not include animal or vegetable based oil or noxious liquid substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation 26  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MEPC of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 at its 31st session in July 1991. Regulation 26 requires every oil tanker of 150 gross tons and above and every other ship of 400 gross tons and above to carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan approved by its flag state. This requirement entered into force for party states, including the United States, on April 4, 1993, for new ships and enters into force on April 4, 1995, for existing ships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 32nd session of IMO in March 1992 adopted a set of guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)) with more specific information for the preparation of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. The guidelines are intended to assist parties to Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 in developing regulations for domestic implementation of Regulation 26, and are the basis of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation 26 requires that plans be prepared according to the guidelines developed by IMO and written in the working language of the ship's master and officers.

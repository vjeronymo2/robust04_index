			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: JVC turns in first deficit for four decades IN ANOTHER sign of the troubles afflicting the Japanese consumer electronics industry, JVC yesterday reported its first loss in four decades with a pre-tax deficit of Y2.3bn (Dollars 17m) for the fiscal year ending in March. The result, however, was better than JVC's expectation that it would lose Y2.8bn. It forecast a return to profitability in the current fiscal year with pre-tax earnings of Y1bn, well below the Y22bn it earned in fiscal 1990. Sales fell 5 per cent to Y606bn, while net earnings fell by 96 per cent to Y544m due to extraordinary costs associated with the restructuring of its 18 sales subsidiaries in Japan. Sales are expected to fall further in fiscal 1992 to Y580bn due to weak demand in Japan, while the net profit will climb to Y1bn. The dividend was cut to Y10 from Y12.50 the previous year. Consolidated sales slipped by 9 per cent to Y839bn, while net earnings dropped by 88 per cent to Y2bn. JVC has been hurt by lower demand in Japan, the US and Europe for consumer electronics. Pioneer, the Japanese consumer electronics concern, reported a 13.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y33bn for fiscal 1991 and predicted a further 20 per cent decrease in the current fiscal year. Sales rose by 4.9 per cent to Y416bn as an increase in exports limited the effects of a downturn in the Japanese market. But earnings were adversely affected by slimmer profit margins due to the appreciation of the yen and strong competition in both Japan and abroad. Net profits fell by 11.9 per cent to Y17.8bn.</p>

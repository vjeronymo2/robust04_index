			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Looking to the future - The Speculator IN THE US, futures funds look after some Dollars 21bn of assets, but the sector has yet to take off in the UK. Only a few managers have entered the market since the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) licenced such funds in 1991. In part, this is because of a public image that links futures with wild speculation. But futures can be used to reduce risk, as well as to increase it. It is thus important that potential investors understand the different types of futures funds. One simple use of futures funds is to match a particular index. This is relatively easy to do, since most major stock market indices are traded on one of the world's futures exchanges. Furthermore, since for every futures buyer there is a seller, one also can create funds that perform in a completely opposite way from a given index. This gives additional scope to those who believe, say, that the FT-SE 100 index is riding for a fall. Instead of just selling shares and investing in cash, the bear can aim to make a profit from the falling market. John Govett has a range of bull and bear funds based on US, UK, European and Japanese indices, as well as other financial commodities such as the US dollar. The same principle can be applied to provide a geared return on the index - a so-called GFOF (or geared futures and options fund). Govett has a GFOF which aims to double the capital growth of the FT-SE 100 index; the corollary is that, if the index falls, the investor's losses are doubled. So, this type of fund is only for the strong of stomach (and wallet). A different variation is to use futures to try to reduce the effect of the stock market's volatility. Last year, Fidelity launched the Stabiliser Growth range, a set of four funds covering the UK, America, Europe and Japan. They were designed to provide a return which does not rise as quickly as the index in a bull market, but does not fall as fast as the index in a bear market. The aim was to create a 'half-way house' for investors who were thinking about moving funds from the building society into shares but were alarmed by the risks involved. In the US, futures funds tend to give the manager greater freedom. Some funds are allowed to take bull and bear positions in a range of financial instruments, and even in agricultural commodities, where there is a perceived opportunity for profit. The investor obviously has to buy on the basis of the reputation of the fund manager, although there are funds which use a range of futures specialists. Such speculative vehicles have yet to be launched in the UK, thanks mainly to the tight rules of the SIB. For European investors, ED&amp; F. Man offers a range of futures funds which take the diversified approach. The key to overcoming traditional European caution has been to offer a guarantee. So, a substantial proportion of the funds is invested in zero coupon bonds, which grow to repay the investor's initial capital; the rest is used to play the futures markets. The Man funds, which are registered in offshore centres such as Bermuda, are not SIB-recognised and cannot be sold directly to UK investors.</p>

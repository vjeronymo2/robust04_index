			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / French reshuffle likely after minister's sacking: Socialists suffer further setback in cantonal elections THE DISMISSAL at the weekend of Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French minister for public administration, means that President Francois Mitterrand will be virtually forced to announce a government reshuffle this week, possibly including replacement of Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister. Pressure for changes in the government intensified yesterday with a sharp setback for the Socialists in local cantonal voting. Mr Soisson was a leading non-Socialist who had been recruited to broaden the government's political base. With his dismissal coming on top of their defeat in regional elections a week ago and now in cantonal voting, the Socialists look increasingly isolated and feeble. Preliminary returns last night showed that the Socialists lost numerous seats to conservative opponents in the run-off second round of the cantonal elections. With 764 out of 1,423 cantons counted, the Interior Ministry said conservative candidates shared 55.9 per cent of the vote, with the Socialists and their allies winning only 32.8 per cent. Initial results indicated the Socialists would lose five of the 29 departments they controlled - Nord, Puy de Dome, Drome, Gers and Dordogne. All were long-standing Socialist bastions and Nord had been held by the Left since 1934. Mrs Cresson was only narrowly re-elected in a western cantonal constituency of Chatellerault, while social affairs minister Jean-Louis Bianco was defeated in a local poll in Provence. Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence minister, conceded that the results were a fresh setback for the party and the government. 'The voters have given a warning, a sign of dissatisfaction,' he said. 'The government must take account of this.' Socialist Party leader Laurent Fabius said: 'This is a serious failure for the Socialist party and it must be recognised honestly. . . We must hear the message that the French people have sent us.' The most immediate implication of Mr Soisson's sacking is that it may become much more difficult for the Socialists to secure the support of moderate conservatives, either as members of the government or in parliament. Indeed, it may be impossible so long as Mrs Cresson remains prime minister, since her feisty character is not naturally suited for consensus building. Mr Soisson was sacked by Mrs Cresson on the grounds that he had accepted the support of the extreme right-wing National Front members of the newly elected Bourgogne regional council in the ballot for council president. Mr Soisson, whose surprise election was secured by only one vote, claimed that all his votes in the secret ballot came from respectable political parties. But the bare figures suggest he may have got help from the National Front, and the National Front leadership has been careful to sustain the uncertainty. Mrs Cresson gave Mr Soisson the option of choosing between his seat in government and his presidency of the regional council. He chose Bourgogne.</p>

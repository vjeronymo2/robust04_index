			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Attorney General Bohumira Kopecna by Pavla </F> Safrankova; place and date not given: "State Attorneys Will Be  Appointed in May"]    [Excerpt] [Safrankova] What will you focus on in your  post of attorney general?    [Kopecna] First of all, on finishing the proposal for the  minister of justice on appointment of the state attorneys. They  will be appointed to their posts according to the Law on the  Office of State Attorney on 17, 19, and 23 May. I consider  expert qualifications and integrity to be the most important  criteria. At this time, approximately 900 attorneys who were  transferred here from the former offices of the prosecutor work  at the state attorney offices. As of 1 July, there will be  approximately 100 fewer of them. Their number at the individual  levels of the office of state attorney is defined by the  Ministry of Justice and are derived from the number of judges.    [Safrankova] Do you have any other priorities?    [Kopecna] I will also concentrate on further developing  cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior in the struggle  against crime because, after all, criminal action is the focal  point of the work of the office of state attorney. It takes part  in a civil action only exceptionally as specified by law. This  concerns, above all, selected sections of Family Law--denial of  fatherhood according to Article 62 of the Family Law, for  instance. [passage omitted]</p>

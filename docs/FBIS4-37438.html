			<p>BFN     [Text] China has expressed its willingness to support  entry of India into the Asia-Pacific Economic Caucus, APEC.  This was conveyed by the Chinese minister for foreign trade and  economic cooperation, Ms. Wu Yi, when she called on the prime  minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, in New Delhi today. During the  meeting, the two leaders felt that there is enormous potential  for bilateral trade between the two countries. They appreciated  the complementary qualities between India and China and said  that there is a rich potential for establishing joint ventures  for third-country markets. It was also emphasized that both  countries should work for increasing direct bilateral trade and  to avoid as far as possible the reexport trade.</p>

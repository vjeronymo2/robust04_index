			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAPD RESPONDS WITH NEW SUBSTATION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department opened a new substation in the Harbor Gateway  on Wednesday in an effort to increase police patrols in the narrow city strip,  which residents complain receives inadequate protection.  </P> <P> City officials said the substation will be used by officers patrolling the  Harbor Gateway to write reports, make phone calls and perform other  administrative tasks.  </P> <P> Previously, the officers had to return to stations in San Pedro and Watts.  </P> <P> Although no new officers will be added to Harbor Gateway patrols, officials  said the substation should allow current patrols to spend more time in the  community.  </P> <P> "It should provide incentive to keep the officers in the Gateway," said Niki  Tennant, Harbor Gateway deputy to Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who proposed  the substation. "It is a very convenient place for the officers to drop in."  </P> <P> The substation, which is not open to the public, is on the ground floor of a  12-story office building at 879 W. 190th St., near the junction of the Harbor  (110) and San Diego (405) freeways.  </P></p>

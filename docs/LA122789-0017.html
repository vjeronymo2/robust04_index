			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EX-MAYOR OPPOSES BACK PAY BUT IS SEEKING HIS SHARE;  </P> <P> BURBANK: COUNCIL MEMBERS VOTED THEMSELVES A RETROACTIVE RAISE. ONE OF THEM SAYS  THERE SHOULD BE A RESOLUTION TO INCLUDE RAISES FOR TWO FORMER MEMBERS.  </P> <P> A former mayor of Burbank said Tuesday he still opposes a retroactive salary  increase City Council members voted themselves last month, but that as long as  it has passed, he wants his share or he may sue.  </P> <P> Former Mayor Al Dossin said he is entitled to receive up to $2,736 in back pay  retroactive to 1985.  </P> <P> "Most citizens didn't understand that the pay increase was retroactive," he  said. "I think it's wrong and selfish. It shows an absolute lack of  conscience."  </P> <P> But Dossin said that if the council is going to stand by its decision, then he  and former Councilwoman Mary Kelsey should receive back pay for the four years  they served on the five-member panel, which chooses the mayor from among its  members. Both Dossin and Kelsey -- also a former mayor -- were defeated in city  elections in February.  </P> <P> Kelsey said Tuesday she also opposed the retroactive pay increase, but declined  to comment on whether she and Dossin should receive any money. "I'm not going  to get into that," Kelsey said. "If they don't want to give it to us, we can't  make them."  </P> <P> Dossin said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the city if he does not  get the retroactive pay. "I think it's very unfair," he said.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Stephen Helvey said the ordinance that outlines  provisions for the pay increase was written to include retroactive pay for  current council members only. But Helvey said the City Council could adopt a  resolution to include the two former council members as well.  </P> <P> At least one council member said Tuesday that she would support such a  resolution.  </P> <P> The council members voted 4 to 1 last month to raise their salaries from $600  to $765 a month effective Jan. 1. Councilman Tim Murphy cast the dissenting  vote, saying he did not feel comfortable voting for a raise.  </P> <P> The five part-time council members had not received a salary increase since  Jan. 1, 1985, when a voter-approved ordinance went into effect. That ordinance  set salaries at the same level that council members receive, by state law, in  some similar-size cities.  </P> <P> The ordinance called for a maximum 5% cost-of-living raise to be voted on  annually by the council. The votes, however, were never taken because of an  oversight by city staff workers, who discovered the discrepancy while reviewing  salary provisions for elected officials, City Manager Robert (Bud) Ovrom has  said.  </P> <P> As a result, Mayor Robert R. Bowne and council members Michael Hastings and  Mary Lou Howard have each received checks for $3,768 -- the money they would  have made if the cost-of-living allowances had been approved each year -- said  Larry Wagenbach, accounting operations supervisor for Burbank. Councilmen  Thomas Flavin and Tim Murphy, both elected in February, received $1,032 apiece,  Wagenbach said.  </P> <P> Howard, who said she is donating her retroactive pay to charities in Burbank,  said she would support Dossin and Kelsey receiving the money. Murphy, who  opposed any salary increase, said it would only be fair for the council to  consider a resolution that would give the back pay to Dossin and Kelsey.  </P> <P> "But that doesn't mean I'd vote for it," Murphy said.  </P> <P> The other three council members could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P></p>

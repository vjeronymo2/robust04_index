Under the Program, SBA is authorized to make direct loans to qualified intermediary lenders who will use the proceeds to make short-term, fixed rate microloans, of not more than $25,000, but particularly in amounts averaging $7,500, to start-up, newly established and growing small business concerns. In conjunction with the loans made to intermediary lenders, SBA may make grants to such intermediary lenders to be used to provide intensive marketing, management and technical assistance to microloan borrowers under this Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SBA will accept responses from entities located in the above jurisdictions which seek to be accepted into the Program as an intermediary.

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 103 AND ROXANI GILLESPIE  </P> <P> Harvey Rosenfield is upset because Gillespie has announced that most of the  rollbacks promised by Prop. 103 will not be forthcoming because the companies  are not making that much money.  </P> <P> Harvey does not trust the insurance companies' figures. He claims that they are  hiding exorbitant profits in their reserves.  </P> <P> Insurance companies aren't the only businesses that use reserves. They are an  accounting necessity so that expenses attributable to a particular time period  are charged against the income for that period. I would like to give a  simplified version of how reserves work.  </P> <P> If your only asset is your $1,000 paycheck for a month, you could say when you  get paid that you had a net worth of $1,000. Not so if you have any bills to  pay. Say that you pay bills you owe of $700.  </P> <P> It looks like that leaves you with a net worth of $300 for the month. However,  you generally spend $100 for groceries. You have to set up a reserve for that  $100. That gives you a net worth of only $200.  </P> <P> From past history you know that you average an emergency expenditures of about  $100 a month. A contingency reserve must be set up for this. This now gives you  a net worth of $100.  </P> <P> If your calculations are correct, you will end up the month with a net worth of  $100, not the $1,000 you started with. Insurance companies do the same thing.  </P> <P> HARRY D. BOYD  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

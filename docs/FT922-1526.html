			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Poll challenges role of Israeli territories A LARGE majority of former Israeli generals and senior intelligence officers believe Israel could safely give up the occupied territories, according to a survey published yesterday. The survey, which comes two days before a general election in which the ruling Likud party is defending its refusal to yield any territory in Middle East peace talks, largely endorsed the opposition Labour party's stance that Israel should be prepared to give up much of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in return for peace and tough security measures. Government supporters dismissed the poll, carried out by an independent organisation, as propaganda by the group of retired officers which commissioned it. But it appeared to undermine Likud's insistence that, in addition to ideological claims to the land, the occupied territories are a vital component in Israel's security. The poll of former generals showed 68 per cent were prepared to give up the West Bank and Gaza and 71 per cent 'a substantial part' of the Golan Heights, given appropriate security arrangements. In another awkward issue for Likud, the government yesterday reversed an earlier announcement that members of the Palestinian negotiating team at the Middle East talks who held a public meeting last week with Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, in contravention of Israeli law would be arrested on their return. A police spokesman said only that they would be investigated, apparently acknowledging that arrest would spark powerful international pressure to release them. Loss of direction, Page 14</p>

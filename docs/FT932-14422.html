			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Ultra-right suspected of Hani assassination: Evidence of plot to hold up democracy in S Africa TENS OF thousands of grieving South African blacks paid their last respects yesterday to assassinated guerrilla leader Mr Chris Hani, as evidence emerged that his death may have been part a rightwing conspiracy to destabilise democracy talks. Mr Hani, idolised by township blacks as one of the greatest heroes of their liberation struggle, lay in state throughout the day in an open casket at a soccer stadium outside Soweto. As the 30,000-strong crowd sang songs in praise of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the African National Congress military wing, ANC leaders filed past the coffin of the man who once commanded Umkhonto in exile. Some touched the body which was dressed in military fatigues and surrounded by flowers. Female mourners wept. The elder statesmen of the ANC, former leader Mr Oliver Tambo and long-time political prisoner Mr Walter Sisulu, led the sad cortege. Mr Nelson Mandela viewed the body last night. After an all-night vigil at the stadium, Mr Hani's body will be buried later today in the mainly white, working-class town of Boksburg, where he was shot by a white assassin on April 10. It will be one of the largest political events ever in South Africa, and may spark clashes between white residents and black mourners. As Boksburg residents prepared for today's funeral, barricading homes and drafting in friends to protect their property, police were interrogating a prominent rightwing white, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, who they said was a suspect in Mr Hani's assassination. Mr Derby-Lewis is a leading figure in the Conservative party, the official parliamentary opposition, and member of the advisory President's Council, part of the government's executive branch. Mr Derby-Lewis regularly made news headlines for his racist comments, including an incident in 1989 when he commented, 'what a pity' on hearing that an aircraft had braked to avoid a black man on the runway at Johannesburg airport. His arrest raises fears that the murder was part of a conspiracy which extends well beyond the lunatic white fringe - the other suspect, Mr Janusz Walus, is a member of the ultra-right neo-Nazi group, the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) - to the top of the rightwing establishment. Political analysts say the involvement of the Conservative party, which polled 800,000 votes in last year's white referendum, is far more worrying than that of the AWB, an militarist organisation which has vowed to carry out what it calls the 'Third Boer War' against blacks. As well as Mr Derby-Lewis, police were holding a second rightwing supporter, who murdered two black protesters on Saturday. The murder of Mr Hani has proved a strategic coup for the ultra-right. Resulting violence has pushed whites further to the right, weakening the ruling National party; and the ultra-right has lost its inactive image. However, the ANC says it will continue to negotiate with the Conservative party and the transition to democracy seems likely to be accelerated as a result.

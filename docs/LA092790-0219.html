			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SMALL BUSINESS;  </P> <P> CHAMBER'S NEW VIDEO LIBRARY FOR OWNERS MAKES ITS DEBUT  </P> <P> The Greater Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday opened Orange County's  first video library for small businesses.  </P> <P> The Business Media Center contains a series of 30-minute videos, developed by  the chamber and Pacific Bell, that provide small business owners tips on  financing, marketing and management.  </P> <P> The initial videos are in English but videos dubbed in Spanish, Vietnamese and  Cambodian will be available soon, said Michael Metzler, the chamber's  president.  </P> <P> The library is the brainchild of insurance agent Paul Park, a chamber member,  and is open to members only.  </P> <P> "This is a prototype model for other chambers of commerce in the nation to  follow," Park said. "This will provide business owners the necessary  information to run their companies efficiently by using local businessmen to  discuss local business problems."  </P> <P> Comcast Cable TV (Channels 3 and 26) in Santa Ana agreed to air some of the  videos in October, Metzler said.  </P></p>

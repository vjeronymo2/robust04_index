			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Under-prescribing by doctors may be penny wise, pound foolish Sir, Your leader ('Curbing the cost of drugs', January 7) rightly warns that bearing down on pharmaceutical costs can result in increasing the costs of more expensive hospital and out-patient treatment. However, while you suggest there should be incentives to provide no more treatment for patients than is needed, you overlook the potentially expensive practice of doctors prescribing less than they should. There are already supply side restrictions on industry profits through the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme and, on the demand side, financial incentives and pressures on doctors to contain their prescribing. But there is no mechanism by which doctors are being encouraged to increase or improve their prescribing, even when there is clear evidence that it would bring such long-term savings as you identified to the National Health Service. Doctors, faced with financial pressures from their local health authorities, are avoiding advances in medicines on the grounds of their perceived costs. One example is the low take-up in the UK of ACE inhibitors to treat high blood pressure. The heart failure task force has reported that 'there is overwhelming evidence that, in heart failure, ACE inhibitors can improve quality of life, reduce death rate and reduce hospital admissions. Less than 5 per cent of heart failure patients receive this treatment'. A further study of this class of medicines has shown that treatment of insulin-dependent diabetics with an ACE inhibitor can also dramatically reduce the risk of kidney failure. As well as halving the death rate among patients at risk, such treatment would also save the NHS Pounds 200m a year in the cost of reduced dialysis or kidney transplants - after allowing for the cost of prescribing the ACE inhibitor. Cost saving schemes are currently designed solely to reward those who prescribe fewer or cheaper medicines but this penny wise, pound foolish approach is not in the interests of individual patients or the taxpayers' interests of achieving a cost effective NHS. A rise in the medicines bill, like a reduction in hospital beds, can be a sign of improving health.

A Foreign Office spokesman expressed deep concern  over the escalation of fighting between rival factions in Kabul  and Mazar-e Sharif. The spokesman said the use of force is not  the right method to resolve political differences and disputes.  The military success of one faction over another will only be  temporary and it can widen the area of confrontation, thereby  affecting national unity. He said the Afghan leaders should  resume the process of reconciliation in order to meet the need  of the hour. He said the Islamabad and Jalalabad accords  reached between mojahedin organizations last year were based on  national consensus and they provide the base for a durable  political settlement that can restore peace in Afghanistan.</p>

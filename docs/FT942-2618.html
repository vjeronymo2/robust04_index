			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Editor of Independent newspapers agrees to stand down Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent, has agreed to stand down as editor. Mr Matthew Symonds, one of the three founders and executive editor, is expected to leave the group. Mr Whittam Smith, who is editor-in-chief and chairman of Newspaper Publishing, the company which owns The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, will remain as chairman. He has made his intentions clear to a number of directors and shareholders of the company. The decision to step down is his own and the timing of the announcement will depend on finding a successor. Informal soundings have already taken place, and this process is now likely to get under way in earnest. A very long list has already been drawn up and shareholders are being encouraged to add names to it. The list includes a number of broadcasters with little experience of newspapers such as Mr Jeremy Paxman, the Newsnight presenter, and Mr Roger Mosey, editor of Radio 4's Today programme. Ms Liz Forgan, managing director of BBC Radio - who used to work for The Guardian - is also being mentioned. The more orthodox names range from Mr Jonathan Fenby, a former Independent journalist who now edits The Observer, and Mr Ian Hargreaves, deputy editor of the Financial Times, to Mr Nigel Wade of The Daily Telegraph and Mr Ian Jack, editor of the Independent on Sunday. Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of HJ Heinz and of Independent Newspapers of Ireland - who controls 29.9 per cent of Newspaper Publishing - had a further meeting yesterday with Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, which is also a significant shareholder in The Independent.

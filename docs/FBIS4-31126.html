			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Positive economic trends have given rise  to optimism in government and business circles in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. The Belgrade press agency TANJUG  reported on 17 May that industrial output has been "steadily"  increasing since the beginning of the year, the market is  "reasonably" well supplied, the national currency, the dinar, is  "completely" stable, foreign currency reserves have grown, and  budget deficits are decreasing.    Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the National Bank of  Yugoslavia and the architect of the economic recovery program,  stated in an interview published in the 17 May issue of the  Ljubljana weekly MLADINA that his program enjoys "wide" public  support. He boasted that Yugoslavia had even accumulated a trade  surplus in spite of the sanctions and that the "international  financial police" has so far been unable to prevent it from  doing so. "In the Balkans, smugglers have really mastered their  trade," he told MLADINA, explaining that Serbian wine can be  bought in the United States, Switzerland, and Germany. A shoe  factory in Kraljevo, he said, is working "full steam" for the  Italian market, and "planeloads" of money are being sent from  Belgrade. Avramovic invited the reporter to the Belgrade  railroad station to see 20-car trains loaded with furniture  departing every day. After all, he concluded, "UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] itself is a huge smuggling operation,"  pointing out that each soldier in the newly arrived Russian  contingent "will leave Yugoslavia with a good car."    Avramovic is convinced that sanctions against Yugoslavia  "must fail," although he conceded that the country is paying a  heavy price to circumvent them: It is paying 30 to 40 percent  above world market prices for its imports while its exports sell  for 30 to 40 percent below market prices. He is also concerned  by shortages of petroleum and drugs. On the other hand,  Avramovic said he is comforted by the fact that "the country can  feed itself well," a "capable" light-industry sector, and a  strong armaments industry.    Similarly, the 16 May issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA  cited  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as telling U.S. journalists  that "sanctions cannot do us any harm even if they last another  thousand years." The same issue of BORBA carried a report on the  opening of an agricultural fair in Novi Sad at which Federal  Prime Minister Radoje Kontic recognized food producers and  farmers "who not only managed to survive under the blockade but  continued to work and share a major burden in the implementation  of the stabilization program." After touring the agricultural  fair, Milosevic also praised the accomplishments of Serbian  farmers and declared Serbia an "agricultural and agroindustrial  power," TANJUG reported on 20 May.    In a statement to Radio Moscow reported by the 18 May BORBA,  Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic said that "although  sanctions have had a serious economic and social impact, they  have neither politically destabilized the country nor made us  sway from our principled policy." Addressing the participants of  the International Conference of Journalists in Belgrade,  Marjanovic recounted the effects of sanctions on the economy,  estimating the damage at $30-40 billion. Nevertheless, he  stressed the positive results of the economic recovery program,  according to the 24 May TANJUG report.    A monthly opinion poll conducted by the Belgrade-based  Market  Research Institute showed growing optimism among Yugoslav  businessmen, TANJUG reported on 25 May. According to the poll,  63 percent of businessmen expect industrial growth to continue  during the next six months. In a similar poll conducted a year  earlier, TANJUG states, 60 percent of those surveyed expected a  sharp fall in production. Sixty-four percent of respondents in  the recent poll expect the business climate to improve over the  next six months, compared to 31 percent of respondents to a poll  taken in January. However, the TANJUG report notes, "experts"  warn that an increase in industrial production might create  problems, since low wages have weakened consumers' purchasing  power to the point that "the population is struggling at the  subsistence level" at the same time that UN sanctions are  preventing exports.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Peruvian economy minister appointed MR Jorge Camet Dickman, Peru's industry minister for the past eight months, has been appointed economy and finance minister following last week's surprise departure of Mr Carlos Bolona. Mr Camet, 65, has a track record as a successful engineer and entrepreneur, and has twice presided over Peru's private businessmen's association. However, he has no background in economics and only limited knowledge and experience of the complex workings of the international financial institutions with which he will be obliged to negotiate in the coming months. Mr Camet has so far made no statement of substance on modifications to economic policy. He claims the general direction towards stabilisation and structural reform will continue and key members of the Bolona team are expected to stay on at the Economy Ministry. Recently both President Alberto Fujimori and Prime Minister Oscar de la Puente have reiterated the necessity of promoting industrial reactivation and raising social spending to create jobs and help the poor.</p>

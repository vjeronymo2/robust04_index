			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Accounts board warns on rules COMPANIES MUST obey the spirit and reasoning of the new accounting standards in almost every circumstance if their accounts are to comply with the law, according to draft documents issued yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board. Members of UK accounting bodies who are directors or officers of companies are also required to ensure their fellow officers understand the significance of the drafts, it says. The details come in two documents which stress that the standards issued by the board and its urgent-issues task force are underpinned in law. They include a legal opinion from Ms Mary Arden, a senior commercial barrister recently appointed a judge, who says the courts are likely to accept the guidelines. That view gives significant new authority to the board compared with its predecessor, the Accounting Standards Committee. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'This is a great leap forward. Before we could not move.' A separate foreword says abstracts from the board's urgent-issues task force are part of the standards which help meet the requirement in law that accounts show 'a true and fair view'. The forward also says that companies should adopt the standards as soon as possible. It stresses that there will normally be no scope for 'grandfathering' of transactions - by which companies can exempt transactions from new standards if they took place before the standards were introduced.

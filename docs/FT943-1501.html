			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Northrop Grumman to shed 9,000 jobs Northrop Grumman, the US defence group formed earlier this year through the Dollars 2.2bn merger of the Northrop and Grumman defence companies, yesterday announced that it would reduce its workforce of 47,500 employees by 9,000 over the next 15 months. Mr Kent Kresa, chairman and chief executive, called the move a 'painful but necessary step' in the increasingly competitive defence contracting environment. Last month Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two of the three biggest US defence contractors, announced plans for a Dollars 10bn merger. Northrop Grumman said about 1,000 of its planned job cuts resulted directly from the merger of Northrop and Grumman, mainly through the closure of Grumman's corporate office and the dissolution of the former Grumman aerospace and electronics group announced earlier in the year. Jobs at Grumman's Long Island operations in New York will be cut by 3,500, of which 2,500 will go by the end of this year. Northrop Grumman said about two-thirds of the cuts resulted from a restructuring announced by Grumman before the merger with Northrop. In California, job cuts are expected to total about 4,500, of which 700 will take place before the year end. The figure includes the previously reported reduction of 2,400 employees assigned to the B-2 stealth bomber programme, 1,600 job cuts in the military aircraft division in Hawthorn, and 500 job cuts in the Hawthorn electronics unit. Northrop Grumman also announced that changes to its early retirement plan and the offer of early retirement to 5,000 employees would result in a one-time charge of Dollars 300m in its fourth quarter if 60 per cent of employees accepted the offer. The precise amount would not be known until after the acceptance deadline of November 15.</p>

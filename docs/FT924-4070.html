			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Serbian ruling seeks to stop Panic running for president MR Milan Panic, Yugoslav prime minister, yesterday rejected as 'insane' a decision by Serbia's electoral commission to turn down his candidacy for the Serbian presidency, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Opposition parties threatened to boycott the elections on December 20 if the decision was not revoked and they accused the authorities of trying to rig the result by tampering with voter lists. The electoral commission said Mr Panic was ineligible because he had not lived in Serbia for the past year as required by law. 'It is insane. It is unfair. Above all, it is unconstitutional,' Mr Panic said. 'I will not accept such a slap to democracy.' He added: 'It is clear today that those who rule Serbia are afraid of free and honest elections.' The decision was absurd, he said. 'I am the prime minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since 1992. How is it possible that a prime minister of Yugoslavia does not fulfil requirements to run for Serbian presidency?' Serbia and Montenegro are the only republics remaining in Yugoslavia. Mr Panic, a 62-year-old emigre businessman from the US, formally launched his campaign on Tuesday with a promise to stop bloodshed in former Yugoslav republics and end Serbia's international isolation. A spokesman for the electoral commission said he had 48 hours to appeal against the decision, which would end his attempt to remove Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his hardline nationalist rival, from the Serbian leadership. His aides said he fulfilled residency requirements because he had rented a Belgrade apartment for more than a year. But the commission spokesman said Mr Panic was a foreign citizen at the time.</p>

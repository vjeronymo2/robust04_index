Model 214ST helicopters, that requires creation of a component history card and establishes an additional retirement life for the main rotor mast (mast). This amendment is prompted by fatigue analysis and retesting that showed that the mast is sensitive to frequent takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events) in addition to time-in-service. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fatigue failure of the mast, loss of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> August 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This AD and any related information may be examined in the Rules Docket at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mr. Lance Gant, Aerospace Engineer, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Southwest Region, Rotorcraft Directorate, Fort Worth, Texas 76193&hyph;0170, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5141, fax (817) 222&hyph;5959. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214ST helicopters was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59967). That action proposed to require creation of a component historical service record and proposed to establish an additional retirement life of 50,000 high-power events for the main rotor mast (mast), part number (P/N) 214&hyph;040&hyph;090&hyph;109. Currently, the mast has a retirement life of 10,000 hours' time-in-service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with some editorial changes. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the notice, the cost estimates associated with this AD were based on replacement of the mast and creation of the component history card for the entire fleet. This rule contains cost estimates for one-sixth of the fleet each year instead of the entire fleet, as in the notice. Additionally, the notice referred to the component history card as a ``historical service record or component history card''. This rule refers to it as a ``component history card or an equivalent record.'' Also, paragraph (d) of this rule was expanded to specify the details of the new retirement life. These changes will not increase the scope of the AD. However, the FAA has performed a more detailed cost analysis and has determined that, when factoring in the creation and maintenance of the component history card or equivalent record, the anticipated costs are $9,163 higher than the proposed amount for the first year, and $7,879 higher than the proposed amount for each subsequent year. In the proposal, the cost of this AD was estimated to be $53,970 each year ($323,820 for the total fleet).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 14 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that (1) it will take approximately 24 work hours per helicopter to replace the affected part due to the new method of determining the retirement life required by this AD, (2) it will take approximately 2 work hours per helicopter to create the component history card or equivalent record (record), (3) it will take approximately 10 work hours per helicopter to maintain the record each year, and (4) the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $21,810 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators for the first year is estimated to be $63,133, and each subsequent year to be $61,849. These costs assume replacement of the mast in one-sixth of the fleet each year, creation and maintenance of the records for all the fleet the first year, and creation of one-sixth of the records and maintenance of the records for all the fleet each subsequent year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Muhsin Dallul, defense and acting </F> information minister, with unidentified correspondents in Beirut  on 20 April--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Dallul] The cabinet held its weekly session  under His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri at 1700  today in the Government House. The prime minister began the  session by highlighting the government's insistence on handing  over the two Iraqi defendants to the judicial authorities to  continue the investigation. His Excellency Foreign Minister  Faris Buwayz presented a detailed report on the issue and on the  implementation of the cabinet decision to sever diplomatic ties  and on conveying this decision to the Iraqi charge d'affaires.  He also reviewed the reactions to the decision. The cabinet  then discussed the items on its agenda. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Did the cabinet discuss the workers' living  conditions and demonstrations?    [Dallul] We are always discussing this issue. The cabinet's  decision is to ban demonstrations. This decision remains in  effect and will not be rescinded, because it serves the  interests of the people and Lebanon. We will confront whatever  harms Lebanon's interests. We will not let such things pass,  whatever the consequences.</p>

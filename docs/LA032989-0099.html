			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon of Puerto Rico granted immediate parole eligibility  to former boxing champion Esteban de Jesus, who was sentenced to life in prison  for murder and later found to be afflicted with AIDS.  </P> <P> De Jesus was found guilty of first degree murder in 1981 for shooting to death  a youth during a street brawl. By advancing his parole eligibility from 1993,  the governor in effect commuted de Jesus' sentence.  </P> <P> The parole board has agreed to release de Jesus "on the condition that he be  transferred to the Faith Home of the Americas, where AIDS patients are  treated," said a statement released by the governor's office.  </P> <P> De Jesus, 37, was World Boxing Council lightweight champion from 1976 to 1978.  He retired from professional boxing in 1980.  </P></p>

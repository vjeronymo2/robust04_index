Around the Spring Festival, accompanied by Xie Fei, a member  of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of  the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Huang Huahua, deputy  secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, Yang  Shangkun travelled to Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Guangzhou, and Foshan on  an inspection tour, visiting the Shekou Industrial Zone, the  Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone, a  construction site in western Zhuhai, large state enterprises,  and Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises. During the tour, he  listened to reports by local party and government leaders on  completed work and the situation and had cordial conversations  with cadres and other people. Yang Shangkun praised Guangdong  for the changes it had brought about every year, saying that  every year sees bigger changes in Guangdong.    In the late 1970's, Yang Shangkun held a leading position in  Guangdong. He said: "At that time, the central authorities  decided to set up special economic zones in Guangdong and  introduce special policies to encourage businessmen from many  countries to invest in Guangdong or to cooperate with China in  economic development, thus effecting an earth-shaking change.  Facts have proven that the principle and the policies of reform  and opening up are entirely correct."    Yang pointed out: "The state will promulgate many major  reform measures involving many fields this year. As we are  pressed for time and have arduous tasks to attend to, we must  take care to study new problems, overcome new difficulties, sum  up new experience, and do our work more energetically and in a  more prudent and better way." He hoped Guangdong will strive  for greater successes in economic development.    During the inspection tour, Yang Shangkun especially praised  Guangdong for training a large number of competent cadres. He  said: "A number of cadres, especially the entrepreneurs I have  met here, are very competent and very young, with some of them  only a little over 30. This indicates that there is no lack of  successors to carry on our cause. They are where our hopes lie."    Yang's stay in Guangdong coincided with the tenth founding  anniversary of the Guangzhou Economic and Technological  Development Zone, so he went there to visit and to listen to a  work report. Over the last 10 years, the zone has spent 4.35  billion yuan on capital construction, introduced foreign capital  of $790 million, and set up 195 industrial enterprises, whose  total output value is 11.5 billion yuan, total export value is  $1.17 billion, and profits of 3.2 billion yuan with tax  delivered to the state amounting to 900 million yuan. Yang  praised the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development  Zone for its high-speed construction. He said that it is  necessary to launch more support projects related to water and  electricity supplies, transport, and the production of raw and  semi-finished materials, adding that in introducing advanced  technologies and equipment, efforts should be made to raise the  level of localizing imported equipment to build up greater power  for sustained economic development.    While in Guangzhou, Yang climbed to the 63d story of the  Guangdong International Hotel, the tallest building in China, to  enjoy a full view of Guangzhou. Catching sight of many tall  buildings standing in great numbers and the incessant stream of  vehicles in the streets, which shows Guangzhou has initially  developed into a modern city, he said happily that the scene on  this side was unique. He hoped that Guangzhou would be built  into a more beautiful and modern city.    During the tour, Yang also visited the Shenzhen Anke  Company,  the Huawei Company, the Guangzhou Baoyuan Limited Company, the  Guangdong Fotao Group, Guangxin Jiangwan Stock marketing  department, and other high-tech and financial enterprises and  wrote inscriptions of encouragement.</p>

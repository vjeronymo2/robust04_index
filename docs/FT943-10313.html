			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Nippondenso expects first profits rise for four years Nippondenso, the Toyota affiliate which is Japan's biggest maker of car parts, is on course for its first profits upturn in four years as a stringent cost-cutting programme offsets a decline in sales. Recurring profits for the first half to June, announced yesterday, were Y29.62bn (Dollars 286m), up 8.6 per cent from the Y27.26bn recorded in the same period of last year and a sharp improvement on the Y20bn the company had earlier expected to reach. Full-year profits are projected to touch Y50bn compared with Y41.63bn in 1993 and an earlier forecast of Y44bn. The achievement comes in the face not only of weaker demand from carmakers - Nippondenso supplies all in Japan except Nissan - but of the squeeze on suppliers' margins which the automotive companies have been exerting in order to hold down their costs. According to one analyst, Toyota is seeking 5 per cent annual reductions in component prices. Results for Toyota in its own full year to June are due later this month, and are expected to show a continued decline. Car sales in Japan turned upward in July for the first time in 15 months. Officials at Nippondenso said rationalisation measures and reduced overtime payments were worth Y15bn and formed the bulk of Y20.7bn in overall savings it was able to make during the six months - the rest came from a lower depreciation bill and cheaper raw materials. These were more than enough to offset the estimated Y18.3bn negative effect on profitability of factors such as a Y7bn impact from unfavourable currency movements. For its full-year projections Nippondenso, which exports about a sixth of its output, is assuming a yen-dollar exchange rate of Y102. Sales fell 4.8 per cent to Y622.6bn and are expected to total Y1,220bn for the year, against Y1,269.5bn. Interim net earnings emerged at Y16.14 per share compared with Y15.70, and the forecast for all of 1994 is Y27.45 against Y23.55.</p>

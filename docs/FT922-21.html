			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bibby poised for Spanish victory after raised bid J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural conglomerate, is finally poised to acquire Finanzauto following a new bid that has raised the value of Spain's sole Caterpillar distributor by 13 per cent to Pta15.9bn (Pounds 86.2m). Mr Jose Antonio Gonzalez, Finanzauto's chief executive, said that the company would drop its two month long hostility to Bibby's bid at an extraordinary meeting scheduled for yesterday evening. Finanzauto's decision to adopt a neutral position brings to an end one of the roughest foreign takeovers of a Spanish company. Madrid analysts said yesterday that the change of stance by Finanzauto paved the way for Bibby to acquire the greater part of the equity at the increased offer price of Pta1,500 (800p) per share. To Finanzauto's extreme irritation, Bibby, which is owned by Barlow Rand of South Africa, had originally valued Finanzauto at Pounds 75m in late April and had offered Pta1,300 per share to the Spanish company's fragmented equity holders. Claiming that the value of the company's stock was closer to Pta1,700, Finanzauto mounted a stiff defence. Analysts believe that Bibby may have paid too much from the point of view of a stock market investor, but that the final price could be justified as a long term industrial investment. Finanzauto is suffering the consequences of a deep recession in the Spanish construction sector, but it has close to 25 per cent of the domestic earth moving market. Bibby has requested Madrid's stock market commission to investigate Finanzauto's share price movements over the past two months.</p>

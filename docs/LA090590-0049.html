			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD'S SUMMER OF LOVE;  </P> <P> ROMANTIC 'GHOST' OUTGUNS MACHO MOVIES TO BECOME SEASON'S BIGGEST HIT  </P> <P> This was the summer when more people went to see Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze  than Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy, when moviegoers finally seemed to weary of  car crashes, explosions and automatic weapons.  </P> <P> Hollywood's macho summer ended with an old-fashioned message: America still  loves a love story. In a season when nearly all the major movies were  big-budget action pictures aimed at young men, the surprise success was a  relatively modest ($22-million budget) love story that offered one of the few  prominent roles for a woman.  </P> <P> "Ghost," an uplifting tribute to yuppie love starring Moore and Swayze, opened  second to "Die Hard 2" and steadily built up word-of-mouth to become the top  film of the summer, with $125 million in ticket sales through Labor Day.  Paramount Pictures poured hundreds of millions of dollars into hardware movies  this summer, but it was "Ghost" that gave the studio a strong edge over much of  its competition.  </P> <P> If tickets sales from another love story, "Pretty Woman" -- actually a spring  release -- are factored in, Disney was the top-earning studio over the summer,  according to Paul Kagan Associates. Produced for a modest $12 million, this  Pygmalion tale -- Henry Higgins takes home a hooker -- had grossed $169 million  through Labor Day, according to the studio. It also returned Richard Gere to  stardom and made co-star Julia Roberts one of the most sought-after actresses  in the business.  </P> <P> Disney also was helped by the success of "Dick Tracy," Warren Beatty's comic  book epic. The No. 4 film of the summer, "Dick Tracy" faced some tough odds  given that young people were not familiar with either Beatty or the character.  But a massive marketing blitz and generally good reviews pushed ticket sales to  $103.7 million.  </P> <P> But overall, moviegoing was off 5% from last year's record summer, according to  projections by Paul Kagan Associates. The firm projects that total box-office  receipts will top $1.92 billion, compared to $2.4 billion for last summer.  </P> <P> "It probably hurt that there were so many of the same pictures at the same  time," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which compiles  box-office figures. "There wasn't the diversity there was in previous years."  </P> <P> The list of the top 10 movies for the summer, as expected, was filled out by  action-adventure films. But many of the films failed to meet expectations set  by last year's adventure blockbusters: "Batman," "Indiana Jones and the Last  Crusade" and "Lethal Weapon 2."  </P> <P> The summer's results could challenge the popular notion in Hollywood that big  stars plus big budgets guarantee big returns at the box office. Analysts say  that none of this summer's major movies will lose money -- video, TV and  foreign markets will make up for any shortfall at U.S. theaters -- but many  industry insiders are predicting that it's just a matter of time before a  Hollywood studio runs into a high-tech "Heaven's Gate," the 1980 spectacle that  nearly destroyed United Artists.  </P> <P> "People are saying the budgets have gotten out of hand," said Elizabeth A.  Cameron, research associate at Smith Barney, a New York brokerage firm. "I  think the companies are going to scale back . . . There's this perception that  you have to spend $60 million for a movie and that's not the case."  </P> <P> Cameron said that business at the box office also was hurt by a slowing economy  and rising ticket prices. In addition, she said, the time window between  theater and video releases closed dramatically. As a result, she said, with  ticket prices reaching $7.50 at some New York and L.A. theaters, young  theatergoers are choosing to wait until their favorite movies come out on  video, rather than standing in line for a second viewing at theaters. Sales of  videos were up substantially this summer, Cameron said.  </P> <P> In the body-count sweepstakes, "Total Recall" -- director Paul Verhoeven's  complex science-fiction thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger -- was the  clear winner. With a budget that stretched beyond $60 million, the Carolco  production, distributed by Tri-Star, came in second place for the summer with  ticket sales of $116.7 million. Given Schwarzenegger's popularity in foreign  markets, many analysts expect the film to match that figure overseas.  </P> <P> The other action picture with the summer's biggest budget, 20th Century Fox's  "Die Hard 2" (industry estimates put the production costs above $62 million)  came in third place with more than $109.7 million in ticket sales. The sequel  to "Die Hard," (1988's sleeper summer hit), exceeded the original's ticket  sales by more than 35%. But overall this was not a kind summer for sequels.  </P> <P> In recent years, Eddie Murphy's name on a summer movie has guaranteed  $100-million-plus in ticket sales. But Paramount's "Another 48 HRS.," a sequel  to the buddy-cop picture that originally launched Murphy to stardom, had ticket  sales of $79.1 million and was rapped by critics for excessive violence and  insufficient plot. Although that ticket-sale figure is large -- and slightly  exceeds sales on the original -- it fell far short of expectations for a film  that cost at least $45 million to make.  </P> <P> Other sequels that failed to meet expectations were Universal's "Back to the  Future III," ($84.1 million, in contrast to $208 million for the original, one  of the 10 top films of all time); Orion's "RoboCop 2," ($44.8 million, compared  to $54 million for the original in 1987); and Warner Bros.' "Gremlins 2: The  New Batch" ($40.4 million compared to $148 million for the original, one of the  top five releases in 1984).  </P> <P> Tom Cruise's ode to stock car racing, "Days of Thunder," was considered by many  an earthbound sequel to the 1985 jet fighter hit, "Top Gun" (one critic even  charted the plot similarities). The Paramount film cost at least $50 million to  make and grossed $80.6 million -- a figure that has to be split roughly 50-50  between theater owners and the studio. In contrast, "Top Gun" grossed $177  million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUMMER CHAMPS  </P> <P> Top 10 Summer Films, With Box Office  </P> <P> 1. Ghost: $125.0  </P> <P> 2. Total Recall: $116.7  </P> <P> 3.

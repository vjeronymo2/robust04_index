			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Fed 'not pressed to relax policy' THE White House yesterday denied reports that it had sought a private undertaking from Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, to relax monetary policy last year as a condition for his appointment to a second term. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, chief White House spokesman, said senior administration officials had often called publicly for lower interest rates, but he denied pressure was applied in private meetings. That would be inappropriate, he said. The denial followed a claim on Wednesday in the Los Angeles Times that the administration had privately pressed Mr Greenspan 'for a commitment to pump up the economy during 1992.' The Fed was set up as an independent agency to prevent political control of interest rate policy. The newspaper said senior officials had held meetings with Mr Greenspan in spring and summer last year to urge him 'to alter Fed policy in an effort to reach specific growth targets during the coming election year.' A Fed spokesman said Mr Greenspan had never committed the Fed to specific economic growth targets. Reuter reports: The US economy is improving slowly and prices are generally stable, aside from a jump in lumber costs caused by Hurricane Andrew last month, the Federal Reserve said in its latest national survey. 'Economic activity has been improving slowly in most of the nation, but the pace of recovery has been uneven across regions and sectors,' the survey by the 12 Federal Reserve banks said. The report, known as the Beige Book, was based on information gathered before September 15 and is the last one before the November 3 presidential election, in which joblessness and economic weakness will be large in voters' concerns.</p>

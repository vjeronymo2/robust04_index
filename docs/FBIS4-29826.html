			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding a report that the Malaysian Islamic Center  has set up a fanatic center, or Al-Arqam in Bangkok, Commander  of the 4th Army Region Lieutenant General Kitti Ratanachaya said  the national level agency, or the Foreign Ministry, and senior  officials concerned will have to investigate the report. His  command, which is a local unit, does not have much information.    Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said during an  interview given to foreign journalists on 14 June that Thailand  must be careful because the group will carry out its mission  regardless of the status of relations between Thailand and  Malaysia.    Speaking to journalists on 21 June, Lt. Gen. Kitti said the  Malaysian minister probably made the remark out of concern about  relations with Thailand. He said the Malaysian side continues  to feel that relations between the two countries further have to  be strengthened. For example, the Trilateral Cooperation  Project will not materialize without good cooperation among the  countries concerned.    According to a report from the Foreign Ministry, Deputy  Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has directed the Thai envoy to  Kuala Lumpur to point out that Thailand allows free choice of  religion and that followers of any religion carrying out  religious activities within the scope of the law will be given  due protection. Thailand has no intention of interfering in  other countries' internal affairs, particularly in neighboring  countries. Regarding the reported training of the  aforementioned group in Thailand, Thailand wants evidence of  such conduct and is ready to provide cooperation to deal with  the matter.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASY GOER TO MAKE RETURN WEDNESDAY  </P> <P> Easy Goer, runner-up to Sunday Silence for 1989 horse of the year, will make  his 4-year-old debut Wednesday in the seven-furlong Gold Stage Stakes at  Belmont Park.  </P> <P> Easy Goer's Belmont Stakes victory denied Sunday Silence the Triple Crown. Easy  Goer finished second to Sunday Silence in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and in  the Breeders' Cup Classic.  </P> <P> Wednesday's race is a prep for the $500,000-added Metropolitan Handicap May 28.  </P> <P> Said Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer: "If I had to, I would have run in the  Met without a prep. It wasn't essential that this race go, but win or lose, at  least we're getting a good, solid race into him."  </P></p>

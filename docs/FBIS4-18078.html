			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The dispute between the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] and the coalition on the SPD's government  program, in particular its fiscal policy, continued on Wednesday  [30 March]. Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social  Union) criticized "a number of proposals for tax increases  covered up as subsidy cuts." Stepping up registration of  speculative profits would make housing construction collapse and  cause major shifts of securities to other countries, Waigel  pointed out.    These measures would not hit big capital but the employees  depending on German capital for job-creating and securing  measures. The finance minister also criticized that the SPD's 10  percent supplementary tax would put a burden on corporations and  joint-stock companies "right from the first mark."    Joachim Poss, the SPD Bundestag Group's monetary policy  spokesman, defended the intention to increase taxes on "high  assets." In the case of inheritance and property tax, tax-free  allowances should be increased to a level where only people  paying high amounts should face higher burdens. With  real-estate tax, small and medium assets should not be charged  more, either. Waigel is suggesting to taxpayers that the SPD  wants to abolish the system of taxable values and to apply full  values without adjusting tax-free allowances in future taxation  of real estate and property. Although taxable values should be  moved closer to actual current values, they must not reach the  full amount, Poss said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marcus Dam: "Living in the Times of Malaria"] </F>   [Text] The scourge seems to have finally buzzed its way  into Calcutta and settled here for good.    Earlier this week a report reaching the State's Health  Directorate stated that of the 26 cases of malaria detected in a  private laboratory in south Calcutta nine were of the malignant,  lethal variety known as Plasmodium falciparum, which  had been confined for long to the districts of North Bengal. But  this was just a tip of the iceberg in a city where the disease  seems to have assumed endemic proportions.    The two-fold increase in the incidence of the disease has  been causing concern to the authorities over the last two years.  In the past year 1,545 cases were reported from Calcutta,  against 728 attacks the preceding year. Any sign of a reversal  in trends seems absent.    The danger limits set by the World Health Organization have  been left behind, baffling experts who are alarmed over the rise  in the annual parasitic index which has exceeded 5,000,  confirming fears that the city has become "epidemiologically  dangerous".    A major reason for the increase in malignant malaria cases  (popularly referred to as cerebral malaria), which accounts for  nearly eight per cent of all reported malarial attacks, is the  victim's growing immunity to drugs as well as the vector's  resistance to insecticides, says Dr. Subodh Dey,  Mayor-in-Council, Health.    He admits that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation's fogging  machines (seven in all) "have of late not been utilized  optimally because of the hazards their use could cause to the  environment".    The vector -- Anophiles stephensi -- seems to have  turned resistant to organo-phosphorous compounds like batex,  used in spraying. Moreover, with more and more drains being  covered, large stretches are virtually inaccessible to spraying.    There is, however, another reason why not all zones where  anti-vector measures are required can be reached. Staff shortage  is a problem. In all 88 vacancies in the Corporation's Vector  Control Department have yet to be filled in", Dr. Dey adds.    Largely responsible for the patient's resistance to drugs is  the growing tendency among medical practitioners to ignore  WHO-recommended schedules where blood samples are expected to be  checked twice (seven and 21 days) following treatment, says Dr.  A.K. Mukhopadhyay, Assistant Director, Union Ministry of Health  and Family Planning.    There are, however, other reasons which could explain why  the  vector has suddenly found Calcutta so congenial, he feels.  According to him these are:     -  Rapid urbanization and the construction boom which comes  in its wake, and    -  The substantial migrant population hailing from endemic zones  in the Chhotanagpur belt.     Dr. Mukhopadhyay believes that a bulk of the malignant  malarial cases, which are reported from different malaria  clinics in the city, come from the more "posh areas" rather than  the suburbs. "For it is here, contrary to popular notion, that  the vector finds abundant breeding place," he adds. These places  are possibly:     -  the huge receptacles of water found lying about a  construction site;    -  domestic water reservoirs attached to nearly every house;    -  the stored water for air coolers and air conditioners; and,    -  even the underground Metro tunnel, Dr. Mukhopadhyay suggests.     "Even a flower vase, where the water may have remained  unchanged for about a week, is a more congenial breeding place  than the highly polluted Keshtopur canal", he says.    Migrant workers from areas like south Bihar and Sundergarh  in  Orissa are also believed to "act as carriers of the parasite,  though they themselves may be merely asymptomatic cases",  according to his studies.    Parts of Chhotanagpur have a startling annual parasitic  index  -- above 20 per thousand people, according to estimates reaching  the regional office of the Ministry's Health and Family Planning  Department at Patna.    The authorities have been offered a proposal to introduce  legal provisions to make it mandatory on the part of private  laboratories to enlist malaria cases without which the gravity  of the situation cannot be assessed, says Dr. B.K. Khastigir,  zonal officer, Presidency division, in the State's Health  Directorate.    "Anti-vector operations can only be carried out in select  sites, given the resource constraints. But without any  information on the occurance of the disease one does not know  where to start", he adds.</p>

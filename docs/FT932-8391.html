			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Observer: Initial search Not before time, the search for Barclays' new chief executive has finally spread to the US and Observer understands that Tom Johnson, 52, the former president of Manufacturers Hanover Corporation (now part of Chemical Bank), has indicated that he's pretty keen. Nothing official, of course. Head- hunters Spencer Stuart have yet to draw up a short list and Barclays is still several weeks from making any formal approaches. But Johnson has been sounded out informally to see whether he would be interested in the position. Given that Johnson has not had a high-profile job for nearly a year and a half now - apart from a two-week stint at troubled real estate developer Olympia &amp; York where he made an estimated Dollars 3m - it would be surprising if he didn't show a passing interest in being chief executive of an international bank which not so long ago regarded Citicorp as one of its few real rivals. Then again, Johnson has been mentioned as a possible head honcho of everything from the FDIC to the New York Fed. Meanwhile closer to home, rogue banking analyst Terry Smith has spotted that the UK's three most successful bankers all have the initials BP - Brian Pitman at Lloyds, Brian Pearse at Midland and Bruce Patullo at Bank of Scotland. Though none of these would accept the Barclays job, Smith's advice to Barclays is to recruit a banker with the same initials. The only candidate which springs to mind is Peter Burt, also of Bank of Scotland  - though it is unclear whether the initials work their banking magic when they are in reverse order.</p>

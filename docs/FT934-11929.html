			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Bock says he regrets 'illogical' attack by Rowland MR DIETER BOCK, the German financier who has been the victim of a strident attack from his joint Lonrho chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, yesterday declared that he had no intention of entering a war of words. He then promptly referred to his rival as 'my dear disjointed chief executive'. For good measure he added: 'I have to act like I'm running a company - not a kindergarten.' Explaining his reticence about commenting on Lonrho's elder statesman, in his first remarks since Mr Rowland's attack last weekend, he said: 'It would be damaging for the company. I regret what Tiny did and that's all I have to say'. He added: 'I was so surprised by Mr Rowland's attack. It was so illogical. I do not intend to comment and correct all the statements.' However he could not resist disclosing that when he saw Mr Rowland, who had accused him of contributing almost nothing to Lonrho, he said: 'My dear Tiny, you bought the most expensive fish ever sold at Harrods. I hope you are paying for it.' Mr Bock was referring to the shark in Harrods food hall, nicknamed 'Tiny', which the Fayed brothers have symbolically given to Mr Rowland after his decision last week to call off the long-standing legal dispute over their 1985 purchase of House of Fraser. Mr Bock, who bought 18.8 per cent of Lonrho at the beginning of the year, said he would not be deflected from his task of turning it into a more conventional company. On Wednesday night, he had dinner with the two new non-executives he nominated to the Lonrho board, Mr Peter Harper of Hanson, and Mr Stephen Walls of Albert Fisher. They made plain their determination to make Lonrho a more transparent company by establishing an audit committee to review the company's finances when the board meets next month and by joining the remuneration committee, to assess pay rates in the company. Mr Rowland is concerned that Mr Bock is preparing to dismiss the older directors, such as the joint deputy chairmen, Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert Dunlop, who are his staunch supporters. In an attempt to pacify Mr Rowland, Mr Bock said: 'I do not intend to proceed with a hammer. I want to try and calm the situation and see if everyone can act in a more reasonable way.'</p>

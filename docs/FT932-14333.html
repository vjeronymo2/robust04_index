			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Russia attacks UN vote against Serbia RUSSIA yesterday criticised the United Nations Security Council for showing undue haste in tightening sanctions against Serbia at the weekend. It also warned that western military intervention against the Serbs might risk provoking an all-out Balkan war, with grave consequences in Russia and elsewhere in Europe. Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign minister and President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, told a news conference in Moscow that the Security Council's decision on Saturday to bar all commerce with the rump Yugoslavia from April 26 had reduced the chances of achieving a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian conflict. 'We are concerned at certain military thinking and some diplomatic talk about strikes and blows in Bosnia,' he said in an oblique reference to proposals mooted in the US and by Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, that UN forces should step up the pressure on the Serbs by bombing their supply lines. 'The international community should decide: does it want a war in the Balkans or an international settlement?' he asked. But Mr Churkin combined his warnings against further punitive action by the UN with a fresh appeal to the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan without delay, and with an 'absolute minimum' of proposed changes. While he admitted that they had some legitimate concerns about the proposed map of Bosnia-Hercegovina, under which the country would be divided into 10 largely autonomous cantons, they could not expect to restart the negotiations from scratch. 'In the next few days you must reach a settlement or you will suffer a defeat that will be a tragedy for the Serbian people,' he said. The Russian government abstained in Saturday's vote, as did China. It had been hoping that a vote on the new sanctions resolution could be delayed until next week for fear of undermining President Boris Yeltsin's position in the April 25 constitutional referendum. In explaining the position, Mr Churkin trod what has come to be a customarily delicate line for Mr Yeltsin's government between appeasing conservative critics at home, who urge all-out Russian support for the Serbs, and seeking to calm fears in the west that Russia is on the verge of breaking ranks on the Yugoslav conflict. Asked by a hostile Serb questioner at yesterday's news conference why Russia had not vetoed the Security Council resolution, Mr Churkin replied bluntly: 'Russia has its own foreign policy priorities. It will not enter a confrontation with the international community just because agreement cannot be reached on a map of Bosnia-Hercegovina.' Foreign policy analysts in Moscow agree that western concerns about Russia's attitude to Bosnia are probably overdone. 'Almost nobody's interested in Serbia here, but the opposition is playing it up to make things difficult for the administration, and the administration has to bow to that,' said Mr Sergei Karaganov, deputy director of the Institute of Europe and a presidential adviser on foreign affairs.</p>

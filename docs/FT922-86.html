			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Algerian martyr in the making: The military will use yesterday's assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf to rally support for law and order THE seven days' mourning declared for Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, after he was assassinated yesterday in the eastern industrial town of Annaba, is an honour reserved for the head of state. However, such were the circumstances in which he came to head the Algerian government six months ago that his constitutional position was never properly clarified. This ambiguity in Mr Boudiaf's status should permit the military, who installed him, to close the gap left by his death while allowing them to exploit the traumatic incident as martyrdom for the nation's unity. Provided the military keep its cool, Mr Boudiaf's death could even be turned to advantage. The killing has already been laid at the feet of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which was denied certain election victory in January and has since been outlawed. By identifying the FIS with the killing, the authorities clearly hope to rally support for law and order and expose the true colours of the fundamentalists. At a broader level, Mr Boudiaf's killing can only delay stalled plans for making Algeria the Arab world's first multi-party democracy. These suffered a serious setback in January when the military stepped in to prevent the second round of voting. In the first round on December 26, the FIS had walked away with 47 per cent of the vote and looked set to form the next government upsetting 30 years' uninterrupted rule by the National Liberation Front (FLN). On the basis that the military had acted with the best of intentions and would not over-abuse human rights, the over-turning of the elections received tacit backing from Algeria's main partners among the industrial nations. The main concern of the west was security of oil and gas supplies coupled with stability payments on Dollars 25bn (Pounds 13.50bn) of foreign debt. Once again this is likely to be the principal worry of the European Community and the US. However, the military have indicated that security of oil and gas supplies is an absolute priority, while Algeria has acquired a breathing space in its debt service by the recent approval of a Dollars 1.5bn refinancing package. The 73-year-old Mr Boudiaf was one of the last surviving historic leaders of the FLN which fought for independence against France. In the aftermath in 1962 he fell out with the leadership and took up exile in Morocco where he spent most of the following 28 years until he returned to Alergia on January 16. It is still unclear the extent to which he had already agreed to return as a political figurehead before the military forced President Chadli Bendjedid to step down on January 11 because they feared he was too weak to deal with the FIS. Mr Boudiaf had always been hostile to the military. He agreed to head a five-man High State Council only on condition that he had some control over policy and soon after he arrived he started lecturing the government about austerity (he even suggested senior officials try public transport to see how ordinary Algerians felt). The Council was an attempt to camouflage the coup in constitutional clothing by persuading a respected group of five with moderate links to the mosque or impeccable nationalist credentials to act as 'wise men'. In this way the authorities sought to offer a competing 'nationalist' platform to counter the appeal of the FIS. Mr Boudiaf was said to be anxious to use his powers as de facto head of government to grant amnesty to a number of FIS members. (Some 5,000 to 6,000 FIS supporters have allegedly been detained since the crackdown on the movement in January). Such an amnesty is unlikely now and the trial of the two main FIS leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj, postponed over the weekend until July 12, again raises the issue of the death penalty. Today, Gen Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister, holds the strings of power and his record is of a person who favours tough repressive measures against the FIS. The military might feel it has a freer hand, no longer restrained by an ageing man who had little sympathy for its profession. However, the authorities need to proceed with caution to avoid a cycle of repression that breeds support for the FIS. The FIS possesses several faces. The majority of those who supported the movement in the elections were not endorsing a fundamentalist view of Algeria with the strict imposition of sharia law. Rather they were the urban unemployed - especially the young - and those in the professional classes who had missed out on the benefits of FLN corruption. The most worrying question is whether Mr Boudiaf's death is an isolated act or the start of a concerted campaign by the armed undergound to overthrow the government. Since January the military leaders have recognised that they have limited time in which to restore stability and get the economy going to lessen social grievances. The Boudiaf killing may have given more time but it has underlined what is at stake if they fail - the survival of Algeria as a state marrying a moderate version of Islam with the needs of a modern state closely tied to Europe.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               ALGERIA SINCE INDEPENDENCE FROM FRANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1962 July 5:   Proclamation of independence.

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace Talks about building jumbo jets to seat 600 may be a pleasant distraction from British Aerospace's current problems, but it will be a long time before the market really cares. Investor attention is focused on whether the new management has the beef to cut costs and resolve the uncertainties surrounding the company. Indeed, the collapse of earnings in 1992 and questions over the size of any dividend payment, left very little else to hang on to. Some progress is clearly being made. The European fighter aircraft will be built, albeit late. And BAe's share of the work may rise if other partners reduce their commitments. Negotiations with Taiwan on regional jets continue and seem likely to produce a positive result soon. If the deal is signed it may not bring in as much cash as hoped, but it will at least prove that the management can put out a bad fire. Overall, BAe's problem is high costs, not low revenues, so the broad cost-reduction programme should bear fruit. The biggest remaining question mark is over the Al Yamamah deal with Saudi Arabia, but that is largely outside the company's control. Airbus production may also slow, while smaller headaches like turboprop aircraft and property remain to be tackled. Yet with some faith that the management has plugged the hole, investors can begin to look towards earnings in 1993 of some Pounds 150m. Not much on Pounds 10bn of turnover, but the recovery story is beginning to emerge.</p>

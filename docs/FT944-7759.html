			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hydraulics side lifts Sterling Boosted by 'strong growth' in the hydraulics division, pre-tax profits at Sterling Industries, the engineering group, leaped from Pounds 1.69m to Pounds 3.37m in the six months to September 30. Cayzer Trust Company and Caledonia Investments own 48.8 per cent and 21.1 per cent holdings respectively in the group, while Sterling has a cross-holding of 9.7 per cent in Caledonia. Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said the hydraulics side had experienced 'good growth in sales', which had led to imp-roved margins. The group had been developing a new range of valves - solenoid, in particular - and some of the increase was attributable to new products coming on stream. The thermal process division, accounting for about two-thirds of group sales, also lifted profits substantially, though while the increase in the US was good news, the difficult trading in Germany and the UK was bad. However, Far Eastern contracts, derived from the Australian operation and achieved through 'effective marketing of our fibreglass know-how', gave a boost to the division's figures. Group turnover grew sharply to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 18.3m) and operating profits swelled to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 422,000). Investment income, including dividends from Caledonia, and minus interest payable was Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 1.01m). Earnings rose to 8.81p (4.62p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.5p (1.8p), though some 0.4p of the rise is to establish a better balance between the interim and final pay-outs.</p>

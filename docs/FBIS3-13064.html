Two of its close neighbors Iran  and China have advised Islamabad to seek a dialogue with New  Delhi to solve the issue which they have said is a bilateral  matter.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent recording]  Iranian and Chinese backing of India's position on Kashmir came  during the visit of [Indian] External Affairs Minister [Dinest  Singh] to Teheran. The Iranian president, 'Ali Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, told Mr. Dinesh Singh that Teheran wants  that Pakistan should hold direct talks with India to solve the  Kashmir issue. The Indian minister also held talks with his  Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati and apprised him of the  latest situation in the Kashmir valley. Mr. Velayati felt that  there was much scope for cooperation between India, China, and  Iran on a regional basis. Later, the Indian minister also held  talks with his Chinese counterpart, Mr. Qian Qichen, who was in  Teheran on Sunday [March 6]. Mr. Qichen described Pakistan's  tabling of the Kashmir issue at the UN Human Rights Commission  in Geneva as being out of context. He said Beijing favors a  solution of the Kashmir issue within the framework of the Simla  accord. The Indian foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, at the  end of the Teheran visit said that both China and Iran agreed  with India that human rights should not be used by nations as a  political tool.    [Srinivasan] This was to have a successful joint commission  meeting but it so happened that it was coincident with the  ongoing round at Geneva and also coincidental to the Chinese  foreign minister's visit to Teheran. It gave us an opportunity  to present our point of view at foreign minister's level and I  think that our point of view has been well received in both  capitals, or rather in Teheran and by the Chinese foreign  minister's delegation.

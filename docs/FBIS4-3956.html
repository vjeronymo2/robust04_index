			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- A Taiwan delegation,  headed by Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of  Foreign Trade (BOFT), left for Tokyo Tuesday [26 April] to meet  with Japanese officials on a number of trade issues.    Huang said prior to his departure that the main purpose of  his visit is to push Japan to take effective measures to narrow  the widening trade gap between the two countries and to seek  Japan's support for Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Taiwan has long incurred huge trade deficits with Japan. The  amount reached U.S.$14.42 billion in 1993 and may hit U.S.$16  billion this year. "We hope Japan can address the trade  imbalance problem before it develops into a political issue,"  Huang noted.    Huang will also hold informal tariff reduction talks with  Japanese officials under the GATT framework. Although Japan has  not yet sent Taiwan a "tariff reduction" list, Huang said the  BOFT has prepared a package of measures to cope with possible  Japanese requests.    "To win Japan's support for our GATT bid, we plan to open  our  market to Japanese cigarettes and alcohol before our GATT  entry," Huang said.    Taiwan also plans to remove "area and quota" restrictions on  16 kinds of fruit imports, including apples, in line with the  GATT requirements, Huang said. "The liberalization would allow  such Japanese fruits as apples and pears to enter our market,"  he explained.    At present, Taiwan only allows free imports of apples from  the United States and Canada.    Huang said Japan is most concerned about Taiwan's ban on  imports of Japanese compact cars. Taiwan currently allows free  imports of American and European compact cars. In line with  GATT regulations, Taiwan must open its market to Japanese  compact cars. In consideration of Taiwan's huge trade deficit  with Japan, Huang said he will ask Japan to voluntarily restrict  its auto exports to Taiwan. "Such a measure would also help  minimize the impact on the local auto industry," he added.    Huang is scheduled to return to Taipei Friday.</p>

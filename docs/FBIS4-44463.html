			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhi (3769 2535): "Reform of the Exchange </F> Rate System Moves into High Gear"]    [Text] Starting on 1 April, taking as a symbol of the  forward operation of the nationwide unified interbank foreign  exchange market and comprehensive implementation of a bank  foreign exchange conversion and foreign exchange selling system,  China's foreign exchange management system reform will push  forward on the basis of the three month transition period of  earlier this year. This series of undertakings has already  attracted broad attention from media circles at home and abroad.  On 30 March, the State Foreign Current Management Office, Policy  Regulations Department Department Chief Yang Gonglin agreed to  an interview by this reporter. Department Chief Yang provided a  detailed and authoritative elaboration of matters of concern to  readers.  <H5>  The transition period of reform is going smoothly, the RMB </H5> exchange rate is basically stable    Since the start of reform of the foreign exchange system,  the  originally specified program called for a transition period of  January to March, the reason being that the pace of reform was  quite substantial, which contained much substance, and some  measures had to be implemented in succession up to April 1.  Looking at the situation at present, during these three months,  China's foreign exchange management system reform has seen the  transition from the old to the new system.    First, a smooth change has been brought about from dual  exchange rates to a single exchange rate, and the basic  stability of the exchange rate has been maintained.    Second, the turnover of foreign exchange to higher  authorities and the retention of a portion of foreign exchange  have been eliminated, and a bank foreign exchange conversion  system has been implemented, increasing the amounts of foreign  exchange on hand. Foreign currency on hand at the end of last  year was $21.1 billion, which at present it has reached more  than $27 billion. It should be stressed that this is mainly due  not to an increase in export generated foreign exchange, but  reflects changes in foreign exchange allocation mechanisms.  Following the elimination of the turning over of foreign  exchange to higher authorities and the retaining of foreign  currency, enterprises were happy to go to the bank for foreign  exchange conversion, and have also taken foreign currency  retained abroad and returned it for conversion. In addition, in  the non-trade area, after the issuing of foreign exchange  certificates (FEC) ceased, there was direct formation of foreign  exchange income, and there was some foreign exchange income  earned last year year has been recalled for conversion this  year. Due to these factors, the overall increase in foreign  exchange income can be explained by the smooth progress of this  reform. But we also cannot be blindly optimistic, there is also  a need to increase export generated foreign exchange. During the  transition period, the People's Bank has adopted a number of  measures to ensure that enterprises that are importing can use  foreign currency.    Third, after the issuing of FECs ceased, the reclaiming of  FECs has gone smoothly, and up to the end of February, close to  1 billion yuan worth of FEC had been reclaimed, though several  hundreds of millions remain in circulation.    Fourth, the interbank foreign exchange market has been  prepared, and already, in the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai,  Tianjin, Hangzhou and Shenzhen a linked network has been  achieved, and starting from 1 March, foreign exchange  transactions are being conducted transregionally, while the test  running results have been very good. After 1 April, other cities  will be linked one by one to the network including Guangzhou,  Xiamen, Chengdu, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Qingdao, and there will be  a progressive expansion of the area of coverage.    Here I must stress that in some locales people are saying  that the network has encountered difficulties, and that the  operation of interbank foreign exchange market will be  postponed, hence deducing of exchange rates cannot be  stabilized. This rumor is completely unfounded, and the  stability of exchange rates is primarily determined by the  supply and demand relationship of foreign currencies, and bears  no direct relationship whatever to the network.    At the same time, within the transition period, the relevant  concrete implementation plans were drafted, in order to  gradually place the reform program implementation on an  institutional basis. Each bank, in order to enter the unified  market, also is properly handling the mental and technological  operational preparation.    The reasons for those achievements that have been attained  within the transition period include: one, this instance of  reform is a steady deepening of the previous several instances  of foreign exchange system reform; second, the policy measures  are reliable, and retain the foreign exchange swap centers for  supply of foreign currencies, while the central bank makes up  the difference to ensure that there is not advantage in the  foreign exchange; third, the transparency level is high, and has  been understood and supported by all. In the process of reform,  maintaining stable exchange rates is a very important condition.  Modern exchange rates are a product of the market, and are  produced on the basis of a weighted average price of the foreign  exchange bought and sold throughout the country in the 18  foreign exchange swap centers, and basically reflects market  supply and demand relations. At the same time, due to the  practice of the foreign exchange conversion system, and  increases in the state's foreign exchange surplus, the ability  of the state to intervene in the market also increases.  <H5>  A Unified Foreign Exchange Market Begins To Operate, the </H5> Price Formation Mechanism is Becoming More Perfected    Starting on 1 April, operation of a national unified  interbank foreign exchange market began, in contrast to the  situation in the past where scattered enterprises used a  nonstandard market to conduct foreign exchange transactions  through swap centers. The past foreign exchange swap centers,  even though it historically had a major effect, in the end it  was decentralized, and nonstandard. Under the premise that banks  convert foreign currency and sell foreign currency as a service  to enterprises, the banks per se will engender the problem of  regulation of foreign currency funds. Hence banks must mutually  buy and sell foreign currencies, and at the same time,  objectively they can demand that the central bank handle  intervention in the foreign exchange market.    The foreign exchange center established in Shanghai is a  leap  into the foreign exchange market. The market will take  headquarters of all banks involving domestic foreign exchange  work as its principle focus. At the same time will allow  foreign capital banks to apply for admission. Considering the  conditions of China's current stage of development and the  stipulations in the foreign exchange system reform plan that  ensure no change in foreign-funded enterprise, foreign exchange  management, swap centers will still be retained, this will  primarily be of service to foreign currency regulation among  foreign-funded enterprises, and assist them in maintaining  balance. However, the prices of swap centers will be consistent  with the prices of the unified market, this is an issue which is  being put into effect.    After the formation of a unified market, rational operation  of foreign currency funds will be promoted, and different  foreign currency prices engendered by foreign currency supply  and demand imbalances between regions will be resolved, further  perfecting the price formation mechanism, and this will be  beneficial to stabilizing exchange rates. From now on the  interbank foreign exchange market transaction first day closing  price will be taken as the primary basis for the central bank  published second day RMB to US dollar middle rate.    Looking at the current supply and demand situation, foreign  currency supply will be ensured, while foreign currency demand  will also not suddenly increase. Therefore, foreign exchange  prices will remain stable at the current levels.  <H5>  Comprehensive Implementation of Currency Conversion Currency </H5> Purchasing, Foreign Exchange Quotas Will Not Be Abolished    Starting on 1 April, there will be a comprehensive  implementation of a bank currency conversion, and currency  purchasing system. However, there will also need to be an  adjustment period, as the past operation sequence of enterprise  foreign currency employment has already been completely replaced  by the new system, and for this reason it is necessary to as  rapidly as possible become familiar with the new sequence.    The enterprise foreign exchange employment examination and  approval system has basically already been abolished, and  enterprise foreign exchange employment has become much more  convenient. At the same time even more pressure is being placed  on enterprises, and it is necessary to protect against exchange  rate risks, while the basic stability of the RMB exchange rate  depends on the concern and safeguarding of enterprises and  various circles of the society. Enterprises, in the process of  engaging in international trade, must pay attention to  forecasting trends in various currencies, and choose a suitable  currency for settling accounts, while mastering the use of  financial methods for avoiding and reducing exchange rate risks.    At present in the society there are rumors that indicate the  foreign exchange quota on 1 April must be abolished or people  will be forced to sell. This is completely without foundation.  In the past the foreign exchange quotas that enterprises had  still can be used by at the enterprises' own initiative, and  there is no issue that became invalid on 1 April. In addition  there will be no coercion to sell, therefore enterprises can be  completely at ease, and there is no need to believe all that one  hears.</p>

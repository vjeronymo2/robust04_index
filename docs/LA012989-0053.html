			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING CHANGE: FOR MONEY, GUNS, GOVERNORS, AND GROWTH POLICY;  </P> <P> OUT OF THE BOONDOCKS INTO MANSIONS OF POWER  </P> <P> When the nation's governors gather in Washington next month for their annual  winter meetings, they will be in an unaccustomed spotlight.  </P> <P> The reason is 1990 reapportionment -- the decennial Super Bowl of American  legislative politics. Following each census, state legislatures (subject to  gubernatorial veto) draw the congressional and legislative districts that  govern elections for the next 10 years. Their map-making, which establishes the  partisan balance of each district, is as influential as any single factor in  determining how many seats each party holds. Democratic control of state  legislatures -- and thus reapportionment -- is the foundation of their enduring  majority in the House of Representatives. When one party controls both the  statehouse and the governorship, their freedom to gerrymander favorable  districts can realign state politics overnight: Democratic dominance of the  map-making process in California expanded the party's margin in the  congressional delegation from one to 11 seats after the last reapportionment.  </P> <P> The opportunity for creative cartography is greatest in states where  reapportionment will change the congressional delegation's size; and almost all  of the states either gaining (including California, Texas and Florida) or  losing seats (most prominently New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois) will elect  governors next year. Virginia, which is expected to gain a seat, and New  Jersey, whose numbers will probably not change, are electing governors this  fall.  </P> <P> For the GOP in particular, the 36 gubernatorial races next year are crucial,  because the party brings so few other cards to the reapportionment table.  Without substantial gains, the Republicans face another Democratic-dominated  reapportionment that will lock-in the Democrats' House majority through the end  of the century. That's because the GOP's White House dominance hasn't trickled  down into statehouse gains: The GOP holds fewer state legislative chambers  today than in 1979, and less than one-third overall. Republicans must elect  governors to offset these Democratic advantages. "We are going to get a lot  more attention than ever before because of reapportionment," says Michele M.  Davis, executive director of the Republi  </P> <P> can Governors Assn. "We are going to get some heavy resources from the national  (Republican) committee."  </P> <P> This attention is somewhat new for the governors, whose travails in the  boondocks have rarely moved Washington. With the exception of a few large-state  governors, and the occasional rogue with a calling for larceny, state chief  executives have typically served out their careers with as much fanfare as bank  tellers. Nonetheless, powerful governors -- from Edmund G. (Pat) Brown in  California to Nelson A. Rockefeller in New York -- transformed their states.  It's a rewarding, comfortable job. Most get a state-maintained mansion, a  police escort wherever they go and power to appoint hundreds of supporters to  well-paying jobs -- instead of dozens senators and congressmen can satisfy.  Senators can debate policy; governors make it. What they haven't been able to  do -- until recently -- is influence national issues, even those that directly  affect states.  </P> <P> But governors have quietly grown up to a major role in the development of  domestic policy. When Lyndon B. Johnson launched the War on Poverty 25 years  ago, the underlying assumption was that Washington needed to fill the gap left  by inert state governments. Now the reverse is true. With the federal budget  deficit paralyzing Washington, governors in both parties have been forced to  develop programs for coping with persistent domestic problems. Their ideas now  bubble up to influence Congress. The movements to reform the nation's  educational and welfare systems grew as much out of state initiatives as  Capitol epiphanies. "It's a complete flip-flop of the imbalance that prevailed  in the 1960s when nothing was happening at the state level," said former  Arizona Gov. Bruce E. Babbitt.  </P> <P> What have the states wrought? A politics of striking moderation -- an almost  nonpartisan agenda that enlists the business Establishment behind traditional  social programs such as education and assistance to young children by  repackaging them as investments in economic growth. From Republicans such as  Thomas H. Kean in New Jersey to Democrats like Arkansas' Bill Clinton,  governors are now building their administrations on bland but sturdy bipartisan  pillars: public-private partnerships to cope with social needs, increased  funding for education and training, leveraging of limited public funds in other  areas. This isn't the kind of politics that sends pulses racing -- ask Michael  S. Dukakis -- but at the state level, at least, it is effective at producing  policy and reelecting office-holders.  </P> <P> The new approach has most dramatically affected Southern and Southwestern  states where governors were previously judged by their success at narcotizing  government. Across the Sun Belt, governors devoted themselves to promoting a  "good business climate" -- a near mystical condition of corporate rapture that  translates into few government services and low taxes. That worked when the Sun  Belt's economy was built on brute low-wage manufacturing -- in the South -- and  bountiful natural-resource industries -- in the Southwest and Rocky Mountains.  </P> <P> But as foreign competition hammered the manufacturing base, and falling energy  prices undermined the oil states' passive prosperity, innovative governors in  these traditionally conservative states have redefined the good business  climate. Even tightfisted business leaders now grudgingly accept the need for  government to provide the infrastructure for economic growth: strong early  educational facilities, research universities, roads, airports, ports.  </P> <P> Stretching this new consensus to its limits, several governors in recent years  have been willing to do what Washington hasn't: raise taxes to maintain  services. Governors in states ranging from Michigan to Utah have won reelection  despite major tax increases. In this budget year alone, four states raised  income taxes, and another seven hiked sales taxes. In his reelection bid next  year, Florida's Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, hurt badly by an early sales tax  hike, will provide 1990's tightest test of that connection.  </P> <P> The two most prominent exceptions to this trend toward more activist state  government are the states that will probably be most fiercely contested next  year: Texas and California. (Texas is expected to gain four congressional seats  in 1990, second only to California, where the delegation will swell by at least  five and maybe six seats.) Though retiring Texas Republican Gov. William P.  Clements Jr. accepted a substantial tax hike to cover budget shortfalls, he  hasn't launched aggressive programs to diversify the state's economy. In  California, retiring Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's Reaganite resistance  to government expansion has intensified the gridlock over mounting  transportation, environmental and social needs: He has played the role of a  traffic light stuck on red.  </P> <P> These open-seat 1990 races may pivot on whether voters believe the next  governor should expand his vocabulary beyond "no" -- even at the risk of  raising some taxes. In Texas, the debate is likely to center on education, and  some GOP strategists worry that Clements has left the party in a weak position.  In California -- where anxiety about the quality of life is matched by  skepticism about tax hikes -- the two parties are likely to fence over the  state's role in funding not only education, but also transportation and  environmental protection.  </P> <P> Those kinds of personalized local concerns, not the polarizing ideological  themes that dominate federal races, determine gubernatorial elections. On the  surface, governor races may look like Senate and presidential races, with the  same consultants hatching the same expensive -- and negative -- media campaigns  that force candidates to spend ever more time dialing donors for dollars.  </P> <P> But governor races have remained independent from larger trends in more  fundamental ways. Despite George Bush's victory in the presidential campaign,  the Democrats actually gained one governorship in 1988; two years earlier, when  the Democrats gained eight Senate seats, they lost as many governorships.  Because of the governors' influence over reapportionment, no races will be more  important to the national parties in 1990. But no races will be less  susceptible to their influence.  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Into the air with a hold full of hopes: Martin Dickson on the outlook for the US aircraft maker McDonnell Douglas as it tries to recover from a succession of blows Three sleek new airliners, their fresh paint glinting in the spring Californian sunshine, sit on the 'flight ramp' - the very end of the production line at McDonnell Douglas's Long Beach plant - surrounded by a clutter of equipment as workers prepare the jets for final delivery. They are among the first dozen production models of a wide-bodied, three-engined jet - the MD-11 - to roll off the commercial aircraft line. To McDonnell Douglas, these jets, and 34 other MD-11s due for delivery this year, represent much more than routine aircraft sales. To the management at Long Beach, where McDonnell makes its civilian aircraft, they provide hope that the chronic problems that have plagued the plant for years are being solved. And at the group's headquarters in St Louis, Missouri, the sales are a kind of financial poetry in motion: each departing Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.8m) jet brings in huge amounts of cash flow which the company believes will extricate it from a tight corner by the end of this year. For McDonnell Douglas, the largest defence contractor in the US and one of the western world's three leading civilian aircraft manufacturers, has a stretched balance sheet. In 1990 much more cash - some Dollars 400m - flowed out of the business than came in. Ironically, just when the company has been basking in the success of its weapons systems in the Gulf war, a succession of blows has left some Pentagon officials and industry observers questioning whether it could even become a contender for bankruptcy or a government bail-out. Mr John McDonnell, the company's bearded, 53-year-old chairman and the son of its founder, says the Cassandras are just plain wrong. 'We've taken a lot of strong measures to improve cash flow and they are taking effect,' he says. 'By the end of this year our cash flow will be getting quite positive and our debt will be going down, and it will be obvious to everyone that we're getting in a much stronger financial situation.' But in 1990 the company reported net earnings of only Dollars 306m on revenues of Dollars 16bn, while at year-end its debts, excluding its financing arm, totalled Dollars 3bn, or 95 per cent of its equity. Nor is the quality of its earnings very impressive: some Dollars 376m of 1990 profits came from a one-time pensions settlement, while the company is in dispute with the government over military contracts which could eventually mean writing off hundreds of millions of dollars. The most serious dispute stems from January's decision by Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, to cancel development of the A-12 attack aircraft, a potential Dollars 50bn programme being jointly developed by McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics. The two contractors, having already taken large write-offs on the A-12, are now locked in litigation over Dollars 1.3bn of progress payments which the Pentagon wants back. Even if McDonnell's finances are now improving, with a reported profit of Dollars 58m for the three months to March 31 this year, against only Dollars 2m for a year earlier, it faces a difficult long-term juggling act: its combat aircraft business, which for years has made up for the weak financial performance of the commercial side, is shrinking inexorably as the US cuts its defence budget. The Gulf war is unlikely to bring in much fresh business - apart from a replenishment of the Tomahawk cruise missiles. And while McDonnell remains the leading US manufacturer of combat aircraft, several models - the F-15 Eagle, the Harrier II AV-8B and the Apache helicopter - are nearing the end of their Pentagon production programmes. An announcement is expected today on the air force's choice to succeed the F-15. The contenders are a Northrop-McDonnell partnership and one comprising Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics. Worth Dollars 64.6bn, according to the Pentagon, the contract for the advanced tactical fighter, the ATF, is vital to McDonnell Douglas. This month it lost out to a rival Boeing-Sikorsky consortium for the US army's new light attack helicopter contract. Whichever way the ATF contest is decided, it is clear that McDonnell's future is becoming more dependent on Long Beach and its ability to develop profitably new generations of civilian aircraft in competition against the larger, more efficient Boeing and European Airbus Industrie. Long Beach, in common with rival manufacturers, has a strong order-book  - particularly for wide-bodied jets - though in recent months the industry has become nervous because of deferrals and cancellations by airline customers. But the plant has been an Achilles heel since the Californian Douglas company merged with McDonnell in 1967, losing money for much of the past 15 years. Its profits record might be blamed in part on the competitive pressures of the aerospace industry, but insiders suggest it results substantially from years of poor productivity and lack of discipline. The plant's management did not have a sufficient grasp on real production costs, while suppliers complained about bureaucracy and inefficiency in the purchasing system. All these problems were exacerbated in the mid-1980s as Long Beach tried to cope not only with making the aircraft it already had in production - the MD-80 twin-engine jet and the now discontinued DC-10 wide-bodied aircraft - but also with a rush of new developments: there was the MD-11, the successor to the DC-10; the MD-90, a follow-on from the MD-80; the C-17, a new generation of military transport aircraft specially designed for use on short runways; and the T45, a naval training aircraft. Despite these new ventures, McDonnell Douglas's family of commercial aircraft is less comprehensive than that of Boeing and the developing Airbus fleet. Unlike its two principal competitors, it has no presence in the middle range of the market, but is concentrated at the lower end, with the MD-80, and at the top with the MD-11. McDonnell and Airbus missed a chance to challenge Boeing two years ago by failing to agree to co-operate on new aircraft production. Now McDonnell is understood to be actively looking for an equity partner to buy a minority stake in the commercial jet side of the business. Meanwhile, as the company struggled to meet its commercial aircraft commitments and programmes, staff levels were rising. At Long Beach, the workforce went from just 12,000 in 1982 to 52,000 in 1989. As it did the experience level of the average worker dropped from 10 years to two. Problems multiplied and the plant's development schedule lagged. At this point Mr McDonnell, who became chairman in early 1988, decided that the entire group needed a radical overhaul of its management systems. A new executive team, drawn from across the company, was despatched to Long Beach last year, headed by Mr Bob Hood. The new management approach aims to improve productivity and customer satisfaction by stripping away bureaucracy, pushing greater powers of decision-making down the line, and creating greater motivation and inter-departmental co-operation through the formation of teams. Called Total Quality Management System (TQMS), and inspired by the Japanese, it has been adopted by several other leading US manufacturers. 'We started from ground zero,' recalls Mr Hood. Departments were reshaped into teams working on individual products, drawing together people from different disciplines. Management layers were cut from nine to five and the new leaders were selected with an emphasis on what Mr Hood calls their ability to 'coach and listen' rather than 'old-style dictatorial management'. Over the longer term, the changes may well prove to be the salvation of Long Beach. In the short term, they produced more confusion, demoralisation and delays. TQMS was introduced gradually and quite successfully at McDonnell's St Louis division, but was imposed virtually overnight at Long Beach. Matters became so bad that Colonel Kenneth Tollefson, the air force representative overseeing the C-17 programme, wrote an article in the staff newspaper accusing management of lack of leadership. Morale at the plant still seems shaky, and union relations delicate, but over the past year progress on the MD-80 and MD-11 lines does suggest that the shake-up is starting to produce better results. For example, productivity on the MD-80 improved by more than 30 per cent in 1990 and is still getting better. For the first time in its history that aircraft has enjoyed two consecutive money-making quarters, with a third coming up. All this has not saved the MD-11 from some recent embarrassing criticism from Mr Robert Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines, who was unhappy with the first aircraft delivered to his company. Mr Crandall's complaints seem to involve some easily fixable and relatively minor glitches, and American says the problems do not alter its enthusiasm for the MD-11. A far larger Long Beach dispute, which could have a significant impact on the group's profits and balance sheet, concerns the C-17, which is behind schedule and looks likely to come in over the Dollars 6.6bn fixed-price contract McDonnell Douglas accepted from the air force. The air force, claiming that McDonnell is Dollars 500m above the ceiling, withheld progress payments late last year and Pentagon officials were recently quoted as saying that the project might now be Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m over budget. McDonnell, however, reckons the aircraft will come in only Dollars 100m above the ceiling. Mr Herb Lanese, the company's senior vice-president, finance, says the two sides are working on new figures and insists that 'the performance indicators at this time are a lot closer to our numbers than to the air force's'. The Pentagon's withholding of Dollars 900m last year for work on the C-17 and the cancelled A-12 has contributed significantly to McDonnell's cash squeeze, as has the tightness of the capital markets, restricting cheap access to funds for a company with a low investment-grade credit rating. But the main factor has been the Dollars 3bn cost of developing the MD-11 - roughly the same as the group's entire equity base. However, Mr Lanese says the financial picture is on the point of improving substantially and that March probably saw the peak of the company's borrowing needs. At the end of the first quarter McDonnell's debt totalled about Dollars 3.3bn, with some Dollars 370m of cash on hand, against net equity of Dollars 3.5bn. With loan covenants setting a ceiling of just over Dollars 4bn on total borrowings, the company still has a sizeable ability to raise funds. The improving cash position is due in part to MD-11 sales but also to a company-wide savings drive: working capital is being slashed, the dividend has been reduced and capital spending curtailed. The MD-11 production schedule has also been cut - by five aircraft this year, from 42 to 37, helping save on parts and labour costs. All this does suggest that the direst predictions are overdone. That said, McDonnell's room for manoeuvre will remain tight for the rest of this year, and there are several wild cards - a Dollars 500m tax claim, the C-17 and labour issues - which could yet cause it severe headaches. Next year cash flow is likely to turn positive, but the heat will still be on McDonnell's management: to improve Long Beach productivity; to find funds to develop the next wide-bodied jet - a stretched version of the MD-11 called the MD-12X which will compete with the Boeing 747-400; and to handle the tricky transfer of resources from fighter to commercial aircraft.</p>

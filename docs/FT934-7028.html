			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Observer: Gone fishing So now we know what Sir Derek Alun-Jones, the deposed boss of troubled Ferranti, did with part of his near Pounds 500,000 golden handshake. The Independent on Sunday reports that he spent Pounds 22,000 on acquiring Ferranti's share of the fishing rights on a stretch of the river Test in Hampshire. The rights had been bought when Alun-Jones was running Ferranti and it could afford to entertain wealthy overseas clients in style. He seems to have struck a good deal paying roughly half what Ferranti paid for the stake. However, his former employer denies any special favours and says that the decline in price was due to a combination of the recession, a drought and the fact that the other owners had the right of veto over any purchaser.</p>

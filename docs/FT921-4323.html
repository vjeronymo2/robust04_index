			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Credit demand by consumers falls further WARY consumers paid back more than they borrowed in January, for the sixth consecutive month as a recovery in spending continued to elude the economy. Demand for credit shrank in the three months to January when consumers made a net repayment of Pounds 293m. This compared with a net repayment of Pounds 212m in the three months to October. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that new credit advanced to consumers fell from a seasonally adjusted Pounds 4.1bn in December to Pounds 3.9bn in January. In January, the latest month for which a figure is available, consumers made a net repayment of Pounds 62m of credit from finance houses, building societies, and bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system. This followed a net repayment of Pounds 197m in December, the highest figure since December 1976. The last increase in outstanding credit was in July last year, when consumers added Pounds 165m to their debts. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said the latest net repayment of consumer credit highlighted 'the extent to which consumer spending and thus economic recovery is being inhibited by the combination of the large debt burden that was accumulated during the late 1980s and continued high real interest rates'. In the three months to January new credit advanced to consumers totalled Pounds 11.7bn, marginally lower than in the three months to October when it totalled Pounds 11.8bn. The figures for credit-card debt were slightly more buoyant. The amount of debt outstanding increased by Pounds 23m compared with a net repayment of Pounds 33m in December. In the three months to January the amount of debt outstanding on credit cards grew by Pounds 34m compared with a net repayment of Pounds 2m in the previous three months.</p>

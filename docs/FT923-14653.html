			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Italian groups float idea of sell-offs - Haig Simonian looks at Eni's decision to sell shares in subsidiaries ITALY'S big state holding groups, strapped for cash owing to tighter government funding and heavy investment needs, are devoting more thought than ever to privatisation as a way of raising money. Eni, the public-sector energy and chemicals group, has already declared plans to sell off initial tranches of Agip and Snam, its big oil and natural gas subsidiaries, before the end of this year. In time, the stakes sold could exceed the 50 per cent barrier which has so far limited every big Italian public-sector company's contact with the stock market. The income provided could be vital in meeting the voracious financial appetites of both Eni and IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company. For Eni, exploiting the Karachaganak oilfield in Kazakhstan, for which Agip won joint rights with British Gas last week, will involve a forecast investment for the two partners of Dollars 6bn over the next decade alone. In the past two years, opportunities for self-financing have been constrained by tougher conditions in many markets, which have curbed profits. In the case of the Eni group, Agip and Snam remain highly profitable, with net earnings of L1,101bn (Dollars 959m) and L635bn last year. However, its EniChem chemicals subsidiary reported a 1991 loss of L742bn after minority interests, up almost ninefold from the previous year. Meanwhile, raising further debt has become less attractive on account of the state groups' already very high borrowing levels and vertiginous financing costs. With direct funding from the government ever tighter, the stock market has appeared increasingly alluring. However, privatisation remains highly contentious for a number of reasons. Many politicians are still reluctant to part company with assets which have, over the years, provided a source of jobs and patronage for the country's leading parties. The issue of control has also been crucial at corporate level, with managers fearful of losing control over parts of their groups. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman, says he is confident that listing Agip and Snam will not endanger either Eni's ultimate control of its subsidiaries, nor put them at risk of takeover, even after the majority of the capital is quoted. Agip's size means its capitalisation would be very high, making a potential takeover exceedingly expensive, he says. Moreover, the likely diffusion of its shares among thousands of investors means Eni, which would probably retain around 40 per cent of the equity, would be by far the biggest single shareholder. Ultimate control could also be ensured by using a 'golden share' as is the case in the UK, he argues. Mr Cagliari admits that plans to quote Agip and Snam, which had sales of L10,957bn and L11,479bn respectively last year, have been partly overshadowed by conflicting priorities with the government over whether Eni itself or the subsidiaries should be floated. A final decision will be taken at cabinet level, and could trigger a heated political battle between members of the governing coalition. Last month, preliminary measures were approved for the transformation of Eni into a joint stock company as a first step towards a possible part-privatisation. One compromise would be to privatise both Eni and some of its subsidiaries, a structure that will be seen later this year when IRI's Finmeccanica engineering holding company is floated. While Mr Cagliari agrees the model of quoting both a holding company and its subsidiaries is unattractive to Anglo-Saxon investors, he argues that it is more acceptable in continental Europe. Floating Eni would be much more time-consuming than listing Agip and Snam, particularly as regards information requirements for foreign stock markets, he warns. While an Eni flotation was perfectly possible, it would require 'much more work'.</p>

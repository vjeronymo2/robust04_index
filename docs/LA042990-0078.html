			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> ** "FREEDOM" NEIL YOUNG WARNER REPRISE VIDEO VIDEOCASSETTE ($19.98): A PERIODIC  SURVEY OF POP-RELATED LASER DISCS, BOOKS AND VIDEOCASSETTES. RATED ON A SCALE  OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC.)  </P> <P> Young may not sing for Miller or for Bud, but he apparently doesn't have any  reservations about lending his music and name to lazy-concept videos. Instead  of an original or even definitive showcase of the music from last year's highly  acclaimed "Freedom" album, this modest 30-minute package features  straightforward footage of Young performing seven songs, ranging from his old  "Ohio" to the recent album's "Too Far Gone." Some of the acoustic performances  are gripping, but there's generally far too low a yield to make this a  satisfying work. ROBERT HILBURN  </P></p>

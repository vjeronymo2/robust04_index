			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Long-term potential seen among Indian steelmakers - Prospects for the sector As Europe's steelmakers struggle to sort out their problems, counterparts in developing and industrialising countries face very different challenges - which could turn into long-term opportunities for investors. A report last month on the Indian steel market by Mr David Morgan, steel analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, focuses on the 'excellent long-term growth potential' of the world's ninth largest steel producer, but coupled with problems such as low productivity and rigid labour laws The report does not make share recommendations, but points out the wide spectrum of investment opportunities among two dozen publicly-listed steel companies. Among these are the state-owned Steel Authority of India (Sail), the world's tenth largest steel company, which sold 10.5 per cent of its stock last year to local institutions; Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco), the largest private sector producer and valued on the stock market at about Rs48bn (Dollars 1.5bn); and fast-growing secondary mini-producers such as Mukand and Jindal Strips. The report coincides with the launch of three India funds in the past few weeks, making a total of about 10 such funds. Foreign individuals cannot buy Indian shares directly, and even foreign institutions need government approval to invest in India. The short-term outlook for the Indian steel industry and steel shares is lacklustre. According to Mr Morgan, the industry has experienced weak demand and subdued prices for the past year, due mainly to public sector spending cuts aimed at curbing the budget deficit. Furthermore, liberalisation of the Indian steel market at the beginning of last year means that the industry is now more exposed to international markets, where prices have been weak. Steel shares have also been caught up in the general volatility of the Indian stock market because of the government's problems. But last week's victory for Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in a no-confidence vote gave the market a much needed boost. The Bombay's BSE index closed yesterday at 2,240.52, up from its 1993 low of 2,036. But Mr Morgan notes that, in spite of recent problems, the steel industry has remained profitable, unlike the majority of steel companies in developed countries. Profitability, he says, is unlikely to remain unsatisfactory until next year, which could provide investors with a good entry point. On a long-term basis, however, the Lehman Brothers report shows why the Indian steel industry is the kind of sector that growth funds ought to find attractive. An average GDP growth rate of 5 per cent a year looks 'quite possible' over the next ten years, says Mr Morgan, which could double steel consumption from its current level of 16m tonnes a year. The industry, one of the world's lowest cost producers until the mid-1970s, failed to keep up with new technology under state regulation, which kept prices low but protected steelmakers with high import tariffs. But both Sail and Tisco have major modernisation programmes underway, the leading secondary producers have efficient modern plant, and there are a number of sizeable new projects employing the latest technology. The negatives are poor infrastructure, rapidly rising input costs as other industries are liberalised too, rigid labour laws, plants that are still inefficient and under-utilised, and finding the money for modernisation and growth. Mr Morgan sees enormous scope for productivity improvements at existing plants but, even with the expansion plans, there will still be a need for more capacity to satisfy expected demand by the beginning of the next century. Beyond that, further big demand rises are expected. But he warns that the post-liberalisation environment is still evolving, and it is hard to say yet exactly where the growth is going to come from. The government still controls about half the country's steel production, but has said that no more integrated plants will be built by the public sector.</p>

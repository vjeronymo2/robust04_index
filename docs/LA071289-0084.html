			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTEST FROM POET'S ESTATE KEEPS FILM OUT OF GAY FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Larry Horne could hardly contain his excitement at last winter's Berlin Gay and  Lesbian Film Festival when he saw "Looking for Langston," director Isaac  Julien's study of homosexuality during the Harlem Renaissance.  </P> <P> "I considered it the first black gay feature film ever made," said Horne, the  director and founder of the seventh Los Angeles International Gay and Lesbian  Film and Video Festival, which runs through Sunday at the Directors Guild of  America Theater in West Hollywood.  </P> <P> Horne, who has shown all of the London-based Julien's previous films, had  decided to open the festival with "Looking for Langston," which deals with  intimate bonds between gay blacks and whites. Langston Hughes' poetry is  presented as a voice-over in parts of the movie. The black poet died in 1967.  </P> <P> "It would set the tone," Horne proclaimed, "of a festival that was shaped along  the themes of multi-culturalism."  </P> <P> But Horne's dream recently fell apart when Ada Griffin, director of the New  York-based Third World Newsreel, the distributor of "Langston," called and  demanded that he not show the film.  </P> <P> The Hughes estate sent a cease-and-desist letter to Julien in mid-June  informing him that he would put Griffin, Horne's festival and himself in legal  jeopardy if the film were screened.  </P> <P> The cause for the crisis? Julien had secured the rights to quote Hughes' poetry  in the film, but only for use in Britain. ("Langston" already has been shown on  "Out on Tuesday," a gay series on Britain's Channel 4.)  </P> <P> But according to Griffin, film maker Julien apparently wasn't aware of the  resistance he would meet from the "black bourgeoisie" who, she feels, "see  Hughes as a racial icon."  </P> <P> "They (the estate) were appalled at any inference that Hughes might have been a  homosexual and they wanted all mentions of him out," said Griffin from her New  York office.  </P> <P> Hughes' sexuality has long been debated among academics. Lately, an acclaimed  biography of Hughes' life by Arnold Rampersad, published by Oxford University  Press, was unable to confirm that Hughes was homosexual.  </P> <P> However, the editors of "Gay and Lesbian Poetry of Our Time," published by St.  Martin's Press, included four poems by Hughes in their anthology.  </P> <P> Why the fuss then about "Langston"?  </P> <P> According to Horne, "the power of celluloid is formidable, even if we're  talking independent art films -- which is why I wanted to program this festival  along multicultural themes."  </P> <P> For Horne's part, "the absence of 'Langston' doesn't necessarily detract from  the festival." Rather, he says that "the mess" points out how "much we still  need gay and lesbian film festivals."  </P> <P> Julien, who was contacted at his London production company, SanKoFa, seemed to  take the pulling of the film from the festival in stride.  </P> <P> "The Hughes estate had four major points of contention: that we delete all of  Hughes' poetry, all mention of the estate in the credits of the film and all  excerpts of Hughes reading his poetry on NBC television, as well as pay for the  estate's legal expenses in suing us.  </P> <P> "We will delete the poetry," Julien said. "I want the film to get shown -- and  the film isn't so much about Hughes as it's about 'looking' for cultural pride.  </P> <P> "But I will not comply with deleting the NBC footage because that is part of  the public domain. And even though we are trying our best to act in good faith  with the estate, we will not go so far as to pay for their expenses."  </P> <P> Officials from Harold Ober Associates, an agency that represents the Hughes  estate, refused to comment on the legal or social implications of their  cease-and-desist letter when questioned by The Times.  </P></p>

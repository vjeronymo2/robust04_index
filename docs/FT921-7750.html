			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bodycote makes Dollars 14.6m acquisition Bodycote International, the metal technology, packaging and textiles group, plans to become a leader in the world market for 'hip'ing' - a process to improve the quality of metals and glass - through the acquisition of two companies for Dollars 14.6m (Pounds 8.3m). The group is buying Industrial Materials Technology, which has two plants in the US, and IMT Europe, based in Belgium, from National Forge Company of Delaware. Bodycote will pay Dollars 637,000 cash. The rest of the consideration will be met through the issue at 356p of 2.23m new shares. The acquisitions follow the takeover last year of HIP, which developed hip'ing - also known as Hot Isostatic Pressing - in the UK.</p>

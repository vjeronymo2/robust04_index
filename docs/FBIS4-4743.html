			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Prosecutors indicted Friday  [1 April] former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on a  charge of accepting a bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp.  in exchange for helping block a criminal accusation by the  government's anticartel watchdog over a bid-rigging case. The  indictment capped a one-year investigation by prosecutors into a  string of payoff allegations involving the nation's top  construction companies and politicians.    Nakamura became the first Diet member indicted in connection  with the general contractor scandals. A total of 32 people,  including two governors, two mayors, executives of eight  contractors and a paper manufacturer, were indicted.    According to the indictment, in 1992 Nakamura, 44,  repeatedly  urged Setsuo Umezawa, then chairman of the Fair Trade Commission  (FTC), not to file a criminal accusation with prosecutors  against a group headed by Kajima. Kajima was then leader of  Saitama Doyo-kai (Saturday Association), comprised of 66  contractors in Saitama Prefecture which allegedly consulted over  bid-rigging.    Umezawa announced May 15, 1992, that the FTC decided not to  file the criminal accusation against the group.    The indictment said Nakamura received 10 million yen in a  bribe from then Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama, 68, on  January 13, 1992, at the parliamentarian's office in Tokyo's  Nagatacho. Nakamura was then acting head of the Liberal  Democratic Party's lobby of legislators concerned with a  revision of the antimonopoly law. Nakamura quit the LDP prior  to the arrest.    The day's indictment followed a rare request by prosecutors  on March 8 that the Diet lift Nakamura's constitutional immunity  from arrest as a legislator while the Diet is in session.    The Diet voted to grant the request on March 10. The  granting of the request and the request itself was the first  such case in 27 years.    Nakamura was not in any governmental or Diet committee  position to lawfully influence the action of the FTC when he  allegedly pressured Umezawa not to file the criminal accusation  against Kajima.    Nakamura has been under arrest since March 11. Since his  arrest, the former minister has refused to answer questions from  prosecutors seeking to corroborate the bribery charges.    In spite of his refusal to testify, the testimonies of other  witnesses and other circumstantial evidence are convincing  enough to prove his guilt, prosecution sources said. However,  defense attorneys for Kiyoyama forwarded to prosecutors a legal  statement in which Kiyoyama said his testimonies written in  prosecutors' papers to be examined in court "contradict my  memories."    The defense attorneys also plan to argue that the FTC had  already given up a plan to file the accusation by the time  Nakamura tried to persuade Umezawa not to file it, saying  prosecutors were then opposed to filing any accusation due to  lack of specific evidence, sources close to the attorneys said.    The attorneys are also expected to argue that Nakamura was  merely acting on instructions from then LDP kingpin Shin  Kanemaru, Nakamura's mentor, who reportedly advised Kiyoyama to  seek Nakamura's cooperation to block the FTC's planned move, the  sources said. Nakamura said in a press statement issued through  his defense counsel, "I am determined to reveal the truth  regarding the allegations at open court hearings."    "After I am released from detention, I will return to my  parliamentary residence and participate in Diet deliberations  from the day after my release," Nakamura said. However,  prosecutors said they will oppose any move by his lawyers to  seek Nakamura's release, saying he may try to destroy evidence,  and three of Nakamura's political secretaries have vanished and  not complied with prosecutors' court-authorized summons designed  to obtain their testimonies.    Meanwhile, the special investigating squad of the Tokyo  District Public Prosecutors Office will continue to investigate  other reported payoffs to politicians other than Nakamura on  suspicion of contravening the political funds control law, the  investigative sources said.    In the course of the one-year investigation, prosecutors  seized hundreds of documents, including financial records, from  the offices of the major contractors prosecutors raided.    The law places a requirement to report acceptance of  political funds while placing a ceiling on the annual amount of  political funds that a lawmaker can lawfully accept from a  single source.    In a related development, the prosecutors decided not to  indict two LDP executives other than Nakamura earlier named by  the media as the alleged recipients of bribes from the  construction industry, investigative sources said.    It is impossible to indict former LDP Secretary General  Seiroku Kajiyama on bribery charges in connection with the  alleged acceptance of 10 million yen from Mitsui Construction  Co. As the firm's ex-managing director told prosecutors he  "embezzled" the money before delivering it to Kajiyama, the  sources said.    The prosecutors also decided not to indict former Post and  Telecommunications Minister Hideo Watanabe on bribery charges,  the sources said.    Watanabe was reported to have accepted 40 million yen from  Kajima in exchange for using his influence in a bid to have the  Tokyo Metropolitan Government ease a regulation regarding  construction of a high-rise building in a restricted area in  Tokyo.</p>

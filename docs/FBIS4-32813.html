			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 30 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Government  announced tonight that it will postpone the increase in the  price of fuel that was to become effective on Wednesday, as  established in an official agreement.    According to a communique released by the Finance and Prices  Ministry [name of ministry as received], the decision was made  because private automobile owners still have gasoline ration  cards that were distributed months ago.    The government decided that "during June, prices and sale  conditions for such ration cards will be the same as those that  were in effect prior" to the 20 May official agreement, the  communique noted. The Finance and Price Ministry, however, did  not indicate if the price increase will go in effect in July or  at a later date.    Private automobile owners have restricted access to gasoline  through ration cards that are distributed by gasoline  distributors periodically. Up to 1991, consumers received cards  that allowed them to purchase up to 230 liters of gasoline each  quarter. The quota has dropped progressively since then however.  Ration cards for 20 liters were distributed in April and ration  cards for this month were for a similar quantity.    Premium gasoline will rise from 38 cents to 1.20 pesos per  liter and regular gasoline will go from 28 cents to 1 peso. A  Cuban peso is equivalent to one dollar but the local currency is  exchanged at a rate of 100 pesos per dollar at the black market.    In addition to gasoline, the government approved increases  for the prices of cigarettes and rum, as well as all  transportation fares.</p>

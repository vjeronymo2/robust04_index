			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Leading Article: University reform Quality is in danger of being crowded out by quantity in the debate over the future of the UK's universities. With student numbers double the level of a decade ago, ministers and universities should focus more on managing expansion and less on measuring it. Contrary to recent fears, demand for higher education is still increasing. The number of university students enrolled for the current academic year is not significantly down on last year - despite a fall of 4 per cent in the number of 18-year-olds, who make up the bulk of university entrants. However, controversy about precise numbers has distracted attention from worrying evidence that the university system is under strain. Five years ago there were 10.6 students for every lecturer. Now there are 14. Despite this, the proportion of students gaining first-class honours degrees has risen by 50 per cent over the last decade, even when former polytechnics are excluded. The Higher Education Quality Council, the universities' own self-regulatory body, has found 'little consistency and much variation' between universities, and even between faculties of the same universities, in the methods used for classifying degrees. This points to a worrying dilution of standards. With government encouragement, universities have generated a number of plans to improve quality assurance. They are developing new credit accumulation systems, by which courses are assessed in separate units, and have proposed a more powerful system for monitoring standards. Such developments are welcome, but they are only a start. To safeguard quality, universities need to attract first-rate staff - many able graduates are deterred from entering academe by low salaries - and to foster diversity. Universities that specialise are more likely to achieve excellence. The most effective policy to safeguard diversity is to ensure that former polytechnics focus primarily on teaching and training, roles they were performing well before acquiring their new status. Other universities should develop more specialised research interests. Ironically, the greatest obstacle to this at present is the government's funding system. It was intended to produce a handful of research-based universities. In practice, by tying funds to each university's quality of research, it has encouraged precisely the opposite trend. Universities, fearing a loss of funds, have stepped up their research work, which has resulted in a wasteful duplication of effort across the system. Rather than continue to encourage an unwarranted universalism, ministers should limit the number of universities allowed to compete for research funding. Competition for funding should continue, but only among a designated 20 or so universities. The list should not be cast in stone. But only by allowing such a group to excel will the twin principles of expansion and excellence be maintained.</p>

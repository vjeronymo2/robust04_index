			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT WE EAT  </P> <P> Thank you for Jack Smith's compassionate and self-revealing column,  "Reflections of Our Animal Appetites." This revelation of consciousness is  particularly timely in light of the fact that we have discovered that eating  animal flesh is almost as harmful to the eaters as it is to the eaten  (although, probably less painful). Since the '50s, because we were wealthy  enough to pay for it, we Americans have been on an animal food binge and it's  costing us our lives and our environment.  </P> <P> Old habits die hard. It won't be easy for most of us to give up or cut down on  animal products, but even the professed carnivore will have to agree that it is  the only intelligent thing to do.  </P> <P> ARIANE SPADE  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 5 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Argentina and Cuba signed  an agreement in Havana on 5 April that contemplates mutual  bilateral assistance for the repression of drug trafficking, the  prevention of drug addiction, and an exchange of information  between security organizations. The document was signed by Cuban  Justice Minister Carlos Amat and Argentina's Secretary of State  Alberto Lestelle.    Lestelle said Cuba "has important traffic by large (drug)  producers in the south and important traffic by large consumers  in the north." The island "still does not have consumption  problems but is facing incipient trafficking problem," the  secretary added. Cuban Justice Vice Minister Zenaida Osorio, who  was mentioned by PRENSA LATINA, said: "The development of  tourism and the opening of the country to foreign investors  might also attract traffickers."    Secretary of State Lestelle, the highest ranking Argentine  federal authority on the repression of trafficking and addiction  prevention, after signing the agreement said the document will  enable the exchange of information between specialized security  organizations from the two countries. For this work, Lestelle  said Argentina uses the National Maritime Prefecture and the  National Border Police.    Lestelle said that under the "mutual agreement," an ad-hoc  committee has been created -- it members will be appointed later  -- to define the way this information cooperation and exchange  will operate. The agreement also covers social assistance and  the legal aspects of trafficking repression and consumption  prevention. Lestelle said that in the Central American and  Caribbean region, Argentina has similar cooperation agreements  with Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Guatemala and similar  proposals are being negotiated with Nicaragua and Honduras.</p>

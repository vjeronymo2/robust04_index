			<p>BFN     [Text] Riots occurred in Zengcheng village, Guangdong when  close to 3,000 villagers took to the streets and blocked roads  for two days to protest the government's uncompensated land  acquisition. The local government sent anti-riot policemen to  put down the demonstration. Four villagers were arrested and  some villagers were reportedly hurt, although no accurate  figures are available. This was the second riot in Guangdong in  the last 10 days sparked by the problem of land acquisition. A  similar incident occurred early this month in Huiyang County.    The riot occurred in Gongbei village, Shitan town, Zengcheng  City. At around 1000, about 3,000 villagers surrounded the city  government building, marching and protesting with banners on  which were scrawled messages about dying of hunger if they got  no compensation for their land.    Other villagers, holding hoes, held up the traffic and  blocked the road from Shitan to Xintang and Zengcheng county  seat, denying entry to public security vehicles. There was a  standoff and tension ran high.    At around 1400, hundreds of anti-riot policemen arrived at  the scene and fired a dozen tear gas canisters to disperse the  crowd, and later arrested a few villagers. Local villagers said  that when the anti-riot force fired the tear gas, the situation  was very chaotic. Many villagers were beaten up by public  security personnel, and some were wounded. As of yesterday  evening, an accurate count of the wounded was unavailable.    Yesterday there were still a few villagers tacking up  posters  on the street, but the city had quieted down. The authorities  began an investigation into the village riot a few days ago, but  would not confirm whether official corruption was involved, only  telling reporters that the matter was under investigation.    Local villagers said that, about six months ago, the village  government sold land of about 500 mu to a Hong Kong businessman  for property development for 10 million yuan. It is understood  that the village government had collected the money, but  villagers had never received any government compensation. In  the last six months, villagers had repeatedly demanded the land  sale proceeds from the village government, but to no avail. The  villagers charged the government officials of corruption.    Early this month in Huiyang, there was a similar village  riot sparked by the villagers' suspicion of their land sale  money being pocketed. About 600 villagers of Bogang village,  Xiayong town, Huiyang County besieged and vandalized the town  public security neighborhood unit. A villager was shot in the  thigh by public security personnel and seven were arrested  during the incident.</p>

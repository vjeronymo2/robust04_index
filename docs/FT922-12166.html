			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price deeper in red ABITIBI-Price, the Canadian forest products company 82 per cent-owned by property developer Olympia &amp; York, has entered its third consecutive year in the red. The unremitting weakness in the newsprint market pushed Abitibi to a first-quarter loss of CDollars 41.6m, (USDollars 35.2m) or 61 cents a share, from a CDollars 5.5m loss, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Losses totalled CDollars 75.9m last year and CDollars 44.6m in 1990. First-quarter revenues dipped by 10 per cent to CDollars 650m. As one of O&amp;Y's non-property assets, Abitibi is a candidate for disposal to ease the parent company's liquidity crunch. However, O&amp;Y would prefer not to sell the company at the bottom of the forest products cycle.</p>

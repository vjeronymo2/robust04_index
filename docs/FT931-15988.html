			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Threat to creditor agreement CHARGES brought yesterday against Mr George Walker, former head of the Brent Walker property, pubs and betting group, centred on Pounds 12.5m of money said to be missing from the group, writes Maggie Urry. The sum relates to two payments. A Pounds 5m payment made in connection with a French property deal, and a Pounds 7.5m payment to Goldcrest Films and Television, then owned by Brent Walker, but allegedly not received by the company. Brent Walker said yesterday that the arrest of Mr Walker, and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the former finance director, had no impact on the group. Lawyers acting for six banks pursuing Mr George Walker with a claim for Pounds 40m, said yesterday that his arrest could affect his chances of continuing to stave off bankruptcy. The lawyers said yesterday that Mr Walker's defence costs could be so large as to prevent him making payments to creditors agreed under a voluntary arrangement. Mr Walker persuaded sufficient of his creditors to agree to the arrangement that he was able to defeat a petition for bankruptcy last autumn. However, the banks have continued to fight it.</p>

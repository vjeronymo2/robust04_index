Farmers will receive approximately 15  percent more for their cereals if Sweden joins the EU in 1995.  Sugar beet will net farmers even more through a 30-percent  price increase. For oil-yielding crops, farmers' incomes will  increase by "a mere" 10 percent. Not in 20 years will cereal  farmers' incomes have risen so sharply from one year to the next.    At the same time, the agricultural sector will become three  times as dependent on grants from the public sector. Today, the  Swedish taxpayer subsidizes the agricultural sector to the tune  of 3.5 billion Swedish kronor [SKr] each year. When the EU  takes control of our agricultural policy this support will  increase to between SKr8 and 11 billion. Precisely how much it  will rise is something that the Riksdag will decide. In many  cases the EU only provides such aid if the country in question  makes equally large -- or even larger -- grants at the same  time. However, the main aid packages for cereals, fallow land,  subsidies for animals, export aid, etc., is paid entirely out of  the EU's agricultural fund in Brussels. Ministry of Agriculture  adviser Dag von Schantz says that they are calculated to total  between SKr5 and 6 billion per year. This is augmented by  environmental aid from the EU totaling a maximum of SKr1.5  billion. This aid is conditional upon the Swedish state  expending just as much in the future, too. However, in the  future it will once again be the Swedish taxpayer who pays the  lion's share of this.    The so-called LFA [less-favored areas] support for less well  developed areas, the woodlands, islands, etc., could amount to  SKr1 billion. The EU will pay only one-fourth of this, and the  Swedish state three-fourths.    Altogether, the general aid earmarked for the agricultural  sector could increase to approximately SKr11 billion. However,  as stated above, the precondition for this is that Swedish  taxpayers contribute more, say, EU grants for the environment,  Norrland, and woodland areas.  <H5>  Scoffing LRF </H5>   It is clear that EU membership means farming will, to a  growing extent, become a kind of "agriculture by money order"  that LRF [Swedish Farmers' Association] spokesmen formerly  scoffed at. The greater part of farmers' incomes will be paid  through various kinds of grant from the EU and the Swedish  state. And as the grants grow, so will the element of control  and bureaucracy. At the same time, sales prices for many of the  farmers' products will drop. The majority of Sweden's farmers,  who grow vegetables, cereals, oil-yielding crops, sugar beet,  and so forth will do very well. Today, farmers receive  approximately SKr1.05 per kg of cereals, plus an acreage  allowance of SKr900 per hectare. This makes a total price per  kg of approximately SKr1.25. In the EU, the guaranteed price  for cereals will drop several ore per kg. In return, the  acreage allowance will increase to SKr900 per hectare and per  year. Together, this will make for a price of approximately  SKr1.45 per kg, according to the LRF. The acreage allowance will  also increase for other kinds of crops when we join the EU.  This will result in the combined revenue for sugar beet  increasing from 30 to 40 ore per kg, according to Hans Ohgren at  the Agriculture Ministry. The proceeds for oil-yielding crops  will increase by approximately 10 percent.    In the EU, the grant for fallow land, i.e., fields where  nothing at all is cultivated, will be SKr2,500 per hectare. The  same grant will be paid for energy forests of willow, or salix,  SKr2,500 per hectare per year.  <H5>  Potato Imports </H5>   Potato growers are a rather small group of farmers who are  not supported by the EU. Potatoes grown for industrial use, as  the raw material for French fries and potato chips, will  probably be imported to a greater extent than is the case today.  Growers of potatoes for domestic consumption can also count on  increased competition, while the price of potatoes grown for  starch is not likely to be affected.    Dairy farmers will probably be able to raise their prices by  between 5 and 10 ore per liter in the EU, LRF chief negotiator  Lars-Erik Lundkvist believes. On the other hand, the current  Swedish grant for cows, worth SKr1,200 per animal, will vanish.  There will be export grants for exports of dairy products  within the EU. At the same time, Swedish exports to countries  outside the EU will also receive a proportion of this amount.  All in all, Lundkvist is optimistic regarding the dairy  farmers. They might also be supported by EU grants, for  example, for less well developed areas or the environment. The  EU grant for bullocks is considerably higher than the Swedish  equivalent. This will result in an increase from SKr155 per  bull to at least SKr950. In certain cases, bulls will be  eligible to receive grants twice. The grant for suckling cows  and nurse cows, i.e., cows that are not milked but rather  produce calves, will increase from SKr1,000 to 1,250. While the  grant for meat production will go up, prices are expected to  fall.    One group of farmers who are expected to find it tough going  in the EU are the country's pork producers. They will be  subjected to substantially fiercer competition. In Denmark,  farmers will receive approximately SKr34 less per kg when they  sell their young pigs. A drop in prices can also be expected in  Sweden.    Finally, a reservation: The above information comes from  some of the country's leading experts on agricultural prices.  However, the EU agreement is extremely recent and has not yet  been definitively written out on paper. Consequently, the  figures might have to be adjusted somewhat, although the main  news is clear as day: Cereal growers will be getting a terrific  deal.</p>

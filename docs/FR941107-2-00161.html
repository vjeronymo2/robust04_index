			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. If a majority of the board of directors, or a majority of the disinterested directors, determines that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, then the relevant insurance companies, at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors), shall take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict. Such steps may include: (a) Establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account; or (b) withdrawing from the Fund or any of its portfolios the assets allocable to some or all of the Separate Accounts, and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium (including another portfolio of the Fund), or submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> annuity contract owners or life insurance contract owners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering the affected contract owners the option of making such a change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard contract owner voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the insurer may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw the investment in the Fund by that insurer's Separate Account; no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of the directors' determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participating in the Fund. These responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. For purposes of the condition set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 above, a majority of the disinterested directors shall determine whether the proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict. In no event will the Fund or DFA be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. The condition (paragraphs 4 and 5) will not be construed to require a Participating Insurance Company to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if an offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners adversely affected in a material way by the material irreconcilable conflict. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of an insurer's decision to disregard contract owner voting instructions and that decision represents a majority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw the investment in the Fund by the insurer's Separate Account; no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of the determination (by the directors of the Fund) of a material irreconcilable conflict, and to bear the costs of such remedial action, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund. These responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interest of contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. For purposes of the condition set forth in paragraph 7 above, a majority of the disinterested directors shall determine whether any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict. The Fund and the Fund's investment adviser will not be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. Moreover, no Participating Insurance Company shall be required by that condition (paragraph 7) to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners adversely affected in a material way by the material irreconcilable conflict. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The determination by the directors of the Fund of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and the implications of that conflict shall be made known promptly, in writing, to all Participating Insurance Companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all variable contract owners as long as the Commission continues to interpret the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable contract owners. Accordingly, Participating Insurance Companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their respective Separate Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely-received from contract owners. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares of the Fund held in its respective Separate Accounts for which no voting instructions from contract owners are timely-received, as well as shares of the Fund which the Participating Insurance Company owns, in the same proportion as those shares of the Fund for which voting instructions from contract owners are timely-received. Each Participating Insurance Company shall be responsible for assuring that its Separate Accounts participating in the Fund calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with other Participating Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Separate Accounts investing in the Fund shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Paris hints at farm deal France may accept the provision in the controversial Blair House accord for a 21 per cent cut in farm exports over a six-year period, provided the impact of these cuts is reduced and Paris gets guarantees from Brussels. The possibility of such a compromise was suggested by Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade minister, in a newspaper interview yesterday. It came as pressure mounted on France to sign up to a Gatt accord, with both Sir Leon Brittan, the chief European trade negotiator, and Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, coming to Paris to brief Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, on the state of negotiations. Mr Longuet, who is one of the more pro-Gatt ministers in the French government, told the Journal du Dimanche: 'The Americans are now proposing technical measures so as not to hit these subsidised European exports with the brutality that was initially envisaged.' France had been seeking to subtract existing food stocks and future food aid from the volume of subsidised exports to which this 21 per cent cut would apply, as well as postponing most of the reduction to the end of the decade. 'It is easier to make progress calculating in terms of millions of tonnes of cereals exported, or on the contrary lost, between 1995 and 2001 than to get hung up on a percentage (21 per cent) already accepted  - alas - by the Brussels Commission,' Mr Longuet said. 'The final objective', he said, 'is that by the end of the agreement Europe should guarantee to France that there will not be one extra hectare of land taken out of production', beyond the set-aside provisions of the European Union's current reform of its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The Brussels Commission has claimed that the Blair House accord as originally agreed would not require the EU to cut production any more than it is already doing under CAP reform.</p>

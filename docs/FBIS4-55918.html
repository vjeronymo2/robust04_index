			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 20 (CTK) -- Coalition deputies will not  support a constitutional bill deleting the Senate from the  Constitution and introducing a unicameral parliament at the  parliamentary session opening next Tuesday [24 May], Parliament  Chairman Milan Uhde said today. The bill has been submitted by  deputies from opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD)  and the Liberal Social Union (LSU). Three-fifths or 120 votes  in the 200-seat parliament are necessary for a constitutional  bill to be passed. The coalition commands 105 votes.    Speaking after a meeting of the "coalition thirteen," Uhde  said that the four coalition parties still held different views  on Senatorial elections. The coalition thirteen comprises the  chairman and four deputy chairmen of the parliament, the  chairmen of the four coalition parties and the chairmen of their  deputies' groups.    The coalition parties are the Civic Democratic Party (ODS),  the Christian Democratic Party-Czechoslovak People's Party  (KDU-CSL), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian  Democratic Party (KDS).    Uhde said that some deputies still believed that the  Senatorial elections should be one-round, while the government  bill provides for two-round balloting. A third, compromise bill  applies the "Australian principle", which combines both previous  ones, he added. The elections will probably be held in the  autumn, along with local elections.    Another question at issue is the number of constituencies.  The ODS still rejects any other number than 81, Uhde, an ODS  member himself, said. But he stressed that negotiations would  continue "until the last moment" before the session, and may be  also during the session, which is to deal with the bill.  Therefore, the course of the session may be slightly dramatic,  but "dramatic only in brackets because there is will to reach  agreement," Uhde said.    The coalition thirteen today set up a commission to seek a  solution to the dispute over the size of constituencies for  elections to the Chamber of Deputies (to be held in 1996) and to  the Senate. The commission should find a solution as close to  the original proposal as possible, which would respect the  existing administrative districts. The original proposal  provided for about 15 percent differences in the numbers of  voters in individual constituencies.    On May 12, Josef Jezek (formerly ODS, now independent  deputy), told journalists that in the government-approved bill  the differences in the population of individual constituencies  had not been more than 15 percent. But the material distributed  to the deputies provides for differences of up to 27 percent, he  added.    The commission is headed by Karel Ledvinka (ODA) and  comprises Libor Novak Jr (ODS), Ivan Masek (ODA), Ludvik Motycka  (KDU-CSL), Marek Benda (KDS) and government experts.    The authenticity of the government bill given to the  parliament was also doubted today by Deputy Premier and ODA  Chairman Jan Kalvoda. His statement contradicts an earlier  claim by Premier Vaclav Klaus who sharply rejected the  possibility that the parliament would have received another bill  than that approved by the government.</p>

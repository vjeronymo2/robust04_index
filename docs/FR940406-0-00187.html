			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on its analysis described above and on manufacturers' projections, the agency concludes that the major domestic manufacturers can achieve the light truck fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy levels listed in the following table:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,tp0,i1,s25,12,4,4 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Approximate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (percent, based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on MY 1993) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1CAFE (mpg) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2MY 1996 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2MY 1997 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> GM  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 30  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 20.7  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 20.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 31  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 21.2  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 21.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chrysler  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 23  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 20.8  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 21.0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated above, most light truck manufacturers other than GM, Ford and Chrysler only compete in the small vehicle portion of the light truck market and are therefore expected to achieve CAFE levels well above those companies. Only three light truck manufacturers, Range Rover, PAS and UMC, are expected to have fuel economy levels lower than the major domestic manufacturers. Since these companies have an extremely small market share, NHTSA concludes that setting a standard based on their capabilities would be inconsistent with a determination of maximum feasibility that takes industry-wide considerations into account, as required by statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, NHTSA has concluded that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales for MYs 1996&hyph;97. NHTSA also concludes that 20.7 mpg is the maximum feasible standard for both MYs 1996 and 1997. For the reasons discussed below, this level balances the potential petroleum savings associated with a higher standard against the difficulties of manufacturers facing a potentially higher standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that a 20.7 mpg light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will make a positive contribution to petroleum conservation by encouraging GM, which has a large market share, to achieve a higher CAFE level than it currently projects while remaining within its fuel economy capability. The agency notes that a 20.7 mpg standard is 0.2 mpg higher than GM's current MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE projection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A 20.7 mpg standard will not unduly restrict consumer choice or have adverse economic impacts on the large domestic manufacturers. The current product plans of Ford and Chrysler indicate that they expect to achieve MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels that are above 20.7 mpg. Therefore, they will not have to make any changes in their product plans to achieve the level of the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While GM's current product plan shows expected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFEs of 20.5 mpg in each model year, NHTSA's analysis indicates that company can achieve a CAFE of 20.7 mpg in both years. As discussed above, this conclusion is based on the following assumptions: (1) The 4WD share of the market will not significantly increase between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97, (2) GM will make successful efforts to maintain market share of certain vehicles, (3) GM can make minor changes in the performance levels of its vehicles to bring them more in line with its competitors, and (4) GM can make small improvements by increasing the penetration of some engine and transmission technology improvements that are not projected for full implementation. All of these actions are very minor and, the agency believes, within GM's capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that a higher standard than 20.7 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97 could result in serious economic difficulties for GM. While GM can achieve 20.7 mpg CAFE without significant product restrictions, such restrictions could be required to achieve a CAFE higher than 20.7 mpg. Given leadtime constraints, NHTSA believes that the first potential fuel-efficiency actions that GM or any other manufacturer would consider in response to a higher standard would consist of marketing actions. For the reasons discussed in other notices, however, the agency does not believe that marketing actions can be relied upon to significantly improve a manufacturer's CAFE. See, e.g., MY 1993&hyph;94 light truck CAFE final rule (56 FR 13775, April 4, 1991). If such marketing actions were unsuccessful in whole or in part, GM would likely have to engage in significant product restrictions to achieve the level of a higher CAFE standard. Such product restrictions could result in adverse economic consequences for GM, its employees and the economy as a whole and limit consumer choice, especially with regard to the load-carrying needs of light truck purchasers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, while NHTSA has concluded that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales, the agency believes that GM's capability is not significantly below that of Chrysler. GM and Chrysler, combined, sell over 50 percent of all new light trucks each model year. Therefore, even if the agency were to set a standard above GM's capability, the standard could not be much above 20.7 mpg and still remain within the capability of the majority of the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Proposed Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Amendments to Part 206  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The title of part 206 is changed to refer to, among other things, ``global and bilateral safeguard actions,'' reflecting the use of the term ``safeguards'' in the NAFTA Implementation Act and to distinguish between actions with respect to imports from all countries (proceedings under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974) and actions with respect to imports from a NAFTA country (proceedings under section 302(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act). The current title of this part refers to, among other things, ``investigations relating to import injury to industries.'' The current title, which historically has been used to refer to section 201-type proceedings, can be confusing to those not familiar with Commission trade law terminology and has been misconstrued as describing proceedings under other statutory provisions that the Commission administers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 206.1 is amended to state that part 206 applies to functions and duties of the Commission under sections 301&hyph;318 of the NAFTA Implementation Act and to state that subparts C and D of the rules apply to requests/petitions and investigations under sections 312(c) and 302 of that Act, respectively. Former subparts C and D (relating to market disruption investigations under section 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2436) and monitoring and advice under section 204 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2254), respectively) are redesignated as subparts E and F.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 206.2, which provides for the identification of petitions, is amended to include references to sections 312(c) and 302 of the NAFTA Implementation Act in the list of statutory provisions under which petitions under this part may be filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 206.3 is divided into three subsections and amended to describe the information that the Commission is to include in a notice when it institutes an investigation, and to state that the Commission will promptly make the petition or request available for public inspection (with the exception of confidential business information). This latter amendment conforms the Commission rules to paragraphs 4 and 5 of NAFTA Annex 803.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 206.4 is amended to state that the Commission will also transmit copies of requests (relating to a surge in imports from a NAFTA country) to the USTR and certain other agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 206.5, concerning public hearings, is divided into three subsections and amended to distinguish between investigations under subpart B, in which the Commission is required to hold separate hearings on injury and remedy, and investigations under subparts C, D, and E, in which the Commission holds only one hearing on both issues, to the extent appropriate. Additional language states that interested parties and consumers, including any association representing the interests of consumer, may appear and may cross-question interested parties making presentations at a hearing; this latter amendment conforms the rule to section 7(b) of NAFTA Annex 803.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 206.6, concerning the Commission's report to the President, simplifies the existing description and also states that the Commission will include, in the case of a report containing a determination under section 302(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, certain findings with respect to factors other than imports that may be a cause of serious injury or threat thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 206.7, states that the Commission, in the case of an investigation under subparts B, C, or D of this part, will not release information considered to be confidential business information unless the party submitting the information had notice, at the time of submission, that such information would be released by the Commission, or such party subsequently consents to the release of the information. This rule reflects an amendment made by section 317(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act to section 202(a) of the Trade Act. Paragraph 8 of NAFTA Annex 803.3 requires that the investigating authority in a NAFTA country adopt or maintain procedures for the treatment of confidential information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart B, which relates to investigations filed under section 201 of the Trade Act, is retitled ``Investigations Relating to Global Safeguard Actions'', reflecting in part the change in the title of part 206.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

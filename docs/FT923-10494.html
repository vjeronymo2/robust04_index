			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining as an environmental pariah - Matthew Kaminski on mounting pressure on the industry in the US THE MINING industry is an environmental pariah that both industrialised and developing nations must strictly regulate. This is the conclusion of a comprehensive study of the global environmental impact of mineral extraction. The report, Mining the Earth, is published by the Worldwatch Institute, a respected Washington think-tank. The report describes a broad pattern of ecological damage. Each year, it says, miners strip 28bn tonnes of material, more than is removed by the planet's rivers, and generate 2.7bn tonnes of waste, much of it hazardous. Smelting pumps 6m tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, a major cause of acid rain. 'Few would dream that mines and smelters take up to a tenth of all the energy used each year or that the waste left by mining measures in billions of tons - dwarfing the world's total accumulation of more familiar kinds of waste, such as municipal garbage,' says Mr John Young, the report's author. Yet he notes that many countries promote virgin mining - which they see as key to development - with hefty subsidies. In the US, for example, tax breaks provided the mining industry with a Dollars 5bn subsidy during the 1980s. The US mining industry dismisses the report's proposals to tighten environmental standards, tax mineral extraction to pay for waste clean-up and eliminate tax breaks. The American Mining Congress, the industry's main trade association, claims that US miners pioneered responsible practices - spending Dollars 14bn over the past 20 years to help the environment - and religiously adhere to already tough government regulations. 'To say that the mining industry is 'ravaging' the earth is both a gross distortion of the truth and an insult to the dedicated work of miners everywhere who respect the land, its treasures and beauty,' says Mr John Knebel, the AMC's president. Even so, the lobby's bigger concern is a threatened congressional bill. The House of Representatives version, sponsored by Democrat Mr Nick Rahall, was the first hard rock mineral mining reform bill ever reported to the House floor from committee. The bill aims to change completely a century-old system under which anyone can explore US federal lands and rights to plots for as little as Dollars 2.50 an acre after discovery of a valuable mineral deposits. One provision would impose a rental fee for using the land and set stricter regulations for repairing the area after mining is finished. The bill would also place an 8 per cent royalty on gold, silver, platinum and other hard-rock minerals extracted from federal lands. Environmentalists hope these standards will make mineral prices reflect the ecological costs of mining. The industry pleads that current policy promotes new ventures on millions of acres of unexplored federal land. It warns that the fee and royalty provisions could dig deep into US mine profits and devastate communities, mostly in western states, that depend heavily on mining. But supporters counter that the present policy is a throw-back to the old west - the current law was passed in 1872 - when the government aggressively promoted settlement. Since minerals are no longer scarce (and the west is settled), Mr Young says the administration has no excuse for ignoring the ecological hazards posed to US land by mining ventures. However, the study finds that severe harm has been done to developing countries, which it says have been left ravaged and indebted by mining development strategies. Many Third World countries became highly dependent on mineral exports during the 1960s, but as prices fell in the past two decades the pressure on producers to repay development debts has become too great. Zambia, which relies on copper for 86 per cent of its export revenue, is held up as an example. When copper prices skidded in the early 1980s, the country's economy went into a tail-spin: in 1989, the country's debt was 1.4 times its gross national product. 'The rich nations bear a special responsibility to help clean up the messes created to satisfy their needs, and to ensure that new damage is kept to a minimum,' says Mr Young. 'More attention - and funding - needs to be devoted to diversifying the economies of mineral producing nations.'</p>

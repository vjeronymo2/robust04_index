			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES GO FOURTH AT GOP PICNIC;  </P> <P> POLITICS: FLAG AND FUNDS ARE RAISED IN COSTA MESA. PETE WILSON LEADS SALUTE TO  REPUBLICAN PATRIOTISM.  </P> <P> Although it lacked traditional staples such as watermelon and red-checkered  tablecloths, there was no shortage of flag-waving patriotism at a  Republican-sponsored picnic that drew candidates hoping to win office in  November.  </P> <P> Dubbed the "Grand Old Picnic," the five-hour fund-raiser held at the Orange  County Fairgrounds showcased a short visit by Republican gubernatorial  candidate Sen. Pete Wilson and his wife, Gayle.  </P> <P> Also appearing were state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), party nominee  for lieutenant governor; attorney general candidate Dan Lungren; Huntington  Beach councilman and state insurance commissioner candidate Wes Bannister, and  Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who is seeking reelection.  </P> <P> The fund-raiser, benefiting the Orange County Republican Party, was designed to  combine family fun with such serious political motives as getting out the vote  and rallying campaign volunteers, said picnic chairman Dan McNerney, assistant  treasurer of the Orange County Republican Party.  </P> <P> Because the picnic's debut last October was poorly attended, McNerney suggested  shifting it to Independence Day this year to capitalize on the patriotic mood.  </P> <P> "We're trying to capture that patriotic spirit everybody seems to feel on the  Fourth of July . . . where it is a national, emotional thing and everyone gets  a little introspective about our country," McNerney said.  </P> <P> Organizers called the move a success, noting that the event drew more than  1,000 people throughout the day -- twice as many as last year -- at  $2-per-person or $5-per-family admission prices.  </P> <P> In addition to brief speeches by Wilson and other politicians, the picnic  featured children's choirs performing patriotic songs, hot dog and lemonade  booths manned by local Republican clubs, carnival games, a classic car display  and face-painters dressed as Miss Liberty and George Washington.  </P> <P> Even Wilson embraced the patriotic glow as he presented an American flag to  County Republican Party Chairman Tom Fuentes.  </P> <P> As he unfolded the flag, Wilson beckoned the dozen local politicians on the  November ballot to gather in a semicircle around him on the outdoor stage.  </P> <P> "This is a symbol of freedom around the world," Wilson said. "I dare anybody to  take this flag away from my (Republican) team or from Tom Fuentes and burn it.  They will be sorry."  </P> <P> Using a theme of Let Freedom Ring, event organizers also said they wanted to  share the holiday with those who have struggled for freedom around the world.  </P> <P> Speakers included Andres Zuniga, head of a Nicaraguan political party involved  in the anti-Sandinista campaign, and Rahmatullah Safi, a leader of the  anti-communist National Islamic Front of Afghanistan. Also present were  families from Poland and the Soviet republics of Lithuania and Latvia.  </P> <P> "This is a day of thanksgiving . . . that we have the leadership and freedom so  many of us are striving to keep for ourselves and our children," Bergeson said.  "Republican values are not for more taxes . . . but for the values we hold true  in our families."  </P> <P> McNerney said the picnic reflected family-oriented ideals stressed by the  party.  </P> <P> "Black-tie dinners are great for (people like) the Brens, the Karchers and the  Segerstroms, who drop $1,000 here and $1,000 there," he said, referring to a  few prominent, wealthy families who support the local GOP. "But today, there  are even more people having fun eating hot dogs and riding ponies."  </P></p>

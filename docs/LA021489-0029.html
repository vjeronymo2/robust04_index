			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AQMD ENFORCEMENT ACTION  </P> <P> After one week, three days and 40 hours on the phone, we still do not know what  chemicals could have been released from Coastcast in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> We still have at least 25 residents living in close proximity to the plant who  are suffering similar symptoms initiated during the same time period.  </P> <P> Medical care? Be aware, fellow Valley residents, that after any exposure, you  are responsible for tests (not counting any ongoing treatment) that could begin  at the very least $1,000 per person. No insurance? Pay up front for a family of  four: $4,000.  </P> <P> Do we need changes? You bet. How many other similar situations are out there  that have never been answered because these agencies and public services could  not respond to a citizen's critical health complaints?  </P> <P> As we are forced to live closer and closer to industry, the public should be  made aware that bloated bureaucracy, inadequate education, lax follow-up and  wrist-slapping penalties are dangerously affecting our health and well-being.  </P> <P> So, here we are. No agency, no governing body, no company will take  responsibility to provide any answers for these trailer park residents. Aren't  you glad it hasn't happened to you? Yet.  </P> <P> PENNY NEWMARK  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P> <P>  Newmark is president of Residents Against Pollution.  </P> <P> </P></p>

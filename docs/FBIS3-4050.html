Chairman Gyaincain  Norbu first gave a detailed account of the progress Tibet has  made over the past year in industry, agriculture, animal  husbandry, transportation, and communications as well as  production and livelihood in the cities and countryside.  [passage omitted]    Speaking of the excellent situation of reform and opening up  in Tibet, Gyaincain Norbu said:    [Begin Norbu recording] The volume of import and export last  year was $100 million, $80 million of which was import and $20  million export. Tourism also registered marked growth over the  previous year. The number of tourists from Hong Kong, Macao,  Taiwan, and foreign countries was 23,000. All in all, progress  was achieved in industry, animal husbandry, agriculture,  tourism, and foreign trade. Fairly good progress was also  achieved in various social undertakings, including public  health, education, science and technology, sports, and  television and radio services. [end Norbu recording]    Speaking of economic cooperation with coastal regions,  Gyaincain Norbu stated:    [Begin Norbu recording] Tibet abounds in resources. Its  transportation facilities are relatively backward, and it lacks  skilled workers. [passage omitted] Last year, either on its  own or as a joint venture, Tibet established more than 120  enterprises in fraternal provinces and municipalities, in the  coastal regions in particular. [passage omitted] [end Norbu  recording]    Looking forward to 1994, Gyaincain Norbu told the  correspondents with confidence:    [Begin Norbu recording] This year will be a crucial one for  the deepening of reform in Tibet. Following the two current  sessions [as heard], Tibet has announced measures for reform in  nine sectors: reform of agriculture and animal husbandry, the  investment structure, revenues and taxes, the housing system,  and so forth. These measures have been announced after repeated  deliberation and taking into consideration the views of various  sectors. This year, we will be combining package reform with  breakthroughs in key areas. We must also take Tibet's realities  into account. We should be bold, but the measures we adopt must  be well-considered. Under such a guideline, we set an annual  GNP target of 4,002,000,000 yuan, an increase of 8 percent over  last year. I believe this target can be reached through the  concerted efforts of people of all nationalities in the region.  [passage omitted] [end Norbu recording]</p>

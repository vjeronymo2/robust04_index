			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Danish sugar move DANSICO, the Danish food, food ingredients and packaging group, plans to rationalise sugar output in six sugar plants it has acquired in the former East Germany, Hilary Barnes reports from Copenhagen. Some 120,000 tonnes of sugar will be produced at one modernised plant in Anklam, north-east Germany, instead of at two main and six satellite plants, as now. Modernisation will cost DKr200m (Pounds 17.6m).</p>

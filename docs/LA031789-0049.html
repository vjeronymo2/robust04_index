			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> INTENSE 'PAPERHOUSE' HAUNTED BY NIGHTMARES  </P> <P> Fever dreams, daydreams, nightmares, the world of art and imagination: These  are the subjects of Bernard Rose's "Paperhouse" (AMC Century 14). But the film  isn't shot in that languorous, soft-focus style we associate with movies about  reverie. The vision here is laceratingly sharp. Ultimately, "Paperhouse"  becomes a film about how dreams can subvert or attack the real world, open it  up to fear, loathing and maybe rebirth.  </P> <P> In "Paperhouse's" dream world, the light is pitiless, pouring down on a  doppelganger land of eerily isolated fields and trashed houses, full of harsh  surfaces, hidden monsters and keen, knife-like edges -- a world ready to crack  open over a hellish, fiery core. Much of the movie is set in the mind of a  sick, bedridden little girl, creating her own territory on paper, with paints  or crayons, and in the inner chambers of her mind -- in dreams and delirium.  And it becomes grindingly intense, a visually and aurally sophisticated little  shocker, shivery and ripe with childhood terrors.  </P> <P> "Paperhouse" is based on a Catherine Storr novel called "Marianne Dreams."  Here, the re-named Anna (Charlotte Burke) is a little girl who makes childish  pictures and then dreams herself into a world where they become real. The  tilted house of her drawings stands huge and abandoned in a vast, deserted  field of endlessly waving gray-green grass, its rooms occupied by another of  her creations: a little, legless, stick-figure boy called Marc (Elliott  Spiers).  </P> <P> Is he also real? Anna's doctor has another patient, another Marc: suffering  from muscular dystrophy. And, gradually, Anna becomes convinced that the fates  of the dream Marc, the drawn Marc and the real Marc are inextricably joined,  and that her drawings are changing all their lives, perhaps destroying them.  Every personal and psychic horror she can imagine, including the conversion of  her own father into a mad, dark stalker, is dredged up as she seeks to save her  friend: the boy she never meets in the waking world.  </P> <P> There's nothing boring about "Paperhouse." The sound track and images keep  working you up, squeezing out cold sweat. Obviously, director Bernard Rose saw  the novel's central conceit, that dreams come true, as a visual springboard.  And, though he and script writer Matthew Jacobs haven't delved far into the  psychology -- haven't really made Anna's dilemma real -- they've had a field  day with the dreams, the crazy surfaces, the hallucinatory edges.  </P> <P> These dreams -- the horrific paternal assault, the mysterious bicycles,  helicopters and ice-cream machines -- are like Andrew Wyeth under ether, like  crisp, deep TV-ad visions out of Dali and de Chirico. The photographic style,  by Rose and cinematographer Mike Southon (Ken Russell's "Gothic") probably owes  as much to Rose's career in rock videos, as Southon's taste for Hammer horror  movies. In their eyes, both nightmare and real world have a diamond-hard  brightness, sliding into the terrifying, skewed emptiness of the dream fields  surrounding Anna's paper house and a huge phallic lighthouse.  </P> <P> The child actress who plays Anna, Charlotte Burke, may be too old for the part.  She is 13, perhaps playing 11, but the drawings she has supposedly made look  like the work of a 6- or 7-year-old. Still, Burke she has an admirable  resilience and energy; so does Spiers. And the adults around her have a scarily  equivocal quality: Glenne Headly, the corrupt ingenue of "Dirty Rotten  Scoundrels" as her too-rational mother, Ben Cross of "Chariots of Fire" as her  night-and-day father, Gemma Jones as her skeptical doctor.  </P> <P> The ideas here aren't new. Postwar '40s British films often took us into these  dream worlds and childhood realms. But the technology is, as recent dream-films  like "Time Bandits" or "Dreamchild" have already shown. The movie all but  attacks you, largely through its lethally sharp images, and a music score by  Hans Zimmer ("Rain Man") and Stanley Myers that is full of dark jags, edges and  harsh screams too. "Paperhouse" (PG-13, despite intense, nightmarish scenes)  puts up an impeccable surface, rips it up, reveals a hell underneath; an  incongruous paper world of flesh and paint, blood and fire, oceans of tears.  </P> <P> 'PAPERHOUSE'  </P> <P> A Vestron Pictures Inc. presentation of a Working Title production.

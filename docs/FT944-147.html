			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Ashdown warns on Eurorebel 'success' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, warned in a new year message to party members that the UK's commitment to the European Union was being successfully undermined by the Tory party's Eurosceptic rebels. He said: 'European Union is the most important political idea of our century. But it is in danger of dying just when we need it most. Just when the case for the European Union is strongest, the sceptics have the best tunes to sing. 'Unless those who believe in the European project are prepared to stand up and defend their vision, then 1995 could be the year when the idea of union in Europe began to die for want of people with the courage to defend it.' Mr Ashdown accused the government of being 'weak, diffident and uncertain' in the face of Eurosceptic attacks on the EU, which was the best hope for containing nationalism in western Europe and preventing war in the east. 'Britain now has a broken-backed government - a government that has lost its way, its majority in the House (of Commons) and the trust of the country. Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats had an opportunity to provide 'the backbone for constructive change' in 1995, building on the party's victory in the Eastleigh by-election in June, its gains in the May local elections and two victories in the June European Parliament elections. However, Mr Ashdown ignored the party's steady decline to about 13 per cent of the projected vote in the opinion polls since the election of Mr Tony Blair as Labour leader last summer.</p>

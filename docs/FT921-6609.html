			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Brussels tries to rescue fisheries agreement with Morocco THE European Community was yesterday trying to patch up a diplomatic breach with Morocco in time to save a fisheries accord which runs out on Saturday. The difference was caused by January's decision by the European Parliament to vote against Ecu463m (Pounds 328m) in loans and grants because of Moroccan human rights abuses and its failure to comply with the United Nations peace plan for Western Sahara. The fishing agreement, mainly of interest to 700 Spanish and a few Portuguese vessels, had worked smoothly. But after the parliament's veto, Rabat was sufficiently enraged to call into question both the fisheries accord and the co-operation agreement with the EC under which the loan and aid programme was agreed last summer. Efforts by the European Commission and Council of Ministers to persuade parliament to reconsider failed to get the Moroccan finance package on the agenda at this month's plenary session. As a consequence, foreign ministers, acting on Spain and Portugal's suggestion, decided last week in Lisbon to explore the possibility of a free trade agreement with Morocco. Mr Vitor Martins, secretary of state for Europe of Portugal, which currently holds the EC presidency, met Mr Abdellatif Filali, the Moroccan foreign minister, yesterday to try to prolong the fisheries deal for at least three months, officials in Brussels said. The free trade carrot has two tactical virtues to recommend it. First, the suggestion has gone down well in Rabat, officials in Brussels say, where King Hassan has seized on it as a move towards the special relationship he has sought with the EC ever since his application for Community membership in 1987 was rebuffed. Second, by going the free trade route, the Commission and the Council largely circumvent the parliament. Co-operation agreements must reach a high bar of 260 votes at Strasbourg to get through. But a free trade agreement, although much wider in scope, would at the moment reduce parliament to an advisory role, since it would be routed through the 113 Committee, made up of the member states and the Commission, which decides EC commercial policy. But some officials regard the free trade idea as little more than a gesture to get the EC over the fisheries accord hurdle by signalling Community willingness to explore a closer relationship with Morocco. Much of the trade between the EC and Morocco is already free anyway, with the conspicuous exception of agriculture, which has about nil chance of becoming so. Parliament, moreover, will get a big say on free trade agreements once the Maastricht treaty on European union comes into force next year, and there is no hope of concluding a deal by then, even assuming one was being seriously pursued. But because Spain originated the gesture, officials hope King Hassan will reciprocate by helping out its fishing armada. If its does not, the Commission is preparing a financing package to help the fishing industry through any lay-off period.</p>

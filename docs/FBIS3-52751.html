President Saparmurad Niyazov, who visited our country at the  head of a high-ranking delegation, left Tehran at noon today  after signing these agreements. He was seen off officially by  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    Our correspondent reports: With the signing of 11  cooperation agreements by the presidents of Iran and  Turkmenistan, economic, political, trade, and cultural  cooperation between the two countries have increased.    On the basis of the agreements signed today by the two  countries' presidents at the end of Mr. Niyazov's official visit  to our country, Iran and Turkmenistan will cooperate on  transport, communications, gas and oil, electricity, railways,  trade, banking relations, education, and training.    Turkmen President Niyazov today expressed satisfaction at  the  outcome of his five-day official visit to our country. He said:    [Begin Niyazov recording, speaking in Turkmen, fading into  Persian translation] This trip has had a profound and very  positive effect on us, and on behalf of the people and  government of Turkmenistan, we sincerely thank Mr.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani for laying the foundation for strong  relations between the two countries. [end recording]    Mr. Niyazov said that close and growing cooperation between  the two countries are exemplary, and that some important  agreements have been signed which will be beneficial to the  people of the two countries and will also have their deserved  impact on regional and international political cooperation.    The Turkmen president thanked the people and officials of  the  Islamic Republic of Iran for their warm hospitality.    Speaking about the outcome of his talks with the Turkmen  president, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, our country's president,  said:    [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] In the name of God, the  merciful, the compassionate. The visit by His Excellency Mr.  Niyazov and his delegation was an interesting one. As far as  official visits are concerned, it could even be considered as  rather unique, because almost all the members of Turkmenistan's  cabinet, together with governors general, vice presidents,  deputy ministers, Friday prayer leaders, and other key Turkmen  figures accompanied the Turkmen president.    This was quite a revealing thing, in that it showed how  serious both sides were to work together in all fields. He  himself explained that he left only the speaker of parliament  and the chief of the police behind, and brought everyone else to  Iran to make expansion of cooperation possible. This also  proves what a stable and secure place Turkmenistan is if its  entire officialdom can stay out of the country for five days.  This is yet another interesting point, and this tranquillity  and stability provides the people of Turkmenistan with the  opportunity to develop their newly-independent country. They  should appreciate their stability, especially in view of what is  now happening in other countries with a background similar to  Turkmenistan.    The length of the visit was also noteworthy. They were here  for five days, during which they visited many places and held  talks on a multitude of subjects. Fortunately, today we witness  the commissioning of 480 telephone lines between our two  countries. Through these lines, Turkmenistan will be connected  to the whole world via Iran. This is just one aspect of the  revival of the ancient Silk Road, albeit in a modern context.    We signed many agreements when we visited there, and our  work  there was carried over to this trip and was completed in the  talks between the officials. Agreements have been signed in all  fields.    Good as the progress in cooperation has been in these past  two to three years, I think that after this trip the pace of  cooperation will be even faster. I think the other countries in  the region can also benefit from our cooperation. No country  should think that our cooperation with Turkmenistan is at odds  with their interests; on the contrary, I believe this will pave  the way for others to join in. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Trudeau urges No vote in Canada MR Pierre Trudeau, the former Canadian prime minister, has indicated he will campaign for a No vote in next month's referendum on the country's new constitution, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. In a strongly worded essay published in a Canadian magazine yesterday, Mr Trudeau urges Canadian political leaders to have 'a bit of courage' in resisting 'master blackmailers' in Quebec who are demanding more powers for the francophone province. The No forces have seized the early initiative in the campaign leading up to the October 26 referendum. Criticism of the deal in Quebec has so far centred on the failure of Mr Robert Bourassa, the province's prime minister, to extract more powers from the federal government. In western Canada opposition is centred on the provision which guarantees Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons in perpetuity. Westerners also oppose proposals for a revamped Senate which would have equal provincial representation but only limited powers of veto.</p>

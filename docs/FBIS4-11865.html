			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political </F> Department, by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from the  "Arabs' Home" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Hijazi] Security Council Resolution 904 has  condemned Israel for the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.  After that, Israel bombed some buildings in Hebron, in defiance  of the Security Council resolution and the world community. How  will the confrontation with Israel end?    [Qaddumi] I do not believe that ending the confrontation  with  Israel is a simple matter. Israel continues to occupy  Palestinian land. Ending the occupation will end the  confrontation. Without ending the Israeli occupation, the  confrontation with Israel will continue using all means.  Unfortunately, this community has proved to be one that harbors  rancor toward the Palestinians and the Arabs. [Former Israeli  Foreign Minister] Abba Eban said this in a lecture he delivered  at George Washington [as heard], when he said that it is now the  duty of Israel to restore its democratic nature, which it  claimed to have had.    [Hijazi] What is the mechanism for implementing the Security  Council resolution?    [Qaddumi] The Security Council is responsible for  implementing its own resolution. It urged the cosponsors of the  peace conference to use all methods to provide protection for  and ensure the safety of the Palestinian civilians inside the  occupied territories. Among these measures is the dispatch of  international troops, the disarming of settlers, and the  adoption of other measures, such as removing the Israelis from  Hebron. This is because their presence creates friction and  constitutes a provocative act intended to perpetuate such  incidents.    [Hijazi] Following the Hebron massacre, Israel announced its  intention to assemble settlers in settlements close to each  other and away from Palestinians in the occupied territories.  Do you think Israel is serious about this?    [Qaddumi] Israel is now divided. We know very well that  there are people who want to resolve the problem, but Yitzhaq  Rabin in particular is a man who indeed does not want peace. He  has postponed the withdrawal and he does not honor anything that  he says, unfortunately. He says that these deadlines are not  sacred. We have cautioned the United States and Israel about the  consequences of these actions, but the Israeli Army put pressure  on Rabin. This became clear during the talks held in Cairo,  Davos, Oslo. Yitzhaq Rabin does not want to honor this  agreement. He says something but does not honor it. He is  acting in collusion with the Army people and with the settlers.  I believe that continuing this policy will finish off the peace  process. Had the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho not been  delayed, these incidents would not have happened. Rabin has  given the opposition more cards to strengthen its position, and  here are the results, but they will fall on Rabin's head, God  willing.</p>

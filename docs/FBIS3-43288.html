As is the tradition, the new year is a time when resolutions  are made and relatives and friends extend their best wishes to  one another. President Pascal Lissouba, who is no exception to  the rule, addressed the nation on the evening of 31 December.  In his message, the head of state outlined measures that would  bring about peace, which our country badly needs for its  development. Here is what President Pascal Lissouba said:    [Begin Lissouba recording] The first challenge is to ensure  a  spiritual and moral awakening through systematic education of  our people, especially our children. The second challenge is to  rebuild the country and to rebuild towns that were destroyed or  ruined by blind and savage violence. The third challenge is to  make people understand, support, and consolidate the process  toward peace and reconciliation among communities which have  been torn apart. It is only when we are ready to accept and  assume the contents of these challenges that a new political  initiative will be proposed to our people in consultation with  the leading political groups so that social peace will be truly  consolidated.    The tragic events which occurred in the country are  sufficient proof that the Congolese political class has not yet  understood the first thing about democratic values, which still  remains [words indistinct]. If it took Europe 100 years to  achieve that, Africa should achieve these democratic values  within just a few years. [end recording]    President Lissouba also had a message for the youth,  especially the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral  Development [MCDDI] and the Pan-African Union for Social  Democracy [UPADS] activists. He called on them to demonstrate  the fact that they are the reflection of Congo and its future.    [Begin Lissouba recording] I turn to our political party  activists, and more especially to you, youth of MCDDI and UPADS.  You are all children of Congo, and I owe it to you all, in my  triple capacity as a father, a man of science, and a statesman,  the heavy responsibility to see to your welfare, your education,  and your training. It is necessary that your parents -- and it  should also be the same for your various parties -- make this a  duty, a privilege, and even an essential priority. Indeed,  Congo as a whole is suffering. It is suffering from the image  you are creating for it; it is worried about your future. I  therefore call on you, through your political leaders, to pay  heed to (?what we propose), to cease-fire, show discipline, and  to put an end to provocation, which leads to rebellion and acts  as an excuse for various reprisals. It is a necessary condition  that will enable your political leaders to present their  political problems and peacefully find the most favorable  solutions for the youth of this country.    I also call on the national mediators, the political  parties,  and the general staff of the Congolese Armed Forces, the joint  staff of the security forces to agree on the conditions, the  modalities, and programs for training, organizing, educating,  and assessing all our unemployed youth who interrupted their  studies or were illegally recruited as private militiamen. It  is only under these conditions that the people who have been  traumatized by so much atrocity can be reassured. This must  necessarily be accompanied by the streamlining of the Armed  Forces, and the restoration of confidence and discipline within  the Army. There should also be more solidarity between the  Congolese Armed Forces, the gendarmerie, and public security  agencies. The reorganization of the Armed Forces [words  indistinct].

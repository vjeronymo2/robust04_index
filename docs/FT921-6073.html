			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Adam jumps to Pounds 0.72m ADAM &amp; Co, the privately-owned Edinburgh-based bank which serves high net worth individuals, went against the trend of the big UK banks by producing record pre-tax profits of Pounds 722,000 in the six months to December 31 1991, compared with Pounds 221,000 last time. The bank is to pay its first interim dividend amounting to 1 per cent. Mr James Laurenson, the managing director, pointed out that 1990 had been depressed by a Pounds 236,000 loss on sterling futures. 'Even if you add that Pounds 236,000 back in, the increase in net profit is still 58 per cent,' he said. The good result, he said, was because the bank Co was small and 'thus in a good position to control all its activities.' Net interest income was Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.3m) and non-interest income from the bank's services was Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.5m), with non-interest income continuing to account for more than half operating income.</p>

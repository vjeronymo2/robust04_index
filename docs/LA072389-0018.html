			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MESSAGE OF 'DO THE RIGHT THING'  </P> <P> The most important lesson to be learned from "Do the Right Thing" is that we  are all globally linked. If we don't realize we are all in this together, the  world will continue its rapid decay.  </P> <P> In 50 years the Earth has become polluted almost beyond the point of saving,  and we the public have to raise our voices as one and demand the end to the  corruption in government and, most importantly, an end to the destruction of  the environment.  </P> <P> To ignore these facts is certain to put an end to life. Wake up and do the  right thing!  </P> <P> DAVID STEENSLAND  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P></p>

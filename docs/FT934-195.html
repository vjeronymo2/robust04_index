			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: LWT/Granada Up to the first closing date of Granada's bid Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's chairman, has done little more than talk a good fight. The much-rumoured defensive alliances have not yet materialised, perhaps because shareholders would spit out anything which tasted like a poisoned pill. LWT's strongest argument - that its fancy media rating might be swamped by Granada's sprawl  -may not be enough to save it. Even given the current enthusiasm for the sector, there is a hefty bid premium in LWT's share price. Shareholders eventually may be tempted to accept the offer rather than risk allowing their windfall profits to slip away. LWT will have to come up with something more solid if it is to get the decision.</p>

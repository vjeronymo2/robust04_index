			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Heated Debate Over Helsinki's </F> Representatives at European Summit Meetings: Goal of EU  Membership Triggers Debate Over the Constitution -- Those  Favoring Membership Still Ahead"]    [Text] Helsinki, 23 May -- Prior to its planned entry into  the European Union [EU], Finland is experiencing intense debate  over the future distribution of power between the president and  the government within the new framework. At issue specifically  is whether Finland should be represented by its head of state or  by its prime minister as the top official at EU summit meetings.    According to the wording of the Constitution the president,  since March of this year Martti Ahtisaari, has the right and the  authority to represent Finland in foreign policy matters. This  authority was utilized to the fullest extent by Urho Kekkonen,  head of state from 1956 to 1981, particularly in the area of  ostpolitik. In contrast his successor, Mauno Koivisto, left such  policy matters up to the government.    A committee of experts has determined that both of these  models are provided for in the wording of the Constitution. The  transfer of decisionmaking powers to the government and the  parliament during Koivisto's term of office could take place  without requiring changes in the articles of the Constitution  because these articles are quite broadly formulated, thus  permitting some leeway.  <H5>  Prime Minister or President </H5>   Of course this determination does not answer the question of  whether Finland should conduct itself in keeping with the French  model (President Mitterrand actively participates in the summit  meetings) or in keeping with the model of the other member  states, whose prime ministers lead the delegations.    The committee of experts defines this situation as a legal  stalemate, of which the only thing that can definitely be said  is that it is "complicated": "Neither the president nor the  prime minister has the authority set forth in the Constitution  to commit Finland to specific EU decisions since the realm of  foreign policy belongs to the president, while domestic policy  guidelines are established by the prime minister -- and the  issues discussed at EU summit meetings typically contain both  foreign policy and domestic policy components."    Because it would run contrary to the interpretation of the  Constitution of the eighties and nineties to invest the head of  state with additional domestic policy authority, the committee  feels it would be best to charge the prime minister, currently  Esko Aho (Center), with the job of representing Finland at EU  summit meetings. The prerequisite would be that the president  would transfer at least part of his foreign policy authority to  the head of government and to individual ministers, as is  already widely the case based on Koivisto's practice.    Of course, the opinion of the experts would not exclude the  president from appearing in specific cases in the summit round,  for example in debate over issues that are of central importance  to Finland's foreign and security policy. With the  recommendation that the decision should be made on a  "case-by-case basis," the experts have lobbed the problem ball  back into the court of the politicians.    As a "golden bridge" they suggest that the president should  regularly participate in the meetings of the governmental  committee on foreign affairs; it would then become a suitable  platform for the transfer of power to the government. To  emphasize parliament's role, it should receive a constant flow  of information regarding developments in the EU, both directly  and via its committees.    Ahtisaari has spoken out in favor of an expanded process in  which regular and confidential meetings would take place between  the president and the party chairmen, during which foreign  policy guidelines could be agreed upon. As Ahtisaari notes, this  model has proven successful in Sweden. The committee does not  like it, however. The proposed body could too easily begin to  compete with the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs,  thereby working against the desired strengthening of the  parliament in the political process.  <H5>  The Date for the Referendum Has Not Been Set </H5>   In principle, Ahtisaari has let it be known that he plans to  follow the Koivisto line of noninterference in the affairs of  the government, including foreign policy. Still, as a former  diplomat he has a taste for international involvement, as he  demonstrated most recently during an official visit to Russia,  when he assured Boris Yeltsin that Finnish membership in the EU  would serve to strengthen rather than weaken economic relations  between the two countries.    At the same time Ahtisaari recommended that Moscow initiate  a  complete withdrawal of Russian military units from Estonia, as  this would exert a "stabilizing influence" on the Baltic region.  Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev reacted promptly with  the remark that there was "no need" for a Finnish mediator in  the discussions with Estonia, which, in fact, Ahtisaari had not  proposed. Nevertheless the Finnish president maintains that his  country will assume a cautiously active role on this issue.    Whether or not Finland will become a member of the EU, as  Ahtisaari recommends, will be decided in a referendum, to be  held on a date in the fall that has not yet been set. Although  the referendum is not directly binding, the parliament may  orient itself based upon the results. A yes to membership is  probable in the referendum, but not certain. According to the  results of the most recent poll, conducted on behalf of the  industrial associations, 40 percent are in favor of EU  membership, 37 percent are opposed, and the remainder are  undecided. In a similar poll taken in the fall of last year,  those opposed to membership were in the majority with 41  percent, while 39 percent were in favor of membership.</p>

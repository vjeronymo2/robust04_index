			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / US rivals clash over telecoms deal with PLO Two US telecommunications giants both claimed this week they had clinched exclusive agreements with Palestinian officials to provide phone services in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in a sign of disarray within Mr Yassir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation, which has taken over administration of the areas. MCI said it had signed a contractual agreement with Patelco, a private company implementing an exclusive 25-year telecommunications concession for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, to provide international telephone network capacity. Mr Lawrence Kodacovi, senior vice-president of MCI, said Bezek, the Israeli telecommunications company, had transferred the telecoms network to Patelco in a ceremony on Tuesday attended by Mr Arafat. But Palestinian officials based in Tunis said Mr Arafat was to announce an AT&amp;T deal to develop a telecommunications nework in the same area, in an agreement timed to coincide with the visit of President Clinton to the region. Both American companies are insistent their agreements will give them exclusive rights to the Palestinian telecoms market. Patelco would run and operate the telecommunications system in all Palestinian areas, Mr Kodacovi said, and MCI would provide the network capacity to link the Palestinian areas with the rest of the world. The agreements were negotiated without public bidding or monitoring by international consultants. The confusion between the rival accords reflects a scramble for contracts among senior PLO officials, and underlines concerns voiced by the US and international donors about the need for more transparency in awarding commercial contracts. The principal shareholder in Patelco is International Technologies Integration, a small American telecom consultancy owned by a Lebanese engineer, which has joint ventures with MCI in Lebanon, Syria and Kuwait. According to a contract seen by the Financial Times, ITI last October won a 25-year concession signed by Mr Arafat exclusively to build, operate and exploit the domestic and international communications network in the West Bank and Gaza. But a rival group of PLO officials based in Tunis said they had signed an agreement with AT&amp;T Network Systems International, a subsidiary of AT&amp;T based in the Netherlands, to 'help develop and modernise the telecom network in the territories' under control of the Palestinian Authority. Mr Maher El Kurd, a senior PLO official in the office of Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, chairman of Pecdar, the Palestinian institution charged with monitoring and planning public-sector investments, said the AT&amp;T agreement 'will lead to an arrangement under which AT&amp;T will build, operate and transfer a complete network to the Palestinian Authority to support 225,000 subscribers'. Mr Cees Steijger, head of corporate communications at AT&amp;T Network Systems, said the 'co-operation agreement' would lead to a contract and AT&amp;T and the Palestinian Authority would work together to set up feasibility plans to develop the project. AT&amp;T is now reviewing financing options requiring several hundred millions of dollars. According to Mr Steijger, AT&amp;T's agreement will include operating the international network, which is what MCI says its own agreement with Patelco stipulates. A senior western diplomat said Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, had written to Mr Arafat expressing his concern over the award of the telecoms contract, and asking Mr Arafat to institute a process of open public bidding. The rival agreement by AT&amp;T raises the stakes in the battle over the telecoms contract and will fuel further controversy. ITI says the contract it has, and the agreement with MCI, are irreversible; it had started on implementation of a multi-year expansion plan worth Dollars 140m with more than Dollars 30m of improvements in the first year alone. Mr Pierre Rizk, a Paris-based businessman who has been a key negotiator of the ITI deal, insisted this week that the rivalry between the two US companies was now over and that the inter-national telephone business would go exclusively to MCI. Mr Rizk denies any financial interest in any of the companies involved. Mr Rizk said the transfer from Bezek to Patelco meant that last October's 25-year concession to ITI 'was legally binding on Israel, the Palestinian Authority and all the telecommunications companies worldwide'. Patelco had now bought the transmission equipment, existing switches, cables, carriers and network remodes from Bezek. Bezek refused to comment. Mr Rizk confirmed there had been US pressure on the Palestinian Authority about the award of the contract but said it was a private business matter which should not concern Washington as the deal involved no foreign aid. AT&amp;T's Mr Steijger said he was surprised by MCI's announcement this week. 'I don't know what to make of it,' he said. 'But the US government policy as given to us for American companies doing business in the Palestinian territories lays down two principles: accountability and transparency, and the vehicle for implementing these two principles is Pecdar.'</p>

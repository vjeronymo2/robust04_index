			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Car sales figures expected to be low FIGURES for last month's sales of new cars, to be published today, are expected to show that registrations were virtually unchanged from a year ago at about 370,000, Kevin Done writes. The result is a serious setback for the motor industry, which had hoped that August would mark the beginning of the long-awaited recovery in demand for new cars. Most leading carmakers had earlier forecast sales in August of about 400,000 and the industry now faces a serious problem of excess stocks. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, the leader of the UK new-car market, said that sales for the full year were now forecast to total no more than 1.55m. This would be a 2.5 per cent fall from last year's already very depressed level of 1.59m and would be a 33 per cent fall from the peak level of 2.3m reached in 1989.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Talk show host/singer Dinah Shore landed a "scoop" while taping an interview  with "Jeopardy!" host Alex Trebek this week. When Shore remarked that Trebek  was one of TV's most eligible bachelors, he broke the news that "I am going to  be married ... and this is the first time I've said it out loud." His intended  is Jean Currivan, a commercial real-estate agent in Los Angeles. Trebek's  office confirmed Thursday that a wedding is planned, but said no date has been  set. Shore was taping the show here for later airing on "A Conversation With  Dinah," her new series on TNN cable. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

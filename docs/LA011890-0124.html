			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY DOUBTS OAT BRAN'S CHOLESTEROL-CUTTING EFFECT  </P> <P> Oat bran, much ballyhooed as a cholesterol-fighting food, appears to have  little specific cholesterol-lowering effect in people with normal cholesterol  levels, researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women's  Hospital in Boston reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> The researchers found that large amounts of high-fiber oat bran are no more  effective in a cholesterol-lowering diet than low-fiber refined wheat. This  suggests that people's cholesterol levels are lowered not by any unique  property of oat bran but simply because people eat less fatty food when they  are full with carbohydrates.  </P> <P> Moreover, a wide variety of starchy carbohydrates, ranging from cereals to  rice, potatoes, bread, beans, pasta, fruits and vegetables, could be equally  effective, the findings suggest. Previously, oat bran, because of its fiber  content, was believed to have direct cholesterol-lowering properties.  </P> <P> "There is nothing special about oat bran," said Dr. Frank Sacks, an assistant  professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School and the leader of the  research team. "It is like any other cereal product that does not have any  cholesterol or saturated fat in it."  </P> <P> Oat bran consumption has taken off in recent years after promising preliminary  studies, heavy promotion by cereal manufacturers and a general public health  emphasis on cholesterol reduction as a way to prevent heart disease.  </P> <P> Oat bran products have been the fastest-growing segment of the $6.5-billion  cereal industry. In 1989 alone, 218 new oat bran products were launched,  including cookies, cereals, pretzels and muffins.  </P> <P> The new study is likely to dampen this enthusiasm.  </P> <P> In an editorial for the medical journal, Dr. William E. Connor of the Oregon  Health Sciences University in Portland wrote: "Clearly, people who eat large  quantities of oat bran or other similar cereals for breakfast have little room  for bacon and eggs, and that may all be to the good." Connor called the  research "superbly conducted."  </P> <P> Sacks, Connor and other nutrition experts said that fundamental dietary  changes, not magic bullets such as oat bran, remain the best way to control  cholesterol. Such changes include reducing consumption of cholesterol and the  saturated fats found in such foods as meat, pork and butter and replacing them  with a variety of starchy carbohydrates.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, substantial interest in the potential cholesterol-lowering role  of dietary fiber will continue.  </P> <P> For example, Dr. Larry P. Bell of the Hennepin County Medical Center in  Minneapolis and other researchers have shown that psyllium, a fiber that is the  active ingredient in several bulk-forming laxatives, appears to have  cholesterol-lowering effects when taken in significant amounts -- two to three  teaspoons a day.  </P> <P> And after reviewing the new study, Bell and another nutrition expert, Dr. Edwin  L. Bierman of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, noted  that the study did not examine people with high cholesterol levels. These  researchers believe that large amounts of oat bran may still have direct  cholesterol-lowering effects in people with high cholesterol levels -- a  possibility that Sacks and his colleagues said was unlikely.  </P> <P> But Bierman, who served as vice chairman of a National Research Council  committee that issued a massive report in 1989 on diet and health, and other  physicians not connected with the study also praised the Boston researchers for  placing oat bran in perspective.  </P> <P> Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt, director of cardiology at Johns Hopkins and the  president of the American Heart Assn., said the message "before, during and  after the oat bran craze is always the same: It is the whole diet (that  determines cholesterol levels). It is the overall choices that you do and do  not make."  </P> <P> Dr. Rodman D. Starke, a heart association senior vice president, said the  organization is "not convinced that there is satisfying scientific data  supporting significant cholesterol reductions through oat bran-containing  foods."  </P> <P> The Boston study involved 20 healthy adults -- four men and 16 women -- who  were dietitians or other hospital employees. The researchers said it was more  carefully conducted and less prone to error than previous oat bran research  that suggested a direct cholesterol-lowering effect. Many of these studies,  they said, lacked appropriate control groups or the participants were told what  diet supplements they were receiving, possibly influencing the results.  </P> <P> While continuing on their usual diets, the participants ate diet supplements  containing either 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of oat bran or low-fiber wheat for  separate, six-week periods. This was the equivalent of five high-fiber oat bran  muffins or five low-fiber refined wheat muffins a day. Their complete dietary  intake, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and diet-related symptoms were  closely monitored.  </P> <P> To avoid bias, neither the researchers nor the participants were told which  supplement was prescribed when. All of the subjects took part in both the  high-fiber and low-fiber phases to "minimize non-specific effects" and the  effect of changes in the intake of foods other than oat bran and refined wheat.  </P> <P> The cholesterol levels of participants "decreased significantly from base line  during both the high-fiber and low-fiber dietary periods," according to the  report. The average decrease was 7.5% during the oat bran period and 7.1%  during the wheat period, indicating that the effects of the two food products  were virtually identical. These changes mirrored decreases in the consumption  of saturated fats and cholesterol, as subjects became full after consuming the  additional oat bran or wheat.  </P> <P> The researchers also found that oat bran did not lower blood pressure, another  of its reputed health benefits. The study was funded by the National Institutes  of Health, unlike much dietary fiber research, which has been sponsored by  cereal manufactures or pharmaceutical manufacturers.  </P> <P> Eighteen of the 20 subjects reported gastrointestinal side-effects while taking  the oat bran supplements, such as excess gas, cramps and diarrhea. By  comparison, only one subject experienced a gastrointestinal reaction --  constipation -- while taking the wheat supplements.  </P> <P> This led the researchers to conclude that while people could "benefit from  diets that are rich in oat bran if their dietary fat intake decreases to  compensate for the calories of the oat bran . . . low-fiber products can  achieve the same result with fewer gastrointestinal side-effects."  </P> <P> Although people with high cholesterol levels were not studied, Sacks said there  "is really no precedent" for a dietary factor or drug to be effective in such  individuals if no significant reduction was seen in patients with normal  cholesterol levels. But Sacks and other nutrition experts said it was important  to study people with high cholesterol levels before this conclusion could be  reached with certainty.  </P> <P> Sacks also said there was "no question" that certain water-soluble fibers, such  as fruit pectin, certain gums and "probably" psyllium, are effective  cholesterol-lowering agents. But he cautioned that relatively large amounts of  the fibers must to be taken, that products such as gums may not be palatable  and that potential side-effects, such as the laxative effects of psyllium, need  to be considered.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Linda Roach Monroe in San Antonio and Maria L.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- About 3,000 South African  Defence Force [SADF] soldiers would have been deployed in  Natal/kwaZulu by Friday, SADF spokesman Cmdt Braam van Wyk said  on Thursday [7 April]. He said the arrival on Wednesday of about  700 more troops from 8 division would increase the SADF's  operational strength in the province to about 3,000 once they  had been fully deployed.    About 1,000 more troops had been called up from April 15 to  May 15 for the period of the elections. These were citizen force  members who would be deployed in "normal security functions".    Of the five companies of troops which arrived in the  province  on Wednesday, four were being deployed in northern Natal and the  other around Durban to promote stability. "In northern Natal  they will be deployed in the Eshowe area," he said.</p>

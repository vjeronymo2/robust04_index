			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kunming, March 4 (CNS)--Participants attending the  second session of the 7th Yunnan People's Political Consultative  Confrence warned that a sharp drop in arable land resulting from  serious soil erosion would have disastrous consequences.    Yunnan, a highland province with arable land making up a  mere  7.5 percent of its entire area, has few effective water  conservancy works while the land under cultivation is so weak  that its productivity is far lower than the average across the  country. Soil erosion is growing more serious because of  frequent natural disasters such as drought, water-logging,  flooding, earthquakes and mudslides with the living conditions  in some areas being in jeopardy. Land under cultivation is  still in decline as incomplete statistics show that the area of  paddy fields were reduced by 149,300 mu in 1993 compared with  the area in 1985.    The use of land in the province is not yet under proper  administration and some counties and cities have rushed to make  use of arable land for the establishment of development zones  without undertaking prior fasibility studies. The participants  at the conference pointed out that damage to the ecological  environment and land would result in waste and lead to a  disastrous outcome. They called for greater awareness of the  need for environmental protection in the province while at the  same time asking for the drawing up of measures for the  protection of land for proper use.    Director of the Yunnan Institute of Economics Mr. Hu  Tongyuan  suggested that a dramatic adjustment of the agricultural pattern  should take place. Ecological-safe agriculture,  commerce-oriented farming and agriculture for the earning of  foreign exchange should be painstakingly undertaken. Modern  agriculture should be developed with a wider scope covering  farming, forestry, animal husbandy and breeding together with  comprehensive exploitation of the processing industry. The area  under cultivation needs to be maintained in order to ensure a  certain amount of agricultural output while few breakthroughs  could be seen as far as science and technology were concerned in  the improvement of farming conditions while at the same time  demands for grains for consumption continued to grow steadily.</p>

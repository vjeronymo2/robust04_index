			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYRIA'S LEADER STAYING LONGER IN TEHRAN;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: ASSAD APPARENTLY IS TRYING TO GET IRAN TO TAKE A TOUGHER LINE  AGAINST IRAQ.  </P> <P> Syrian President Hafez Assad, who is believed to be trying to persuade Iran to  take a harder line against Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis, has extended his  visit to Tehran into a fourth day, the Iranian news agency reported Monday.  </P> <P> No details of Assad's talks with Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani have been  disclosed, but his visit was extended "due to the importance of the issues  under discussion and the need to complete consultations," the Islamic Republic  News Agency said.  </P> <P> The Syrian leader, Iran's key Arab ally and a rival of Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein, met for talks in Damascus with Secretary of State James A. Baker III  earlier this month. The United States has voiced increasing concern that Iran  may not abide by the U.N.-sponsored trade embargo on Iraq.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Rafsanjani, at a banquet for Assad, again rejected a suggestion by  Baker that a regional security structure be considered to keep Hussein in check  after the current crisis is resolved, calling it an "arrogant scheme." Iran has  interpreted Baker's suggestion as an attempt by Western powers to keep a  long-term foothold in the oil-producing area.  </P> <P> "We should not allow foreign forces and the hegemonist powers, who are all  geared up to tighten their grip on vital oil resources, the Persian Gulf and  the Red Sea, to remain in the region," the Iranian news agency quoted  Rafsanjani as saying.  </P> <P> Syria, which has sent 4,000 troops to Saudi Arabia and pledged to send a full  armored division of up to 15,000 additional troops, also insists that the  American-dominated Western forces must leave the region when the crisis is  resolved. Both Syria and Iran have demanded an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> The Iranian media have reflected political divisions within the country, with  radical-line newspapers focusing on the emotive issue of the deployment of  Western troops in Saudi Arabia, the site of Islam's holy cities of Mecca and  Medina. On the other hand, Tehran Radio, controlled by the brother of the  centrist president, who favors improved ties with the West, sees a positive  aspect to the Syrian presence there.  </P> <P> "Syria," a Tehran Radio commentary said, "believes that by sending a few  military units to Saudi Arabia to confront the Iraqi incursion, it is possible  to prevent the expansion of the U.S.-led Western influence in the region."  </P> <P> As Assad continued his talks in Tehran, leaders of exiled Iraqi opposition  groups gathered in Damascus on Monday, underlining the Syrian opposition to  Hussein. They included religious, Communist and Kurdish groups that claimed to  have wide support among Iraqis living abroad.  </P> <P> "We believe there is a golden opportunity now, and all opposition groups agreed  we should postpone the discussion of ideological differences to agree on the  toppling of the Saddam regime," said Mohammed Taqi al Mudarresi, religious  leader of the Islamic Action Organization. He said the groups will establish a  government in exile.  </P> <P> Damascus-based diplomats said last week that the groups had little influence  and no affinity except opposition to Hussein. The mainline Kurdish  organizations would not take part in the Damascus conference, one diplomat  said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Iran announced Monday that it has arrested 29 people for trying to  smuggle food to Iraq, the Iranian news agency also reported. It was the first  action reported by Iran to enforce the U.N. embargo.  </P> <P> The news agency said two groups of smugglers were handed over Sunday to the  revolutionary court in Sanandaj, a Kurdish city 50 miles from the Iraqi border.  The food seized included rice, flour, sugar, vegetable oil and milk.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 19 May -- "We shall act decisively and  consistently in the defense of the territorial integrity of  Ukraine. We shall act within the bounds of the Constitution, of  our powers, precisely proceeding from the fact that the Crimea  is a component part of Ukraine, as registered in the  constitutions of our state and the Republic of Crimea." This  was stated by President Leonid Kravchuk at a press conference  today.    He dwelt on the latest events in the Crimea when the Supreme  Soviet of this autonomous republic intends to examine the issue  of restoring a number of clauses of the Crimea's Constitution in  the edition of 6 May 1992. In particular, this relates to the  inclusion of the Crimea in the composition of Ukraine, to dual  citizenship, the setting up of military formations and others.  "If the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea adopts these documents, I  shall immediately submit to the parliament of the Ukraine a  draft decision on suspending their effect," the President said.    "Solving these issues is exclusively within the competence  of  the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine," Leonid Kravchuk stressed.  Ignoring this fundamental situation registered in the law "On  Demarcation of Powers Between the Bodies of State Power of  Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea," is fraught with serious  consequences for those who set foot on that path.    "For each society, for each state, there is a pale beyond  which no one is allowed to step," the president pointed out.  Those who ignore this, those who are guided by ambitions and by  other principles, should remember that their actions are  unlawful. They should know that such actions, will primarily  have an effect on the entire population of the Crimea. Those  who, ignoring the existing legislation and international legal  norms, cause the situation to heat up, will have to answer for  this. No one will evade the responsibility, regardless of what  high regalia and powers he might be in cooperation with, the  head of the Ukrainian state stressed.</p>

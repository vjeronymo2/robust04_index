			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marcos Chagas from Cartagena, Colombia] </F>   [Text] Four more countries may join the Common Market of  the South, Mercosur, which currently consists of Brazil,  Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.    On 15 July Amorim will attend a meeting in Argentina to  evaluate the Chilean and Bolivian petitions to join Mercosur.  Commenting in Cartagena on the Mercosur integration process,  Amorim said:    [Begin Amorim recording] We regard as very positive the  interest expressed by Bolivia and Chile in joining Mercosur as  associates. We believe all this will strengthen Mercosur by  opening up new trade prospects, and will also be instrumental in  attracting other countries to endorse President Itamar Franco's  proposal to create a South American Free Trade Area. In sum, I  believe all this will be regarded as something very positive.  [end recording]    Amorim added that much progress has been made in the talks  with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela on their also  taking part in Mercosur.</p>

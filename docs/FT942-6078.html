			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dasa plans missile and satellite joint ventures with Aerospatiale Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace arm of the German Daimler-Benz group, and Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace operation, intend to form two joint ventures - one to build guided missiles and the other to build satellites. Munich-based Dasa said yesterday that talks with the French company over the terms of the joint ventures had reached an advanced stage and it was likely the new companies would be formed from January 1 next year. The statement from the German company explained that Dasa and Aerospatiale had worked together in the guided missile area for decades, and that a formal joint venture was the best way of co-operating further. The same argument applied to satellite technology, Dasa said. The joint ventures are likely to be structured around two holding companies, one for guided missiles which will be established in Paris and a satellite company in Germany. Each of the holding companies will be parent to a German and a French subsidiary, which will divide the work equally between themselves. Both Aerospatiale and Dasa plan to concentrate all their activities in these business areas within the new holding companies. Dasa and Aerospatiale already operate Eurocopter, a helicopter joint venture. The news that the negotiations are at an advanced stage follows comments made by Mr Louis Gallois, the French group's chairman, earlier this month. He said that joint ventures were planned as part of the Aerospatiale's strategy of returning to profitability. Aerospatiale, like other companies in the sector, has suffered from the downturn in both defence and commercial activities. 'We need to achieve a much deeper integration of our European defence industries to compete with the US, where consolidation is taking place at a very rapid pace,' Mr Gallois said.</p>

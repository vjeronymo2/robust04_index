			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Calm returned to Abeche, the capital of the Ouaddai  Region, today. The inhabitants of Abeche woke up yesterday to  sustained weapons fire. Some elements of the Chadian National  Front [FNT] attacked the military garrison and the Gendarmerie.  This attack left 29 dead among the attackers and two among the  government forces. Defense Minister Mamadou Regui immediately  went to the site. For the moment, the situation is under  control, and the people have resumed their normal activities, as  the minister of defense explained in a statement this afternoon  in Abeche. Here, Minister Mamadou Regui speaks to our special  correspondent Solomon Ngartha.    [Begin Regui recording] Soon after our arrival, (?we noticed  that) the situation was quite alarming. We saw some fighting.  We saw dead bodies almost everywhere in the town, and we still  heard shooting here and there.    After the agreement, the elements of the FNT gathered here  in  Abeche. They numbered about 400. They were waiting to be  absorbed into the army, but unfortunately there were some  constraints here and there [words indistinct] that they were  deceived by some individuals--by people who have left the other  fronts to come to Abeche and some accomplices in the town of  Abeche. These elements mutinied and broke into the storerooms  here and looted more than 400 weapons, took ammunition, and  began the attack. After some hours of intensive fighting, the  Chadian National Army got control of the situation. When we  arrived here, the town was already under the full control of our  elements. The survivors managed to flee in many directions.  Searches are currently going on. Our troops are all over the  place. We have organized searches in the town of Abeche,  but--as you know--the town is very big. It is the Gendarmerie  that is carrying out this search. These elements, it is said,  infiltrate [words indistinct] by midnight, we saw some elements  who were stealing and who broke into people's homes here and  there to steal.    Since this morning, the situation has been calm. The town  has begun to come back to life. Shops have opened. It is true  that it not all the shops, but there are traders who have  already opened the doors of their shops and have begun working.  The town is quite lively. I have met with some traders. I  have met with traditional chiefs and village chiefs and unit  heads. We discussed many issues and I told them that their  security is guaranteed. I personally engaged myself to search  for these [words indistinct] in the Army and in the Gendarmerie.  We have seen some elements who are currently under (?detention)  and who will be brought before court.    Concerning the FNT elements who are in flight, I mean those  in flight who are hiding somewhere in the town or are very far  away in the bush, I still extend to them a hand of  reconciliation. They must surrender. Their security will be  guaranteed because the agreement is still valid provided they  return. I think that they have heard the appeal by their  leader, the chief of staff, (Dawuud), who was with us today. He  launched an appeal. He has asked them to return. Well, if they  return, their lives are guaranteed and we will take all the  measures necessary to have them brought into the Army, have them  organized, and [words indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

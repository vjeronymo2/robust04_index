			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (10): Spectre of the rusting town - Steel Industry In Kamaishi, on the northern coast of Japan, steelmakers can see the future they fear. The town, site of the country's first blast furnace for pig iron, began rusting two decades ago when Nippon Steel announced a restructuring that meant job losses and a gradual reduction in steel output. The Japanese government predicts that Kamaishi's population will be halved from the present 50,820 by the year 2010, and Kamaishi Shinkin Bank, the local bank, collapsed earlier this year under bad loans equivalent to about 60 per cent of its total loans outstanding. Steelworkers in the town have turned to mushroom growing and the building materials industry, but they are struggling against the general downturn in the economy. The same is true for the Nippon Steel Kamaishi rugby team, the country's strongest side during the 1970s, which has slowly slipped down the national ladder. Japan's steelmakers are concerned that they and the communities which depend on the industry for survival are facing not just recession, but a Kamaishi-like decline. Mr Takashi Imai, Nippon Steel's president, said his company would have to change the structure of its management and workforce to ward off the rust. He suggests that Japan faces an unemployment problem similar to that of the US, where jobs lost in manufacturing where not soaked up by the service sector. In the case of steelmakers, he says, traditional customers such as automotive and consumer electronics companies are selling to a mature domestic market after four decades of expansion. 'We are looking for some other industries that will replace these industries as a source of demand, but we haven't been able to find them,' Mr Imai said. Steel companies can see their own diversification policies reflected in the Kamaishi government's unsuccessful attempts to create new industries. There was a plan for a marine theme park, and former steel workers now make office furniture, but the town is still losing younger workers to neighbouring regions and the main shopping centre is dotted with permanently shuttered shops. The Japanese steel industry was inspired to diversify after the Plaza Accord in 1985 led to a rapid appreciation of the yen and a slowing of domestic demand. Steel production fell from 105m tonnes in 1985 to 98m tonnes a year later, and the leading makers slipped into the red during 1987. Companies began to cut their workforces and expand into new business areas, in particular, computers and semiconductors, which were seen as the 'industrial rice' of the future. The shift was thought appropriate because steel companies have traditionally seen themselves as the suppliers of Japan's industrial staple. But the speculative excess of the late 1980s led the steel industry off course. The workforce cuts slowed when domestic demand for steel bounced back to 105.6m tonnes in 1988, and the country became more concerned about a longer-term labour shortage than a short-term surplus of workers. The cheap capital of that era, when money was easily raised through new issues of equity or equity-linked bonds, fuelled the industry's many diversifications, some of which were unwise. Sales projections were calculated when stock prices were climbing relentlessly and the Japanese economy was expanding at annual rate of 7 per cent. Steel companies are feeling the cost of those miscalculations. In the first half to September, the five leading makers had pre-tax losses, including Y16.7bn at Nippon Steel and Y15.4bn at NKK, which both reported profits last year. The losses would have been more embarrassing if the companies had not reaped profits from the sale of equities. For the full year to March, the leading five companies, which tend to move as a caravan in and out of loss, are expecting combined losses of about Y60bn, although Japanese steel industry specialists say the figure would be Y200bn, if the benefits of accounting changes and profits on securities sales were not counted. The pressures to discard loss-making diversification projects are obvious, but the companies are still determined to restructure without dismissing workers. Sumitomo Metal Industries, which had an interim loss of Y9bn, said the change in market conditions had forced a broad review. 'As for the electronics, new materials and biomedical divisions, efforts shall be concentrated on examining profitability in each field and in identifying where profits can be improved as quickly as possible,' Sumitomo said. Each of the companies concede that demand will remain weak into next year, with some growth expected in public works construction which has been undermined in recent months by political scandals. Local governments have delayed project awards, fearing that the successful company may be implicated in the scandal, but they will eventually have to make a decision. Steel companies are also hoping that demand from China will strengthen in coming months. Kobe Steel noted in its summary of the first half, when it lost Y8.1bn, that exports to China early in the year had 'increased remarkably'. Japanese steelmakers have co-operatively shared the profits of China demand, just as they collectively negotiate prices for imported materials. But the present downturn has raised the question of whether the 'restructuring' described by Mr Imai will also mean an end to the very cosy relationship among the leading five companies. Nippon Steel has been criticised in the past for not exploiting the advantages of its size and expertise, and being as concerned to represent the industry's interests as much as its own. The next year will be a test of the company's will, and a measure of the relative importance of its shareholders and its industry friendships.  -----------------------------------      Crude steel production       (millions of tonnes)  ----------------------------------- 1985              105.3 1986               98.3 1987               98.5 1988              105.7 1989              107.9 1990              110.3 1991              109.7 1992               98.1  ----------------------------------- Source: Yamaichi Research Institute  -----------------------------------</p>

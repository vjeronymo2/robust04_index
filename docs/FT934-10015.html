			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / People: Boulton &amp; Paul Sir Derek Alun-Jones, who was chairman and chief executive of Ferranti International from 1975 to 1989, has been appointed to the new post of non-executive chairman at Boulton &amp; Paul, the leading UK joinery manufacturer. The appointment, which takes effect immediately, is a coup for Boulton &amp; Paul, which was purchased from BET in February in a Pounds 14.5m management buy-out. David Chenery, Boulton &amp; Paul's chief executive, said: 'We know our customers pretty well but what we wanted was to add another dimension. Working with Sir Derek, we can capitalise on the progress we have made to date and prepare for a possible flotation of the business three to four years hence.'</p>

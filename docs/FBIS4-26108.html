			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter returned here from Pyongyang via the truce village  of Panmunjom this morning after a four-day visit to the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) during which he  held talks with President Kim Il-song on resolving the nuclear  issue.    Carter is expected to brief South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam on the results of his two rounds of talks with the DPRK  leader.    During their second round of talks in Pyongyang on Friday,  Carter told Kim that the U.S. had suspended its moves to apply  sanctions against the DPRK, while Kim declared that he had  authorized a joint search for Americans missing in action (MIA)  from the 1950-1953 Korean War.    The news appeared to signal a breakthrough in the nuclear  crisis on the Korean peninsula, with Carter describing the MIA  initiative as a "good omen for the future."    "I would like to inform you that they have stopped the  sanctions activity in the United Nations," Carter told Kim at  their talks.    The former U.S. President also said that Washington had  "provisionally agreed" to hold a third round of high-level talks  with Pyongyang, and added that he was passing on the message  after consultations with the White House.    U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Thursday that his  country  would resume high-level talks with the DPRK if signals from  Pyongyang indicated that it was willing to freeze its nuclear  program.    The U.S. and the DPRK held two rounds of high-level talks on  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in June and July last  year. The third round of talks, which was scheduled for March 21  this year, was cancelled because of differences between the two  sides.    Kim told Carter during their first round of talks on  Thursday  that two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) would be allowed to remain in the DPRK rather than be  expelled, a gesture of conciliation in Pyongyang's nuclear row  with Washington and its allies.    Carter passed through the heavily-fortified border village  of  Panmunjom on Wednesday on his way to Pyongyang after meeting  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, Deputy Prime Minister and  National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku, and  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu during a three-day visit to Seoul.    He said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula would  be a private one. "My hope is to discuss some of the important  issues of the day with leaders in the area," he explained.    Recently the U.S., after consultations with South Korea and  Japan, drafted a resolution calling for United Nations sanctions  against the DPRK when it banned IAEA inspectors from testing  samples of nuclear fuel to determine whether it had been  diverted secretly to make atomic weapons.    Pyongyang warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to  accept inspections would be regarded as a declaration of war,  while insisting that its nuclear program was entirely peaceful.    On Monday, the DPRK announced that it was withdrawing  immediately from the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog,  and would accept no more inspections of its nuclear program, in  retaliation for the agency's own sanctions resolution against  Pyongyang. The resolution provided for an immediate halt to  IAEA technical assistance to the DPRK totaling 250,000 U.S.  dollars a year.    Before meeting president Kim Yong-sam here today, Carter  will  meet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to discuss the steps that  Seoul and Washington can take to deal with the nuclear issue,  based on the outcome of his talks in Pyongyang, official sources  here say.    The former president is to meet the press here this  afternoon  before leaving for the United States.</p>

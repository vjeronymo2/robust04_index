			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Peter Rabl and </F> Hans Rauscher; place and date not given: "Brussels Will Make  Concessions on Tough Positions"]    [Text] [KURIER] We have actually less than one month for  the decisive negotiations with the European Union [EU]. Will we  achieve an acceptable agreement or will our entry be delayed?    [Vranitzky] Against the background of so many conflicting  reports, people tend to ignore one thing, namely that this is a  poker game. As in all poker-like negotiations, the parties  start out with their maximum demands, for example the European  Union's position contained in the agricultural paper is, of  course, an extreme position that could never become reality.    [KURIER] So you are sure that Brussels will make concessions  on some of the tough positions it confronted us with in the  spheres of agriculture and transit?    [Vranitzky] Yes. And I know that from my experience. Four  years ago, when we worked out the transit agreement, there were  many people in the European Union and also in Austria who said  that such an agreement is impossible -- while now we have such  an agreement. A few days ago, we could hear that a duration of  only three years could be conceded, while during the visit of  the German transport minister yesterday, the position sounds  different again.    [KURIER] If the European Union were to commit itself to  achieving a 60 percent reduction in exhausts, would we be ready  to compromise and not insist on the full duration of the transit  agreement?    [Vranitzky] We want to bring to fruit efforts that improve  the transport situation and the ecological situation.    [KURIER] But there are serious voices that ask whether the  transit agreement has really brought a significant reduction of  exhausts in Austria?    [Vranitzky] One effect is that trucks have been modernized.    [KURIER] But the second effect is also that foreign trucks  have increased their loads and forwarding agents are putting up  with higher fines.    [Vranitzky] We must not neglect the awareness that has also  increased in our neighboring countries. We have received  signals from Germany: Do not give up your position on the  transit agreement, because it is a model for other European  regions, too. After all, we must not forget East-West transit.    [KURIER] According to all recent surveys, people are taking  incredible interest in the European Union at the moment. The  point now should be to convince the population of the European  Union not only with facts, but also on the emotional level.  What is your answer to a primitive argument such as that  unemployment is much higher in the European Union than in  Austria, and that if we join, unemployment will go up here, as  well.    [Vranitzky] First, the reason that unemployment is lower in  Austria is that the quality of our products and the hard work of  our economy enable us to sell our products to these 12  countries. Second, these countries are continuously moving  closer together. So, if we remain outside, it is obvious that  our exports to the EU will become more and more difficult and,  thus, also the protection of our jobs. Third, even today we  suffer from being outside. These disadvantages would increase.    [KURIER] Industry has said it would leave the country unless  we join the European Union.    [Vranitzky] Not everybody will emigrate, but one has to take  such threats very seriously. I have always warned against  looking at the issue solely from the current point of view.  Between February and July 1994, no spectacular changes will  take place. Yet, what will we tell the workers and employees  five years from now, when many investments in industry will not  have taken place?    [KURIER] You have been criticized for the statement that  Austria is seeking EU membership without if's and but's.    [Vranitzky] My point was to document that this is a vital  issue for our country. Still, without if's and but's does not  mean giving up one's positions in the negotiations.    [KURIER] Another argument against is: The significant  economic decline in 1993, unemployment, farmers' demonstrations,  the job action in the German metal industry -- that is the  European Union; should we really join it?    [Vranitzky] Or even more strongly: The European Union cannot  solve the Yugoslavia crisis. Then there are the monetary  turbulences, the fall in stock exchange prices. Particularly  because a second Yugoslavia must be prevented, one has to  support the political network. Particularly because hundreds of  millions [no currency specified] have been lost, one needs to  coordinate monetary policy.    [KURIER] What would you tell the Austrians in a single  headline on the current situation in the EU discussion? A  one-sentence message.    [Vranitzky] That is not easy. What the opponents of the  European Union are trying to convince the people of is the  threatening loss of identity, the being mixed into an  all-European mash. Yet, the exact opposite is true;  particularly because we want to preserve our independence,  particularly because we want to maintain our character as a  small, efficient people at a sensible border line, we must not  remain isolated when others embark on a joint course. Brussels  headquarters has existed for 35 years. Yet, not a single  citizen of Wuppertal has turned into a Belgian.    [KURIER] Another argument brought forth by many is that  Germany dominates the European Union, and that accession would  be a second Anschluss.    [Vranitzky] In reality, we would become more dependent on  Germany if we remained outside.    [KURIER] We have another month. Can we do it or not?    [Vranitzky] You want an answer to be published in your  newspaper or a private answer?    [KURIER] First for the newspaper, and then a private one.    [Vranitzky] I am giving you one answer for both, and it is:  yes.</p>

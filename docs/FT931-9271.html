			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Kuwait holds up Opec deal on output KUWAIT'S resistance to making substantial cuts in oil production was last night holding up agreement by ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce output in the second quarter of the year and shore up oil prices. Other delegations at the Vienna meeting last night broadly accepted a Saudi Arabian proposal to cut Opec's second-quarter production by about 1m barrels a day from a first-quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d agreed in November. But Kuwait, pleading special dispensation to maximise oil earnings and pay for its post-Gulf war reconstruction, was resisting concerted pressure to agree to pro-rata output cuts. The Gulf state said it was unhappy with the level of cuts that fellow members believed it must make if the cartel was to satisfy the markets. A series of late night bilateral meetings appeared to have made little progress in the effort to persuade Kuwait to accept the position of most members. The Saudi formula would, if the cartel obeyed its own ceiling, take nearer to 1.5m b/d off the oil market, given that most estimates by the industry put Opec output for the present quarter at more than 25m b/d. To attain that, members would be expected to cut output from their claimed production levels at the time of the November meeting. At that point Kuwait was lifting about 1.5m b/d. The Gulf state, however, has insisted that it did not receive a quota as such in November and anyway should be regarded as a special case while it is repairing damage done by the war. Kuwait claims its present production to be about 1.98m b/d, which would rise to 2.1m b/d in the second quarter, and wants any cuts to be considered only from this level. Other delegations, and many industry specialists, believe a present Kuwaiti production figure of about 1.7m-1.8m b/d to be more credible. Some delegations, including Saudi Arabia, argue that Opec cannot deliver a credible output cut while allowing Kuwait such leeway. Patience has worn thin among other delegations for Kuwait's call for special treatment. 'Every country has got economic problems,' said one Nigerian delegate. Neither do many Opec countries want to set a precedent for special treatment with the prospect of Iraq's re-entry on to the oil market looming, albeit fairly distantly. Anything less than a unanimous agreement to cut production to somewhere near 23.5m b/d, and corresponding discipline in meeting the target, is likely to disappoint the markets. They have built Dollars 1.50-Dollars 2 into the price of crude before this weekend's meeting on the back of apparent consensus to cut at least 1m b/d from the November ceiling.</p>

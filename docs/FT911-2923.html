			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Batch of bad news upsets traders in German bonds NEWS that Mr Gorbachev had offered to resign from his position as head of the Communist party (the offer was rejected), coupled with poor German inflation data, led to some selling of German government bonds, traders said, although prices were virtually unchanged on the day. The cost of living in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, rose 0.5 per cent in the month to mid-April, giving a year-on-year rise of 2.6 per cent. Dealers said this was taken as a sign that nationwide inflation figures would show a similar increase. The lack of new federal government bond issues since the start of the year have helped to keep yield rises in check, but dealers are increasingly worried that there could be a new federal issue in early May which could depress the market still further. UK government bonds edged up, though traders said that in the absence of any important economic data the move was probably inspired by the US market. Attention in the gilts market is likely to focus on next week's local elections, and traders expect to see some upward pressure on yields over the next few days. TRADING in Japanese government bonds was dull ahead of the Golden Week holidays next week, although dealers warned that consumer prices index figures released today could provide the market with some indication of whether the Bank of Japan will ease its monetary policy. Hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate are receding, according to a national newspaper poll of analysts. Roughly one-third of those polled said they expect a cut during May, one-third between May and July, while one-third thought the cut would not come until after August. The yield on the benchmark No 129 bond was unchanged on the day in Tokyo at 6.74 per cent. US government bond prices firmed at the short end but weakened slightly at the long end yesterday as the market struggled to find a lead in the wake of a successful auction of five-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was down  3/16 at 96 1/32 , yielding 8.227 per cent, while the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/8 , to carry a yield of 6.915 per cent. Trading activity was reported to be light throughout the day. Although the announcement of another large rise in the number claiming state unemployment insurance perked up, the short end of the market, the injection of fresh supply left the long bond weaker, with dealers and investors paring positions to make room for the Dollars 9bn in notes sold at 1pm. With Fed funds trading below the Federal Reserve's target of 6 per cent, the Fed arranged overnight matched sales to drain liquidity from the banking system and push up the rate. In late trading, Fed funds had been squeezed back up to 6 per cent.</p>

"It was untrue. There would be no such replacement," he told  the press after the transfer of the post of ABRI's social and  political affairs chief of staff from Lieutenant General  Hariyoto P.S. to Major General R. Hartono.    He said that he has lately been questioned whether the ABRI  chief would be replaced.    "I should reiterate that there will be no such a  replacement," he said.    ANTARA sources said that the possibility of the ABRI chief  replacement was on stage following a speculation on the  retirement of the ABRI chief by the end of this year.    On the occasion the ABRI spokesman revealed that the  governor  of the National Defense Institute (Lemhanas) will be held by  Major General Muntojib, replacing Major General R. Hartono.    "Muntojib's post as ABRI's staff and command school (Sesko)  director will be transferred to Major General Theo Syafei, who  is now the Udayana regional military commander," he added.    He said that Brigadier General Adang Ruchiatna will take the  post to be left by Major General Theo Syafei.</p>

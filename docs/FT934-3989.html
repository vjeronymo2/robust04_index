			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Jakarta go-ahead for more Hawk aircraft Indonesia's air force has been given the official go-ahead to discuss buying 16 more Hawk aircraft from British Aerospace, foreign aviation officials say, Reuter reports from Jakarta. BAe won an Indonesian order in June for 24 Hawk trainers and ground-attack fighters worth about Pounds 500m. The first aircraft are due to be delivered in 1996. The officials said the air force, with some 80 combat aircraft, had been told by the government it could proceed with talks for more Hawks but it was not clear when negotiations would start. An air force spokesman confirmed the need for more aircraft. Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, Britain's chief of air staff, visited Jakarta last week for talks with military leaders. His visit came shortly after BAe said it might set up joint ventures with Indonesia on turboprop aircraft and cars. Indonesia's military chief, Gen Feisal Tanjung, confirmed in June the country planned to buy about 100 new warplanes over 25 years. US-designed aircraft, including F-16 Fighting Falcons, F-5E Tigers and A-4E Skyhawks, form the backbone of Indonesia's present air-combat capability.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Camdessus gambles on Russia's unlikely reformist: How and why the IMF chief made a Dollars 1.5bn deal with a prime minister whose instincts are conservative Mr Michel Camdessus is taking the biggest risk the director of the International Monetary Fund has ever taken. He is gambling on the ability of the Russian prime minister to keep the country on a reformist course. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin is a powerful premier. But he is also a man from state industry whose instincts have been those of control, subsidy and central planning. Has he really bitten the bullet of reform? Mr Chernomyrdin wanted a meeting with Mr Camdessus very much. At the end of last month, he turned for aid to Mr Peter Castenfelt, a wealthy financier who chairs blue chip companies in the UK and elsewhere and who has a company, Archipelago, which trades in Russia. His credibility with Mr Chernomyrdin rests on the fact that he knows Russian business from the inside. Mr Castenfelt knew Mr Camdessus and senior officials in the World Bank and undertook to take a message to them that the Russian prime minister wished to prove he was serious about reform. The message was delivered at the beginning of this month: once Mr Castenfelt told Mr Chernomyrdin that Mr Camdessus was receptive, an invitation was issued to him to come to Russia. He came as IMF officials, led by Mr Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, were bogged down in grinding, frustrating talks with Russian officials on the budget and on reform. These were talks that seemed to confirm the worst fears of many in the IMF that this was a government which could not manage the finances even if it wished to. Mr Camdessus began talks with Mr Chernomyrdin last Friday on a sour note, of the kind which had marred their previous efforts in Washington to come to an understanding. The Russian executive director of the IMF, Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky - one of the few remaining members of the original Gaidar team still in some sort of office - had given an interview to Reuters news agency expressing his belief that a deal would be done. This kind of public pressure, said Mr Camdessus, was not right: press relations must be better handled. The next day the two men disappeared on their own - to a hunting lodge at Zavidovo, were Mr Camdessus, no great sportsman, was introduced to the joys of the chase by the prime minister. (Richard Nixon had been similarly inducted by Mr Leonid Brezhnev at the same spot 20 years before.) At that meeting a mutual understanding began. However, in parallel discussions, the IMF staffers and the Russian officials were still far apart, and the estimations, especially from the Russian side, were pessimistic. After further talks on Sunday, Mr Camdessus and Mr Chernomyrdin planned to have a final session on Monday - a meeting billed as make or break. Instead, Mr Chernomyrdin flew to the Black Sea resort of Sochi to see President Boris Yeltsin, recuperating there from 'flu. He did so to explain to the president what lay behind a rumour of a coup being organised against him and to get the president's assent to a range of decrees which he would have to sign if the agreement the prime minister wished to make with Mr Camdessus was to be honoured. He came back with assent. Late on Tuesday night the two men came up with a deal that was not quite an agreement to pay the Dollars 1.5bn loan which was the immediate goal of the talks, but was as close as Mr Camdessus thought he could get. It is a tough deal. The Russian government has agreed: To hold the budget expenditure line at Rbs183trln - a line which the lobbies are already attacking fiercely, with the military threatening unrest in the army if their share is not raised. It has also agreed to raise revenue, budgeted for Rbs120trln, by a series of measures which would involve extra taxes and - crucially - a measure which would make at least some of the existing spending programmes open to cuts if revenue fell below that planned. By the end of this year, inflation should be running at no more than 7 per cent a month, a rate lower than at any time in the past 27 months. To finalise a statement on economic reform, which lays out the strategy for the rest of the year. To put before the lower house of parliament the legislation required to bring in the changes in the budget, already before the house. To sign the further measures needed which do not have to go before parliament. These moves are supposed to be completed by April 15. They will then be examined by a committee of the IMF board and, if approved, Mr Camdessus will recommend to the full board the payment of the Dollars 1.5bn. IMF insiders in Washington say the deal is largely done: at least six of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries are enthusiastic for the agreement, with the US leading the way. The risks are high. Revenue is to date far behind the projections and the hard pounding is yet to come. Though Mr Camdessus has been enthusiastic about the attitude of leading parliamentarians to the budget, parliament as a whole has a majority conventionally seen as anti-reform. The 'essence of this agreements depends on a personal relationship between two men', said an official close to Mr Camdessus last night. 'He has taken a huge risk, and he knows it.' 'Camdessus was between two cliffs,' said another official privy to the talks. 'At the foot of one is written: you lost Russia. At the foot of the other: you are a fool for believing Chernomyrdin. He preferred to take the risk of looking like a fool.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RUSSIA AND THE IMF  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 1990: The International Monetary Fund, with the World Bank, the European bank for Reconstruction and Development and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, produces a report on the economy of the Soviet Union  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 15 1991: The Soviet Union applies for membership of the IMF  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 4 1991: A unique agreement of association is made between the IMF and the Soviet Union  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 1 1991: IMF opens largest foreign office in Moscow under Mr Jean Foglizzo  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 2 1992: Russia applies for IMF membership  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 1 1992: Russia receives IMF membership  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 5 1992: Russia receives dollars 1bn as a first credit tranche  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 30 1993: Russia receives dollars 1.5bn as first tranche of dollars 3bn 'systemic transformation facility', another unique mechanism developed to bring rapid assistance to Russia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 22 1994: Agreement in principle between Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian premier, on payment of second dollars 1.5bn tranche of the STF under certain conditions  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

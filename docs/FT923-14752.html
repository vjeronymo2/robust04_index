			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Top executives' pay gap widens THE CHIEF executives of big companies are continuing to increase their differentials over lower-ranked managers, although the rate of pay rises for UK executives as a whole is slowing, according to the latest pay index produced by the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries. The index, calculated quarterly for the Financial Times, includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses. The figures for the second quarter of the year are based on a survey of 5,438 managers in 426 companies. Taking all ranks of executives together, the average total pay rose to Pounds 79,019, an increase of 8.1 per cent on the same quarter last year. The corresponding increase over the previous 12 months was 13.5 per cent. Among the different categories of managers, however, the chief executives of companies with sales turnovers of more than Pounds 600m continued to pull ahead. Their average rise over the latest 12 months was 9.1 per cent, the biggest increase of any of the categories. Of the overall total pay of Pounds 79,019, the share made up by salary has risen slightly since last July to 71.6 per cent, while pensions increased their share from 9.9 per cent to 10.5 per cent. Bonuses edged down from 5.8 per cent to 5.7 per cent, company cars from 11 per cent to 10.6 per cent and miscellaneous benefits from 1.8 per cent to 1.5 per cent.

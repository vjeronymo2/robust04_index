			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carl-Gustav Linden: "Union Researchers Warn of </F> Long-Term Unemployment"]    [Text] Researchers at the Wage Earners Research Institute  (PT) are concerned over rising long-term unemployment.    It is expected that by the end of next year, 190,000  individuals will have been unemployed for over a year. That is  40 percent of the jobless total, and according to the PT's  supervisor, Jukka Pekkarinen, it is a direct result of the  government's economic and industrial policy.    The obligation to place people in jobs, which was deleted  from the employment laws at the beginning of last year, has led  to a situation in which more and more long-term unemployed are  losing all contact with the labor market. Government employment  measures now cover only one out of every five long-term  unemployed, compared to one out of every two in 1992 and almost  70 percent when Finland first entered the recession.    Pekkarinen points out that unemployment cannot be markedly  reduced until the growth rate in production stands at around 5  percent. We will not reach that point until the end of 1995. The  researchers therefore feel that in order not to lose one of our  most important competitive advantages -- a well-trained and  knowledgeable work force -- Finland must concentrate more  strongly on an active manpower policy. The institute points out  that, instead, the funds available to the labor offices are  being reduced.    "When it comes to activity related to labor policy, Finland,  which used to be at the average level for OECD countries, is now  falling behind in international comparisons," the PT writes in  its latest economic forecast for this year and next year.  <H5>  No Upswing </H5>   The institute feels that while an economic recovery after  three years of moving backward can certainly be glimpsed, it is  still not possible to talk about a real upswing as long as  private consumption continues to decline. The research team  feels that the government must relax its extremely tight  economic policy to some extent, and one of the measures it  recommends is temporary tax reductions. The value-added tax,  which will go into effect at the beginning of June, should be  decreased by 2 percent for one year.    The PT is also proposing a program to restore balance in the  public sector for the purpose of reducing the structural  deficit, recommending that the partners in the labor market  commit themselves to low inflation, and proposing that the Bank  of Finland take an active part in keeping interest rates down.    The PT is somewhat more cautious than other research  institutes. According to its forecast, total production will  rise by 1 percent this year and 4 percent next year. Exports  will grow by 20 percent this year and an equal amount next year,  with their share of total production rising to 40 percent.    Exports will be the locomotive of recovery, and the export  industry's investments will speed up this year and increase by  15 percent next year, the PT predicts.  <H5>  Households To Get Less </H5>   But the purchasing power of households will continue to  decline. It is predicted that private consumption will decline  by 2.5 percent this year because households are losing nearly 4  percent of their purchasing power. Private consumption is  expected to rise by 3.5 percent next year.    Recovery is also foreseen in the unemployment statistics.  The  PT is predicting that 430,000 individuals, or 17.5 percent of  the labor force, will be jobless next year, compared to an  average of 473,000, or 19 percent, this year.    The PT expects weak trends toward rising inflation (1.5  percent this year), but feels that the threat of inflation is  not likely to become an urgent problem before the end of this  decade.    The researchers feel that the Bank of Finland could very  well  ease up on its monetary policy without endangering its goal of  keeping inflation at 2 percent or less.    Record figures in trade statistics are expected to continue.  The PT predicts that the surplus in the trade balance will total  44 billion markkas this year and reach 13 billion markkas in the  current account balance and then grow to 47 billion markkas and  20 billion markkas respectively next year.</p>

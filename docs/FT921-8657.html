			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: BP causes a spasm with its dividend - London Markets In 1981, ICI cut its dividend and the stock market shuddered, then shrugged off the news. A less drastic dividend decision from British Petroleum sent the stock market into rather more of a spasm this week. ICI's decade-old dividend cut was significant because it signalled just how dire the early-1980s economic recession would be. BP's decision - and a slight rejigging of dividend policy by Hanson - similarly prefigure the future, but in a slightly different way. They provide fresh examples of the pressures on UK companies' dividend policies over the next few years. On Thursday BP decided to hold its fourth-quarter dividend unchanged, producing a rise for the year of 4.7 per cent, barely more than the inflation rate. Robert Horton, BP's chairman, told analysts on Friday that the company must ensure that dividend payments are covered on a replacement cost basis. BP's replacement cost profits - that is, profit excluding stock holding gains or losses - amounted to Pounds 72m in the fourth quarter; the quarter's dividend payout will come to Pounds 227m. On that logic, unless BP's earnings improve the dividend must ultimately come into question. The outlook offers little comfort. 'Trading conditions for the first half of 1992 are likely to be broadly similar to those of the previous six months,' said the company. Much therefore depends on the 'demanding cost and profitability improvement programme' underway throughout the group. BP shares reached their all-time high of 377 1/4 p in July 1987, just before the October crash and the government share sale that so disastrously coincided with it. The echoes of that event still linger: because the sale went so badly, the Kuwait Investment Office was able to pick up a substantial stake in BP, which the company later bought back, weakening its balance sheet just at the moment when oil prices fell and the economy went into a downward slide. In October 1991, BP shares were touching 354p, before sliding to trade between 275p and 295p. On Thursday, the day the profits and dividend were announced, the shares closed at 274p, a drop of 10p on the day, but still more or less in touch with the trading range. The next day, Friday, saw the real damage: Horton met the analysts and the shares had fallen to 255p by midday. They closed at 255 1/2 p, their lowest since January 1989. Since autumn 1991, BP has underperformed Shell by a quarter. The message sent by the Hanson dividend development was rather different. Hanson is switching to quarterly rather than half-yearly dividends, citing the desires of its US shareholders. Shareholders will be unaffected, but a timing adjument will neatly reduce the dividends paid in the year to September 1992, and thus lower the company's advance corporation tax (ACT) payments. Like many big UK companies, Hanson finds itself unable to reclaim all its ACT payments because it hasn't enough mainstream corporation tax against which to offset it. Hanson's tax-management skills and ability to keep buying UK earnings have kept this burden to a minimum. Other companies are under greater pressure. The Hanson dividend switch tells us perhaps less about the company's famously deft financial management than analysts' immediate comments suggest. Instead, the lesson may be a more general warning of downward pressure on dividend growth created by the interaction of four factors: the UK's tax system; the country's high payout ratio; its worse-than-elsewhere recession; and the high overseas exposure of its big companies. In 1981, despite the ICI dividend cut (and FT headlines such as 'The City shivers') the market closed the week of the announcement up 18.2 points on the FT Ordinary share index. This week, the market closed at 2,513.9 on the FT-SE 100 index, a drop of 3.3 points on the week. That understates the BP impact - at mid-morning on Friday, the FT-SE was a fraction away from breaking the 2,500 level. It steadied, however, and the recent trading range remained intact. One reason is undoubtedly that the imminence of the election has left the City in a form of suspended animation. Neither good news, such as the lower-than-expected inflation figures; nor bad news, such as a gloomy assessment of the economic outlook by the Bank of England and much-worse-than-expected unemployment figures, can break the trance. As the charts show, the most recent two elections both show a pattern of rising equities in the months before the vote. So far, working on the assumption of an April 9 vote, the stock market has tracked its previous pattern. It is now faced with a choice, however. If it is to replicate recent form, the market might follow the steady rise of 1987 to the election date and beyond. Or it might repeat the pattern of 1983, with a dip before the election, then a recovery in the closing weeks of the campaign, and a fall later on. In both cases, however, there was a steady downward trend of trading volumes in the weeks before the vote. This year, that pattern seems to have set in early. One other striking feature of recent weeks has been the way in which shares which have done best so far this year differ from those which have done worst. Looking at companies of reasonable size, those which have risen most seem to be ones away from the core of the market: medium-sized media businesses, for example, specialised retailers and so on. Those which have fallen most have a markedly more heavyweight character: the bottom 20 includes British Gas, Wimpey, General Accident, Pilkington, Ranks Hovis McDougall, British Aerospace, Taylor Woodrow and BET. When such key institutional holdings show drops of 10-20 per cent while the market as a whole is rising 2 per cent, there may be more pessimism at work than the broad averages show.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (1): Bitter price of liberation - Adding to the anxiety throughout much of Scandinavia is the sobering realisation that there is not going to be rapid and immediate recovery from the current difficulties. Signs of improvement among the financial institutions are not expected during this year. Robert Taylor investigates AFTER the champagne days of the 1980s, the Nordic region's financial system is going through a prolonged hangover, which shows no signs at all of coming to an end. Leading financial institutions in Norway, Finland and Sweden are still being hit hard by soaring bad debts, caused in many cases by the reckless provision of unsecured credit for the speculative activities of finance and property companies. Over the past few weeks, one bank after another has reported the grim consequences in the form of falling profits and huge credit losses. Few have emerged unscathed. Norway's leading banks have been suffering from disastrous deficits for the past three years and it has needed direct government intervention to prevent a collapse of the country's banking system. In Sweden, Forsta Sparbanken, the Stockholm-based savings bank, and the state-controlled Nordbanken, have both required government guarantees for loans to prop them up. In Finland, the savings bank federation, Skopbanken, was only saved from collapse last autumn by being taken over temporarily by the country's central bank. Only Denmark has been spared from the prevailing sense of crisis. What is adding to the anxiety across much of Scandinavia is the sobering realisation that there is not going to be any rapid and immediate recovery from current difficulties. Signs of improvement in the financial position of the banks and other financial institutions are not expected during the course of this year. Even 1993 is already looking difficult. Some observers are starting to wonder just how sizeable the credit losses will eventually be, and what impact they will have on the capital base of the leading banks. The disaster in Norway in 1991 brought total accumulated losses for the financial institutions of NKr19.8bn. In a number of cases the losses were higher than the equity capital. Bankers in Stockholm say that Sweden is not going to experience what Norway is going through but they may yet be proven over-optimistic. The whole of the Nordic region is paying a bitter price for the liberating impact of financial deregulation that first began in the mid 1980s. In the new competitive climate created by the lifting of controls and rules, banks and finance companies rushed in to try and satisfy demand for loans, and competed against each other for corporate and personal customers, with little regard for proof of credit soundness. 'Handling credit is like handling explosives', explains Mr Jacob Palmstierna, vice-chairman of Sweden's Nordbanken. 'If you don't know how to handle it, in time it explodes'. The supervisory authorities, as well as the Nordic governments and central banks, underestimated the turmoil that deregulation would bring to the financial system. 'We saw the gains without seeing the pain which could be incurred in the pursuit of efficiency,' admits Mr Bengt Dennis, the governor of Sweden's central bank. The impact of the credit losses is coming in three waves, Mr Palmstierna points out. First, it is hitting the real estate and finance companies. Next, bad debts are being incurred by industrial enterprises, particularly among small and medium-sized firms. Finally, private individuals will start to default. So far, this dismal process has only reached the first phase. The regulatory authorities, governments and central banks are looking at how to respond. It will not be easy for the banks and other financial institutions to go back to basics, drop their pan-Nordic visions and consolidate their activities, when the pace of external change shows no signs of easing. Indeed, further deregulation is going to force the Nordic financial world to become ever more competitive. 'The doors have been almost completely opened to international competition, and yet the spirit of a tightly-controlled, closed economy still pervades the economic and financial system', argues Mr Tuoman Sukselainen at the Finnish Banker's Association. The traditional commercial bank is being transformed into a multi-faceted financial services institution. The market is demanding that banks must provide every kind of financial service to corporate and household customers alike. As a result, there will more freedom of choice in the Nordic financial sector during the 1990s. Moreover, as Mr Dennis told a banking conference in Kuala Lumpur last month, the number of non-bank financial firms coming into the market, often banks in all but name, is growing. 'The expanding menu of bank services is pushing more and more of the banks' risk exposure off the balance sheet,' he warned. The globalisation of financial markets is also going to intensify the pressures on the banks and other financial institutions in the Nordic region. Removing foreign exchange controls and other restrictions has made the economies of the Nordic countries much more vulnerable to short-term capital fluctuations. The Nordic currencies have been pegged to the European Currency Unit and this has been backed by tough fiscal policies by the governments of the region. Devaluation and demand management are no longer accepted as instruments of economic management. The Finnish markka was devalued last November, but this move was regarded, even by supporters, as a final, one-off measure, necessitated by uniquely difficult conditions. These resulted from the collapse of Finnish trade with Russia, coinciding as it did with a trough in the paper and pulp industry cycle. A more telling sign of the new times in the region was the Swedish central bank's draconian decision to raise lending rates to the banks by 6 per centage points shortly after the markka devaluation. This helped to restore overseas confidence and stem a dangerous outflow of capital from Sweden, but it also underlined the fragility of the more open financial system within which the Nordic countries must operate. 'We live in a tightly integrated global financial village', explains Mr Dennis. Nordic financial institutions have little time to adapt to further external pressures. On January 1, 1993, the European Community's single market comes into effect and with it the free movement of capital as part of the 19-nation European Economic Area (EEA). The extension to the Nordic area of the EC's second banking directive is also designed to stimulate more competition. A single banking licence will entitle any financial institution to operate in the EEA market based only on the authorisation of its home country. Supervision of the activities of financial institutions, including day-to-day activities, as well as financial solvency, will take place where it is incorporated and not where it operates. The principle of mutual recognition will also be applied so the respective host countries' authorities will recognise each other's authorisation and supervision. The second development that will certainly make an impact on the Nordic region by the end of this year is the implementation of the banking capital adequacy requirements of the Basle-based International Banking Settlement. Only in Norway does there seem likely to be any difficulty in meeting this stipulation. But beyond those pressures lies the wider and murky issue of European economic and monetary union. All the Nordic countries (even divided Norway) are intent on joining the EC by 1995 but so far the debate about monetary integration has hardly gone further than the preliminary stage. However, enough has happened over the past year in the Nordic banking and investment scene to suggest there will be no return either to the heady atmosphere of the late 1980s or the semi-isolation that lasted for nearly half a century. Instead, there is likely to be a confusing mixture of consolidation and competition. The Nordic countries used to be renowned for their belief in moderation, consensus and stability but recent banking problems suggest they have lost their sense of balance. What is needed more than ever is the revival of older virtues. They provide the best guide for the Nordic countries as they seek to adapt to the arbitrariness of the open global financial system.</p>

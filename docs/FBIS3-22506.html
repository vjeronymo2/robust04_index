			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Serious Outbreak of Dengue Fever, </F> "Nong Chok" Champion for Highest Number of Sick"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Dr. Warawit Lepnak, Director of  the Bangkok Health Office, said that heavy rains and flooding  provided many breeding places for mosquitos and people could be  more at risk from dengue fever. So the health office had been  working to destroy these breeding places throughout Bangkok. The  statistics for dengue fever for the past ten years indicated  that the highest incidence had been in 1987 when there were a  total of 12,190 cases in Bangkok and 18 deaths. The pattern of  the disease was to spread every other year or every two years.  When Bangkok battled the disease, the number of cases was  reduced.    He said that this year the number of cases of dengue fever  had been higher from January until August. There had been a  total of 1,096 cases but no loss of life. If one compared the  statistics for the number of cases in various areas based on the  population, one found that Nong Chok had the highest incidence.  Next came Yannawa, Sathon, Bangrak and Thonburi in that order.  If one considered the total number of cases in the top ten  areas, Thonburi was first with 75 cases, Huai Khwang was next  with 61 cases, Yannawa with 59, Sathon with 58, Phasi Charoen  with 56, Chomthong with 45, Ratsadon Burana with 42, Phrakhonong  with 40, Bangkapi with 39, and Dusit with 36.    He also said that although the situation with dengue fever  in  Bangkok had not reached the stage of epidemic, we should be  careful after the rains not to throw away anything which might  hold water as these could provide breeding places for mosquitos.  There was a mistaken belief that breeding places for mosquitos  could only be in waste water. In fact mosquitos could breed in  clean water.</p>

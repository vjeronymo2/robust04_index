			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ABSENCE OF MOORE MAKES CSLA LESS DIFFICULT FOR CSUN  </P> <P> As if Cal State Northridge needed any help -- and for a while, it appeared as  if it would -- Cal State Los Angeles benched its best player for disciplinary  reasons Friday night.  </P> <P> Rhodney Moore, the Golden Eagles' top scorer and rebounder, was suspended for a  game by Coach Henry Dyer for missing a practice this week.  </P> <P> What horrible timing. Cal State L. A. would normally need not one, but a couple  of more Moores to be competitive in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  The Eagles came into their conference opener at home against CSUN with the only  losing record (2-11) among CCAA teams in nonconference games.  </P> <P> But for almost a half, Moore's absence seemed to adversely affect Northridge  more than Cal State L. A.  </P> <P> Eventually, the Matadors took a commanding edge and won fairly easily, 69-55,  running their record to 10-4 and handing the Eagles their ninth consecutive  loss.  </P> <P> Northridge played as well -- and as poorly -- as it had all season during  segments of the game.  </P> <P> CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy seemed fairly confident of the reason. "A lot of that  was mental," he said.  </P> <P> Jemarl Baker, 1 of only 2 CSUN players to shoot better than 50%, said that it  was tough to keep a competitive edge against the outmanned Eagles, who laid a  goose egg over the course of the 14-game conference schedule last season.  </P> <P> "We knew they were talented," Baker said. "We came here ready, but you don't  come in ready to play as hard as you would against a Bakersfield. You try, but  it's hard to do."  </P> <P> Such problems never would have become apparent if the Matadors had made some  easy shots in the first half.  </P> <P> Northridge, which had shot less than 40% in its previous 2 games, made only  38.2% of its attempts in the first half.  </P> <P> "I don't know if we came in with full concentration," Cassidy said. "We missed  a lot of layups and around-the-basket shots."  </P> <P> Said Baker: "We were getting a lot of open shots, we just weren't making them."  </P> <P> Even so, the Matadors led at the half, 31-23. Northridge was fortunate in that  as poorly as it played in the first half, Cal State L. A. was equally bad. In  some cases worse. The Eagles shot only 31.4%.  </P> <P> Still, Northridge didn't take the lead for good until 2:39 remained in the  half. A jump shot by Darren Matsubara put the Matadors ahead, 24-23, and  ignited a 9-0 run to end the half.  </P> <P> In the previous 8 minutes, CSUN had managed only 1 basket, a jump hook by  center Todd Bowser.  </P> <P> "There were stretches I thought we played very well. It was like, 'See, coach,  we can do it,' " Cassidy said, sticking his tongue out to mimic the attitude of  his players.  </P> <P> Northridge shot 56.5% in the second half and twice opened 20-point leads.  </P> <P> Guard Derrick Gathers ended his 2-game shooting slump for the Matadors, scoring  a game-high 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting, including 4 of 7 from 3-point range.  He also had 8 rebounds and 4 steals.  </P> <P> Matsubara added 12 points for CSUN, while Bowser had 11 points and 8 rebounds.  </P> <P> Northridge put Cal State L. A. away early in the second half, outscoring the  Eagles, 9-2, over a 2-minute stretch.  </P> <P> Consecutive steals by Matsubara, Gathers and Kris Brodowski resulted in 4  points and the Matadors had a 42-27 advantage only 5 minutes into the second  half.  </P> <P> After Bruce Turner scored on a layup with 2:23 into the second half, the Eagles  scored only 2 points over the next 7 minutes as Northridge ran out to a  20-point lead.  </P> <P> Turner led the Eagles with 13 points. David Porter added 11, but made only 5 of  19 shots.  </P></p>

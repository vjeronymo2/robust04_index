As the CFD technology has evolved, the  relationship with the conventional design tool of wind tunnel  testing has also changed accordingly. This paper reviews the  relationship of the two major technologies in Mitsubishi Nagoya.  The typical CFD application is briefly introduced during the  discussion.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   The utility of CFD technology in the aerodynamic design of  aerospace equipment began to make rapid strides in the 1980s.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), at its Nagoya Aerospace  Systems (NAS) facility, has also been working hard on CFD R&amp;D  and now considers it an important aerodynamic design tool  alongside of wind tunnel testing. In this article we trace the  development of CFD at Mitsubishi NAS, giving specific examples  and focusing on how its relationship with wind tunnel testing  has changed. We also discuss the significance of these two  technologies to designers engaged in aerodynamic design work,  and look ahead to the future of the technology.  <H5>  2. Changes in CFD and Wind Tunnel Testing </H5>   Advances in CFD applications in the aerospace field were  tremendous in the 1980s, and CFD has now developed into an  indispensable aerodynamic design tool that ranks alongside  conventional wind tunnel testing. As CFD technology has  developed, naturally its relationship to wind tunnel testing has  changed (cf. Figure 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-43A>           Figure 1. Changes in Relationship Between CFD Technology </FIG>    In the early 1980s, when we began to see the possibilities  for CFD applications, it was being said that CFD was a  "substitute" for wind tunnel testing. At that point in time,  that being focused on in CFD technology were the  analytical functions, as was the case with wind  tunnel tests, which put CFD in a competitive relationship with  wind tunnel testing. Subsequently, with the unforeseen  improvements in supercomputer speeds and CFD technological  advances, it became possible to handle Navier-Stokes inverse  solution computations, and after the mid-1980s it was the  design functions of CFD which came into focus. These  were absolutely new functions which are not available in  conventional wind tunnel testing, and in that sense CFD  technology transcended wind tunnel testing. Then in the late  1980s the quality of CFD technology began to be questioned,  which led to careful comparative studies between CFD and wind  tunnel tests. As a result, there is now emphasis on the  complementary functions realized by organically  combining the two technologies.    Beginning in the next section, we introduce the reader to  some typical examples of CFD applications at Mitsubishi NAS, and  retrace the changes in the relationship between CFD and wind  tunnel testing.  <H5>  3. Competition (Analytical Functions) </H5>   In terms of aerodynamic analytical functions for determining  aerodynamic characteristics for a given shape, there is no  essential difference between wind tunnel testing and CFD.  However, in the field of aerodynamic design, these two  technologies are clearly differentiated in their use. CFD is  superior to wind tunnel testing in terms of its greater speed  and its greater flexibility.    Compared to the task of designing and fabricating models and  then conducting wind tunnel tests, the time involved in  generating CFD meshes is extremely short. For this reason, CFD  has great merit in being able to immediately reflect the results  of aerodynamic performance evaluations in shape designing. And  unlike wind tunnel tests, where the test conditions are limited  by the capabilities of ground-based equipment, CFD technology in  principle poses no restrictions on the evaluation conditions, so  that aerodynamic performance evaluations can be conducted in  regions that cannot be simulated with a ground-based facility.  In Figure 2 a pressure distribution is depicted for HOPE  re-entry conditions. This kind of function is particularly  appreciated in the development of such space shuttle  vehicles.[.sup]1[/] In Figure 3 [not reproduced] is displayed  a pressure distribution around the blades of an advanced  turbopropeller (ATP). Obtaining this kind of detailed data for a  turning object from wind tunnel tests is extremely  difficult.[.sup]2[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-44A>           Figure 2. HOPE Pressure Distribution (M = 15, _a_ - </FIG>    In the area of "analytical functions," where it is  essentially no different from wind tunnel testing, there are  still many respects in which CFD takes a back seat to wind  tunnel testing. Take the cost angle, for instance. For some  shapes, where many data points are required, wind tunnel testing  holds the advantage. And in the area of precision, beginning  with turbulence models, some aspects of CFD are still unknown.  And there is a tremendous difference in terms of track record.  In the field of aerospace equipment development, for example,  where very high reliability is demanded, nothing has ever flown  yet with only CFD.  <H5>  4. Superiority (Design Functions) </H5>   CFD design functions perform processes which are exactly the  reverse of the analytical functions, and here we can expect  little help from wind tunnel testing. The ability to derive a  geometrical shape given a pressure field, in what is called  inverse solving, is extremely important to the aerodynamic  designer. Recently it became possible to perform Navier-Stokes  reverse solutions, and the field of applications has spread. To  the aerodynamic designer who must design "flows," it is a  tremendous advantage to have the "directness" of being able to  designate not shapes, but pressure distributions.    In Figure 4 is depicted a full-craft pressure distribution  for a transonic civilian aircraft.[.sup]3[/] The  high-Reynolds number main wing that is employed in the latest  airframes represents the positive application of the Reynolds  number effect -- which used to be difficult to estimate in many  cases -- so as to achieve high drag-divergence Mach numbers. The  technology for these new wings would not be possible without the  high-precision reverse solution method of CFD technology. In  Figure 5 is depicted an example of applying the Navier-Stokes  reverse solution method.[.sup]4[/] The HOPE main wing has a  complex flow field that is surrounded by the fuselage and chip  fins, so its design required a tool for precisely estimating the  positions and conditions of the shock wave and separation,  particularly at transonic speed. By employing the Navier-Stokes  reverse solution method, it became possible to make extremely  high-precision designs in a short time.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-44B>           Figure 4. Full-Craft Pressure Distribution for Transonic </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-44C>           Figure 5. HOPE Main Wing Reverse Solution Design (M = </FIG>  <H5>  5. Complementing (Organic Merging) </H5>   It is impossible [sic] to verify the precision of CFD  computations by doing careful correspondence studies with wind  tunnel test data. Out of the process of carefully comparing the  two kinds of simulation results, we derive "organic merging"  with which it is possible to make aerodynamic performance  evaluations at higher dimensions by mutually making up for each  method's shortcomings.    In Figure 6 we have a pressure distribution for a  swept-forward wing. With a swept-forward wing, due to the  structural divergence characteristics, the deformations that  result from static aeroelasticity, even in a wind tunnel model,  cannot be disregarded.[.sup]5[/] For this reason, we combine  CFD and structural analysis to estimate the flexure in the model  beforehand, and then actually fabricate the model in a deformed  condition so that it forms the aerodynamic shape designed at the  design points in the wind tunnel tests. This enables us to  verify high-precision aerodynamic characteristics in a way that  could not be done with either CFD or wind tunnel testing alone.  In Figure 7 [not reproduced] are depicted the results of  two-dimensional wind tunnel side-wall analysis.[.sup]6[/] In  two-dimensional wind tunnels, particularly in developing  transonic airfoils with high Reynolds numbers, it is not  possible to use models with high aspect ratios due to  limitations in model structural strength, so the side-wall  effect becomes too large to be disregarded. For this reason, we  employ CFD to analyze the side-wall effect in a two-dimensional  wind tunnel, then apply corrections to the wind tunnel test  results, and thus perform high-precision performance evaluations  on transonic airfoils with high Reynolds numbers.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-45A>           Figure 6. Forward Swept Wing Pressure Distribution (M = </FIG>     Now that CFD technology and wind tunnel testing have reached  the mutually complementary stage, from the aerodynamic  designer's perspective the situation becomes as diagrammed in  Figure 8. Wind tunnel tests provide CFD technology with a steady  stream of verification data for enhanced precision, while CFD  provides wind tunnel testing with images of flow-site phenomena  inside the wind tunnel which is very difficult to see in a  conventional wind tunnel test. The designer continually learns  physics from the wind tunnel tests while learning how to narrow  his focus on the points which should be looked at in terms of  designing and testing.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-45B>           Figure 8. Two Design Tools </FIG>  <H5>  6. Summary </H5>   Amazing progress is being made in CFD technology at  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Nagoya Aerospace Systems facility.  In conjunction with these advances, the relationship between CFD  and wind tunnel testing is changing. Aerodynamic designers  should now be able to effectively use these two tools in a  mutually complementary way to design higher-performance  aerodynamic shapes.  7. References    1.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kim Hyon-ik] </F>   [Text] President Kim Yong-sam exchanged views with former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter on dealing with the North Korean  nuclear issue upon the latter's return to Seoul on the morning  of 18 June following a four-day visit to North Korea which  included talks with President Kim Il-song on two occasions.    President Kim Yong-sam listened to former President Carter's  explanations on the result of his visit to North Korea and  emphasized that until President Kim Il-song proves his word,  firm efforts based on the UN Security Council's [UNSC] sanctions  against North must be maintained by the international society.    President Kim Yong-sam clearly stated that even if the  United  States accepts President Kim Il-song's views, it must be carried  out at the same time as efforts for UNSC sanctions against the  North.    Regarding the nuclear issue, President Kim Yong-sam pointed  out that complete and thorough transparency must be guaranteed,  and asserted that along with measures to freeze nuclear weapons  in the future, past nuclear activities must be clarified.    While recalling that in the past, North Korea avoided the  international society's pressure and sanctions through scheming  tactics and promoted nuclear development while buying time,  President Kim Yong-sam pointed out that we must not slacken the  reins of caution until President Kim Il-song's true motives are  confirmed.    President Kim Yong-sam repeatedly asked former President  Carter not to be dazzled by President Kim Il-song's words.    Former President Carter explained that North Korea's will to  accept special inspection [tukpyol sachal] includes its past  nuclear activities. It was learned that former President Carter  conveyed to President Kim Yong-sam the need for the ROK and the  United States to provide assistance in switching to the light  water reactor.    A high-ranking Chongwadae [presidential offices] official  said that an overall assessment based on the former President  Carter's remarks and the U.S. Government's material will be  conducted. He emphasized: "Currently there is no change in the  basic principle of completely securing North Korea's nuclear  transparency and taking sanctions through the UNSC."    On 17 June, U.S. Ambassador to the ROK James Laney visited  Chong Chong-uk, senior secretary for Foreign and National  Security Affairs of the Presidential Secretariat, to confirm  such matters and provided explanations to Senior Secretary Chong  on the series of matters regarding former President Carter's  visit to North Korea.    The official avoided further comment by saying, "As  indicated by President Clinton's denial and definition of  President Carter's remark in Pyongyang on the suspension of U.S.  sanctions against the North, as personal opinion, the remarks  remain merely reference material."    The official added that the White House has denied the  validity of this remark of former President Carter through the  ROK Embassy in the United States, on the morning of 17 June  (Korean time).</p>

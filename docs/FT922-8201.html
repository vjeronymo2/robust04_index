			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Net income slips to Dollars 4.4m at Berlitz BERLITZ, the US language instruction company, has turned in first-quarter net income of Dollars 4.4m, or 23 cents a share, against Dollars 5.9m, or 15 cents, a year earlier. Operating income in the quarter fell to Dollars 4.4m from Dollars 7m, while sales rose to Dollars 68.3m from Dollars 64.8m. The company attributed the decline to economic slowdown in Japan and Europe and continued expenses related to the expansion of its translation business. Macmillan, the US publishing subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) owned 56 per cent of Berlitz shares. The ownership of the stake is the subject of litigation. Berlitz's interest income from affiliates fell Dollars 3.9m to Dollars 1.7m, reflecting payment defaults of the notes from MCC and some MCC affiliates in the 1991 fourth quarter. MCC has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code. Berlitz reiterated that preferred stock dividends have been suspended and are not expected to be paid in the foreseeable future. In the 1991 first quarter, the preferred stock dividend reduced net income available to common shareholders by Dollars 3.1m.</p>

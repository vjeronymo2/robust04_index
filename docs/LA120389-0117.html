			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILLER AND FOAM, NONSTOP;  </P> <P> LOVE AND WILL BY STEPHEN DIXON (PARIS REVIEW EDITIONS: $18.95; 193 PP.;  0-945167-20-2)  </P> <P> Reading these 20 irritating, unstoppable, sometimes amusing and on rare  occasion touching stories by Stephen Dixon puts one in mind of Samuel Beckett,  and of the words Beckett once put in the mouth of his character Molloy, in the  famous novel of that name: "Not to want to say, not to know what you want to  say, not to be able to say what you think you want to say, and never to stop  saying, or hardly ever, that is the thing to keep in mind, even in the heat of  composition."  </P> <P> The prolific Dixon's gift, indeed, seems to lie precisely in this ability  "never to stop saying," to keep spinning out words no matter what, to fill up  the page against the horror of -- of what? In Beckett's case, it was done in an  admittedly doomed attempt to fight against the horror of the existential abyss  of nothingness. In Dixon's, it seems, it's done for another reason: to fight  against the horror of -- well, against the horror of not writing another story.  Surely, one thinks, the aims must be higher than that, the themes deeper and  the purpose grander. Perhaps so. But both in subject and manner, the pieces  here often strain such a hope.  </P> <P> These are stories that come to the reader always at a fast-forward, breakneck,  cartoon-like pace, as if time were about to end and the writer had better  hurry. Take "Arrangements," for example, chronicling in seven pages an entire  marriage, from meeting to death: "She comes into my room. I hold her hand. She  kisses my lips. We undress one another and go to bed. Later, she dresses and  leaves. I sleep for a little while and dress and go outside. I see her talking  to a man on the street. I say, 'Hey, how are you?' " And at the end: "She nods,  closes her eyes, dies. I go off, but it's never the same with anyone after  that."  </P> <P> Maybe that really is Dixon's theme, one thinks: time itself, that we're running  out of it. In "Said," indeed, Dixon manages to tell a story in a satirically  bright ultra-shorthand that thrives on the omission of all that's conventional  and thus unnecessary ("He said, she said. She left the room, he followed her.  He said, she said. She locked herself in the bathroom, he slammed the door with  his fists. He said. She said nothing . . . "). And he tries to do the same also  in "Grace Called," about a man (one of many here) whose life appears at first  as sadly/hilariously empty as any Beckett clown's: "Grace calls. I drink a  glass of beer. I hang the mop over the bathtub. I cut my hair. Grace calls. I  run in place. I eat a celery stick. . . ."  </P> <P> The rub comes when, time and again, Dixon lets such initially skillful,  incisive, and suggestive stories wander off into the very conventions one  supposes him to be taking courageous flight from: the quick-fix explanations of  the standardized psychological-maudlin, for example (the man in "Grace Calls"  ends up being traumatized by the death of a pet in his childhood), or the  gratuitous tropes of having "something happen" (the fighting couple in "Said"  end up in a taxi wreck).  </P> <P> Dixon's austerely promising philosophical wit, in other words, shows all the  signs of being ephemeral, brief, and, above all, easily lost sight of by its  possessor, and the stories here -- in its thunderous absence -- remain often  curiously trivial, sluggishly flat, and banal. In "Buddy," a man walks through  his neighborhood meeting people he knows; in "A Friend's Death," another pallid  and lonely man gets a terminal disease, then dies; in "In Time," a man is  imprisoned for eight years by two old ladies, then is let go; in "The  Postcard," a man tells his wife about his eccentric and unsavory relatives; in  the gag -- and shtick-filled "Dog Days," two men get bitten by a transvestite's  dog,which then can't be located for a rabies check.  </P> <P> The growing and disheartening suspicion that Dixon is in fact writing about  nearly nothing intensifies with those stories that are about the writer  writing. "A Sloppy Story" is the animated-cartoon-paced tale of a writer  selling a story idea ("This guy comes in and says to me and I say to him and he  says . . . ") to a producer whose company then goes bankrupt. The ambiguity of  Dixon's title (the sale takes place on a rainy day) comes to seem an attempt to  head off anticipated criticism (that it's a "slapdash story") through a  disclaimer of the come-on-this-is-just-a-bauble-so-don't-take-it-so-seriously  variety. Which is fair enough, except that Dixon plays the same card --  lightheartedly admitting his own deficiencies -- too often for it to keep  working as an anodyne or charming sop to the less-than-infinitely-patient  reader-critic.  </P> <P> "I stopped writing that last sentence because it was getting confusing," says  the writer in "Magna . . . Reading." (Then go back and rewrite it, says the  critic.) The self-appointed task of this nameless character is to finish  writing another story (He's already got "two-fifty to three hundred of them")  before Magna, who is reading downstairs, "finishes the other four." So: "Fill  up this page, go right on to another. How many pages more will it take to make  a story, go right on to another, have one ready for her. . . ."  </P> <P> And is Dixon, too, writing just to write? Writing just to fill pages? In "The  Last," a writer talks about his "biggest manuscript" and says: "Been working at  this so long I forget what I do, why I do it, when I did it." What can an  increasingly bored and by now slightly infuriated reader say to such a  shameless, narcissistic, logorrheic wearing of the writely heart on the writely  sleeve? Yet on goes the heedless and unstoppable Dixon. In the title story, a  high school teacher, who loses his girl, says of himself: "I often say . . .  things simply because I think they might or do sound metaphysically comical or  epistemologically profound or just plain bright or yuk yuk funny and she'll  enjoy my company more for my having said them than if I hadn't or some such  stuff."  </P> <P> Beckett's sea of words was an ocean of crafted and conscious drowning; Dixon's  is mainly filler and foam.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Gaona and Georgina Tristan] </F>   [Text] In the final stretch of Carlos Salinas de Gortari's  term as president, his political and social finishes [cierre]  are viewed by the government itself as "unstable," while his  economic finish is "threatening."    A "confidential" report by the Attorney General's Office  [PGR] entitled "Mexico, Picture of Violence," which was  completed one day before Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination,  states that Salinas' administration has been the most turbulent  administration in the past 36 years.    The 46-page document states that Adolfo Lopez Mateos'  administration had an "unstable" social finish, but it was  politically and economically "stable." Jose Lopez Portillo's  political and social finishes were "stable," but his economic  finish was "unstable." Miguel de la Madrid's were economically  and socially "stable" but politically "unstable."    Meanwhile, the report states that in view of the upcoming  federal elections on 21 August, it is important to protect  citizens nationwide through the presence of public security  forces.    There is evidence of a serious political schism within  Salinas' inner circle, a schism which is not only personified by  Manuel Camacho Solis and his supporters, but which the  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas has used to  his advantage.    The report points out that the Chiapas rebellion and the  death, violence, and political persecutions it prompted dashed,  among other myths, the fallacy that Mexico's social peace was  the envy of many countries in the world. Still, in his final  State of the Nation address, President Salinas pointed out: "I  hereby reiterate that Mexico is moving forward confidently and  calmly with the help of its Armed Forces."    The reality experienced by the Mexican people, at least over  the past 10 years, shows the exact opposite to be true.  Although its origins were diverse, the myth of social peace  that the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] had boasted  about has led to a climate of violence in many parts of the  country, the PGR report added.    The Zapatist revolt revealed a threat that has always  existed  as well as proving that social tensions can erupt at any time in  any part of the nation. They are likely to occur in the wake of  years of extremely poor economic and social conditions,  repression, and a lack of mechanisms to participate in politics.    Other forms of violence are not simple possibilities, they  are tangible realities. For example:     -  Political violence  that the state's repressive apparatus -- namely, the Army, state  and federal police, and judicial institutions, as well as the  so-called "white guards" of the paramilitary corps -- exercise  against dissidents who oppose the government, the official  party, and regional leaders.    -  The violence that has been  unleashed as a result of the war between the various cartels  fighting over drug production, marketing, and distribution in  Mexico.    -  The violence displayed by numerous gangs of former  police officers and criminals who have turned kidnapping and  robberies into their favorite means of obtaining million-dollar  profits, without ever worrying about whether or not they will  have to murder their victims.    The report acknowledges that political violence seems to  have  unleashed its fury in the southeastern part of the nation. This  region, which has only been thrown the leftovers of the nation's  economic modernization policy, stands out, because the states  that comprise it -- Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Puebla, and  Veracruz -- feature the largest concentrations of poverty and  abandonment, the worst education and health services, and  populations predominately comprising peasants and Indians.    Together with this area, in states such as Mexico, Hidalgo,  Morelos, Michoacan, and Tlaxcala, social tensions and political  confrontations have often turned into political demonstrations  against the authorities, local leaders, and police. The  demonstrations have invariably been repressed by the "forces of  order."    The electoral frauds, political challenges, seizing of  mayoral offices, violent evictions by way of the police,  arbitrary arrests, and the murder of activists and sympathizers  of political parties that oppose the PRI have created a vicious  circle that makes it very difficult for the authorities to  respond without violence and in accordance with the law.    The document notes that one of the main ingredients  contributing to this climate of violence and social instability  is the lack of credibility in election results.    Tabasco looms as the state first in line on the list of  electoral risks for "radical changes." Conflicts, in the  meantime, are possible in the states of Oaxaca, Veracruz, and  Yucatan as a result of the prevailing social, economic, and  political situation. "The worst-case scenario, in terms of  elections, exists in Guerrero and Michoacan, where prospects for  August are not very encouraging."    The document mentions some regions where the PRI  presidential  candidate will face difficulty in winning votes in the upcoming  federal elections:     -  Baja California, the first state  governed by the opposition (PAN) [National Action Party], could  very well represent a vulnerable region for the PRI candidate,  although there is a good chance there will be votes to favor the  candidates of that party for deputy and senatorial posts.    -  In  Chiapas, with a population of more than 3.2 million people, the  events early this year gave rise to a certain political anarchy  and opportunism on the part of some political parties, labor  unions, and government, student, and peasant sectors which  openly declared support for the demands made by the EZLN  [Zapatist National Liberation Army]. There were those, in fact,  who even proposed Subcommander Marcos as a candidate for  governor of this state.    The current situation makes it difficult to define the  attitude of the people toward the PRI.     -  To a great extent,  Chihuahua represents the largest number of votes for the  rightists (PAN). The degree of PRI penetration is limited in  the elections for deputies and senators, just as it is for local  legislative representatives in some municipalities of less  importance.    -  In Guanajuato, with virtually 4 million inhabitants,  49 percent of people of voting age, and in one of the three  PAN-controlled states, there is a minimal degree of conflict.  It has not been ruled out, however, that there may be  vulnerable areas or possible postelectoral conflicts.    -  Guerrero,  one of the areas in which the FDN [National Democratic Front]  won the elections by a majority in 1988, is one of the most  vulnerable electoral regions for the PRI. This is where Procup  [Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party], the  Progressive Party of Guerrero, and the Guerrero Civic Party have  the greatest penetration.    Some business groups also play a decisive role: Ruben  Figueroa Alcocer, Israel Soberanis Nogueda, and Max Tejeda. The  Catholic Church also maintains a great deal of influence here.    This is a state that has a climate that could engender  conflicts that are not only social, but also political-electoral  in nature.     -  In Jalisco, civilian society is very upset over  the negligence with which public officials are carrying out  their work, both at the state and municipal level. Jalisco  could represent a favorable vote for the PRI candidate, but not  for the party's senatorial and deputy candidates.    -  In the state  of Mexico, with more than 9.8 million inhabitants, social  sectors are disgruntled, above all among PRI militants, as is  evidenced by the occupation of mayoral offices, the blocking of  highways, and frequent demonstrations. The climate is ripe for  political and social conflicts.    The regions most vulnerable for the PRI are Valle de Chalco,  Chimalhuacan, Nezhualcoyotl, Los Reyes la Paz, Tejupilco, and  San Mateo Atenco.    To a great extent, the power the PRI still holds is  attributable to the aid the National Solidarity Program has  earmarked to traditionally overlooked areas; this, in turn, has  favored the PRI.    Meanwhile, the PAN comprises people from the middle-high  class. Proof of this is in the zone in which the PRI has not  been able to win one position [casilla] in several elections.  It (PAN) is the third political force.    As far at the PRD is concerned, its focus of action and  penetration lies mainly in areas most unprotected and forgotten  by the authorities.     -  The PRD's main bastion is Michoacan,  where 17.5 percent of the working population comprise artisans  and laborers and 33.7 percent of the population are farmers.    This is the state with one of the greatest risks of  political  upheaval by way of post-electoral protests and demonstrations.  For the election of deputies, senators, and president of the  Republic, this state is one of weakest in terms of PRI  support.Morelos, where the rural vote is decisive, does not  represent an area totally opposed to the PRI. Nevertheless, the  PRD's influence among the Morelos peasants cannot be  dismissed.268460096n Nayarit, there is a possible majority vote for the  PRI in the election for president of the republic, but this does  not hold true in the election of deputies and senators.Nuevo  Leon is a state in which there is no immediate climate for  political conflict. Nevertheless, there is a certain level of  discontent among lower social classes, teachers, and some labor  groups. The PRI is strong in this region.2000060100axaca, as other  states in the nation, has been fated by several administrations  to economic, social, and political backwardness. Therefore, the  state's serious economic inequalities, extreme abandonment, and  poverty are a fertile ground for the rise of political groups  linked to the defense of human rights.    This region is ripe for post-electoral conflicts.     -  In San  Luis Potosi, where there is strong PRD influence, there a  political and social explosion is waiting to happen. This area  is very weak in terms of PRI voters, particularly in the  presidential elections.    -  Tabasco, which in the past three years  has become totally polarized as a result of the diverse  political, social, and economic problems, is susceptible to  political and social conflicts. This region is vulnerable for  the PRI.    -  In Yucatan, there are approximately 400,000 unhappy PRI  members; therefore, there exists a climate ripe for political  conflicts. This could be a stumbling block for the PRI and help  the PAN in the federal elections, particularly with regard to  the federal deputies and senators.</p>

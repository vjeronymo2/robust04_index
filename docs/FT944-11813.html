			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Modest rise in new mortgages New net mortgage lending in September was only slightly higher than a year ago, according to figures published yesterday which further underline the slowness and fragility of the UK mortgage market recovery. Bank of England statistics show new net lending totalled Pounds 2.11bn in September compared with Pounds 2.05bn in the corresponding month last year. A similar picture emerges from the statistics for loans approved, an important forward-looking indicator since they translate into lending undertaken in the following weeks. In September 83,000 loans were approved, compared with 82,000 in the same month last year. New gross lending was, however, higher this September than last, standing at Pounds 5.2bn, compared with Pounds 4.59bn. The figures also underline how market shares have changed in the total amounts lent. In September building societies carried out more than 60 per cent of the new net lending. Last September, when fixed-rate mortgages offered by banks were particularly popular, banks and societies both undertook about the same amounts of lending. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, societies and centralised lenders, said levels of mortgage activity were 'only modest' and reiterated its warnings against 'nasty shocks' for the housing market in the Budget.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee responds belatedly to Brazilian export move The May coffee futures price rose by Dollars 16 at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday to Dollars 1,179 a tonne in a belated response to Wednesday's news that the Brazilian government would hand over the management of the coffee retention scheme to the private sector. The move was encouraged by rumours of heavy buying by a big European roaster. Traders were sceptical that the exporting companies would be able to run the retention scheme more efficiently than the government, but also pushed prices higher in the expectation that changes in its operation would tie up some coffee stocks for several weeks. When the coffee retention scheme, which involves withholding 20 per cent of exports from the market, began in October the Brazilian government said it would organise the stockpile for six months. The only surprise in Wednesday's announcement was that it came in February rather than early March. The government had problems keeping 20 per cent of supplies back, but traders doubted the private sector, which is subject to commercial rather than political pressures, would manage any better. While the retention scheme has succeeded in underpinning prices, sharp falls in production in Colombia and a downturn in Mexican output are expected to drive prices higher in the next few months. This week's International Coffee Organisation meeting in London agreed to retain the organisation as an administrative body conducting studies and surveys. The decision follows the failure of the ICO to agree on price stabilisation measures and the US decision to leave the body last year.</p>

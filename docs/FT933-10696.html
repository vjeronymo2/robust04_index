			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / People: Aquascutum loses Paul Bennett Paul Bennett is retiring as chairman of Aquascutum, the upmarket fashion retailer renowned for supplying outfits to Baroness Thatcher. Bennett is handing over to James Stokes, who has worked closely with him as joint managing director for the past two years. Bennett, 65, joined the chain in 1960 as the company's representative in Japan. He built up the Far East business from virtually a one-man operation into one of Aquascutum's most important markets. After the company was bought for Pounds 74m by Renown, the Japanese clothing company, Bennett was invited back to the UK to become chairman and joint managing director in 1991. James Stokes, 58, trained as an accountant and joined Aquascutum in 1962. He was financial director until 1991, when he was appointed joint managing director with Bennett, and has also acted as deputy chairman of the company since 1982. Bennett says he he has overseen the transition of Aquascutum from a 'closed enterprise' to a subsidiary of an international group and feels he can now 'gracefully retire'.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STREET VENDORS PROTEST POLICE ARREST METHODS  </P> <P> About 70 demonstrators carrying signs that said "We are vendors, not  criminals," and shouting in Spanish, "Work, yes. Repression, no," marched in  front of the Rampart Police Division Headquarters on Thursday to protest what  they said is excessive use of force by officers arresting street vendors near  McArthur Park and other areas near downtown.  </P> <P> The protest is the latest wrinkle in a long-running flap between street  vendors, who say they are just trying to make a living, and police, who say the  vendors are violating a city ordinance that prohibits pedestrians from selling  food or merchandise on public streets.  </P> <P> Several vendors in the crowd of protesters said police had roughed them up as  they were arresting them, and had confiscated their merchandise. Rampart police  did not return calls.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley With yesterday's decision to refer the Tarmac-Steetley joint venture to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the options for restructuring Britain's building materials industry have dramatically narrowed. A Tarmac-Steetley solution looks dead in the water, perhaps the only outstanding question being whether Tarmac turns to Ibstock Johnsen for an encore. On the fairly safe assumption that Redland can now avoid a referral by submitting undertakings, Steetley is left ever more vulnerable looking down the barrel of a Pounds 620m bid. Its main defence is anticipated next week, and will doubtless focus on asset value and Redland's ACT difficulties in an effort to force up the terms. The market appears to have accepted, though, that Redland's opening shot was pretty close to the mark. Admittedly there has been a certain amount of buying interest for the likes of Blue Circle and RMC since the bid was launched before Christmas - but this has been highly selective and might well have passed Steetley by. At this stage the main reason for Redland to sweeten its offer would be to win the recommendation of the Steetley board.</p>

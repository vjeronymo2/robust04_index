			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Japanese drugs groups to hear price cut details today Drugs groups in Japan will today learn how much the government intends to cut pharmaceutical prices. The companies expect reductions to average 6.5-7 per cent, further undermining growth of a sluggish Japanese medicines market. The industry fears the Japanese market, the world's second largest, could fail to grow over the next few years following the latest price cuts and other government-inspired efforts to limit demand for medicines. Mr Toshihide Yoda, drugs analyst at UBS Securities, estimates the market will fall 0.9 per cent this year. 'There is no growth potential in the Japanese market for the rest of the century,' he warns. Japanese companies will be hit particularly because of their dependence on the domestic market. Only three Japanese companies generate more than 10 per cent of their sales overseas. The Ministry of Health and Welfare is also expected to tell manufacturers that in addition to the regular biennial price reductions, there will be special price cuts for fast-selling products such as cholesterol-lowering drugs and interferons. One pharmaceuticals group believes the special cuts for cholesterol medicines could be about 12 per cent, while the interferon prices could be cut by 13-20 per cent. After the ministry tells the drugs companies of the scale of the cuts, they will be able to appeal. Prices for the next two years will be announced around March 10, and implemented on April 1. The price cuts will probably hit Sankyo, Japan's second largest drugs group, hardest. The price of its cholesterol medicine Mevalotin will be reduced. Last year, the product generated sales of Y86bn (Pounds 515m), representing about 21 per cent of Sankyo's turnover, according to brokers Merrill Lynch. Banyu, the subsidiary of the US group Merck, will also lose sales when the price of Lipovas, its cholesterol drug, is cut. The compound was one of the group's fastest-growing products last year, generating sales of about Y16.6bn, compared with group turnover of Y122bn. Among interferon manufacturers, Sumitomo Pharmaceutical is likely to be worst affected. Sumiferon, its compound for hepatitis C licensed from Wellcome of the UK, controls 40 per cent of the market, with sales of about Y50bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eamonn Mallie, Anthony Bevins and David Rose: </F> "Sinn Fein Ready To Explore Ways Round Deadlock"]    [Text] A possible move to break the political deadlock  over December's Anglo-Irish Declaration was signalled yesterday  by the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams.    Asked in a BBC interview whether he would pick up the recent  suggestion of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland  Secretary, that Sinn Fein requests for clarification of the  declaration might be considered by London, Mr Adams said:  ``We're exploring that, and I won't say I am hopeful.    ``I have always said we would be flexible in allowing them  to  get off the hook which they got themselves on to on  clarification. We don't want any big public climbdown by them.  We are pursuing the issue.''    It was unclear whether Mr Adams was about to submit a list  of  questions to the British Government, detailing the points on  which Sinn Fein or the IRA wanted clarification.    Albert Reynolds, Irish Prime Minister, said last week: ``I  would hope that we would be able to draw the process of  clarification to a conclusion shortly, because there is, in my  opinion, not a great deal more that can be said at this stage.''    That statement was read as a warning to Sinn Fein that Mr  Reynolds' patience was running out. The Taoiseach [Irish prime  minister] is known to have sent a 16-page letter of  clarification to Sinn Fein last February. But London and Dublin  sources said last week political talks were going ahead -- with  or without Sinn Fein.    THE OBSERVER has been told that the Republicans have more or  less completed their analysis of the Downing Street Declaration.  Those dedicated to assessing it are now working on other  issues, according to a senior Sinn Fein source.    That disclosure came at the end of a week of bloodletting in  Northern Ireland in which 10 people died, four of them killed by  the IRA.    In the latest incident yesterday morning, the UFF [Ulster  Freedom Fighters] shot and critically wounded a 39-year-old  Catholic security man at the Valley Business Centre in  Newtonabbey.    The body of a man, killed by the IRA and dumped on  Newry/Omeath Road in South Down on Friday afternoon, was  recovered by the security forces yesterday.    The IRA named him as Martin Brown, from Downpatrick, and  alleged that he was an RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] Special  Branch informer. The man, who had his hands tied behind his  back and was shot in the head, was the tenth person to be  murdered by the paramilitaries in nine days.    Until last Sunday, when John McCloy and Alan Smith (both  Protestants) were killed in Garvagh, south Londonderry, the IRA  had exclusively targeted members of the security forces since  the publication of the declaration. One Republican said: "It's  back to business as usual for the IRA, I suppose."    Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that last week's claim by  the  Government that the IRA had held secret meetings with the  Iranian secret intelligence service, the MOIS, had followed a  joint operation involving all three elements of Britain's secret  world: MI5, MI6 and GCHQ [Government Communication Headquarters].    It was co-ordinated by MI5, which has had "lead  responsibility" for combating Irish terrorism since last year.  MI5 directed the operation, with MI6 conducting surveillance in  several European cities.    It is understood vital parts of a picture described by  Whitehall sources as a "patchwork quilt" of intelligence emerged  from the bugging of international telephone and fax messages by  GCHQ in Cheltenham.    The decision to make the intelligence public was taken by  politicians on MI5 advice. The service considered the prospects  of prosecuting any of those involved were remote: the meetings  took place on foreign soil; several of those involved from Iran  had diplomatic immunity; and it would have been almost  impossible to put together a viable case relating to any  specific criminal offence. Therefore it was decided to disrupt  the link by publicising it.    It is understood Iran has already made cash donations to the  IRA through Sinn Fein, but the sums involved are small. In the  IRA-MOIS meetings, much bigger donations were discussed,  together with weapons shipments.    The IRA representatives were known quartermasters with  experience in the international arms market. It is believed  their work was sanctioned by the Army Council.</p>

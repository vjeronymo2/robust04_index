			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 4 Apr (EFE) -- It was reported here today  that the Ecuadoran Government has implemented measures to ensure  and encourage a free market system and to increase production in  the country's different industrial sectors. According to the new  rules, investments in Ecuador's private sector will not require  a patent, license, registration, permit, or certificate.  Meanwhile, numerous decrees, laws, and administrative rules  that had placed restrictions or limitations on industry and free  trade were repealed.    The price of all local or imported goods, products, and  services will be subject only to the free market laws without  state controls, which means their prices will be established by  the law of supply and demand, based on their quality and price.  The new rules state that all products, goods, and livestock will  be allowed free movement, transportation, and transit across the  country without having to obtain a license or administrative  authorization. Also, from now on, all Ecuadoran goods and  products are exportable, with a few exceptions subject to  quotas, restrictions, or limitations foreseen in the Law for  Expediting Exports and Over Water Routes.</p>

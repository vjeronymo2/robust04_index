			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LIKE A METEOR, S&amp;L CAME AND WENT BEFORE ANYONE KNEW IT CRASHED  </P> <P> Even in an era when savings and loans were failing at a fast clip, regulators  were amazed at how quickly Seapointe Savings &amp; Loan of Carlsbad was forced  to close.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L opened for business in a Carlsbad shopping center April 17, 1985,  and, in little over a year, lost more than $24 million. On May 30, 1986, the  Federal Home Loan Bank Board found Seapointe to be insolvent, its assets and  capital dissipated by what federal regulators have described as a risky and  fraudulent commodities and futures trading strategy set in motion by Strategic  Investment Services, a Riverside-based financial adviser.  </P> <P> "You blinked and (Seapointe) was gone," said William Davis, assistant  commissioner with the state Department of Savings and Loans. "Everything  happened so quickly that regulators were just behind (on detecting) . . . the  problems."  </P> <P> Seapointe's brief existence also caught many S&amp;L executives in San Diego  County by surprise. "Seapointe was like a meteor," according to one S&amp;L  industry observer. "Nobody really knew it was there and all of a sudden it  simply exploded."  </P> <P> In reports to state regulators, Seapointe's executives described a fairly  traditional S&amp;L that was growing in accordance with its conservative  business plan. State regulators never conducted an in-depth review of Seapointe  because the institution simply wasn't around long enough, Davis said.  </P> <P> "It looked pretty clean, right up until" the last report before the staggering  losses occurred, Davis said.  </P> <P> The reports that regulators were reviewing, however, masked the unusual and  risky commodities- and futures-trading strategy that the financial adviser had  devised to protect Seapointe from swings in interest rates. That strategy, when  coupled with other unusual practices, led the S&amp;L to suffer a stunning  string of losses in early 1986.  </P> <P> According to regulators, once Seapointe's losses appeared, there was very  little that could be done -- largely because the S&amp;L's complex options- and  futures-trading strategy generated a $15.9-million loss on a single day in  early February, 1986. That loss grew to $18 million in just four days,  according to a recently amended lawsuit filed by the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corp.  </P> <P> State regulators first considered a merger or an outright sale of Seapointe's  remaining assets. But the losses had drained Seapointe's capital and regulators  eventually sold the S&amp;L's insured deposits to Monterey Savings Bank of  Monterey Park for $42,000.  </P> <P> According to a lawsuit amended earlier this month by the Federal Savings and  Loan Insurance Corp., there were several reasons for the S&amp;L's unexpected  failure:  </P> <P> * Unlike most failed S&amp;Ls, Seapointe was not destroyed by bad loans. In  fact, Seapointe had yet to make its first loan -- or even hire a loan officer  -- when federal regulators seized the institution. It instead used the deposits  and its equity to purchase government securities, hoping to realize a profit on  its interest-rate spread.  </P> <P> Although that no-loan strategy was unusual, "it was not unique" during the  mid-1980s, according to Davis.  </P> <P> * Within two months of opening, Seapointe had attracted $31.8 million in  deposits -- of which all but $6.3 million were Jumbo CDs. Although Jumbo  CDs-certificates of deposit with a minimum worth of $100,000 -- help  institutions build deposits quickly, they typically carry higher-than-average  interest rates, which makes it harder for institutions to turn a profit. Jumbo  CDs are also viewed as an unstable source of capital for S&amp;Ls because  fickle depositors often withdraw and redeposit their funds elsewhere if they  can receive a better interest rate.  </P> <P> In contrast, Seapointe's business plan called for Jumbo CDs to account for just  15% of total deposits throughout the first three years. The conservative plan  also called for Seapointe's total deposits to grow slowly to $12 million during  the first year, $27 million in the second year and $47 million by end of the  third year.  </P> <P> According to the FSLIC suit, Seapointe's collapse was caused by the complex  trading strategy that Strategic Investment devised to protect Seapointe from  interest-rate swings. Although S&amp;Ls traditionally use trading schemes as  hedges against rate swings, the FSLIC suit alleges that Seapointe's trading  strategy was actually a speculative -- and, consequently -- illegal program.  </P> <P> Seapointe "risked and lost the entire net worth of the association, plus its  Jumbo CD deposits, to conduct a speculative trading strategy built on the  ultimately erroneous assumption that interest rates would rise," according to  the suit.  </P> <P> "At the time, (Seapointe was) the only institution that I knew of that was  dealing so aggressively in these types of securities," Davis said.  </P> <P> Seapointe "hired what they felt was an expert to transact their business and  they relied totally upon their judgment," recalled Davis. "Then, whammo . . .  they were out of business."  </P> <P> Seapointe's use and alleged abuse of futures and options trading ran contrary  to the staid plan that regulators approved during the early 1980s, when  Seapointe was struggling to find enough capital to open its doors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planned to Be Traditional  </P> <P> According to that plan, Seapointe would be a "traditional" S&amp;L that would  use locally generated retail deposits to finance home mortgages in the Carlsbad  area.  </P> <P> To manage interest-rate risk, Seapointe would not "presume to outguess the  marketplace" or "risk the net worth of the institution in an attempt to 'make a  killing' for the sake of short-term earnings."  </P> <P> Although Seapointe's business plan devoted a full page to outlining its  interest-rate risk strategy, regulators have maintained that there was no  mention of the futures and commodity options that Strategic Investment  developed.  </P> <P> Events leading to that failure were described earlier this month in the FSLIC  lawsuit that seeks $24 million in damages from Strategic Investment and Kidder  Peabody, the New York-based investment firm that conducted trades for  Seapointe.  </P> <P> A San Diego attorney who represents Strategic Investment and Dirk Rose, its  founder and president, declined to comment on the suit. A spokeswoman for  Kidder Peabody has denied any wrongdoing in Seapointe's failure.  </P> <P> The Seapointe suit is one of many to spring from federal investigations that  try to set blame -- and, if possible, recoup losses -- in connection with the  continuing stream of S&amp;L failures. Already, more than 100 lawsuits have  been filed against S&amp;Ls and their advisers, Federal Home Loan Bank Board  member Lawrence J. White said during a press conference last week in San Diego.  </P> <P> The FSLIC suit stemming from Seapointe's failure is one of a growing number  that hold outside professionals responsible for S&amp;L failures. "We've been  suing the accountants, lawyers and others," White said. "There will be a strong  effort to bring more and more of the parties" to trial.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hold Directors Responsible  </P> <P> Federal regulators also are exerting "more and more pressure on thrift  directors to set (responsible) policies," White said. "We're not expecting them  to become 'rocket scientists,' but we do want them to look harder at what  they're signing off on."  </P> <P> Despite Seapointe's dramatic failure, its officers and its board of directors  -- including Ernest Dronenburg Jr., a member of the state Board of Equalization  -- were not named in the lawsuit filed in the FSLIC suit.  </P> <P> Dronenburg has denied any knowledge of the allegedly fraudulent trading scheme  that Strategic Investment developed to shield Seapointe from unexpected  interest rate swings. "There was a lot of deception going on," according to  Dronenburg.  </P> <P> Seapointe was "the only case I can recall where not one member of management or  the board" was held responsible when federal regulators went to court to seek  damages in the wake of an S&amp;L failure, Davis said.  </P> <P> Seapointe's directors were unaware that Strategic Investment had developed a  risky and illegal trading strategy that left the S&amp;L open to "a potentially  unlimited loss" in the event of an interest-rate swing, according to the FSLIC  suit.  </P> <P> "What struck me was the total lack of sophistication of the management and  directors for those types of transactions," Davis said. "They didn't know a  damn thing about" futures and commodities trading.  </P> <P> Seapointe's failure surprised the state Department of Savings and Loans, in  part because regulators were beset by a dramatically changing industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Regulators Swamped  </P> <P> At the time Seapointe was seized, regulators were responsible for 158  state-chartered S&amp;Ls. Savings-and-loan examiners also were processing  applications from more than 100 groups that wanted to open new S&amp;Ls. And,  during 1985 and 1986 alone, regulators took over or created conservatorships  for 23 state-chartered institutions.  </P> <P> The state had been slowly bolstering its inspection team to meet the growing  workload, but, even by 1987, there were still only 79 S&amp;L examiners.  </P> <P> "When it blew, it caught everyone unaware," recalled David Ross, who had become  Seapointe's second president just weeks before the dramatic losses. Ross, who  now works for an executive search firm in Orange County, had been hired to  bolster Seapointe's anemic retail deposits. The trading strategy "was already  in motion when I got there," Ross said.  </P> <P> Ross linked the losses to "very rapid movements in oil prices during the first  few weeks of 1986. . . . That kicked off a very precipitous change in interest  rates," which caused Strategic Investment's trading strategy to collapse.  </P> <P> Seapointe, which dismissed Strategic Investment one day after learning about  the $15.9-million loss, decided to seek damages by filing suit against the  financial-advice firm and Kidder Peabody. However, federal regulators took over  the troubled S&amp;L the same day that Seapointe's board voted to file a suit,  and the lawsuit was never filed.  </P> <P> "The lawsuit (became) moot at that point," Ross said. "I ended up being a  caretaker for four months. That was basically my job."  </P> <P> Interestingly, a capital shortfall almost kept Seapointe from ever opening for  business.  </P> <P> Seapointe's initial board of directors, which included mostly San Diego County  residents, had trouble gathering $2 million in capital needed to gain deposit  insurance from federal regulators.  </P> <P> As the group approached $2 million, regulators increased Seapointe's regulatory  capital minimum to $3 million and many of the original investors backed out.  "Evidently, it was one thing to be just a couple of thousand dollars short and  another to be $1 million short," Ross said.  </P> <P> Early in October, 1984, Strategic Investment's Rose told Seapointe's board that  he could attract investors with enough capital to meet the stricter capital  requirement. Rose eventually solicited 51% to 80% of Seapointe's capital,  according to federal regulators.  </P> <P> But, with that new wave of investors, control of the Carlsbad-based S&amp;L  passed to investors who were largely from outside San Diego County.  </P></p>

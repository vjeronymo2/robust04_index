			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The great leader  President Kim Il-song received a letter of thanks sent by  Rodrigo Carazo, Ex- President of Costa Rica and chairman of the  International Commission for the Peaceful Reunification of  Korea, and Antonio Betancourt, deputy secretary general of the  Federation for World Peace and executive director of the Summit  Council for World Peace, on behalf of the Pyongyang-visiting  group of former heads of state and government and politicians of  different countries.    Extending thanks to President Kim Il-song from the bottom of  their hearts for his invitation and hospitality, the letter  dated April 19 says:    We came here in the interest not only of regional peace and  stability but ultimately of world peace and stability.    To achieve this it was imperative to have the presence not  only of world leaders comprising the summit council's  international commission for the peaceful Reunification of  Korea, but of world media, consisting of the THE WASHINGTON  TIMES, CNN, and NHK, who would reach out to all corners of the  world, and give unbiased, fair, objective and respectful  reporting covering your side of the story on the different  issues that divide world opinion. These media came not only to  hear your views directly but to report on the astounding  progress this nation has made through self-reliance, rebuilding  itself out of the ashes of war. The reports we have heard from  around the world are that everyone is absolutely happy with the  constructive media coverage generated from this trip.    We feel very happy and satisfied with our work. We leave  with a renewed commitment to continue our work for the peaceful  resolution of the difficulties on the Korean peninsula.</p>

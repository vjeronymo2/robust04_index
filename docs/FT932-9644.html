Mr Janusz Walus, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis and his wife, Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis, said nothing as a magistrate agreed to a state request to adjourn the case to May 21. Reuter adds from Durban: South Africa lost up to R500m (Pounds 102m) in tourism earnings last year as a direct result of political violence, Mr Piet van Hoven, chairman of the tourism board Satour, said yesterday.</p>

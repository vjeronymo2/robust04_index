Aksenov and Captain 1st Rank K. Lumpurov]    [Text] This article, prepared from foreign press materials,  provides a brief analysis of the status and immediate  development prospects of navies of NATO member states (above all  their numerical strength and ship order of battle) under new  conditions.    The U.S. military-political leadership regards a powerful  fleet as a necessary attribute of a superpower and one of the  main tools for ensuring U.S. interests on a global scale. In a  report on national military strategy (January 1992), the  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that "geography  endowed the United States with a defensive shield, but national  security is linked firmly with events across the oceans and with  possibilities of access to various regions." The experience of  combat employment of naval forces in recent years, above all in  the Persian Gulf, demonstrated the Navy's increased importance  in accomplishing missions of military presence in areas of the  globe remote from the United States, in prompt reaction to  crises and in vigorous operations in them. The Navy is given a  special role in connection with the closing of a number of U.S.  military bases on foreign territories.    Assurance of U.S. Navy readiness to take part in regional  conflicts, above all in Europe, the Persian Gulf and the Far  East, is becoming the important element in U.S. Navy  organizational development and employment. In case a global  threat is revived, measures are envisaged for an emergency  buildup of the effective combat strength of regular forces to  the necessary level. On the whole, it is planned to keep the  Navy in a high condition of combat and mobilization readiness.  (As announced in the 1994 budget report, 40-45 percent of ships  presently are at sea each day, including 20-25 percent on combat  duty in forward areas), continue programs for developing the  fleet and its reserve components, and ensure effective work of  the shipbuilding industry.    U.S. Navy activity in maintaining stability in various  regions of the world requires corrections to be made to combat  training plans aimed at additional rehearsal of missions in  combating navies of developing countries equipped with modern  weapons and military equipment. Above all, this concerns  anti-submarine and anti-mine defense in "shallow-water areas"  and organization of a more effective defense against small  surface craft and missiles.    To strengthen its influence and develop remote TVD's  [theaters of military operations], it is planned to expand the  scale of two-sided combat training of fleets of the United  States and other countries (the aforementioned report notes that  in 1992 alone the Americans took part in 216 joint exercises  with fleets of 58 countries) and to make fuller use of U.S. Navy  capabilities for giving humanitarian aid and for fighting the  drug trade and terrorism.    At the same time, the priorities of matters being decided by  the Navy are changing under conditions of the new  military-strategic situation. According to U.S. Navy command  statements, because of sharply decreased activeness of Russian  Navy combat training and increased effectiveness of national  global surveillance and reconnaissance systems in sea and ocean  TVD's, it is becoming possible to reduce maneuverable ASW forces  providing protection for ocean and sea lines of communication.  Based on experience of Operation Desert Shield, the mission of  such ASW forces now reduces merely to creating "protected zones  of lines of communication" in areas adjoining a combat  operations zone.    In accordance with basic provisions of the concept for Navy  organizational and combat employment adopted in 1992 known as  "operation from the sea" (and not on the sea as in previous  "maritime strategy"), the Navy's primary mission becomes  assurance both of sea supremacy as well as superiority in air  space and outer space over the waters and territory of a combat  operations zone.    According to data of the reference "Jane's Fighting Ships,  1993-1994," the numerical strength of the U.S. Navy (not  counting Marines, Naval Aviation and other components) as of the  beginning of 1994 was 708,000 persons and the ship order of  battle numbered 400-307 combatant ships and 60 auxiliary vessels  in the regular forces and 33 ships in the Naval Reserve. In  addition, 70 ships and vessels were in mothballs and 47 patrol  ships and around 200 vessels and small craft were part of the  Coast Guard, which in peacetime is subordinate to the Department  of Transportation.    The country's Navy is divided into strategic sea-based  nuclear forces and general purpose forces according to missions  to be performed.    Nuclear powered missile submarines (SSBN's) hold a  special place both in the makeup of the country's strategic  nuclear forces as well as in the Navy's organizational  structure. The ballistic missiles (SLBM's) with great striking  power, range and accuracy that are aboard them make these  submarines, which possess high readiness for combat employment  and survivability, the most effective means of nuclear attack  compared with land-based ICBM's and strategic bombers.    By the beginning of 1992[.sup]1[/] the number of U.S.  SSBN's was 34 and there were 640 ballistic missiles (5,440  nuclear warheads) accommodated aboard them. In January 1994 22  SSBN's (464 SLBM's, 5,056 warheads)--14 Ohio-Class and 8  Lafayette-Class--remained in the U.S. Navy.    Plans are that in four years there should be a total of 18  Ohio-Class SSBN's in the U.S. Navy order of battle. It is  planned to remove Lafayette-Class submarines, which are  exhausting their service life, from operational status gradually.    With the aim of fulfilling requirements of the Treaty on the  Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (the total  number of nuclear warheads of SLBM's and ICBM's must not exceed  4,900), it is envisaged recycling or eliminating all obsolete  SSBN's and SLBM's. At the same time it is proposed to up-arm the  first eight submarines in the Ohio-class series with Trident II  missiles in place of Trident I missiles. (The possibility of  such modernization was included in their design). Specifications  and performance characteristics of ballistic missile  modifications are given below.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Trident I                |Trident II               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year operational         |1979                     |1990                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Launch weight, t         |32                       |57.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length, m                |10.36                    |13.42                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Diameter, m              |1.88                     |2.11                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum range, km        |7,400                    |12,000                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Accuracy (CEP), m        |450                      |90                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Type of reentry vehicle, |MIRV, 8x100 or MARV, 6x10|MIRV, 12x150 or MARV, 7x4|  |number of warheads x yie-|0                        |75                       |  |ld, KT                   |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Guidance system          |Inertial with stellar correction                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Ohio-Class SSBN's have been constructed since 1974. The lead  submarine was launched in 1979 and transferred to the Navy in  November 1981. Her specifications and performance  characteristics are as follows: surface displacement 16,600 t,  submerged displacement 18,700 t; principal dimensions--length  170.7 m, beam 12.8 m, draft 10.8 m; output of nuclear power  plant (S8G water-moderated reactor, recharging of core every  nine years) of 60,000 hp permits providing a submerged speed of  25 knots; normal operating depth 300 m; armament--24 Trident I  or Trident II SLBM's, four 533-mm torpedo tubes. There are two  crews (Blue and Gold) for each submarine consisting of 155  persons each, including 15 officers.    From the moment of transfer to the Navy until removal from  operational status an SSBN must be at sea at least 66 percent of  the time, including major overhaul periods (combined with  recharging of the nuclear reactor). One SSBN combat employment  cycle consists of a 70-day patrol and a 25-day period, which  includes the submarine's transfer to the other crew, maintenance  between patrols, transfer of ammunition and so on.    The first eight SSBN's (SSBN 726-733, stationed at Bangor  Naval Base in Washington) perform duty in Pacific waters and the  other six (SSBN 734-739, Kings Bay, Georgia) in the Atlantic.  Those naval bases are specially equipped for reception, docking,  loading and unloading of ammunition, degaussing of SSBN's, and  for personnel and families to rest and live.    Communications and command and control of submarines are  accomplished in particular using very low frequency radio gear,  ground systems of which are located on territory of the states  of Michigan (opened in 1986) and Wisconsin (1991).    As they are outfitted with increasingly powerful offensive  weapon systems, general purpose forces become an  effective reserve of strategic forces and are an irreplaceable  means, tested many times, of achieving military-political goals  in local conflicts. They include nuclear powered multipurpose  submarines, surface ships (aircraft carriers, cruisers,  destroyers, frigates, mine warfare ships and landing ships) and  auxiliary vessels.    As of the beginning of the current year, the U.S. Navy  numbered 87 nuclear powered multipurpose submarines (SSN's), of  which 54 are of the Los Angeles Class (Fig. 1 [figure not  reproduced], during 1992-1993 six with side numbers SSN 759-765  and 767 were included in the order of battle and SSN 689 Baton  Rouge was turned over for scrap); 30 Sturgeon Class (two SSN's,  SSN 663 Hammerhead and SSN 687 Richard B. Russell, were removed  from the regular forces in 1993 and taken off Navy rolls, and it  is planned to remove SSN 637, 648, 650, 662 and 679 from the  Navy order of battle in 1994); and one Narwhal-Class (SSN 671).  In addition, SSBN 642 Kamehameha and 645 James K. Polk, refitted  for supporting U.S. Navy Special Operations Forces raiding and  reconnaissance parties, were reclassified as multipurpose SSN's.    It is planned to commission the last Los Angeles-Class SSN  in  the series, SSN 773 Cheyenne, in August 1996. Their construction  began in 1972 (the lead submarine was transferred to the Navy in  November 1976). Submerged displacement of the SSN's is 6,927 t;  the nuclear power plant (S6G reactor), with an output of 35,000  hp, permits developing a submerged speed of 32 knots;  submergence depth is 450 m; standard ammunition 26-8 Tomahawk  cruise missiles, 4 Harpoon antiship missiles and 14 Mk 48  torpedoes (there are four 533-mm torpedo tubes). All SSN's are  equipped for under-ice navigation, and beginning with the 32nd  submarine (SSN 719 Providence), they are additionally equipped  with a vertical launcher for 12 Tomahawk missiles (outside the  pressure hull in the forebody). According to foreign press  information, nine ships of this class successfully participated  in the war against Iraq in 1991 and two submarines delivered  Tomahawk cruise missile strikes against Iraqi territory from the  Eastern Mediterranean.    The Americans presently are building two SSN's of a new  class, SSN 21 Seawolf and SSN 22 Connecticut, and their  commissioning is planned for 1996 and 1998 respectively.  Initially, it was envisaged building up to 30 such ships, but  this program was revised in favor of less costly SSN-X  Centurion-Class SSN's. The latter's capabilities are assessed to  be 25 percent lower. Basic specifications and performance  characteristics of Seawolf are as follows: surface displacement  7,460 t, submerged displacement 9,137 t; hull length 107.6 m,  beam 12.9 m, draft 10.9 m; the nuclear power plant (S6W reactor)  with an output of 52,000 hp permits developing a submerged speed  of 35 knots; submergence depth 610 m; and standard ammunition  may include up to 54 (Tomahawk cruise missiles, Harpoon antiship  missiles, torpedoes, mines) employed from eight torpedo tubes of  increased diameter.    Aircraft carriers are the Navy's main striking force. As  part  of battle groups and in coordination with mixed naval forces,  they perform missions of winning sea supremacy and air  superiority, delivering strikes by deck-based aircraft against  targets in the interior of enemy territory, providing air  support to amphibious landings and operations of ground troops  on coastal axes, accomplishing blockade operations and a number  of other missions.    The Navy's regular forces presently number 13 carriers, of  which six are of the Chester W. Nimitz Class (CVN 68-73), four  of the Kitty Hawk Class (CV 63, 64, 66, 67), two of the  Forrestal Class (CV 60, 62) and one of the Enterprise Class (CVN  65). Ten ships are part of combat-ready forces. The carriers  Enterprise and John F. Kennedy (CV 67) are in major overhaul  until May 1994 and September 1995 respectively, and following  sea trials work is being done on the latest nuclear powered  carrier, George Washington (CVN 73), transferred to the Navy on  4 July 1992 (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]).    The carrier Ranger (CV 61) was decommissioned 10 July 1993  and is in mothballs at Bremerton, Washington. The carrier  Forrestal was reclassified as a training carrier (ATV 59) in  February 1992. Up to the end of the 1990's it is planned to  decommission three ships of this type: Saratoga (CV 60),  Independence (CV 62) and America (CV 66), built in 1956, 1959  and 1965 respectively.    Under the program for development of carrier forces, two  Chester W. Nimitz-Class nuclear powered carriers, John Stennis  (CVN 74) and United States (CVN 75), are in various stages of  construction, with planned dates of transfer to the Navy in 1996  and 1998. One billion dollars were allocated in fiscal year [FY]  1994 for procurement of equipment and materials for building a  ninth ship of this class; it is envisaged having ten such  carriers in the early 2000's.    On the whole, despite budget and other limitations,  construction of nuclear powered carriers continues in the United  States, thanks to which the U.S. Navy will continue to have a  monopoly on this kind of weapon in the next few years.    Cruisers, destroyers and frigates hold an important place in  the makeup of the Navy's general purpose forces (all  battleships--Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri and Wisconsin--were  mothballed). They are intended for delivery of strikes both  against naval and shore targets as well as against targets in  the interior of enemy territory, for operations above all as  part of carrier, missile and ship battle groups, and for defense  of amphibious landing groups and convoys.    There were 45 cruisers in U.S. Navy regular forces at the  beginning of this year: 9 nuclear powered--CGN 9 Long Beach, CGN  25 Bainbridge, CGN 35 Truxton, CGN 36 California, CGN 37 South  Carolina, CGN 38 Virginia, CGN 39 Texas, CGN 40 Mississippi and  CGN 41 Arkansas; 6 Belknap Class (CG 26, 29-33); 4 Leahy Class  (CG 19, 20, 22, 23), and 26 Ticonderoga Class (CG 47-72). Three  Belknap-Class cruisers (CG 27, 28 and 34) and 5 Leahy-Class  cruisers (CG 16-18, 21 and 24) were taken off operational status  and removed from the rolls in 1993.    In the next three years it is planned to eliminate from the  order of battle the nuclear powered cruisers Long Beach,  Bainbridge and Truxton, built in the 1960's, three  Virginia-Class nuclear powered cruisers, and all remaining  Leahy-Class and Belknap-Class ships, and to transfer to the  fleet in 1994 the 27th and last in the series of  Ticonderoga-Class cruisers (Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]).    In just the last two years the Navy received six of the  newest cruisers of this class, which became the embodiment of  modern U.S. shipbuilding achievements. They were created based  on the hull and main power plant of the destroyer Spruance,  which permitted making their construction less expensive,  simplifying operation and maintenance, and facilitating  personnel training. The multifunctional Aegis combat system,  with which Arleigh Burke-Class destroyers also are outfitted,  combines essentially all means of acquisition, command and  control and communications as well as weapon subsystems  (Tomahawk cruise missiles, Harpoon antiship missiles, ASROC ASW  missiles, Standard SAM's, torpedoes, guns), jammer subsystems  and so on. Functions of combat employment of weapons are  performed with the help of a unified computer system, thanks to  which the resources of all subsystems become common and are used  more effectively to perform a specific combat mission. The Aegis  system also permits integrating weapons of an entire formation,  including aircraft.[.sup]2[/]    The destroyer type in the U.S. Navy is represented by 39  ships of four classes: Kidd (4, DDG 993-996), Spruance (31, DD  963-992 and 997) and four newest ones of the Arleigh Burke Class  (DDG 51-54), transferred to the Navy during 1991-1993.    By the end of the 1990's another 28 of the Arleigh Burke  Class will be added to the above destroyers (18 ships of this  class presently are in various stages of construction). It is  envisaged having a total of at least 49 such ships of three  modifications distinguished by displacement, weapon mix, size of  crew and certain technical features.    The lead ship, transferred to the Navy in July 1991, has a  full displacement of 8,315 t, hull length of 153.8 m, beam of  20.4 m and draft of 9.9 m; four gas turbines with an output of  105,000 hp provide a flank speed of 32 knots and a range of  4,400 nm at 20 knots. The ship's hull is made of steel, and a  kevlar covering with an overall weight of 70 t protects her most  vulnerable parts. Special attention is given to protecting the  crew (303 persons, including 23 officers) against mass  destruction weapons. Ships of a second modification will be  built after 1995 beginning with the 22nd hull (full displacement  9,033 t), and ships of the third modification beginning with the  28th hull (9,217 t). There will be a crew of 380, including 32  officers.    Twenty-five Spruance-Class destroyers are armed with  Tomahawk  cruise missiles and are capable of delivering strikes against  targets in the interior of enemy territory. It is envisaged  outfitting all ships of this class with Mk 41 vertical launchers  during scheduled modernization (up to the end of the 1990's).  Presently 19 Spruance-Class destroyers already have such  launchers (61 missiles: Tomahawk cruise missiles and ASROC ASW  missiles). Harpoon antiship missiles and Sea Sparrow SAM's are  in two quad launchers and one eight-cell launcher respectively.    Thus, despite a certain reduction in appropriations for  construction and upkeep of the fleet, in the last two years  there has been a buildup in the number of ships that are  platforms for Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCM's),  one of the most important strike weapons of U.S. Navy general  purpose forces.[.sup]3[/] By the beginning of 1994 the U.S.  Navy had a total of 135 such ships (2,200 launchers), including  80 SSN's (600 launchers) and 55 surface ships (1,600 launchers).  In addition, four Iowa-Class battleships with a total of 128  Tomahawk cruise missile launchers are mothballed in 270-day  readiness to put to sea.    The direction of the U.S. shipbuilding program up to 1998  confirms the trend toward a certain increase in SLCM platforms,  with a substantial growth in the cumulative number of launchers  on them (over 3,000) through commissioning of new ships that are  SLCM platforms. The U.S. Navy command plans to have over 4,000  Tomahawk cruise missiles in the inventory in 1995. In accordance  with a decision by U.S. President G. Bush of 27 February 1991,  SLCM's with nuclear warheads were removed from ships during 1992  and placed in arsenals of naval bases in the continental United  States in readiness to be loaded back on platform ships in 24-36  hours.    Specifications and performance characteristics of Tomahawk  cruise missiles of various modifications are given below.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |BGM-109A          |BGM-109C, D       |BGM-109B          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Launch weight, kg |1,450             |1,500             |1,205             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length, m         |6.26              |6.25              |6.25              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Diameter, m       |0.53              |0.53              |0.53              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flight speed, km/-|                  |                  |                  |  |hr:               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cruising          |885               |885               |885               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum           |1,200             |1,200             |1,200             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Range, km         |2,500             |1,250             |550               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Type of warhead   |Nuclear           |Cluster (high cap-|High explosive    |  |                  |                  |acity)            |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Guidance system (-|TERCOM            |TERCOM, DSMAG     |Active radar      |  |inertial)         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Frigates are one of the most numerous types of surface  ships.  There are 35 in U.S. Navy regular forces and there are 16 Oliver  H. Perry-Class ships in the Naval Reserve. Eight Knox-Class  ships are used as training ships to train crews of reservists  for 22 mothballed frigates, which are ready to be transferred to  the regular forces in 180 days.    The entire series of Oliver H. Perry-Class frigates was  transferred to the fleet during 1977-1989 and has the following  side numbers: FFG 7-16, 19-34, 36-43, 45-61. The ship's full  displacement is 4,100 t, length 135.6 m, beam 13.7 m, draft 7.5  m; the power plant with an output of 41,000 hp provides a flank  speed of 29 knots and a range of 4,500 nm at 20 knots; there is  a crew of 206, including 13 officers and 19 technical flight  personnel who service two SH-60B helicopters; armament: Harpoon  antiship missiles, Standard SAM's (ready inventory 40 missiles),  76-mm single-tube gun, 20-mm Vulcan-Phalanx CIWS, and two 324-mm  triple torpedo tubes.    All nuclear powered multipurpose submarines, 118 surface  combatants of the Regular Navy and 24 of the Naval Reserve, and  a number of U.S. Naval Aviation squadrons are armed with Harpoon  antiship missiles.[.sup]4[/]    Information about modifications of this antiship missile are  given below.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |RGM-84A, B        |RGM-84C, D        |RGM-84E           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Launch weight, kg |667               |667               |765               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length (with boos-|4.57              |4.57              |5.23              |  |ter), m           |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Diameter, m       |0.34              |0.34              |0.34              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Range, km:        |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum           |120               |150               |150               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Minimum           |13                |13                |.                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Warhead weight, kg|225               |225               |225               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flight speed (cru-|0.85              |0.85              |0.85              |  |ising), Mach      |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Guidance system:  |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |On mid-course leg |Inertial          |Inertial          |Inertial          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In terminal phase |Active            |Radar             |Thermal imaging w-|  |                  |                  |                  |ith remote control|  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      U.S. Navy mine warfare forces are represented by 15 ships,  including 13 Avenger-Class (MCM 1-13) and two Osprey-Class (MHC  51 and 52). Five Aggressive-Class ships (MSO 441, 455, 488, 489  and 492) and one Acme-Class (MSO 511) are in the Naval Reserve.  The 14th Avenger-Class mine countermeasures ship Chief, which  completes the series, is planned to be transferred to the Navy  in 1994. During the next 3-4 years it is planned to complete  construction of ten Osprey-Class ships with simultaneous removal  of obsolete minesweepers from the order of battle.    The mine warfare ships Avenger and Osprey are intended for  mine countermeasures support to the Navy on approaches to naval  bases, basing facilities and ports, and support to naval  groupings in combat operations areas in remote TVD's. The  experience of employing minesweepers during the Persian Gulf  War, which was negative on the whole, showed the need to upgrade  this naval arm. Its reorganization was carried out during  1992-1993.[.sup]5[/]    Amphibious forces support the sealift and landing of Marine  formations and units on an austere beach. As of the beginning of  the current year the U.S. Navy numbered 51 large landing ships:  two Blue Ridge-Class command ships (LCC 19 and 20), eight  amphibious assault ships--three Wasp-Class (LHD 1-3) and five  Tarawa-Class (LHA 1-5), eight Whidbey Island-Class (LSD 41-48)  and five Anchorage Class (LSD 36-40) dock landing ships, ten  Newport-Class tank landing ships (LST 1184, 1186, 1187, 1189,  1192-1194, 1196-1198), five Iwo Jima-Class helicopter carriers  (LPH 7, 9-12) and 13 Austin-Class amphibious transport docks  (LPD 4-10, 12-15; AGF 3, 11).    It is planned to include two Wasp-Class ships (the  possibility of building one more is being considered) and four  Whidbey Island-Class ships (cargo version) in the Navy order of  battle in the next 3-4 years. In connection with the planned  removal of Austin-, Anchorage-, Newport- and Iwo Jima-Class  landing ships from operational status at the end of the decade,  the Navy leadership decided to develop the design project of a  new LX-Class landing ship. With a full displacement of 23,000 t,  she will be able to take aboard up to 900 landing personnel, air  cushion vehicles and assault transport helicopters. A contract  for building the lead ship will be signed in 1996 and  commissioning is planned for 2002. The period for building each  of the 11 subsequent ships should not exceed 55-60 months.    The military-political leadership is showing concern over a  possible reduction in effectiveness of the national shipbuilding  base in connection with a likely reduction in previously planned  programs for upgrading the fleet. The Defense Department drew up  an appropriate plan called "National Shipbuilding Initiative,"  the goal of which is to develop its industrial base up to the  year 2000. There are $2.18 billion being allocated, including  $485 million in FY 1993-1995, $400 million each in FY 1996-1999  and $100 million in FY 2000 for specific goals connected with  developing new technologies, designing and building ships and  vessels, upgrading the process of managing the sector, and  training specialists of various profiles. A special naval  technologies center will be established in 1994.    In the assessment of specialists, the indicated numerical  reduction in the U.S. Navy ship order of battle during 1994-1998  is not leading to a decrease in its combat potential inasmuch as  qualitatively more improved ships are coming to replace obsolete  ships and the spectrum of missions they are to perform is  enormously broader.    The program for commissioning combatant ships during  1994-1999 is given below.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ohio-Class nuclear powered missile su-|4                                     |  |bmarines                              |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nuclear powered multipurpose submarin-|                                      |  |es:                                   |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Los Angeles-Class                     |7                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Seawolf-Class                         |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chester W.

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Forestry interests help North Broken Hill Peko to 57% gain HIGHER profits from its forestry interests, lower interest charges, and asset sales helped North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resources group, to a 57 per cent increase in profits after tax for the year to end-June. The Melbourne-based company reported a surplus of ADollars 132.4m (USDollars 88.2m) after tax, against ADollars 84.2m in the previous year. Total sales slipped to ADollars 1.51bn, from ADollars 1.54bn. Earnings per share rose to 21 cents from 13.8 cents. At the trading level, the company said profits rose to ADollars 265.1m from ADollars 265.1m . This reflected higher results from forestry and paper - up to ADollars 43.5m from ADollars 24.7m - and from the Warman International business, which contributed ADollars 30.5m against ADollars 20.8m. But the mining and exploration side saw operating profits dip to ADollars 125.7m from ADollars 140.9m . North Broken Hill said the tumble on the mining side reflected price and volume falls at the Robe River Iron Ore project in which it holds a 53 per cent interest. By contrast, the forestry business gained from reduced costs and expansion into exports of softwood chips and pine logs. Interest charges fell to ADollars 44.6m from ADollars 66.9m. North's figures included abnormal charges of ADollars 18m, reflecting restructuring in the forestry division, but these were more than offset by abnormal gains, of ADollars 25m, largely due to asset sales. Mr Campbell Anderson, chief executive of Australia's Renison Goldfields Consolidated, is to resign and join North Broken Hill Peko as chief executive and managing director, AP-DJ reports.</p>

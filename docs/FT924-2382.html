			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Oil prices hit their lowest since March - At a glance OIL prices hit their lowest point since March, when the price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery slipped by 30 cents to Dollars 17.70 a barrel on Wednesday. The crude oil price is being dragged downwards by continued weakness in the price of products such as gasoil and fuel oil. The mild winter and the recession in both North America and Britain has weakened demand for these products. The falls in price come despite an agreement last month by Opec member states to cut production to 24.58m barrels a day from 25m b/d. The ceiling does not include a production level for Ecuador which has left Opec. The chart shows the volatile performance of oil since the beginning of 1991 before the outbreak of the Gulf War.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (13): Life in tomorrow's fast lane - Louise Kehoe discusses convergence of computers with television Convergence has become the buzzword of the US high-technology industries as telephone, cable television, computer and software companies all work toward creating high-speed, broadband 'information highways' linking homes, offices and schools. The notion that these formerly distinct industries are melding into a giant 'information industry' has been buoyed by a plethora of partnerships and alliances that criss-cross industry segments. Yet it is fierce competition, rather than a meeting of minds, that is driving rapid changes in the US communications sector and the results, at least in the short term, may be more chaotic than cohesive. US telephone companies are engaged in a huge battle with the cable television industry. Similarly, the personal computer industry is pitted against the makers of TV sets, broadcasters and all who place their bets on TV as the primary vehicle for delivering multimedia services to the home. As author George Gilder puts it: 'The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse.' He predicts a period of 'creative destruction' as industry segments collide and battle over establishing their new roles. There will be 'winnowing out' of many of the early participants in the rush to create interactive multimedia communications services, predicts Bill Gates, chairman and chief executive of Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, which this year is investing Dollars 100m - a quarter of its research and development budget - in software for multimedia communications services. Just building the infrastructure for this high-speed information transport system could cost as much as Dollars 100bn, Mr Gates estimates. Yet no one, including the companies making these investments, really knows how the market will develop, he warns. This is especially evident in the transmission segment where telephone and cable TV companies are spending heavily to upgrade networks. Due to progress in technology and differing assumptions about customer demand, a variety of approaches to modernisation have evolved. To increase the capacity of networks, telephone companies are investing in optical fibre cables. Debate continues, however, on whether the optical fibre needs to run all the way to the kerb, serving perhaps a dozen homes, or to neighbourhood 'hubs' serving hundreds of homes. While Bell Atlantic, for example, favours fibre to the kerb, Pacific Bell has adopted a 'hybrid fibre coaxial cable' approach in which fibre-optic loops link to coaxial cables that feed telephone and TV signals to groups of homes. US West plans to employ a combination of the two. Cable TV companies already have coaxial cable networks in place to serve more than 60 per cent of households. Over short distances, with digital compression, coaxial cables rival the capacity of optical fibre, but like the telephone companies, the cable industry must upgrade to fibre for longer hauls. Many of the larger cable TV companies are now upgrading to hybrid networks with optical fibre links to neighbourhoods, then coaxial cable to individual homes. The limitation of the cable TV networks, however, is that they were designed for one-way, point-to-multi-point communications, whereas true interactive television will require switching systems, more like the telephone network. Thus the cable TV industry also faces huge costs. Another drawback of the cable television networks is that they generally cover only a small area - one town or city - and are not interconnected. How this problem will be resolved remains unclear. Even as the communications 'pipe layers' continue their preparation for the advent of interactive multimedia communications services, the personal computer and television industries are involved in a parallel battle. Intel, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips used in personal computers, maintains that personal computers will be the primary 'conduit' on to the information superhighway. 'PC technology is advancing far more rapidly than television technology,' says Avram Miller of Intel. ' Already, 30 per cent of US homes have personal computers. How long will it take for interactive television to reach that level?' While most discussions of the information highway focus on the notion of 500 channels of interactive cable TV being piped into living rooms, Intel believes that business use of video conference and multimedia information services, delivered via the PC screen, will take off first, with applications for the home trailing by at least two years. While competition between industry sectors expands, it is already intense within established industry segments. As many as a dozen companies, for example, are vying for position in the market for TV set top terminals - electronic boxes that will sit on top of the television decoding and transmitting two-way signals. Computer companies are already elbowing each other in the emerging market for 'video servers'; electronic juke boxes that will store and retrieve films, television programmes or video clips for 'on demand' services. Oracle, the leading database software company, has paired with nCube, a manufacturer of massively parallel supercomputers, in a bid to lead the video server market. But International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard also have their eyes on this prize market. Sales of video servers are expected to surge to Dollars 5.1bn by 1997, from just Dollars 16m last year, according to Dataquest. Meanwhile, Microsoft has developed video server software that will run on networked personal computers that sell for a fraction of the cost of a mainframe computer or supercomputer. The intense competition surrounding the implementation of 'information superhighways' is probably the surest sign that this technology vision will soon become reality. Rather than a 'convergence' of industries, however, it seems likely to involve the invasion of established industry sectors by ambitious newcomers. For all industry participants, keeping pace with rapid change will be essential to success.</p>

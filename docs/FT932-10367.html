			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: The year of Aquarius - Radio NOT BECAUSE it was a quarter of a century ago, simply as an interesting year, Radio 3 offers a 1968 Season for a week or two. Myself, I enjoyed 1968. I went to the theatre 208 times, I spent ten days in Venice, I heard Gwyneth Jones as Sieglinde in Die Walkure; but in retrospect I think everyone, even me, took things too seriously, as Radio 3 does now. In That Was the Year, That Was, Alan Bennett recalled his happy times with John Gielgud in Forty Years On; Jonathan Miller regretted not having pursued his neuropsychology and insisted that his televised Alice in Wonderland was Wordsworthian rather than satirical; Peter Hall recalled his move from the Royal Shakespeare Company to the not-yet-royal National; Michael Frayn began writing novels because he had no more to say in his newspaper column. Nothing significant, unless you count Peter Hall. Comparatively few of the items seem actually to have happened in 1968, anyway. Of Hits of 1968, only 'The Age of Aquarius' meant anything to me, and that not much. Peter Barnes's The Ruling Class is the first of four 1968 plays to be revived. In Nottingham that year, it ran nearly three-and-a-half hours, but when it reached the West End (in 1969) it had lost 20 minutes, and Radio 3 plays it in two hours and 20 minutes, a real improvement, though there is still much dispensable frivolity. Lunatic Jack (versatile Simon Callow) succeeds as 14th Earl of Gurney, believing that he is Jesus Christ, married to Marguerite Gautier. A German psychiatrist 'cures' him by confrontation with a rival God, so instead of the loving New Testament Deity, Jack now becomes the vengeful Old Testament God. Moreover, being Jack, he is also Jack the Ripper. This is how he is to take his seat in the Lords. No one but a few Oxford students could have thought that hereditary peers, mad or sane, were vital in the government of the country, but there is some fun. Gerry Jones directed. I am conscious of devoting too little space to Radio 5, so here are some notes on three series that began this week, no candidates for historical importance. On Monday we enter Mark Davies Markham's The Mall, a new shopping centre. All the population sound like teenagers, even when they are a bit over. Jonathan is sacked for stealing just before the opening, so he and Mickey break in and bust it up. There are to be 14 parts, so we may hope for high adventure. Hatches, Matches and Despatches on Tuesdays is lightweight education. This week was Hatches, a fascinating array of customs, superstitions, folklore and general knowledge connected with the birth of children, not only in Britain but among the Sikhs, Hindus, Moslems, Chinese and others. John Walters was the presenter. On Thursday we had the first of seven stories about The Green Hornet, a a respectable newspaperman until there is a matter that he must put right, and for this he dons a sinister disguise. The series was first heard in 1936 on Detroit Radio and played for 16 years thereafter. This week we had the dishonest exploitation of a charity, and as it began with one of the directors handing over a bunch of signed blank cheques to his colleague, dishonesty was no surprise. Once again we find radio supplanting the magazines. The equivalent of this kind of material might have been found in Chums or The Modern Boy, though I do not think they would have used delinquency so blithely for entertainment. Not that Jonathan or the dishonest charity is defended, but the existence of such behaviour is taken for granted - and so it should be. Why not contrive an exciting serial about car joy-riders who all end up reformed? If radio is an influence at all, on Radio 5 it is for good.</p>

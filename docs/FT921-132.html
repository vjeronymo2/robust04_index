			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Philippine privatisation expanded AN OFFERING of 10 per cent of state-controlled Philippine National Bank (PNB) has been over-subscribed by about three times, the bank said. PNB has decided to expand the offering by another 5 per cent to a total of 12.05m shares. The offering is the second stage of the privatisation of PNB, the country's largest commercial bank. In 1989, it sold 30 per cent of its outstanding capital in what turned out to be the most successful float in the local stock market. Although foreign investors are already qualified to purchase up to 30 per cent of these offerings, the bank plans to issue global depository receipts for overseas buyers after the Philippine elections in May. The price for the latest offering was fixed at the weekend at 265 pesos a share for cash purchases. The price is 12.50 pesos a share higher for deferred payments. The offer price is about six times projected earnings for 1992. The PNB stock yesterday closed at 267.50 pesos on the Manila Stock Exchange and at 270 pesos on the Makati bourse.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Observer: Caught short A stockbroker offering to sell 20,000 shares when he meant to sell 2,000 might be considered unfortunate. But to try to sell 200m shares worth Dollars 1bn - as Thai stockbroker Phatra Thanakit did the other day - is mind-boggling, especially since the company in question, Ayudhya Investment and Trust Co (Aitco), only had 25m shares in issue. Rival Bangkok brokers spotted the error and started buying more of the non-existent stock - adding to the problems of the well-connected Phatra, which co-operates with SG Warburg in researching Thai companies. Phatra's shares were suspended, much to the embarrassment of Phatra's president, Viroj Nualkhair, who is also vice-president of the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Luckily for him and his firm, the stock exchange cancelled the relevant transactions, but not before more than 18m Aitco shares had been bought. A post-mortem is being conducted to find out how the extra five zeros crept into the sell order from a sub-broker. But if it simply blames a faulty computer, then the central issue will just have been ducked. Did Phatra contravene the regulations, by allowing sub-brokers' orders to be routed automatically through its computer system to the market?</p>

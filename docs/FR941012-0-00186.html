			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose and Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA is implementing the requirements of the HMTUSA in a new subpart C, Routing, in Part 397 of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. This regulation implements the requirements of the HMTUSA by establishing Federal standards and procedures which States and Indian tribes are required to follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations for the highway transportation of non-radioactive hazardous materials. The intent of these requirements is to ensure that NRHM are moved safely and that commerce is not burdened by restrictive, uncoordinated, or conflicting requirements of various jurisdictions. The standards and requirements of this regulation, however, allow for the flexibility intended in the HMTUSA. The FHWA will not designate routes used for transporting NRHM. Any State or Indian tribe that chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations is required to comply with the Federal standards established in this regulation. The States and Indian tribes are also required to ensure that any NRHM routing designations by political subdivisions under their jurisdiction are established, maintained, and enforced in accordance with this regulation. Any NRHM routing designations that fail to comply with the standards can be preempted. Any State, political subdivision thereof, Indian tribe, business, organization, or individual affected by a NRHM routing designation can apply to the Federal Highway Administrator (Administrator) for a preemption determination pursuant to 49 CFR 397, subpart E, which contains procedures for Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemptions, and petition for reconsideration. Procedures for dispute resolution are included in this final rule (49 CFR 397, subpart C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations require States and Indian tribes to report existing NRHM routing designations within their boundaries to the FHWA and, thereafter, to report any additions or changes to these routing designations 60 days after the effective date of designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of this regulation are applicable to States, including any political subdivisions, and Indian tribes that establish, maintain, or enforce any highway routing designations over which placarded NRHM may or may not be transported. The regulation also contains several provisions which are applicable to motor carriers transporting NRHM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This regulation requires States, including political subdivisions, and Indian tribes to comply with Federal standards in establishing NRHM highway routing designations and to follow certain procedures. This regulation also requires States and Indian tribes that establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations to report these routing designations to the FHWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Motor Carrier Responsibility for Routing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Motor carriers transporting NRHM as of the effective date of this regulation are required to comply with the NRHM routing designations of States or Indian tribes. Where States and Indian tribes have not established NRHM routing designations, motor carriers are required to operate in accordance with 49 CFR 397.67, previously set forth in 49 CFR 397.9(a), over routes that avoid heavily populated areas, places where crowds are assembled, tunnels, narrow streets, or alleys. The routing plan requirements previously set forth in 49 CFR 397.9(b) for transporting Class 1 explosives, divisions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, as defined in 49 CFR 173.50 and 173.53, have also been incorporated into the same section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

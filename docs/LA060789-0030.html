			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS LOSE ROUND;  </P> <P> L.A. PANEL SAYS CONDOS' GREENBELT IS RIGHT WIDTH  </P> <P> In a partial defeat for a group of Woodland Hills homeowners, a Los Angeles  City Council committee ruled Tuesday that city inspectors properly interpreted  zoning maps when they measured the distance between a controversial condominium  project and neighboring homes.  </P> <P> Homeowners have protested that the nearly completed complex at 20700 Ventura  Blvd. was illegally constructed because it is too close to their houses and too  tall.  </P> <P> The building permit specified a 134-foot-wide greenbelt between the 24 luxury  units and the adjacent single-family homes. The homeowners complain that the  width of the irregularly shaped greenbelt should be measured at its narrowest  point, but the builder measured at the widest point.  </P> <P> The homeowners have contended that the measurement was incorrect, allowing the  developer to build a portion of the complex in the greenbelt.  </P> <P> However, the Planning and Environment Committee voted 2 to 1 to accept a city  Planning Department report that said the greenbelt was measured properly and is  wide enough to meet conditions on the building permit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Planned  </P> <P> Homeowner representative Sidney Perry said his group mainly wanted the city to  admit that the complex had been constructed in error, but did not necessarily  want the portion built on the greenbelt to be torn down. He said he will appeal  the ruling to the City Council, which must also approve the finding.  </P> <P> "The issue here is the intent" of the conditions written into the building  permit, Perry said. "In our opinion, this interpretation clearly breached the  intent of those conditions."  </P> <P> However, the homeowners are still waging a separate battle over the building  height, which may require the developer to lop about two feet off the top. That  issue will come before the city's Board of Zoning Appeals in August.  </P> <P> In accepting the planning staff report, the council committee also agreed with  an earlier decision by Chief Zoning Administrator Franklin P. Eberhard, who  determined that the structure is too tall to meet a 45-foot height restriction  imposed on the site 10 years ago. Development partner James R. Gary said he is  appealing that decision.  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson, committee chairman, dissented, saying the committee  should not take a stand on the height dispute until the Board of Zoning Appeals  has considered it.  </P></p>

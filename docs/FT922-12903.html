			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: DacEasy buy behind Sage's rise to Pounds 4.34m SAGE GROUP, the Newcastle-based business software company, yesterday reported a 44 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.34m for the six months to March 31, boosted by last year's large acquisition in the US. The group said DacEasy of Dallas, which it bought in May for an initial Dollars 18m (Pounds 10.4m), was trading ahead of budget and increased its profits by 62 per cent, contributing Pounds 1.4m. Sage shares rose 31p to 484p. The enlarged group's turnover rose by 85 per cent to Pounds 14.5m while earnings per share grew to 14.5p (11.6p) on share capital enlarged by last year's rights issue. Sage said the proportion of recurring revenues from sales of stationery, software maintenance and training increased to 40 per cent of group sales. Mr David Goldman, chairman, said: 'With around half of total sales arising overseas and a large and increasing proportion of income arising from recuring revenue, the group has become much less vulnerable to economic conditions in the UK.' UK software sales increased by 16 per cent in spite of the continuing recession. The core UK business grew by 24 per cent, excluding MainLan, which supplies software for PC networks. MainLan sales were down 42 per cent, partly caused by a reduction in prices. MainLan had come under strong competitive pressure. Overall, UK operating margins fell from 38 per cent to 36 per cent, because of MainLan and extra staffing costs. In the US, DacEasy showed sales growth of of 14 per cent. Profitability rose because the higher sales had been achieved without any increase in overheads, and operating margins in the much more fragmented US market rose from 18 per cent to 25 per cent. Losses at MainLan Inc had been reduced to Pounds 115,000. Last year all its activities except sales were moved from Florida to DacEasy in Dallas and it is intended to complete the consolidation of MainLan with DacEasy, to ensure a return to profitability for the group's sales of network products. The interim dividend is raised to 3.02p (2.7p). Sage said its balance sheet remained strong, with end-period cash balances of Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.6m).</p>

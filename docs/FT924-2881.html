			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Supply side helps Manweb to Pounds 37m AN IMPROVED performance from its supply business helped Manweb, the electricity company supplying Merseyside, west Cheshire and North Wales, to raise first-half pre-tax profits by 35 per cent from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 37.1m. Sales rose 9 per cent to Pounds 409m (Pounds 375m) and the interim dividend is lifted by 12 per cent to 6.1p (5.45p). Separately, Mr John Roberts, chief executive, indicated support for the idea that the liberalisation of the electricity supply market should be delayed if companies were to be asked to buy more coal-fired electricity. He also joined other regional electricity companies in expressing scepticism about the possibility of agreeing to a contract, covering either one or five years, with generators prior to the publication of the government's energy white paper. In the half-year to September 30 supply losses were reduced from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 2.7m. The company cited management of purchase costs as the main factor, helped by a 15 per cent unit volume improvement partly from securing contracts in the competitive market. Distribution volumes increased by about 1 per cent, with industrial and commercial growth offsetting a 1 per cent reduction to the domestic sector. However, profits from this source fell to Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 44.4m), affected by a freeze in prices. Improved margins on steady sales enabled retailing to turn in a Pounds 200,000 operating profit, against a Pounds 200,000 loss previously. In contracting, however, losses increased from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 600,000, resulting from a 5 per cent fall in sales, blamed on the recession, and the non-recurring costs of establishing a contracting subsidiary from August. Mr Roberts said the subsidiary was now trading at breakeven and profits were expected from next year. Pre-tax profits were reduced by provisions of Pounds 4m (Pounds 2.5m) to tackle staff reductions. Mr Roberts said he did not expect provisions to increase at the year end. COMMENT One of the clouds hanging over other regional electricity companies will almost certainly lift today when the regulator exonerates them of blame in the 'dash for gas,' and that may affect some of the sentiment surrounding Manweb. As the one rec which is not involved in a gas-fired power station its shares have benefited in recent months. Nonetheless, Manweb's place as one of the star shares of the sector is unlikely to be changed either by today's announcement or yesterday's results. Distribution volumes are rising during the recession, even if the higher margin domestic sales are down; supply business lost last year is returning and retailing is back in profit when most other suppliers are still suffering losses. Contracting is a blot, but that is a familiar story and new staff terms are already in place for an improvement. The shares at 471p, down 2p, have a prospective yield of 5.8 per cent, assuming a 20.5p dividend.</p>

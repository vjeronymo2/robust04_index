			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "990 Morning News" program] </F>   [Text] Listeners, Lieutenant General Gu Hui, commander of  the Nanjing Military Region and chairman of the People's Air  Defense Committee of the region, emphasized at the regional  people's air defense work conference -- which closed yesterday  -- that the work on people's air defense should be enhanced to a  new level to better meet requirements of the socialist market  economy and partial wars under conditions of modern high  technology. The following is a report filed by station reporter  (Yao Shukun) from the meeting place yesterday.    [Begin recording] [Yao] Concentrated population, congested  buildings, heavy traffic, limited land, and environmental  pollution are problems that have become more and more  conspicuous in urban modernization construction. What will we  do with an international, large city like Shanghai, where the  highest population density has exceeded 160,000 people per sq  km, with a mere 2 sq-meter per capita road space, which is  one-fourteenth and one-fifth of that of London and Tokyo? Lt.  Gen. Gu Hui said going underground would be an effective way out.    [Gu] In light of the development of China's urban  modernization construction, developing and utilizing underground  space also has become an inevitable trend. Based on the  principle of dual use for peace and war time, upgrading and  constructing people's air defense works and shifting certain  ground facilities underground are important features in  developing and utilizing underground space.    [Yao] It has been learned that people's air defense projects  that have been developed by and put into use in Shanghai --  including warehouses, workshops, markets, hospitals, hotels,  activity rooms, and cultural and entertainment centers -- have  saved the use of city land, activated the market economy,  facilitated the people's work and lives, and initially  demonstrated the fine prospects of opening up underground space.  Lt. Gen. Gu Hui pointed out that the construction of people's  air defense should be enhanced to a new level.    [Gu] Time has proved that investment in the people's air  defense construction is not an unworthy consumption; the  efficiencies and benefits it generates and the wealth it created  for the state have far exceeded its input. Hence, we, the  leadership at various levels, including comrades engaged in  people's air defense work, should fully understand its value and  strengthen propaganda education for all sectors of society to  seek all-level consensus -- a bid to create a fine social  opinion and environment to guarantee continuance of the people's  air defense construction for a long time.

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> CANADIAN ABANDONS CATALINA SWIM  </P> <P> A 28-year-old Canadian woman, suffering fatigue and hallucinations, had to  abandon her efforts to swim from Santa Catalina Island to the mainland for  charity early today.  </P> <P> Vicki Keith, abandoned her quest after 19 hours in the chilly ocean waters. She  had covered about 21 miles of the nearly 24-mile crossing but had to give up  when strong currents kept her from her goal.  </P> <P> "My body just wasn't ready for it," she told her mother by phone after  abandoning the swim.  </P> <P> Keith said the hallucinations occurred when she blinked and thought she saw a  huge tanker in her path as she swam. When she blinked again, the ship was gone.  </P> <P> She attributed the hallucinations to lack of sleep.  </P> <P> Keith, a powerful athlete from Toronto, planned to use only the butterfly  stroke as she crossed the San Pedro Channel in a fund-raising event for a local  children's charity. She began her swim in Santa Catalina's Emerald Bay about 8  a.m. Friday and had hoped to reach Cabrillo Beach, about 26 miles south of Los  Angeles, early today.  </P></p>

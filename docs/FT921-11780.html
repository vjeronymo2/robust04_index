			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Seeboard moves into gas supply Seeboard, the electricity distributor serving the south-east of the UK, is to go into the gas supply business. It has set up a joint venture, Southern Gas, in which it will hold a 75 per cent stake, the rest being owned by Utilicorp, the US gas and electricity utility based in Kansas City. The venture will purchase gas from United Gas, another UK subsidiary of Utilicorp, and supply it to large gas consumers via British Gas pipelines starting in March. Seeboard said the move would enable it to provide a more comprehensive energy service to customers. It intended to expand the service as UK regulations were eased. The deal is the fourth of its kind for Utilicorp.</p>

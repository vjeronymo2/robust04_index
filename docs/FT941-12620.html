			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Mayhew hopeful of positive Sinn Fein response on Ulster An upbeat assessment of the Ulster peace process came yesterday from Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, following talks in Dublin with the Irish government. After the first Anglo-Irish conference since December's Downing Street Declaration, he said there was 'a rational ground for being hopeful' that there would be a positive response by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The British and Irish governments have agreed to give Sinn Fein more time to consider their joint peace initiative. In the meantime, however, they will press ahead 'as a matter of urgency' with efforts to restart round-table talks between the province's constitutional parties. Hours after Sir Patrick's remarks, Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams said he was prepared to go 'the extra mile' for peace. 'I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign,' he said in Belfast. Earlier yesterday the US government in effect refused Mr Adams a visa to attend a conference on Northern Ireland in New York on Monday, saying it would only consider lifting its ban on him entering the country if he renounced violence and embraced the peace process. Sir Patrick also hinted at greater flexibility on the British government's refusal to respond to demands by Sinn Fein for clarification of the declaration. He said that 'through speeches' both governments would continue to 'make clear' what the joint declaration offered. 'If there are misapprehensions I will put that right . . . you can call it clarification if you like.' He added that he did not dis-agree with any recent speeches on the declaration made by the Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, or the foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring. These had been expressly aimed at clarifying concerns raised by Sinn Fein. Sir Patrick reiterated, however, that there would be no negotiation or 'unravelling' of the agreement. The declaration concedes the principle of national self-determination for the Irish people as a whole, but any new agreement would require majority consent in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick's positive tone contrasted with the mood at recent private briefings for journalists by the Northern Ireland office, and suggests yesterday's talks have given him reasons for optimism. Mr Spring, asked if he was privy to information that Sinn Fein was moving towards an acceptance of the declaration, said: 'I don't think it would be helpful to go into details.'

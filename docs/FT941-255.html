			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (20): Most promising export sector - Shiraz Sidhva takes a look at the food processing industry India's food-processing industry has attracted more than Rs300bn of domestic and foreign investment in the last two years, more than any other sector except power. Realising the tremendous export potential and domestic market for processed foods, the government is encouraging strawberry farmers, mushroom growers, tomato paste and fruit juice exporters, aquaculture and deep-sea fishing companies to set up joint ventures or 100 per cent export-oriented companies in different parts of India. Multinationals such as Pepsi, Lever Brothers, Cadbury's, Kellogg's, Nestle, McCormick, Wimco, Dalsem Veciep and Haegens of Holland, and C Itoh, have entered the market or shown interest in India's most promising export and domestic industry. India, with its range of tropical and temperate climates, abundant sunshine, ranks second only to China and Brazil in the production of vegetables and fruits respectively. For a country that produces nearly 80m tonnes of fruits and vegetables, its share in the world market is negligible, at less than one per cent. About 0.6 per cent of the country's produce is processed (a poor comparison to Brazil's 70 per cent, Malaysia's 83 per cent or the US 70-80 per cent). About 30 per cent of the total produce is wasted due to inadequate or underutilised food processing capacity, and poor harvesting techniques, causing a loss to the country of Rs30bn per annum. Realising the tremendous export potential of this relatively new industry (India, until the late 1980s, concentrated on self-sufficiency in food), the government is encouraging the setting up of 100 per cent export-oriented fruit and vegetable processing units. Changes in the export-import policy and an exchange rate adjustment have helped improve export of fruit and vegetables. Exports of processed fruits and vegetables including dried and preserved fruits and nuts (excluding cashewnuts) have increased from Rs787.7m in 1988-89 to Rs2.63bn in 1992-93. The ministry of food processing industries estimates that India has the potential to increase its processed foods exports to Rs60bn in the next five years. Last year, exports registered a growth of over 30 per cent despite the set-back received by exports to Russia and CIS countries. Value addition is the key, say officials. For example, mango juice fetches Rs40,000 per tonne, and tomato paste Rs12,000 globally, while the raw fruit costs only Rs1,000 per tonne. According priority status to the food processing industry, the government has allocated Rs3bn for building up infrastructure by 1995-96. The estimated installed capacity in the fruit and vegetable processing sector has increased to 1.1m tonnes in December 1992 from 950,000 tonnes in 1991. But even the existing capacity is often underutilised by up to 30 per cent. Other factors that inhibit growth are the high costs of produce (due to low yields) and variations in quality of raw material, attributed to small agricultural holdings; inadequate and expensive storage facilities; increasing transportation and distribution costs; unhygienic slaughter houses; the poor quality of packaging and outdated technology. Though most food processing industries have been deregulated - with the exception of distillation and brewing of alcoholic drinks, sugar, animal fats and oils - potential investors say government policies lack clarity, and that high tariffs are a great disincentive. India grows some of the most exotic fruits and vegetables in the world, but many varieties are table quality, and not conducive to exports or processing. Companies entering the sector have to invest heavily on infrastructure and on importing technology. The most remarkable growth has been in the area of deep sea fishing, where more than 25 proposals with foreign investment of about Dollars 6m have been approved by the government in the last two years, which will add 113 large deep-sea fishing vessels to catch tuna and other fish. Some of these vessels include on-board processing of fish to produce value-added products. An additional Dollars 12m worth of foreign investment proposals have been approved for aquaculture and 100 per cent export-oriented units for fish-processing and marketing. India's domestic markets have been limited by the fact that Indians prefer to cook and eat fresh produce, not processed foods. But with increasing urbanisation and the disintegration of the family, a burgeoning middle class is emerging, which could provide considerable potential for processed foods. 'The sky is the limit,' says an official with a food multi-national. 'India could be a world leader in processed foods by the turn of the century if it tries hard enough to get there.'</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALTERNATIVE TO LOSING HOMES;  </P> <P> PUT NEW SCHOOL OVER RIVER, RESIDENTS URGE  </P> <P> Faced with the prospect of watching the Los Angeles Unified School District  level an entire neighborhood for a new elementary school, residents in Bell and  Cudahy are urging school officials to consider building the proposed facility  over the Los Angeles River.  </P> <P> During a meeting this week sponsored by Bell officials, about 60 residents of  the two cities urged support of suspending the proposed elementary school over  the cement-lined riverbed.  </P> <P> The residents oppose the school district's current plan -- called the Bell  Elementary No. 3 -- to tear down 263 houses, businesses and apartments and  build the 1,000-student elementary school on 13 acres at Florence and Wilcox  avenues.  </P> <P> "We have put men on the moon, and we've developed the greatest architectural  capabilities known to man," said James Kleinpell, a spokesman for the Committee  Against Bell Elementary No. 3.  </P> <P> "With that in mind," Kleinpell continued, "we ask why can't a structure be  built over the river that makes maximum utilization of space and doesn't  displace men and women and children that potentially could become homeless and  a burden on society."  </P> <P> City officials, although stressing that they believe the Florence Avenue site  is the best place to build the school, said that they will present the  residents' plan to school district officials.  </P> <P> "It beats displacing people," Mayor George G. Mirabal said. The city has no  power to approve or veto a school district decision to build a school in the  city, but can make suggestions, apply political pressure and offer to work with  the district.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 residents would be forced to move if the school district  approves the Florence Avenue site, which lies in both Bell and Cudahy. The two  cities fall within the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, the new elementary school would be bound by Florence on the  north, Wilcox on the west, Live Oak Street on the south and an extension of  Crafton Avenue on the east. Walnut Street, a cul-de-sac one block south of  Florence, would be eliminated entirely.  </P> <P> If built on the site, the school would be named Walnut elementary School, after  the cul-de-sac. It will replace overcrowded Elizabeth Street Elementary School,  scheduled to be converted into a junior high. A majority of students would come  from Cudahy.  </P> <P> Last month, the resident group's over-the-river proposal was considered an  unlikely alternative to the politically sensitive task of forcing residents  from their homes, city officials said. At the Monday night meeting, however,  several city officials said that the idea should be pursued because it would  not displace residents and businesses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Innovative Approach'  </P> <P> "I think it's a very innovative approach," Councilman Jay Price said.  </P> <P> The residents' proposal might allow the large school district to take advantage  of a new school construction program that was established last year to finance  creative ways to build schools without displacing residents, said state Sen.  Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento).  </P> <P> The "Space Saver School" program, sponsored by Greene, will subsidize pilot  programs by the first four school districts in the state -- two in Southern  California and two in Northern California -- who submit a space-saving school  plan, Greene said.  </P> <P> Plans could include putting new schools over freeways, over existing buildings  or underground, Greene spokeswoman Alex Ives said in a telephone interview from  Greene's Sacramento office.  </P> <P> Several school districts have inquired about the Space Saver School program,  and Greene has met with Los Angeles Unified School District officials to  discuss the concept earlier this year, he said. But no school has submitted a  plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Offers Options'  </P> <P> Bonnie R. James, building services administrator for the Los Angeles Unified  School District, said district officials know of the Space Saver Program, but  have not decided if the district will participate in it.  </P> <P> "The concept is unique," he said. "It offers options to districts who are  highly urbanized. It tries to minimize the impact of displacing people."  </P> <P> He declined to say whether he would consider the residents' Los Angeles River  plan. "We're still identifying a number of sites (in Bell) that have  potential," he said.  </P> <P> Kleinpell and other residents who supported the over-the-river school plan  offered no details about how the school would be built over the river.  </P> <P> Kathy Delegal, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Public  Works, said that any proposal to build a facility over the cement-lined  riverbed would need to be approved by the county and the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, which paved the riverbed.  </P> <P> She said that no structure has been built over the Los Angeles or the Rio Hondo  rivers, which join about two miles south of Bell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chance for Discussion  </P> <P> District administrator James said residents and city officials will have an  opportunity to discuss the river plan and other alternatives at an April 25  Building Committee hearing at the Bell Community Center. He said several  optional sites will also be unveiled at the school district's 6 p.m. hearing.  </P> <P> School district and city officials, in a struggle to balance housing and  commercial growth against the need to build more schools, have been at odds  since 1986 over a suitable site. The two sides agreed on the Walnut Street site  earlier this year after Bell and Cudahy officials added a provision to require  seven acres of ball fields and other green space.  </P></p>

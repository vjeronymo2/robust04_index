			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRACKDOWN SOUGHT ON TICKET ROBBERIES;  </P> <P> POLICE, AIRLINES NOT DOING ENOUGH TO STOP RASH OF THEFTS, TRAVEL AGENTS SAY  </P> <P> The tearful widow of a Van Nuys travel agent killed during a robbery joined  other travel agency operators Monday to voice complaints that police and the  airlines are doing little to stop a rash of airline ticket robberies in the Los  Angeles area.  </P> <P> At a press conference in Burbank, about a dozen members of the American Society  of Travel Agents called for coordinated police effort and more security at  airline gates to stop the apparent ease with which stolen tickets are used on  airlines.  </P> <P> But spokesmen for the police and airline industry said later they are already  making those efforts.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police have said that more than 20 armed robberies of travel  agencies -- in which airline tickets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars  were taken -- have occurred this year throughout the city. Several others have  occurred in nearby areas outside the city.  </P> <P> The thieves use a variety of sophisticated methods to fill out the tickets and  sell them to travelers. Each ticket is worth an average of about $1,000, police  said. No arrests have been made and investigators believe the crimes may be  linked because of the gunmen have similar descriptions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latinos Targeted  </P> <P> The travel agents said Monday the robberies have primarily occurred at  Latino-operated agencies. Most often, the robbers are described as Latinos. The  agents said more than 60% of the stolen tickets are used on airlines with  regular flights to Central America and South America.  </P> <P> Amanda Vaca, whose 46-year-old husband was fatally shot Sept. 15 during a  robbery at Excelsior Travel &amp; Tours in Van Nuys, said Alfredo Vaca resisted  the demand of three robbers to open a safe where airline tickets were kept. She  said her husband was aware of the recent robberies and wanted to make a stand  against the thieves.  </P> <P> "My husband said they weren't going to get any more tickets," she said. "They  didn't. But they did get his life. . . . Something has to be done to stop  this."  </P> <P> Susan T. Kaplan, president of the Southern California chapter of the travel  agents organization, said airlines make little effort to determine whether  tickets presented at boarding gates are stolen. Kaplan and other agents said  they could possibly be held responsible for tickets that are stolen.  </P> <P> The group also criticized police efforts. "Travel agents are the victims and we  no longer can stand it," Kaplan said. "Airlines are not standing up for us.  There is no police alert. There is nothing being done."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Lt. Ron Lewis said all travel agency robberies in Los  Angeles are being handled by the same robbery squad downtown. He said that  squad also is working with other agencies investigating robberies outside the  city.  </P> <P> "There is an ongoing exchange of information," Lewis said. "I don't think any  kind of task force is needed as long as we have the telephone and open lines of  communication. We have a coordinated effort."  </P> <P> Lewis said he could not discuss the tactics being used by police to pursue the  robbers. No suspects have been identified in the robberies or the murder, he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Airlines Concerned  </P> <P> Stephen Hayes, spokesman for the Air Transport Assn. in Washington, which  represents the major airlines, said the rash of robberies in the Los Angeles  area has not gone unnoticed.  </P> <P> "We have been in touch with our member airlines and asked them to increase  vigilence and take whatever steps they can take to stop stolen tickets from  being used," Hayes said.  </P> <P> Industry meetings next month will include discussions of better methods of  detecting stolen tickets, Hayes said. He also said that a travel agency is not  usually held responsible for the value of stolen tickets once the airlines are  made aware that the tickets were taken during a robbery.  </P></p>

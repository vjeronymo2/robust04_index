			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (2): New ways to use spare PC power - Agent Software Software is set to go on the market to exploit the reservoir of untapped energy existing in idle personal computers on desktops. The history of the computer industry consistently proves the old maxim that 'nature abhors a vacuum.' No sooner do hardware engineers produce faster chips and higher-capacity storage than software engineers rush in and create new ways of using computers. 'There is an enormous amount of spare computing power out there and we are on the verge of turning it loose with the next generation of multi-tasking operating systems,' comments Mr David Friend, founder and chairman of Pilot Software, a specialist in a new type of software called intelligent agents. He adds: 'Imagine a large retailer with over 1,000 stores and maybe 30,000 different products in 800 categories. They need to collect sales data from each store on a daily basis to get management information. They want to be able to identify any product where sales have changed markedly,' he adds. 'They want to make sure they have hot items in stock . . . the problem is to work out what mental rules you apply if you are an expert and define them mathematically in a program so you can create a software agent - or agents - to do the job. Then you can get that spare computer power working for you.' The phenomenon of surplus computer power is, of course, relatively new. Before the PC, computers were so expensive that all their power had to be used to justify their cost. Mainframe systems were - and still are - used for on-line work during the day and for batch processing at night. With the spread of PCs, computer power has moved to the desktop and much of it lies unused. The limitations of PCs are partly to blame. With some exceptions, for instance background communications and printing, a PC can only do one thing at a time. But the move to multi-tasking operating systems such as Windows NT, OS/2 and Unix opens the door to the latent power of the PC (see O for Operating Systems). Software agents can help to use this spare power productively. They are either passive agents which monitor events and take action, or active agents searching networks and databases for specific information. A passive agent may monitor network traffic, measuring performance and working to improve it. Active agents help reduce the growing problem of information overload by coping with the mass of information available in modern computer networks. Typically, an active agent would use a set of rules to seek relevant information for a project, consolidate it and present it to the user. This type of agent fits well with developments in areas such as workgroup computing (see W for Workgroups) and transaction management (see T for Transaction Management). The importance of agents as an enabling mechanism for these technologies promises to open up a new software market. According to UK market researcher Ovum, the worldwide market for agent software will grow from an annual value of Dollars 37m in 1994 to Dollars 2.6bn by the year 2000. Software builders have already started to add agents to a wide range of applications. One project aims to automate loan processing in an underwriting organisation. As much as 80 per cent of the processing is carried out by software agents, leaving the user to concentrate on exceptions and problems. A project from Andersen Consulting, the world's biggest consulting firm, uses agents to create a workbench which can filter newsfeeds and support casual users in the financial services industry. There are more ambitious plans for agents in the future. This year AT&amp;T plans to introduce a messaging service called Personalink which uses agents to filter messages and search for information on a network. The agent software for Personalink was developed by General Magic, a Californian-based software company founded by the two lead designers of the Apple Macintosh. Telescript and Magic Cap, General Magic'stwo software products, are at the core of the Personalink service and could become the basis of more general standards in agent software. Other leading players in the software agents market include IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Xerox. With this level of interest and the expected market growth for agent software, it will not be long before spare PC power begins to wane.</p>

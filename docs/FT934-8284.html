			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries recover most of early falls in late rally ALTHOUGH longer-dated US Treasury securities ended the first day of the new week in negative territory, a late rally helped prices recover most of the earlier losses incurred in the wake of strong industrial production data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond, which had been down half a point at one stage, was only  3/32 lower at 101 1/4 , yielding 6.152 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 19/32 , to yield 4.076 per cent. Prices at the long end fluctuated in early trading, but turned decisively lower mid-morning when it became clear that there would be no follow-through from initial dealer buying. Sentiment was not helped by the news that industrial output climbed 0.8 per cent in October. The data was the latest to show resurgent economic growth, yet the downward pull on prices they exerted in the morning eventually eased. By mid-afternoon, the long end had recovered most of its losses as dealers anticipated increased demand from municipal authorities. GERMAN government bonds rallied following the announcement of yet more gloomy news on the economic front. Bunds were further supported by expectations that the Bundesbank will lower interest rates at today's repo. The government's independent council of economic advisers, known as the Five Wise Men, forecast zero growth in 1994 for west Germany and a further increase in unemployment in their annual report, released yesterday morning, which provided a good bid for the Bund market early in the trading session. News that western German wholesale prices fell 0.2 per cent in October and were down 0.6 per cent from a year earlier also supported Bund prices. The market's attention is likely to be focused on the Bundesbank's repo, with many dealers predicting that the rate will be cut by between 5 and 10 basis points. Last week, the lowest rate on the 14-day facility was 6.38 per cent. Mr Julian Jessop, economist at Midland Global Markets, said speculation of a 5 to 10 basis point cut was fuelled by 'the fact that call money is soft and that the repo rate would have to come down accordingly' but he thought a 2 basis point cut more likely. Bund futures rallied from Friday's close of 99.78 to a high of 100.03, before slipping back to 99.84 by late afternoon. THE DANISH central bank cut key interest rates by 25 basis points but the move came late in the trading session and had little initial impact. However, traders expect the cut to help lift prices when the market opens today. RUMOURS of a poor auction result pushed Italian government bonds sharply lower yesterday afternoon, although when the final auction details were released later on, the rumours turned out to be unfounded. The sale of L1,500bn of 10-year paper eventually came through in line with expectations, with the net yield falling to 7.94 per cent from 7.99 per cent at the previous auction. UK gilts opened on a firm note, taking their cue from other international government bond markets, but fell back after yesterday's US economic data. Dealers said that the market is waiting for the release of the UK PSBR figures today and the October retail price index tomorrow for direction. The Liffe long gilt future rose from Friday's close of 114.22 to a high of 114.30 but traded at 114.24 by late afternoon. JAPANESE government bonds opened sharply higher on the back of Friday's rally in the US Treasury bond market and the yen's strength, but drifted lower during the course of the day as domestic players took profits. Although usually a boosting factor in the government debt market, yesterday's tumble in the Tokyo stock market - a 418.94 point fall to 18,074.61 - was largely shrugged off by the bond market. Interest rates on three-month certificates of deposit remained low, trading at 3.32 per cent, while the call rate edged up to 3 5/8 per cent, which dealers said reflected the fact that this was the end of the reserve period for the Bank of Japan. Expectations in the markets are high that the prime minister will propose income tax cuts of between Y5,000bn and Y6,000bn later this week, to be financed by short-term bridging bonds. The March futures contract, which opened at 114.39 after Friday's close of 114.19, fell to a low of 114.12 and ended Tokyo trading at 114.15.</p>

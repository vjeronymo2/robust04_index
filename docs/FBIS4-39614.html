			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]  <F P=106> [All quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Moscow hopes that the United States and Russia's  other western partners will exert their influence on the Bosnian  Moslems and Croats in order to reach a ceasefire agreement in  Bosnia and Herzegovina, a top-ranking Russian diplomat in charge  for the settlement in the former Yugoslavia said in his  interview with Interfax.    In his words, the Geneva meeting between the special envoy  of  the UN General Secretary Yasusi Akasi and representatives of the  confronting Bosnian parties was fruitless. "Moslems and Croats  agree only to a quadripartite ceasefire with its possible  prolongation for four weeks. The Bosnian Serbs are ready to  cease fire at least for four months," the diplomat indicated.    As he said, "fears that the Serbs would try to preserve the  status-quo and to fix themselves on 70 percent of Bosnia and  Herzegovina stand behind the obstinacy of the Moslems and  Croats." "One cannot say that these fears are groundless. The  threat of "an ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and Herzegovina is  still preserved and all confronting parties are the source of  this threat, noted Interfax interlocutor. But it is quite  obvious that nobody will let the Serbs violate the proportion of  division which was coordinated at the ministers' meeting in  Geneva; in accordance with this agreement the Serbs will receive  49and the Moslem-Croatian federation -- 512000060100f the territory  of this former Yugoslavian republic."    According to the diplomat, "one cannot permit that the fears  of one of the parties would "suspend" the process of peaceful  settlement in Bosnia." "In an adverse case the world community  will be forced to begin everything from the very beginning," he  said.</p>

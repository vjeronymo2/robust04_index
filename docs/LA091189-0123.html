			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ADR CYCLING TEAM TO SUE LEMOND ON DECISION TO RIDE FOR FRENCH Z  </P> <P> World champion and Tour de France winner Greg LeMond will be taken to court by  his current team ADR for alleged breach of contract, the team's owner Francois  Lambert said today.  </P> <P> LeMond is to announce Wednesday in Paris which team he will ride for next year.  But he will definitely leave ADR, and is widely expected to sign a three-year  contract worth $5.7 million with the French outfit Z.  </P> <P> Lambert said he will seek compensation from LeMond for breaking his two-year  contract with ADR after only one season.  </P> <P> "It's all in the hands of my lawyers now. If he signs somewhere else, we're  going to court to get what we're entitled to. He has a two-year contract and he  can't get out of it," Lambert told Reuters in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> He said he would seek compensation equaling one year's salary with Z -- almost  $2 million.  </P> <P> He said LeMond's salary this year was $300,000.  </P></p>

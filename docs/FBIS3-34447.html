			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 9 Feb (MENA)-- The Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations continued up to dawn today under the cochairmanship  of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and the presence of Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa, in an attempt to reach an agreement that would eliminate  the obstacles hindering the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. Sources close to  the negotiations have said that the stances assumed by both  sides have not changed a bit and that differences still persist  on the crossing points and the area of Jericho.    [Paris AFP in English at 0210 GMT on 9 February carries a  Cairo-datelined item by Haro Chakmakjian on the negotiations,  which adds: "Israeli and PLO negotiators made `some progress' in  a marathon session of talks deep into the night aimed at  launching Palestinian self-rule, but an accord would still need  more work, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said here  early Wednesday.    ["`We made some progress and we shall try tomorrow  (Wednesday) to complete our work,' Peres told reporters after  more than four hours of discussions with a PLO delegation led by  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat.    ["Peres said both sides would meet again at about 10:00 a.m.  (0800 GMT) Wednesday, and he would meet 'Arafat at about midday.    ["`We are working on a text that we are to agree on,' Peres  added.    ["Another Israeli negotiator, Foreign Ministry Director  General Uri Savir, said differences with the PLO had been  reduced, but `nobody at this point knows how close we are' to an  agreement.    ["The points of disagreement were sensitive, he explained.  `We haven't set a deadline yet.'    ["Negotiators from the Palestine Liberation Organisation  could not be reached for comment on Tuesday's talks held at the  Andalus Palace in the northeastern suburb of Heliopolis, where  'Arafat was staying.    ["Savir said both sides were working `word by word and  paragraph by paragraph.'    ["They were concentrating on security issues such as the  control of international borders and road access to Jewish  settlements, which, together with the size of the autonomous  Jericho area, have been the main stumbling blocks.    ["Earlier Egyptian leaders stepped in to try to break the  deadlock after an inconclusive round of talks Monday."]    The same AFP report adds: ["An Egyptian Foreign Ministry  official told AFP Egypt had `made every effort to enable the two  sides to reach an accord.'    ["President Husni Mubarak held a 45-minute meeting with  'Arafat and Peres, after a day when the two sides reported no  progress.    ["Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa later met Peres for an hour to  try to resolve the remaining difficulties.    ["Peres said he had the `mandate of the government' and  would  stay on in Cairo as long as necessary to overcome obstacles.  The points agreed in Davos still stood, he said, denying  Palestinian charges that Israel was backing out.    ["However, he told Israeli radio: `Even if we sign an  agreement on security issues, which are on the agenda, there is  a range of other subjects which we have not yet tackled and  which will have to be settled.'    ["They included the powers to be devolved to the Palestinian  autonomy council, the electoral system and the transfer of  civilian authority."]</p>

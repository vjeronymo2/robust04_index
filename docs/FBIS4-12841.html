			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Amman--The Iraqi parliamentarians headed for  France on Tuesday to attend a session of the European Parliament  where they are expected to make a strong pitch for the release  of frozen Iraqi assets and an end to the 45-month old  international sanctions against their country.    Abd-al-Karim 'Abbas and Bashir Qadim, members of the Foreign  Affairs Committee of the Iraqi Parliament, are expected to  present a summary of the impact of the sanctions against their  country and argue that Baghdad has satisfactorily met with all  demands of the United Nations Security council, diplomats said.    One of the immediate Iraqi requests to be made formally and  informally at the Strasbourg meetings is expected to be for an  unfreezing of Iraqi assets that remain frozen in some of the  European countries. [passage omitted].    At the outset of the Gulf crisis, Iraqi assets frozen abroad  were estimated to be worth around $4 billion. Since then some  of the governments have publicly released the funds while others  have clandestinely entered agreements with the Iraqi government.  Under the agreements, some of the governments agreed that part  of the frozen assets be used to pay for Iraqi imports from their  countries and part be used as collateral to guarantee Iraqi  letters of credit.    In the maze of a confusing array of arrangements that the  Iraqi government has entered into with many sympathetic Western  and Third World governments, the actual amount that remains in  the frozen accounts is not known.    "I don't think many senior Iraqi officials themselves know  what is left and what has been appropriated in their inter-bank  arrangements and agreements," said a source closely familiar  with Iraqi moves in the international market.    The two Iraqi members of Parliament are expected to issue a  public appeal for the release of frozen Iraqi assets in the  member countries of the European Union (EU) as well as for EU  support for Baghdad's call for an end to the international  sanctions.    A diplomat said Iraq "will have a listening audience  particularly from among French members of the European  Parliament." The diplomat noted that France has stood out among  the five permanent members of the Security Council to argue that  Iraq deserved an easing of the crippling sanctions. (passage  omitted]    Meanwhile, an Italian business delegation is expected here  Wednesday after a visit to Baghdad.    Diplomatic sources said Iraqi officials who met with the  delegation raised the issue of unfreezing Iraqi assets held in  Italian banks. Some of the banks have already entered  unpublicised arrangements with the Iraqi government, but others  are believed to be holding back.    The delegation includes businessmen and officials of the  Arab-Italian Chamber of Commerce, but the team's trip to Baghdad  was not arranged or organised by the Italian governments, the  Italian Embassy in Amman said.    During their stay in Amman, the delegation members will hold  talks with their Jordanian counterparts on issues related to  Jordanian-Italian trade.</p>

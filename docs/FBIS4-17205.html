			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report in the "Russia-Ukraine" column: </F> "Pavel Grachev Will Do Everything for Sevastopol To Become  Russia's Main Base on the Black Sea. But the First Day of  Negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet Division Has Ended  Inconclusively"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The current situation has  been commented on by Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet  commander; and Valeriy Volodin, chairman of the Coordinating  Council of the Black Sea Fleet Officers Assemblies. The keynote  of their statements was the impossibility of dividing the fleet.  But if the presidents so wish, then both the main and all the  other Black Sea Fleet bases must remain in Crimea. As for the  Ukraine Navy base, both Kalinin and Volodin, as well as other  Black Sea Fleet representatives, persistently urged Pavel  Grachev not to allow its deployment in any of Crimea's populated  areas. Kalinin proposed that the Ukraine Navy headquarters and  its installations be located in Odessa, Nikolayev, or Ochakov,  but "in no circumstances in Crimea."    Summing up the results of the meeting, Russian Federation  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that he has taken note of  everything that was said and that "we must have 80 percent of  the fleet, and then it will be a sound fleet. We shall stick to  our guns." [passage omitted]    Reliable sources say that the Ukrainian side has expressed  its readiness to lease Sevastopol to Russia for five years, as  its main Black Sea Fleet base, with a subsequent extension of  the term; and to withdraw the Ukraine Navy Headquarters and  other installations from Sevastopol. Kiev, however, insists  that Black Sea Fleet units leave the cities of Izmail, Ochakov,  Odessa, and Nikolayev, as well as populated areas in Crimea.  The Russian side agrees with this in principle but is against  redeploying its units from Feodosiya and Novoozernyy (Donuzlav).  Ukraine proposes dividing the fleet fifty-fifty, so that 15 to  20 percent of battleships and auxiliary vessels go to the  Ukraine Navy while the remaining part (30 to 35 percent) Kiev  promises to transfer to Russia on mutually beneficial terms.    Yesterday at 1200 talks began at the Black Sea Fleet  Headquarters between the defense ministers of Russia, Army  General Pavel Grachev; and of Ukraine, Army General Vitaliy  Radetskyy. Radetskyy declared that the negotiations cannot  proceed with the participation or even in the presence of Yuriy  Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea; or Viktor Semenov,  chairman of the Sevastopol City Council. Meshkov and Semenov  left the room. According to information in possession of  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, the president of the  Crimean Republic has left for Simferopol.

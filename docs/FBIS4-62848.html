			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine's statement that it is ready to pass its  strategic bombers to Russia is yet another gimmick aimed at  creating a wrong impression of the talks on the issue, commander  of the Russian Air Force, Colonel-General Petr Deynekin told  Interfax on Wednesday.    He said that if Ukraine did not pass its strategic bombers  to  Russia on acceptable terms this year, they would simply turn  into scrap metal. He also noted that even now many of these  planes would hardly be able to take off and that all of the  maintenance facilities were located in Russia.    He said he did not know anything about forthcoming talks  with  Ukraine on the transfer of the bombers to Russia. He also noted  that Russia and Ukraine had not yet come to terms on the sum  which Russia is to pay for the bombers.    He said that the 8 billion dollars claimed by Ukraine was  unacceptable. Russia is ready to write off 217 billion rubles  from the Ukrainian debt for the Russian energy and fuel in  exchange for the bombers, he stated.    Ukraine has 42 heavy strategic bombers.</p>

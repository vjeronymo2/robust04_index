			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper prices settle back - Market Report The London Metal Exchange COPPER made another attempt to clear Dollars 2,450 a tonne for three months delivery yesterday but again met general liquidation and Chinese selling and settled back to end marginally lower on the day. ALUMINIUM prices did not make any more headway either. Business was done within a comparatively narrow band, well below the overhead objective for the three months position of Dollars 1,550 a tonne. There were some signs of forward tightness developing in LEAD next year, but this failed to generate enough on the upside to lift the market above the Dollars 600-a-tonne barrier.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government plans to buy a third nuclear reactor  for research purposes next year. Seven international companies  are expected to bid for the construction contract of a new Bt4.5  billion atomic centre in Nakhon Nayok province.    Suchat Mongkhonphantha, secretary general of the Office of  Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), claimed yesterday that feedback  to the proposal from local residents was "positive".    The centre, to be built on 316-rai of land in Nakhon Nayok's  Ongkharak district, will include a five-to-10 megawatt reactor,  a laboratory for atomic isotope production, a chemical nuclear  laboratory, a radioactive waste management plant and other  nuclear facilities for scientific and medical purposes, he said.    However, resident groups in the province told THE NATION  they  are concerned that the OAEP had not given them full information.    They were worried about possible radioactive contamination  of  the environment and waterways. They had also not been told  about safety measures or how to behave in case of an accident.    "OAEP public relations officers only informed us how the new  centre will be useful in terms of scientific and economic  progress," said a resident of Ongkharak who asked not to be  named.    "But as local residents here, we also need to know about the  possible negative effects -- whether it will pose a danger to  our health and the environment.    "We need more details about the transportation route of  radioactive fuel and waste management."    Suchat said the OAEP office will also be relocated to the  new  site from its 30-year-old office on Bangkok's Wiphawadi Rangsit  Road, about eight km from Don Muang International Airport.    International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations  require  nuclear reactors to be at least 14 km away from an airport to  diminish any danger from an aviation accident.    The seven firms expected to bid for the project are: Atomic  Energy Canada Ltd, the US-based General Atomic, Technical Atom  from France, Siemens from Germany, Invapp from Argentina, C. Zec  from China and a Japanese consortium.    OAEP and the Bechtell International, a US consultancy  company, will draft the terms of reference (ToR) for the  project, Suchat said. Contractors will be invited to discuss  the ToR before submitting their bids. OAEP expects to select a  contractor by January next year.    Construction will start after preparation of a Safety  Analysis Report, which will include an environmental impact  assessment. The Nuclear Facility Regulation Centre, based in  the OAEP office, and the National Environmental Board will  examine the report.    "We expect construction and establishment of a new nuclear  reactor and other facilities to be completed in 1998," Suchat  said.    OAEP spends about Bt4 million annually purchasing  Uranium-235  from General Atomic for its present two-MW reactor, Suchat said.  Waste from the plant is treated and stored at the OAEP office on  Wiphawadi Rangsit.    "The solid waste is stored in 200-litre buckets after being  treated. There are about 200 buckets' of low-level radioactive  waste being stored here," said an OAEP's waste management  specialist.    "OAEP also encourages hospitals to send their wastes to us  for treatment. Therefore, our space is almost full. Treatment  and storage will be moved to the new centre when it is  completed," she said.    Liquid waste from the plant such as  radioactively-contaminated water is released, after being  treated, into the waterway in front of the OAEP office building  before flowing into a canal in Bang Khen area.    She said the office monitors the water closely.    The new research reactor will be the third in the country.  The first, a one-MW reactor, was given to Thailand by the  United States under the Atoms For Peace Programme of President  Dwight Eisenhower in 1961. The government paid Btl6 million to  purchase the second, two-MW reactor from General Atomic in 1977.    Suchat said the new atomic centre will also give priority to  staff training in preparation for the future if Thailand decides  to build a nuclear power plant.</p>

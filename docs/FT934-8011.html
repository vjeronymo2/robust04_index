			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: SocGen launches 'knockout' warrant SOCIETE Generale has issued 400 'knockout' call warrants on Mexican par bonds, designed to provide a play on ratification of the North American Free Trade Association (Nafta). The warrants give holders the right to buy Mexican par bonds, but the 'knockout' feature means that if the value of the bonds falls below a certain level at any time during the life of the warrants, they expire worthless. Otherwise, the warrants can be exercised on July 15 1994. The 'knockout' feature reduces the cost of the options, particularly when the underlying security is volatile. Societe Generale believes there is an 80 per cent chance that Nafta will be approved by US Congress, and that this would have a positive impact on the performance of Mexican debt. The ratification would 'probably lead to an upward revision of Mexico's grading on long-term foreign currency debt', reducing the premium on Brady bonds, said SocGen. If the treaty is not ratified, SocGen believes there will be a short-term increase in volatility.</p>

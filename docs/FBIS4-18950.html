			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jacques Calvet: "Saying No to the Current </F> Europe"]    [Text] The cantonal elections will be followed shortly by a  vote to elect European officials. Maastricht was already a  wakeup call for nearly half the French people; many others voted  in favor of the treaty not out of the conviction that it was a  good one, but because they were reluctant to delay what was  described as a step toward building a united Europe. Maastricht  has since died--not, unfortunately, in terms of its practical  consequences, each of which is more loathsome than the next, but  in the minds of virtually the entire French population.    The European elections will at least partly shape the fate  of  the European Union for the next five years. The French must take  advantage of the opportunity to rise up together and deliver a  resounding "no" to the current Europe of confusion, abandoned  principles, incompetence, and absurdity.    How can Europe get along as Twelve--soon to be  sixteen--after  the curious about-face of the French president in Vienna a few  months ago? In Austria Mitterrand abandoned the notion of  deepening the Community and revamping its institutions before  widening it. Meanwhile, the Twelve still do not know what sort  of common future they would like to have. How can a family,  company, association, political party, or church establish  itself before it has ensured that its members adhere to a  certain number of shared goals?    What is the joint position of the Twelve with respect to the  United States of America or Japan on foreign--or more  important--trade policy? What is its shared vision of European  monetary or social policy, from which Great Britain and Denmark  have been allowed to withdraw? What is the Twelve's common  assessment of the Community's institutions, executive branch  (legally, the Council of Ministers; actually the Commission, or  more accurately the technocrats that sit on it), legislature,  powers, and sense of responsibilities? What attitude do the  Twelve share on the serious problem of the need for equality  among the four biggest countries, Germany, France, Great  Britain, and Italy? The French head of state abandoned this  principle of equal weight--to Germany's benefit--during  discussion of the Maastricht treaty, first when determining  future European monetary institutions, then the composition of  the European Parliament.    The European Commission has just negotiated with Japan's  MITI  [Ministry of International Trade and Industry] the  implementation--beginning in 1994--of the 31 July 1991 agreement  on the sale of Japanese cars in the EC. It is just one of many  examples that could be cited.    I protested this accord as soon as it was signed on 31 July  1991. I underscored the responsibility of its  negotiators--notably Mr. Mitterrand and European Affairs  Minister Elisabeth Guigou--for the inevitable rise in  unemployment and deterioration in living standards that would  result. The agreement was drafted by the president of the  European Commission, Mr. Delors, and the commissioner concerned,  Mr. Bangemann.    Unfortunately, everything is happening just as I predicted.  Year after year, the terms of the accord are flouted; Japan is  not shouldering its fair share of the slump in the European  market relative to the Commission's original, too-rosy  predictions; cars produced in Japanese factories in Europe are  not counted in the official total of Japanese sales in the  European Union; and the Japanese market is still virtually  closed to European car exports.  <H5>  The False God of Monetary Management </H5>   Despite the best efforts of the present government,  particularly Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, the  Socialist government got off to too bad a start in Paris and  Brussels for any easy fixes. All we can do now is challenge the  present Europe of abandoned principles, and define at last a  common trade policy based on reciprocity rather than wide-eyed  free-tradism. Europe practices free trade, while the United  States of America in recent times--and Japan for as long as  anyone can remember--merely talk about it, while scrupulously  rejecting it in practice. Automobiles can travel freely on  public roads, but traffic is organized through systems of  right-of-way and stoplights. Why not apply a modicum of  rationality to international trade, which, while free, would be  based on reciprocal and symmetrical rights and responsibilities  for all parties involved?    Monetary management is the last of the false gods: though  the  practical and psychological consequences of joblessness can tear  a society apart, the extent of unemployment in France and Europe  alike is underestimated. For advocates of monetary policy, the  only thing that counts is a rising or falling money supply, "M3"  in specialists' jargon. And when the money supply does not  evolve as expected--that is, when it does not expand enough to  meet objectives--it is interpreted in ways that defy common  sense to justify a restrictive monetary policy.    The Maastricht-stipulated independence of the Bank of  France,  which even authorities are beginning to realize is noxious, has  been another damper on hopes for an economic recovery in France.  What kind of an orchestra would have one conductor for the brass  section and another for strings? What kind of soccer team would  have one tactical coach for forwards and another for defense?  The previous government debased itself when it abandoned some of  its prerogatives together with its legitimate responsibilities.  As for the Bank of France, it tails after Germany's Bundesbank  like a puppy, despite the fact that the economic situations of  Germany and France require different monetary policies. In other  words, our monetary policy is no longer either European or  French, but purely a product of Germany's.  <H5>  A String of Concessions </H5>   Mitterrand takes great delight in talking about our social  safety net, at the risk of sowing dissension and disorder in  French society. But the role of a president of the Republic is  to bring parties together, not divide them. How can Mitterrand  imagine for one second that we will be able to maintain the  current standard of living in France and the EC, when he has  conceded one principle after another in building Europe, and has  failed to extract a real, jointly-defined trade policy from some  of our partners? Without monetary and social safeguards,  competition between the developing countries of southeast Asia,  including the highly managed economy of Japan, and European  countries more attentive to the fate of individuals, that is, to  their real social responsibilities, can only lead to increased  unemployment and a drop in European living standards.    If, as Mitterand claims, we need to define a social policy  for Europe, we must first found it on a policy that protects  Europe's economic and trade interests vis-a-vis the rest of the  world. Staunch European though I am, Europe in its present form  must be rejected. And if France truly cannot persuade its  partners to construct a real Europe within the current  framework, better to abandon what will have been only a dream  before it becomes a nightmare. We will then have to rebuild our  country's future in Europe in a precise, courageous, competent,  and logical fashion, with whatever partners choose to join us.</p>

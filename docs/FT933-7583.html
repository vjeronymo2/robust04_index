			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Metcalfe to lead Queens Moat Houses MR STANLEY Metcalfe, former chairman and chief executive of Ranks Hovis McDougall, is to become non-executive chairman of Queens Moat Houses after the hotel group's annual meeting next Thursday. Mr John Bairstow, QMH's founder, resigned as chairman yesterday. QMH is continuing talks with its 65 banks over refinancing debts of Pounds 1bn. Losses for 1992 have yet to be reported. Mr Bairstow will not receive any compensation for leaving, in common with nine other directors of the group who have resigned since its shares were suspended in March. He stepped down to the post of non-executive chairman last month and said then that he would resign once a new chairman was found. Mr Bairstow will not have to attend the annual meeting. It will be chaired by Mr Andrew Coppell, who was made chief executive last month after being brought in as a consultant. Mr Coppell said that Mr Metcalfe was a man 'with solid industrial experience and familiar with the disciplines required at QMH. He will make a significant contribution to the recovery of the group'. Mr Metcalfe had the support of the group's main bankers, but would be a 'champion for the shareholders'. Mr Metcalfe, who will work three days a week, was available following RHM's takeover by Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate, at the end of 1992. He had worked for RHM for the whole of his business career, but his lack of experience in hotels was thought yesterday not to be a problem. A QMH adviser said of Mr Metcalfe, 'he is very aggressive, opinionated and pushy which is good for a company in this situation'. He was also described as 'a strong leader'. One food sector analyst said: 'Mr Metcalfe is a man of integrity, diligence and discipline and that's what QMH needs. They have got hotel management.' However, he was critical of some aspects of his management at RHM. In 1988 RHM resisted a Pounds 1.7bn bid from Goodman Fielder Wattie, the Australian food group, but last year agreed to the Pounds 935m bid from Tomkins. Another analyst said: 'I am a fan of Metcalfe, but I think I'm the only one. People forget that when he became managing director in 1981 the share price was 48p and he took it to 480p.' The Tomkins cash bid was worth 260p a share. 'He took a run-down, over-geared, not very profitable business and turned it into a very profitable company and transformed the balance sheet,' he added.

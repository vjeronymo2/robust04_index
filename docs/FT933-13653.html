			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A riposte to the supermarkets - Jancis Robinson tastes some of the offerings at Whitbread's wine shops AT LEAST until Victoria Wine and Augustus Barnett are fully integrated, the Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up group of Whitbread-owned off-licences will continue to be the major (only?) challenger to the supermarkets' increasing domination of wine retailing in Britain. The group's resourceful public relations manager - the one who had to deal with all those inquiries about former chancellor Norman Lamont's champagne - invited wine writers to taste 190 of its wines recently. Not everyone could come, so she laid the whole thing on again. Of the 80-odd wines I tasted, these made the strongest impression in terms of value. I loved the 1952 Verdelho Madeira at Pounds 69 per bottle, but was slightly sceptical about the claim that this rarity is available at each of the three chains. Note that some wines may have to be ordered, and that Thresher Wine Shops carry a much wider range of wines than Thresher Drinks Stores. Thresher recently launched an admirable booklet on matching food and wine. Bottoms Up offers to refund the difference if beaten on case prices of any wine, and throws in an extra bottle for goodwill. Thresher does not try to fight the supermarkets on rock bottom prices, but tries, with varying degrees of success, to offer at least as good value. Its enthusiasms include Alsace, superior Languedoc-Roussillon, New Zealand and fortified wines. WHITES Slovakians: The Gruner Veltliner from Nitra is sheer delight, with real Balkan intensity, yet crystal clear acidity. Price is kept at Pounds 2.99 by bottling in Germany. Thresher's buyer has sent some to potential Austrian suppliers to show what can be done with their native grape variety just over the border. The Gewurztraminer at Pounds 3.29 is equally convincing and withstood comparison with a much more expensive example from Alsace. NZ 1992 Chardonnay: Montana at Pounds 4.99 is very serviceable. Lots of pineapple and acidity. Truly representative, but not nearly as fine and lively as Hunter's, also from Marlborough, at Pounds 9.99. For white Graves enthusiasts: all the thrill at half the price in Ch Bonnet 1992 at Pounds 4.99. Now this is what Entre-Deux-Mers is best at] Portuguese Chardonnay: Peter Bright must be thrilled with his 1991 vintage of Cova de Ursa at Pounds 6.99 which delivers great fruit, clean oak, some lemony acidity and an odd Australian twang (yeast?). Southern French: Domaine Gauby's oak aged white 1991 is just the sort of creamy, fragrant, full-bodied dryish white Roussillon oddity for which I would happily pay Pounds 7.99, and indeed have, but it will be too full for some. WR/BU only. California Chardonnay: one which has even impressed Burgundians, Chalk Hill's 1991 is Pounds 11.99 and very fine indeed. BU/WR only. REDS Eastern Europeans at Pounds 2.99: Slovakian 1991 St Laurent also teaches the Austrians a lesson about pricing (see above). Lovely direct fruit flavours and even more exciting than the equally well made Hungarian Cabernet Sauvignon and even fruitier Merlot from Villanyi Hills. Southern French reds: Excellent buying here with the stupendously concentrated Domaine de l'Hortus at Pounds 4.99 (BU only), the intense, long-term old vine bottling from Ch de la Liquiere 1991 in Faugeres at Pounds 4.99 (WR/BU only), the more international oak-aged Cabernet Domaine de la Rivoyre 1990 at Pounds 3.99, and Terroir de Tuchan 1991, the most excitingly substantial Fitou I have tasted for five years, at Pounds 7.49. OTHERS Pinks: A fine and varied range includes Ch Bonnet's rosy Bordeaux Clairet at Pounds 4.99, the deeply fruity and serious Domaine de l'Hortus 1992 Rose (BU only), and the pale and frivolous Domaine Tastavy from the Domaines Virginie in Herault at Pounds 3.39 which should be consumed this minute. Palest sherry: Don Zoilo Manzanilla at Pounds 7.99 is described as Very Old, but is the palest, driest, freshest drink you could hope for on a hot day. Presumably it is the solera whence it comes whose origins are so old? Sticky and weird: Cavendish Late Bottled 1963, Pounds 6.99. This South African fortified relic, sweet, ancient, and a bargain, tastes like a particularly venerable cross between Australian Liqueur Muscat and Madeira, and comes from a bottle that looks like a Walnut Whip. One of the few wines you could drink with same.</p>

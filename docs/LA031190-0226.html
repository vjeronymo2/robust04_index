			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I watched ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" for the first and last time  Feb. 18. One almost can pardon adoring parents for thinking it's funny for  "junior" to pour dirt onto their pet Doberman's eyes, but not the judgment of  the show's producers for considering it to be a hilarious situation.  </P> <P> Mary Lou Maloy, Hemet  </P></p>

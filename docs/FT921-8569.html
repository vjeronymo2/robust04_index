			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Watchful eyes on Pounds that will be the big question occupying the Bank of England as it watches the fate of sterling in the foreign exchanges and as political pressures for a reduction grow more intense. Sterling's shining performance last week - when it ignored virtually every piece of bad news the economists could throw at it - may well strengthen the case for an interest rate cut. Certainly, if the dollar continues to rise at the expense of the D-Mark, one of the heaviest pressures on the UK currency could be eased just enough to allow a reduction in interest rates. Dr Mark Austin, economist with HongKong Bank, suggests that the authorities could 'get away with just a small cut', in a such a case. The market is becoming increasingly attuned to the idea of a  1/4 point reduction. A strong dollar appears to be on the cards this week, with few events scheduled which would have an adverse impact. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is set to give his biannual report to Congress on Wednesday, known as the Humphrey Hawkins speech. Most economists expect him to say the same old thing - enough has been done, but if necessary we will do more. The market is also looking for a pick up in housing starts, due out the same day. Even if the statisticians come up with depressing numbers, 'the market is in the mood to ignore the bad news and trade on the good,' says Mr Nigel Newman, senior economist with Barclays. In Germany, good producer price figures are not expected to put off the D-Mark bears. The continuing difficulty of wage negotiations and the Bundesbank's stated policy of holding firm on rates are likely to weaken the D-Mark, say economists.</p>

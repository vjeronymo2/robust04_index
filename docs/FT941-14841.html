			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): A season of flood, mud and misery - Seeds are perishing and sugar-beets remain unharvested in Britain's sodden fields Apart from a few snow showers there has been no precipitation of any significance in Norfolk for four days, but the lawn outside the office window of my farmhouse is flooded in several places to a depth of two to three inches. It has been like that for at least six weeks and as I write I can see that the pair of blackbirds who have recently adopted the largest puddle as their bathing place are back for their morning dip. Beyond the garden hedge is a field of wheat - at least that is what was planted at the end of November after the sugar-beet had been lifted from the already wet land. The seeds did not go in at all well and by no means all have so far germinated. The soil was saturated by 30 inches of rain during the six months before planting (compared with a long-term annual average of 23 inches per year) and I was not very optimistic at the time. In the event almost continuous rain since the beginning of December has 'puddled' on the surface and in some places, such as the inevitable tractor wheel marks made during cultivations and planting, water has been lying ever since. It is highly unlikely that seeds beneath these mini-floods will have survived. Moreover, in a low corner on the far wide of the field about half an acre is flooded to a depth of several inches. We tried clearing drains and ditches that might allow the water to run away but to no avail. The soil is saturated and cannot take any more - that area must now be considered a total write off. At the back of the farmyard there are lambs on a meadow. But it does not look much like a meadow at present. In fact there is more mud than grass - the inevitable result of tiny hooves on saturated land together with the wheelings of the tractor and trailer used to deliver roots for the lambs to eat. I am at least thankful that we do not have outdoor pigs on this farm. After a series of mild, dry winters, and attracted by the relative economy of keeping pigs outside, without expensive buildings, many farmers have adopted outdoor systems. Some have put pigs on to land that is frankly unsuitable. Only sandy, free-draining soils are really appropriate. But this winter is illustrating why many pig farmers, myself included, brought our pigs inside, off inappropriate land, many years ago. For pigs are far harder on the land than sheep. Quite apart from their habit of 'rooting' the soil with their snouts, they carry several times as much weight as sheep on feet that are not much bigger. When the land is as wet as it is now pigs sink up to their bellies. Indeed they find it difficult to get around at all in deep mud and it is even worse when that mud freezes into a landscape as hard and abrasive as petrified volcanic lava. Furthermore pigs have no woolly coats to keep them warm and dry during the worst excesses of winter. I feel sorry for them and for those who have to look after them under such conditions. But my greatest immediate worry is for 30 acres of unharvested sugar-beet. They should of course, have been harvested long ago, in line with the recommendation by British Sugar, the monopoly processor of all UK beet, that roots should be lifted and piled way before Christmas. That is what we usually try to do; but last season, a heavy national crop and the decision of British Sugar to extend the processing season in order to make better use of its factories, meant that some of our November-lifted roots were still on the farm until the end of February. By that time some of them had gone rotten and British Sugar refused to accept them. Indeed we had to sort hundreds of tonnes by hand to remove the rotten ones and sell the rejects at a low price for sheep and cattle feed. Needless to say we wanted to avoid a repeat of that experience and when the same situation appeared to be building up again - in other words that British Sugar might again extend processing until the end of February or beyond - we, along with a great many other sugar-beet growers, decided to take the risk of leaving some lifting until the new year. The reasoning behind this was that the beets keep a lot better in the soil than in a heap. Unfortunately we reckoned without the rain and at the last count some 5 per cent of the national sugar-beet crop remained in the ground. In Norfolk, where I farm, the figure was 12 per cent. Sugar-beet growers are now battling to recover what they can of the crop in the full knowledge that they are unlikely to harvest it all. The contractor who lifts our beet, for instance, last week spent two and a half days digging his machine out of a bog on one of our fields - a bog that had never been there before. At a potential value of about Pounds 600 an acre the 30 acres at risk on our farm are worth Pounds 20,000. But the land on which they are growing is scheduled for set-aside in 1994. To qualify for the arable area payment on that land we should, according to EU regulations, have cleared the land by January 15. It was therefore with great relief that we learned last weekend that the minister of agriculture, Mrs Gillian Shephard, has succeeded in persuading officials in Brussels to extend the deadline to the end of February. Now the battle with the elements is to get as many beets as possible lifted and delivered to processing factories before they are closed, probably during the third week in February, by British Sugar - the company that got us into this mess in the first place.</p>

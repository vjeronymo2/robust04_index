			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (8): Focus is on a second generation - Supersonic travel By the end of the 1990s, Concorde will have been carrying commercial passengers at supersonic speeds for almost a quarter of a century, having entered commercial service in 1976. Normally 25 years is about the maximum life-span for an airliner, but Concorde's relatively low annual utilisation rate, compared to subsonic jets, and its intensive maintenance schedule mean it will probably be able to continue flying well into the next century. Nevertheless, Concorde was designed in the 1960s and inevitably even its most ardent admireres are beginning to ask what comes next. There is already much interest in the world airline and aerospace industry in the development of a second-generation supersonic airliner - or High Speed Commercial Transport - to replace Concorde. It is unlikely, however, that any HSCT could emerge before the year 2005 at the earliest. Before any successor to Concorde could be built, key technological, environmental and commercial economics issues must be addressed. The HSCT would be expensive to build - some estimates have suggested it could cost Dollars 15bn or more to develop - and it is likely to face even more severe environmental restrictions than Concorde in terms of noise levels and pollution. No single company can afford that sort of money - particularly with other large subsonic aircraft studies such as the 800-seat Ultra-High Capacity Aircraft under way. A single US-led international effort to share the research and development costs of the HSCT probably stands the best chance of success, but multinational consortia are notoriously difficult to assemble and manage. Nevertheless, an informal start has already been made. The leading airframe manufacturers in the US (Boeing and McDonnell Douglas), western Europe (Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace) and in Russia and Japan have been working on many aspects of the HSCT for some time, together with the engine manufacturers. Among the issues, noise will be especially critical. The HSCT's engines will need to be much quieter than those of Concorde in order to use existing airports and meet international aircraft noise regulations which have been progressively toughened in recent years. The engines will also have to be much more efficient, in order to save fuel and keep down operating costs while also reducing, if not eliminating, pollutant emissions, especially nitrous oxides in the upper atmosphere. This may mean turning to new forms of engine, perhaps using combined-cycle turbofan-ramjet technology which is being studied in Japan and elsewhere. The aircraft will also need to make considerable use of low-weight, high temperature-resistant materials, such as ceramics and new composites capable of coping with the extremely high temperatures that will be generated both inside the engines and on the aircraft skin during the longer periods of sustained and faster supersonic cruise that Concorde is called upon to perform. But although there are still many unresolved technical and other problems, the aerospace industry's general view appears to be that none of these are insurmountable. Probably the most critical factor in the final decision on whether to go ahead with an HSCT is the likely market for supersonic travel. Although Concorde has been operated profitably by British Airways and Air France since the mid-1980s, no provision has been made for depreciation costs on an aircraft that cost Pounds 1.2bn to develop. With its payload of only 100 seats, Concord may be an engineering triumph, but its premium fares have always limited its market appeal. To be commercially viable, the industry believes that the next generation of supersonic airliners will probably have to be much bigger than Concorde, fly slightly faster and have a significantly longer range. The HSCT probably needs to seat 250 to 300 people in several classes, cruise at around Mach 2.4 (1,500mph) compared to Concorde's Mach 2, and have a range in excess of 5,000 miles compared to Concorde's 3,500 miles. The range is critical because it would open up new high-density routes such as the trans-Pacific routes from America's west coast to Asia. For example, the Los Angeles to Tokyo route could be flown non-stop in about 4.3 hours, instead of today's subsonic 10.3 hours. However research suggests that most passengers are willing to pay only a relatively modest 'supersonic premium' of 10-20 per cent over subsonic fares. There are strikingly different estimates of the potential market size for a new HSCT. The most optimistic suggest that demand in the first quarter of the next century could reach as many as 1,000 new supersonic aircraft, worth some Dollars 200bn-Dollars 300bn. However, more conservative estimates suggest that if such an aircraft could be built at an economic cost the market might run to several hundred aircraft at most. While small in comparison with many subsonic jets built over the past 40 years, that would still make it exceptionally successful compared with the total of 16 Concordes that originally entered service with BA and Air France  -reduced to 13 in use today by the need for spares. The requirement for a 'spares pool' serves as a reminder of Concorde's creeping middle age. Perhaps the real challenge for the manufacturers and the airlines will be to keep Concorde flying until a second-generation supersonic airliner is ready to replace it. Last year, BA's seven Concordes completed 250,000 commercial supersonic flying hours - more than the combined air forces of the west since the introduction of supersonic combat aircraft. In some areas the strain is beginning to show. Last year, BA began even more frequent checks following a series of incidents since 1989 in which parts of Concorde's rudder fell off during supersonic flight. None of the incidents represented a serious risk to the aircraft, but they were an embarrasment. Subsequently, BA asked British Aerospace, responsible for the original rudder design, to manufacture a new series of rudders for its Concordes for a total cost of about Pounds 5m. Each Concorde is at present cleared by the UK and French airworthiness authorities to fly a total of about 7,000 supersonic flights. BA's fleet of Concordes has already completed more than 4,000 flights and is expected to reach its current operational limit by 1998-99. The airline operators, the airframe manufacturers (BAe and Aerospatiale) and the engine suppliers (Rolls-Royce and Snecma), have been working to try to extend Concorde's life into the next century. The airlines in particular hope to stretch the life of Concorde until 2010. In the meantime, BA's Concorde fleet is being given an interior facelift. Eight years after the last refurbishment Concord is getting improved seats - with a folding central arm rest - new decor and galleys. The 1980s provided Concorde with a significant boost as captains of industry and finance, pop stars and sports personalities climbed aboard to cross the Atlantic in style and on time rather than worry about the cost. Inevitably, the recession and the cost-consciousness of the 1990s has forced some companies to reconsider the expense of flying senior executives by Concorde. But Concorde still attracts its regular fliers. Mr W. D. (Jack) Lowe, BA's director of flight crew for Concorde, says the airline remains 'very happy' with the Concorde operation and is confident that the service will continue well into the next century. He says the transatlantic flights are currently achieving an average load factor of 60 to 70 per cent. Apart from regular transatlantic services, BA has run scheduled winter flights to Barbados for the past four years which Mr Lowe says 'are busier than ever,' and both BA and Air France have also developed successful charter businesses for their supersonic jet.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTORS WANT BAIL REVOKED FOR MAN ACCUSED OF SHOOTING HIS WIFE;  </P> <P> CRIME: THEY AND THE FAMILY OF THE PREGNANT VICTIM WERE SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT  HER HUSBAND HAD POSTED $250,000 AND BEEN RELEASED.  </P> <P> Prosecutors prepared Friday to ask a judge to revoke the bail of Anthony L.  Totten, accused of shooting his estranged, pregnant wife, after the unemployed  tile setter made $250,000 bail and was released pending trial.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Cher DeCant said that prosecutors were "shocked" to learn  that Totten, 32, who has pleaded not guilty, had been released Tuesday. DeCant  said she believes Totten is a danger to his wife.  </P> <P> "Everybody was surprised, because the (municipal) judge set what he thought was  a reasonably high bail and expected that would protect her safety," DeCant  said.  </P> <P> Totten is accused of shooting his wife, Janet, 29, outside her gynecologist's  office in Huntington Beach on Oct. 30. Almost seven months pregnant, she is  recovering from the attack, which left her suffering from sinus problems,  hearing loss and a broken jaw. Her mouth has been wired shut, and she can only  speak through clenched teeth, family members said.  </P> <P> "I can't believe he's out," said Janet Totten's sister-in-law, Sheri Quick.  "He's a dangerous person. I can't believe they didn't tell anybody he was out."  </P> <P> The defendant's lawyer, John F. Hendry, said that his client has no intention  of going near his wife, his daughter or his year-old son.  </P> <P> Hendry said that Totten is staying in Laguna Hills with his family, who "kind  of put (the $250,000 bail) together," and is looking for work. "He's doing well  and has no desire to make contact with her," Hendry said.  </P> <P> Since learning on Thursday that Totten had been released, Janet Totten and the  couple's two young children have been living in fear, family members said.  </P> <P> "We're really upset that he gets to go home and have Christmas dinner and run  around and do whatever he wants," Quick said. "But Janet has to be afraid and  hide in fear."  </P> <P> Janet Totten declined to be interviewed. Two months ago, she claimed in a  lawsuit that her husband had a history of abusive behavior toward her and often  struck and threatened her. Anthony Totten is scheduled to appear in Superior  Court on Jan. 3.  </P></p>

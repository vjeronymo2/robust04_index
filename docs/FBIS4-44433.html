			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Deng Weizhi (6772 0251 1807), famous </F> sociologist, and central committee vice chairman of and  researcher at the China Association for Promoting Democracy;  edited by Gu Chu (6253 0443): "An Academic Treatment of the Ten  Relationships Among the People"]    [Text] As reform has intensified, opening has expanded, and  interest groups have been adjusted, today's contradictions among  the people have changed somewhat from those of pre-reform. An  academic treatment of the old and new contradictions among the  people is of direct concern to the stability and development of  Chinese society. There are 10 major contradictions.    1. The CPC vs the non-CPC. The CPC is the ruling  party, while the democratic parties (those bourgeois and  petty-bourgeois political parties that have accepted the  leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and joined the  revolutionary united front) are parties that participate in  government and political affairs. If we see China as a large  ship, then the captain is the CPC, with the rowers being the  democratic parties, the people of all nationalities. If we  take China as a solar system, then the CPC is the sun, with the  democratic parties and the association of industry and commerce  being the nine planets. But while "long-term coexistence" has  been no problem, "mutual oversight" still needs reinforced.  Mutual oversight is both a major function and a general  guarantee of long-term coexistence. A few places are still  subject to "treating each other as guests with mutual respect,  while not speaking to each other face to face, but living in  peace with each other." When speaking is necessary, some talk  of health and tell jokes, with the words not to involve justice.  Even when "justice is involved," it is mostly a repetition of  adages and stereotypes. Some grass-roots people are "blind to  the united front." We absolutely must not tolerate words or  deeds of discrimination against the democratic parties.  Meanwhile, the democratic parties must not stubbornly blame  society for not knowing about them. Democratic figures should  examine their consciences, asking themselves how many political  views they have espoused that have thoughtfully contributed to  strengthening the leadership of the party, and how many deeds  they have done that have "knowledgeably" benefited the people.  If things are to be done right, there must be no fear, but of  course prevention, of overstepping of the bounds. In the  history of the democratic parties, there have been almost no  incidents of overstepping the bounds. In order to help, there  must be no fear, but of course prevention, of adding to the  confusion.    2. City dwellers vs peasants. As to the supply,  demand, and prices of farm and sideline products in some places,  there is a phenomenon of "city dwellers laughing when peasants  jump, and peasants laughing when city dwellers jump." This is a  case of contradiction between urban and rural areas, and the  difference between industry and agriculture. Cheap grain  prices harm agriculture, while high grain prices harm industry.  All need to submit to the law of value for things to work out.  Some areas are now experiencing a contradiction between  takeover of arable land and expansion of cultivated area.  Cultivated land is peasants' livelihood. On existing  technological terms, higher per-unit yields are limited. So  higher gross output means mainly dependence on expansion of  cultivated area. Takeover of arable land means less gross  output, lower peasant income, higher farm product prices, and  thus increased spending by city dwellers. China is a country  of large territory, little arable land, and many people. While  we have exact plans for the hundreds of millions of jin of grain  that we would like to produce by the year 2000, our population  expansion means that we may not even have as much by then as we  do now. The sharp drop in cultivated area will make it hard to  avoid a day when we may have to tighten our belts.    3. Educational circles vs the business world. The  educated are the holders of advanced knowledge, and the  developers of advanced productive forces. The entrepreneurial  stratum is just rising in China, with businessmen being the  organizers and managers of our socialist economy. The relations  between these two strata concern the fate of our nation. The  educated are diving into the sea of business, while businessmen  climb the shores of academia, showing the exchange between the  two strata. Scholars are acquiring a stronger awareness of  serving businessmen, while business support for education is  growing. This shows the mutual appeal of these two strata.  But business support for education is like flower arranging,  not necessarily tree planting. Educational circles need to plant  taller trees to attract more breezes. Educational circles and  the business world need to form an alliance. And we need to  raise this educational-business alliance to the level of our  worker-peasant one.    4. Military vs civilian. The people supporting the  army and the army cherishing the people, working together as one  family, has been a glorious Chinese tradition for decades. With  the little amount we can afford to spend on education, how could  our military spending not experience difficulties. While our  force has been cut, our military spending still needs to be  higher. We need crack troops with good equipment. While mess  standards are not high for college students, they are even lower  for soldiers. Just as schools running enterprises is not a  permanent solution, military-run tertiary industries are also an  expedient measure. The crux of the matter is that both need to  be done moderately, with all observing market laws. From an  economic perspective, the poor compete to enlist in the army.  This economic standing can then be conveniently converted to  social standing. So the military and civilians are undergoing a  mutual conversion, as well as being dependent on each other.    5. Rich vs poor. China's gap between rich and poor  has begun to widen. The wealthy calculate their incomes in  hundreds of millions, while the poor have annual incomes in the  hundreds. While most of the wealthy get rich properly, some do  so improperly. Poverty involves objective as well as subjective  factors. The poor should not be jealous of the rich, just as  the rich should not discriminate against the poor. The poor  should trace the root cause of their poverty, and the rich ought  to help the poor. The rich also have a problem of being very  wealthy materially and spiritually, but poor educationally,  which is in urgent need of solution. The order of "simple  labor earning lots of money, while complicated work earns  little," needs corrected quickly. The labor-remuneration  "price relations" for various lines of work need to be rational.    6. Authorities vs subordinates. While  authorities and subordinates are unanimous on goals and basic  interests, they are still subject to contradictions. As  China's political democracy advances, with increased freedom of  speech, overt conflicts between upper and lower levels increase,  while covert contradictions decrease. One of the foci of these  conflicts is the phenomenon of corruption by some. In addition  to the exchange of power for money, there is more public  discussion about job and political corruption. As  anti-corruption intensifies, people will reach a better  consensus on the features, subjects, natures, and degrees of  corruption, by which time an order of high unity among upper and  lower levels will appear.    7. The old vs the young. Someone has discovered  the fact that the difference in the study of problems is far  smaller among various political parties than among differing age  groups. This shows that there is certainly a generation gap  between the old and the young. While this is the inevitable  result of faster Science and technology, economic, social, and  perceptual development, the gap is not unbridgeable. The  relations between the old and the young are actually ones of  tradition vs change. It needs pointed out that there is no  change in the world divorced from tradition, as well as no  unchanging tradition. While Confucianism has been discussed  for millenia, there is actually noone who has not transformed  it. While the generation gap seems to be a qualitative issue,  it is actually mainly a quantitative one. As to rate of change,  it is inevitable that the young will run ahead a little faster.  The future of our country is in the hands of our young people,  just as the future of our young people can be said to be old  age. As all are subject to physiological and psychological  ageing, the old and the young need to cooperate and supplement  each other.    8. Theists vs atheists. Since the primitive  beginnings of religion, theism has a million-year history. In  the future, once classes and political parties have withered  away, theism, as well as the need to propagandize atheism, will  continue to exist. Laterally, religion in China affects dozens  of nationalities and hundreds of millions of people. In  addition, it also has an international relationship. As religion  is culture, as well as social norms, it is reasonable that some  areas have a low crime rate among believers. Atheists ought to  respect the beliefs of theists. While all categories of cadres  at all levels should have a little general knowledge about  religion, some now lack this, often making fools of themselves  and bringing on disaster. While those who secure rights in  religious circles by force or trickery should be dealt with  severely, theists also need to be understanding, forgiving, and  tolerant about the lack of religious knowledge among some  atheists. As understanding and tolerance are key items in many  religious creeds, the more one is understanding, the more one is  respected. Some publishing houses now turn pale at the mere  mention of the word "religion," fearing that not dealing with it  accurately will cause trouble, so delete all references to  religious knowledge, which is actually adverse to its spread.    9. Coastal vs interior. China is made up of  several dragons with their heads along the coast and their tails  inland. Our coastal zones were opened up first and have  developed a little faster, while our inland areas have a poor  base and have developed a little slower. But the heads and  tails have a common fate. When the heads are lifted, the tails  raise up. The heads and tails are tied together by production  relations. How high either the heads or the tails can be lifted  depends on the role of the productive forces and overall  national might. A dragon can do without neither a head or a  tail, with the tail having a tail function, the waist a waist  function, and the head, tail, and waist needing mutual  attention. While it cannot be said that local protectionism  should not be allowed to exist at all, with patriotism including  love of one's native place, overdoing it shifts one's troubles  onto others. Local conditions need concern for the overall  situation. The more the center devolves authority to localities,  the more conscious inter-local cooperation is needed, and the  more all localities need to subordinate themselves to the  center. China is a whole piece that cannot be divided. "The  peacocks flying off to the southeast," with population flowing  to the coast, has both pros and cons, but is more pro than con.  The crux of the matter is that it needs to be controlled, with  control of the flow rate, volume, and direction, to keep them  orderly. As the relations between the coastal and interior  areas are ones of urban vs rural and advanced vs backward, they  need dealt with cautiously.    10. Mainland Chinese vs Taiwanese. Mainland  China and Taiwan are two places in one country. Both sides  have the same roots, which will sooner or later mature and  intertwine their branches. As Taiwan has more money and the  mainland has a large market, cooperation benefits both.  Cooperation is invincible. As neighboring countries  throughout the world make "treaties" and form "communities," how  can we as one country remain divided into this side and that  side? How can we go around in circles about our intercourse?  It is time to "shake hands for the third time" and "greet each  other with a smile." As the common people on both sides have  long since claimed each other as kin, those at the higher level  need to make faster, more, and all-out contacts.    All of these ten relationships are derivatives of the major  contradiction between our peoples' ever-growing material and  cultural needs and our backward productive forces. The goal of  dividing them up for purposes of discussion is to resolve this  major contradiction.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Stronger franc sees off danger of more exchange controls THE STRONGER performance of the French franc on currency markets yesterday suggests that the reimposition of capital controls in the European Community is unlikely to spread beyond Spain, Ireland and Portugal. Earlier this week, there were fears that the European Monetary System might become dependent on controls for its survival as first Spain and later Ireland and Portugal imposed restrictions to prevent funds flowing into the D-Mark. But yesterday, as the European Commission ruled that the three countries' exchange control measures were compatible with European law, Italy denied that it had any plans to follow suit. The apparent success of the joint Franco-German intervention to preserve the parity of the franc sharply lowered expectations that France would restrict the free movement of funds beyond its borders. Although European policy makers have been dismayed at the way large-scale movements of short-term capital have undermined parities and government policies in countries such as Italy, Britain and Spain, events over the past week have done little to support the idea that exchange controls are the answer to the problem. The controls imposed this week have caused damage to the EC as a whole and the countries that imposed them. Unless repealed soon, they could threaten the EC's policy for creating a single market in Europe by the end of this year. The Spanish experience this week also served as a warning to other EC nations. Spain's decision to force domestic banks to match loans to foreign investors by depositing an equal sum, interest-free, with the Bank of Spain sent the country's stock and bond markets into a tailspin on Thursday. The stock market fell to its lowest level since early 1986 and government bond yields moved to their highest ever levels. According to Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist of Lehman Brothers International in London, the Spanish move probably made foreign investors 'just as cross' as if the currency had been devalued for a second time in the crisis. As a result, the Spanish government will in future have to pay foreign investors a risk premium to finance its deficits. UK officials yesterday made clear that Britain would not re-impose foreign exchange controls. This determination should act as a further barrier to the spread of controls in Europe. The authorities in Rome and Paris are conscious that London and Frankfurt would be the beneficiaries of any move to impose controls. Italy, for example, was studying whether to impose controls similar to those introduced by Spain when the lira first came under speculative attack two weeks ago. According to senior monetary officials in Rome, the discussions were overtaken by events and and the Italian authorites, bowing to market pressure, opted for devaluation as 'the lesser evil'. Opponents of capital controls received strong backing this week from Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. 'Any step back to real controls is a step backwards, a regressive step,' he said in Washington. The US Treasury also made clear yesterday that the call by Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, for a study by the Group of 10 countries of global capital flows and their impact on the world monetary system was not intended to encourage the introduction of controls. A senior US Treasury official said the US had been 'very sorry' to see Spain and Ireland impose controls. Commenting on the proposed study, he said: 'We want to look at the power of the markets and we need to know more about the new instruments. But the study is not intended as a step towards re-regulation and we would strongly resist any move towards the reimposition of controls.'</p>

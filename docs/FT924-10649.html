			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Tomkins joins battle for RHM with Pounds 935m bid MR GREG HUTCHINGS, the British conglomerate-builder who once said Lord Hanson had taught him 'pretty much everything I know', yesterday trumped his former mentor with a Pounds 935m takeover bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK milling, baking and grocery products group. RHM, which already faces a hostile Pounds 790m offer from Hanson, the Anglo-American industrial conglomerate, agreed to the counter-bid from Tomkins, Mr Hutchings' company, and recommended that shareholders accept it. Tomkins' move puts pressure on Hanson either to offer more or pull out. Lord Hanson said he was 'very surprised' that RHM had refused to talk about 'whether we might be prepared to offer a greater value'. He said he was 'astonished' that Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman and chief executive of RHM, had said two weeks ago that a demerger of RHM was 'the right path for us to take'. Mr Metcalfe was not commenting yesterday. Tomkins, which makes Smith &amp; Wesson guns, Hayter lawnmowers and Murray bicycles, had been looking at RHM for a year, Mr Hutchings said. He said Tomkins' brand management skills would help RHM revitalise names such as Mothers Pride bread and Bisto gravy. Mr Hutchings, 45, spent three years working for Hanson as UK corporate development director, before buying into Tomkins, then a tiny engineering company, in 1983. He said yesterday: 'We would not be bidding unless we had been there first. That's not our style.' Of his 70-year-old former boss, Mr Hutchings said: 'Lord Hanson is far too experienced and shrewd to be anything other than philosophical about it.' Tomkins started buying RHM shares in May but bought only 14,000 shares in 1,000-share lots. Yesterday it was buying more shares in the market. In mid-August, Mr Hutchings telephoned Mr Metcalfe and suggested talks. Mr Metcalfe, who was about to go on holiday, arranged a meeting for September 16. At this meeting, Mr Hutchings put forward a bid proposal and Mr Metcalfe invited him to present his ideas to a board meeting in mid-October. Hanson's offer intervened on October 5, after which Mr Hutchings and Mr Metcalfe met again, although talks on price did not start until later. It was Mr Hutchings' turn to be surprised when RHM announced its demerger proposal on October 16. The purchase of RHM would represent a big jump in size for Tomkins, which has a market value of Pounds 1.3bn. Tomkins is to raise Pounds 653m net of expenses through a rights issue, and has net cash of Pounds 150m. Although RHM's businesses are outside the usual scope of Tomkins activities, Mr Hutchings said the offer was 'totally consistent with everything we've done'.

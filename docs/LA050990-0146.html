Briseno -- who found Joseph  Lynch, 44, guilty on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of his  wife, Helen, 35, and their daughter, Natalie Alexandra -- ruled the defendant  was insane when he committed the crimes in the family's Santa Ana home. Deputy  Dist. Atty. James Cloninger said Lynch will be eligible for release from a  state mental hospital when "his sanity is restored."  </P></p>

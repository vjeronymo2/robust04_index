			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE DENYING ARREST OF SUSPECT IN SHOOTING OF PREGNANT WOMAN  </P> <P> Police on Sunday denied published reports that they had arrested a main suspect  in the shooting of a pregnant woman and her husband last month.  </P> <P> William Bennett, 39, of Boston's Mission Hill section, where the shootings  occurred, was arrested at his girlfriend's home in suburban Burlington on a  traffic violation, Burlington police said Saturday.  </P> <P> The Boston Sunday Herald cited unidentified police sources as saying that  Bennett was a chief suspect in the attack that left attorney Carol Stuart dead  and her husband, Charles, seriously wounded.  </P> <P> The Boston Sunday Globe also reported that sources familiar with the case said  that police were focusing on Bennett.  </P> <P> But Joseph Dunford, deputy chief of detectives for Boston police, said in a  statement released Sunday that no arrest had been made in the Stuart case. He  refused to comment on the newspaper reports.  </P> <P> Pauline Bennett, mother of the man who was arrested, said that her son was a  suspect in the shooting.  </P> <P> "He's been in trouble before. He knew he was a suspect. He was nervous and  upset about it," she said.  </P> <P> Carol Stuart, 30, was shot in the head by a man who abducted her and her  husband as they were leaving Brigham and Womens' Hospital after a childbirth  preparation class.  </P> <P> She died shortly after their son, Christopher, was delivered by Cesarean  section. The infant survived for more than two weeks, but succumbed to a  respiratory ailment Thursday. His death was ruled a homicide.  </P> <P> Charles Stuart, 29, was in guarded condition in Boston City Hospital after  surgery Saturday. Hospital officials would not give a reason for the surgery.  </P> <P> Bennett has served separate prison terms for shooting two police officers, the  Herald reported.  </P> <P> Charles Stuart told police that the assailant mistook him for a police officer  because the couple had a cellular telephone in their car.  </P> <P> Bennett's girlfriend, Faye Nelson, told the Sun of Lowell newspaper in a  telephone interview that Bennett was with her at the time of the shootings.  </P> <P> "He didn't do it," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Proteus calls on shareholders for Pounds 10m Proteus International, the biotechnology company, is making another call on shareholders with a 1-for-7 rights issue to raise about Pounds 10.4m after expenses. Mr Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, said the cash would be used to pay for research and development over the next two years by which time the company's revenue stream might have risen enough to cover expenses. The cash-raising operation comes less than two months after UBS resigned as joint broker to the company following disagreements over the speed with which its products could reach the market. The new ordinary shares are expected to be issued at 284p and dealings in the nil paid shares are expected to start today, with the latest time for payment April 20. The shares closed 2p lower yesterday at 290p. The rights issue will dilute the holding of Imseco, a private company, from 49.5 per cent to 43 per cent. Imseco is controlled by Mr Gilmore and Mr John Poole, Proteus' managing director. The issue is being underwritten by Allied Provincial Securities, broker to the Cheshire-based company. Proteus raised about Pounds 12m via a cash call in May 1992, two years after it was floated on the USM at 87p a share. For the six months to September 30 pre-tax losses at Proteus doubled to Pounds 2.73m. The company specialises in using powerful computers to design drugs. COMMENT The good news is that Proteus has a long pipeline of products in development, the first of which should generate some revenue this year. The rights issue is no sign of weakness: such companies need regular infusions of capital to keep going until drugs are marketed. The bad news is that there are serious question marks over whether the rights issue is worth taking up. Proteus still has not found a big name stockbroker to represent it after the resignation last month of UBS. Nor has it managed to sign collaborative agreements with big research-driven drugs companies which have the expertise and cash to buy into the best of the biotech sector. The rights issue is, at best, speculative.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Japan steel output set to hit 23-year low Japan's crude steel output, a leading indicator of industrial activity, is expected to hit a 23-year low for the April-June quarter, reflecting weak exports and sluggish demand from manufacturers and the construction industry. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast output for the first quarter of the next business year, at 22.4m tonnes, the lowest since 1971. The figure is down 14.7 per cent from the previous year and down 0.1 per cent from the preceding quarter. The gloomy estimates follow the recent spate of strong economic data which many private economists believe indicates the country's economy has hit bottom. 'All the good stories are overdone,' Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at brokers Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo, said. He predicted economic figures to be announced during May and June were likely to reflect a still sluggish economy. The ministry said crude steel production for the year ending March 31 would fall below 100m tonnes for the second consecutive year to an estimated 97m tonnes, down 1.9 per cent from the previous year. However, analysts expecting a recovery this year led by consumer spending were comforted by household spending figures for January announced yesterday. These indicated a year-on-year rise for the fourth consecutive month. According to the Management and Co-ordination Agency, household spending in January increased 2.7 per cent in real terms from a year earlier. Spending by salaried workers grew a net 0.6 per cent for the first time in nine months, while spending by households of the self-employed surged 6 per cent. Expenditure on education rose 16.9 per cent and housing spending rose 14.2 per cent; medical-care spending fell 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] This morning's attacks, which started at 0540,  intensified at about 0800. The entire city is again targeted,  but the area around the hospital and the hospital itself, half  of which is almost completely demolished, are exposed to the  heaviest attacks. It is impossible to provide aid to the  wounded, what with the constant attacks with tanks and rockets  and the lack of all kinds of medicine and sanitary material.  The lives of the wounded and the medical staff are in constant  danger.    The tanks on the right side of the Drina River are only  several hundred meters from the hospital. At 0845 they moved a  bit closer to the center of the city, demolishing it house by  house on their way. At 0910 the chetniks opened heavy small  arms fire from all their positions on the right bank. However,  the front lines have not moved and the entire city is still  under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.    The chetniks are attacking fiercely on the left bank. The  district of (Obarac) is under attack, while tanks have been  demolishing the 1 May Street from the direction of the city  stadium. The attacks are also intensifying at the defense line  toward [word indistinct], where the aggressor has been bringing  reinforcements. [Word indistinct] missiles have been fired from  Ustipraca at the eastern sector, and from (?Stubiste) at the  southern sector.</p>

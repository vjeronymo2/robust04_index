			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Backing grows for talks with PLO MORE THAN half the ministers in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's cabinet support the idea of direct talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation over the future of the occupied territories, Israel television reported last night. At yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting, ministers from the left-wing Meretz party urged the immediate opening of face-to-face negotiations with the PLO and Mr Yassir Arafat, its leader, to try to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process. Mr Rabin himself remains adamantly opposed to the PLO's inclusion in the peace process and he blocked a cabinet vote on the direct talks proposal. However, several ministers from Mr Rabin's own Labour party echoed the call. Mr Uzi Baram, Labour's tourism minister, said later that the 'worst error' of successive Israeli governments since the capture of the territories in 1967 had been the boycott of talks with the PLO. Earlier this year the Israeli parliament lifted a ban on meetings between Israeli citizens and the PLO. The growing support at cabinet for a direct government dialogue with the Tunis-based PLO leadership reflects Israeli concern at the rise of the radical Islamic movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Bosnia negotiations fail to make progress in Bonn Two days of talks between Bosnian and Croat leaders ended yesterday without agreement on a ceasefire or territorial settlement, officials at the talks in Bonn said. The officials said the talks between Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of Geneva-based peace conference, had ended after a full day of difficult meetings. They said the four would have dinner together last night and leave Bonn this morning. It was not yet known whether any of the parties would issue a statement. Meanwhile, fighting flared again yesterday in central and north-eastern Bosnia. Bosnian Croat forces yesterday tried to retake a strategic road, intersecting the Croat enclave in central Bosnia, according eyewitnesses in Vitez. They said the mainly Moslem government army cut through a supply route at the weekend, running between Vitez and Busovaca, two towns on the route crucial for the Croats to maintain their hold over the enclave. Major Mike James, a British UN officer in the area, said the Bosnian army attacked Croat forces at four points in the Vitez pocket. Sarajevo radio yesterday denied reports that the Bosnian army started the fighting. Bosnian Croat forces this autumn suffered a string of reverses at the hands of their Moslem adversaries. If the Bosnian army seizes Vitez, it will bolster its control over central Bosnia. The town has a weapons factory and is the headquarters for British UN troops. Serb forces stepped up attacks around Teocak, northeastern Bosnia, according to Sarajevo radio. In nearby Bijelina, local inhabitants yesterday anticipated an upsurge in attempts to force remaining Moslems out of the Serb-held town on the Bosnian frontier with Serbia. In Geneva, a United Nations official said the international humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo, suspended last week after Bosnian Serbs shelled the city's airport, is to start again today.</p>

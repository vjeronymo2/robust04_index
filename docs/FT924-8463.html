			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Anglian will make water meters compulsory for all ANGLIAN WATER plans to extend compulsory metering to all its customers. It has already installed meters for industrial users and new houses. The extension of the scheme is likely to start in 1994, and will take more than 10 years. Water companies already install meters for industrial users and all new properties, while some companies have trial meter programmes in operation for older properties. Anglian will be the first to move to compulsory metering for all properties. Ofwat, the water industry regulator, has supported metering as a way of reducing consumption. But a compulsory programme is likely to be unpopular with many customers. Mr Alan Smith, group managing director, said households which were compulsorily me-tered would not pay installation charges, which can total Pounds 200. He said metering would make little difference to bills for average households with average consumption, but bills would increase for those who regularly washed cars and watered gardens. Water companies have until the year 2000 to put new charging systems in place to replace charges based on domestic rates. Some companies, especially those in the south of England which have been affected by drought, are likely to follow Anglian's lead. Thames Water is in the process of metering all commercial users and may meter large houses with gardens. It is unlikely to meter flats and houses with joint supply. South West Water yesterday reached agreement with Ofwat to restrict its price rises to 11 percentage points above inflation, a reduction of 0.5 points, for 1993-94. This follows a request from Ofwat last month for the 10 water and sewage companies to hold back price rises by an average of 2 points. Other than North West Water, which is appealing, all 10 have now agreed to a reduction in price rises. Northumbrian Water was fined Pounds 1,500, plus Pounds 937 costs yesterday by magistrates at Blyth, Northumberland, after pleading guilty to causing a discharge of sewage effluent into controlled water, the Seaton Burn. The prosecution was the tenth brought by the National Rivers Authority against Northumbrian Water since 1989. Anglian results, Page 25</p>

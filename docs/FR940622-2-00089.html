			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine the appropriate percentage for market risk, ISCC will review the Financial Times Index and assume that it will take one day to sell all positions. Based on a ten day settlement cycle this will result in 11 days elapsing from trade date to close out date. Accordingly, the formula will take into consideration the largest price movement over an 11 day period. Initially ISCC will use the largest price movement in 1993 of 7% for the market risk factor component of the formula. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To calculate the foreign exchange risk, ISCC will review the daily rate fluctuation for the exchange rate between the British Pound and U.S. Dollars. Initially, ISCC will use data from the 1989&hyph;1992 period and the maximum fluctuation during that time was 4.445%. This number will be used on the foreign exchange factor component of the formula. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, Clearing Fund Requirements for ISCC members on surveillance are increased, in the discretion of the Corporation, by requiring up to an additional 3%, 5%, and 7% of average daily debits for members on Advisory, Class A, and Class B surveillance, respectively. The same increases (of three, five, and seven percent for Advisory, Class A, and Class B surveillance) will be retained under the new formula, only they will be added to the Market Risk Factor and Foreign Exchange Risk Factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The proposed rule changes will permit ISCC to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control and is therefore consistent with Section 17A of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

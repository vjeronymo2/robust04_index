			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT WAS A LONG WAY TO THE TOP;  </P> <P> BUSINESS: AN EXECUTIVE CHEF AT A TRENDY SANTA MONICA RESTAURANT WORKED HIS WAY  UP FROM DISHWASHER AND SERVES AS A MODEL FOR OTHERS PURSUING THE AMERICAN  DREAM.  </P> <P> As with many immigrants who enter this country illegally, the only job Martin  Garcia could find when he arrived 10 years ago from Mexico was that of a  dishwasher at a new Santa Monica restaurant.  </P> <P> Today, Garcia is still at that same restaurant -- the very tony Michael's --  but now he is executive chef and senior vice president of McCarty Group  Restaurants, which owns and operates Michael's and three other restaurants  across the country.  </P> <P> "I've always wanted to do something with my life," Garcia said. "When I first  got here, I just wanted to have a job. I wasn't really thinking about the  future. But now, I work hard because I want to be successful."  </P> <P> Advancing from dishwasher to executive chef is analogous to moving from the  mail room of a major corporation to company president; it's rarely done.  </P> <P> Garcia's ascent is even more remarkable because of the obstacles he had to  overcome: his illegal immigration status, learning a new language and finding a  way to fit in with classically trained chefs, particularly in a high-profile  market.  </P> <P> It helped that restaurant owner Michael McCarty has a philosophy of training  his people and promoting from within.  </P> <P> "Martin is our great success story," McCarty said. "He is a light, a beacon of  success. We like to promote from within. Each time a space becomes available,  you look at the next guy in line to promote. He showed the initiative to  perfect one stage before going on to the next."  </P> <P> McCarty said that what Garcia, 29, lacked in experience and formal training, he  made up with tenacity and an ability to learn quickly.  </P> <P> "He's a fast learner," McCarty said. "A good cook is one thing, but a good chef  is someone who can think and who can manage people. It's the business end of  the kitchen. Martin is a good chef."  </P> <P> But in a town such as Los Angeles, where restaurants are as popular for their  celebrity chefs as they are for their food, was McCarty -- himself a celebrity  chef -- concerned with turning over his kitchen to an unknown?  </P> <P> "Absolutely not," McCarty said emphatically. "It was never a risk. We never  moved him until he was better than the person before him."  </P> <P> Garcia has come a long way since 1979, when he paid a coyote -- a smuggler --  $250 to get him across the border from Mexico into the United States to join  two of his brothers.  </P> <P> He arrived in Los Angeles with only the skills of a farm worker who had toiled  the fields surrounding his native hometown of Guadalajara. One of 11 children,  Garcia said he came to the United States because he wanted more out of life  than what his native Mexico could offer.  </P> <P> "My father was a farmer," Garcia said. "We never went hungry, but I wanted to  do something else with my life."  </P> <P> Despite his lack of formal training, Garcia moved from dishwasher to head chef  in five years.  </P> <P> "The best training is learning from the bottom up," he said. "It's one thing to  have your resume say you can do the job, and another thing actually being able  to do it."  </P> <P> Now, as executive chef, Garcia manages a $4-million budget for the four  restaurants and hires and fires personnel. He said he looks beyond a resume, or  the lack of one, when he evaluates potential employees.  </P> <P> "It's very important to look at the whole person," he said. "You can usually  tell whether a person can do the job within a couple of days, and whether that  person is someone who can grow with the company, regardless of their  experience."  </P> <P> Garcia's success has become a source of inspiration for others at the  restaurant, particularly recent immigrants.  </P> <P> Benjamin Gonzalez, from Michoacan, Mexico, has been working as a dishwasher at  Michael's for seven months. But in that short time, he said Garcia has become a  role model.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure what I want to do with my life, but seeing Martin's success makes  me believe that I can accomplish something here," Gonzalez said in Spanish.  </P> <P> "Martin, being Latino, has been very helpful," said Luis Campo, a dishwasher  for three years who is originally from El Salvador. "We don't speak English  very well, so he speaks up for us when we can't and explains things to us that  we don't understand."  </P> <P> Juan Bautista, from Oaxaca, Mexico, has moved up from dishwasher to helping to  prepare food for the chefs.  </P> <P> "Martin has helped me learn the business, and I think I have a future here,"  Bautista said.  </P> <P> Garcia said the only thing holding Bautista back is his having to keep a second  job to support his family and not having enough time to take classes to learn  English more quickly.  </P> <P> "I tell all these guys that, if they want to succeed in the United States, they  are eventually going to have to learn English," Garcia said.  </P> <P> Garcia, who married his childhood sweetheart and is the father of two children,  took English classes about five years ago and has a good command of the  language, speaking with only a slight accent.  </P> <P> Taking advantage of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's amnesty  program, Garcia last year received his permanent residency card. He looks  forward to becoming a U.S. citizen, after fulfilling the five-year permanent  residency requirement.  </P> <P> "I want to be on equal footing with everyone else in this country," he said.  "Also, my intent is to live here the rest of my life."  </P> <P> Garcia hopes to complete his success story by opening his own restaurant some  day. But for now, he says he is happy learning about the business and helping  McCarty branch out.  </P> <P> "Money is not the most important thing to me right now," he said. "I know that  will come later. I'm happy with what I am doing now, and I'm learning a lot."  </P></p>

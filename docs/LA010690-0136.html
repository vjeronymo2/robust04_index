			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA;  </P> <P> OFFICE PROJECT OKD FOR PUBLISHING FIRM  </P> <P> Construction of an office building on a piece of prime commercial property will  begin in March despite arguments by some city officials that the parcel should  be used for other purposes.  </P> <P> The council passed ordinances this week paving the way for McMullen Publishing  to build a new office building on Placentia Avenue adjacent to Brian Chuchua's  Jeep Inc.  </P> <P> "This is a welcome addition for the city," said Peter Gustaf, attorney for both  McMullen Publishing and Brian Chuchua's Jeep. "Their organization will be a  real plus factor for the city."  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Maria Moreno said she favors the site but had long considered  the spot to be ideal for senior housing.  </P> <P> "In all honesty, I am disappointed that we couldn't see a business that would  provide a service for the people," Moreno said.  </P> <P> The office building will occupy space now used by the auto dealership as a  helicopter landing pad. McMullen Publishing, which publishes automotive  magazines, will employ architecture called "different" and "modern" by Joyce  Rosenthal, director of development services.  </P> <P> "It's something we haven't seen before in Placentia," Rosenthal said. "It will  be a very good-looking building." JULIE ESPY  </P></p>

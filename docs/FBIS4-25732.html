			<p>BFN     [Text] The scientific and technological 10-billion-yuan  project, listed by the municipal government as a major project  of this year's scientific and technological work, has been  started in an all around manner and has yielded initial success  thanks to the active efforts of the participating large  contingents of scientific and technical personnel in all fields.  The first group of nine items has been started, with the  participation of dozens of scientific research institutes,  institutes of higher learning, and enterprises. In developing  these items, the scope of industrialization has been expanded  and commodity production has been organized simultaneously.  Initial success has been won in this to increase the industrial  output value by nearly 200 million yuan and to lead the  development of a number of relevant industries.    Beginning this year, the scientific and technological  10-billion-yuan project plans to build 10 high technology  industries in five years with an annual output value exceeding  500 million yuan each so as to promote the development of a  group of high technology products and establish a group of  industries whose output value totals 10 billion yuan. Since  last March when the municipal scientific and technological  congress put forward the targets of the 10-billion-yuan project,  the municipal scientific research units stationed in Tianjin,  the research institutes of the schools of higher learning,  scientific research institutes under the municipality, large and  medium-sized enterprises, and high technology enterprises of  various types have actively participated in the project. After  screening, the municipal science and technology commission  decided to cultivate on a priority basis a group of high  technology achievements with broad market prospects and then  gradually include them in the 10-billion-yuan project. To date,  the production of study-oriented video game machine, cortex  hormone, nickel-hydrogen battery, new-type pesticide, and  numerical-controlled machine tool has been officially listed as  items for implementation, and coating technique and three other  items have also been listed as ones for cultivation on a  priority basis and given particular support. The first group of  items to be implemented are high technology products developed  by the large contingents of scientific and technical personnel  in various fields after many years of research. The  technological levels and technical measures of these items are  among the best in the country or up to the advanced levels of  the world, their market prospects are very broad at home and  abroad, and they possess fairly good basic conditions for  expanding the scope of industrialization. They can be turned  into highly competitive products in a short time, and their  output value is estimated at 1 billion yuan this year. Take the  16-bit study-oriented video game machines first produced by the  Xinxing Electronic Company, which was established by the no. 46  institute of the Ministry of Electronic Industry. From January  to April, 60,000 such machines were produced and sold, and  orders keep pouring in from domestic areas and foreign  countries. Including this product in the 10-billion-yuan  project will help increase its production capacity to 600,000  and its annual output value to 300 million yuan this year.    The scientific and technological 10-billion-yuan project not  only helps accelerate the industrialization of the scientific  and technological achievements of scientific research institutes  but also leads a group of large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises to the new road of pursuit of high technology. The  items on new-type pesticides, numerical-controlled machine  tools, and other products have been carried out at some dozen  large and medium-sized enterprises. The municipal general  pesticide plant cooperated with Nankai University to carry out  scientific and technological development, thus continuously  upgrading and updating its products and creating notable  economic returns. In the first four months of this year, the  output value created by its new-type pesticides exceeded 70  million yuan.</p>

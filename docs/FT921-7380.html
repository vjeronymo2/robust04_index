			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / As They Say in Europe: This troubled sporting life INTERNATIONAL sport arouses xenophobia among the British, paranoia among the French and, inevitably, Angst among the Germans. Ladies first: the world's fastest female, Katrin Krabbe, cheated on a dope test in South Africa and was banned for four years as a result. So there is a new word in the German language - Urinmanipulation. The neologism covers the action of Ms Krabbe and a compatriot who thought they might save time and trouble by presenting a sample delivered by a third lady as representative of them all. Our heroine is known as Die goldene Brandburgerin. There must be a Schubert song cycle of that title which is somehow relevant to this sad tale. Ms Krabbe is, inevitably, a privileged product of the old German Democratic Republic. The Sachsische Zeitung from Dresden in the east lamented that the story was going to provide 'yet another variation on the theme of 'trouble with the east Germans.'' The reference here is to the disdain which 'Wessies' have developed for 'Ossies' since unification. But in fact the western press fell over itself to be fair. As the Saarbrucker Zeitung put it: 'When the fastest woman in the world has bought her sprint prowess at a pharmacy, she can expect no pity. But the urine-exchange game is not a specifically Ossie problem. In the west the test-water frequently changed ownership but only minor sinners were caught in the old federal states.' Neue Presse of Hanover concurred. 'The Krabbe ban must not result in a political campaign against the Ossies, not every Saxon won thanks to the syringe.' Another paper noted that the German Olympic medals at Albertville were largely the product of the old GDR which has given rise to a new saying: 'Thuringia beats the USA.' But nobody, as far as I could see, had actually said the affair proved just how awful the Ossies were. What all this shows is that right-minded people in Germany are so afraid that any exposure of sin and error might become an occasion for persecution, that they leap to the defence of the potential persecutee even before a fist has been raised. Unlike the French. To be fair they did not exactly rush to the defence of Messrs Moscato and Lascube who got expelled from the France-England rugby match last Saturday, and then were banned for several months. But the rugby brawl did lead to much questioning of Anglo-French relations. So this is not a tale of rugby but of life itself. Numerous papers reproduced the work of a news agency piece which could have been entitled, 'As they say in England.' It summarised the comments about the French of British rugby reporters: 'Animals, savages, wild, shameful.' French rugby writers believe their players will be seen as a bunch of thugs whatever they do. As a result, the theory runs, the (northern) Irish referee, Steve Hilditch, went on the field prepared to find the French guilty of everything. In an editorial in Le Figaro, Jean-Pierre Lacour wrote that international consultations were necessary; 'In the future Mr Hilditch must not find himself in a context where, quite naturally, a Frenchman is more suspect than an Englishman.' Gerard Baudouin wrote in France-Soir: 'There is no doubt that Mr Hilditch started the match with pre-conceived ideas.' The nub of French case was not that each decision taken in isolation was necessarily wrong (although some were) but that it was taken in a context that ignored other relevant events. In fact the French 'defence' reflects exactly the difference in the ways the English and the French approach everything. Thus the French argue that last Saturday's shambles was only partly the product of French thuggery; it was also the reflection of a specific historical situation. The violence needed a trigger which turned out to be two highly controversial decisions which led to England being handed six points by the referee at a time when they were one point behind. This may seem boring to those who have no interest in Rugby Union but it explains why the English and the French will always squabble. What the latter see as central events in this affair might occupy the court for a whole day if it came to a trial in France but would be inadmissible as evidence in England. And that matters when the English put the French in the dock. A novel solution to the impasse was proposed. M Lacour in Le Figaro suggested that the French Rugby Union should study infractions and their punishment in British games. And, he said, English players had to be told that the Five Nations Tournament was not the Hundred Years War. Fact: The malefactor Lascube plays for Agen, a town that the dauphin agreed to cede to Edward III in 1360. The French broke that agreement.

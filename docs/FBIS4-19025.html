			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Interview of Turkish President Demirel With the Albanian </F> Television" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 11 (ATA) -- "Albania's policy is a  factor for stability in the Balkans," said President of Turkey  Suleyman Demirel in an interview with the Albanian Television  recently. "Under the capable leadership of President Berisha,  during the past two years Albania became a country with a  positive influence in the Balkans." Regarding the possible  expansion of the conflict in Kosova, Mr. Demirel said: "I think  such a thing will not happen." As regards the stand of Turkey in  case of a spillover of the conflict in Kosova, Mr. Demirel said  that "we shall give our support for Kosova and Albania."  Questioned about the Greek embargo against Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Mr. Demirel  said that it causes a definitive damage to the stability in the  Balkans.    According to the Turkish president, the creation of the  Moslem-Croatian federal state is a step towards peace, while he  described as meaningless the Serbian stand against the creation  of such a state.    With regard to the opposition by Greece, Bulgaria or some  other country to the dispatch of Turkish troops in Bosnia as  part of the UN peace-keeping forces, President Demirel pointed  out that "it is quite difficult to understand the stand by our  neighbours. In fact we have not sent Turkish troops in the  Balkans. United Nations are asking for Turkish soldiers,  because there is a need there for soldiers to establish peace,  and Turkish soldiers will go there to defend peace. I do not  understand why does this matter become a subject of opposition,"  Mr. Demirel stressed.    In his interview, Mr. Demirel described as "excellent" the  level of Albanian-Turkish relations, adding that they will also  continue to be excellent in the future.    "I wish the fraternal Albanian people good fortune,  prosperity, happiness and peace. May God be with us!," Turkish  president said at the end of his interview.</p>

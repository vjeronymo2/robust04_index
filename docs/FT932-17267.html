			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Pinault raises profits to FFr586m PINAULT-Printemps, the heavily-indebted French retail group, lifted net profits 16.5 per cent to FFr586m (Dollars 106m) in 1992 from FFr503m in 1991, the year that it took over Au Printemps department stores, Mr Francois Pinault, chairman, stressed that the results were not comparable, as the 1991 figures included only a one-month contribution from Au Printemps and six months from the Conforama furniture chain. Pinault's sales almost doubled to FFr70.23bn last year from FFr36.3bn, reflecting the impact of the Au Printemps deal. But operating profits only rose by 20 per cent to FFr2.79bn from FFr2.32bn. The company said it had suffered from 'stagnation of demand' in some sectors. French retailing has been affected by the economic slowdown, due to the combination of static consumer demand and the instability caused by a number of large corporate transactions, notably Pinault's purchase of Au Printemps.</p>

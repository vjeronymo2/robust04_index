			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Powerful, glamorous and beautiful: Lunch with the FT - Michael Thompson-Noel entertains Janet Holmes a Court at a quiet little place ... How splendid life would be if one could lunch twice a week - or better, twice a day - with Janet Holmes a Court. At 50 she is rich, glamorous and beautiful. But she is also modest and unaffected to a degree that would be thought exaggerated in a plain woman. We are sitting in San Moritz - a choice of restaurant that pinpoints the unassuming classiness of this friendly and resourceful woman. San Moritz is a quiet place in Wardour Street, not far from Soho Square, where Janet Holmes a Court reigns benevolently as executive chairman of Stoll Moss Theatres. As the proprietor of 11 London theatres, she is one of the most powerful individuals - certainly the most powerful woman - in West End theatreland. But San Moritz is not a power restaurant. There is no wheeling and dealing. The beautiful people are absent. There are no luvvies lurking. It is a Swiss restaurant, if you please, that serves charming, well-cooked food at spectacularly non-Swiss prices. For 'Lunch with the FT', guests can choose any restaurant they like. When I asked Janet Holmes a Court why she had chosen this one, she said that she liked its friendliness and food, and that she could walk to it from her office. I told her that I didn't drink, but that she must have anything she fancied. She asked for water, and said that a glass of house red might be fun later. I am afraid I forgot to order it. She did not mention it again. I asked her about Soho. What was it like to work in? She replied: 'I love Soho enormously. I have a flat here at present. I can walk here for lunch. I can also walk to every one of our theatres at night and walk home again, feeling completely safe. I may not be safe, but I feel I am.' Stoll Moss Theatres is part of Heytesbury Holdings, a family concern she inherited on the death in 1990 of her husband, Robert Holmes a Court, the astute and exceedingly civilised Western Australian businessman whose fortunes had been reduced by the global stock market crash of 1987. On the death of her husband, Janet Holmes a Court could have retreated into a life of luxurious obscurity. But that is not her way. She has tons of vitality, and a commensurate array of interests. Her principal business achievement has been to establish Heytesbury as a diverse but focussed group. Apart from 11 London theatres, she owns a Western Australian cattle company (Heytesbury Pastoral Group) and a Melbourne-based construction company (John Holland Group) that does much business in south-east Asia. She also owns a Perth-based trucking operation, an extremely successful racehorse stud, and a winery and restaurant in St Margaret's River, at the south-western tip of Western Australia. To supervise these interests, she has homes in Perth, Melbourne and London, and flits hither and thither, visiting England four or five times a year. Her CV of cultural, educational and charitable interests is as long as your arm. She is pro-chancellor, for example, of the University of Western Australia and a member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. One of the things that seems to please her most is Australia's success with multi-culturism and its efforts to integrate itself more fully into its part of the world. 'There are 176 different nationalities in Australia,' says this ambassador-at-large approvingly. 'You rarely go anywhere and sit with people who look the same.' Intrigued, I asked her about her Reserve Bank appointment. Why had they asked her to join? 'Well,' she said, 'they wanted a woman, and I'm not particularly flattered by tokenism. They had never had one, you see. On the other hand, Heytesbury operates in widely different geographical locations, and in very different businesses, so I expect they found that interesting.' I said, rather clumsily, that I was sure that the Reserve Bank of Australia had had hundreds of successful businesswomen from whom to choose for its foray into - uh - tokenism. To which Janet Holmes a Court replied: 'Michael, you are charming.' Theatre is her greatest love, both in Australia and in London. Stoll Moss is spending Pounds 10m refurbishing her London theatres, which include the Theatre Royal (home to the money-spinning Miss Saigon), the London Palladium (awaiting Fiddler on the Roof), Her Majesty's (Phantom of the Opera), the Lyric and the Queen's. One of her theatres, the Globe, in Shaftesbury Avenue, is being renamed the Gielgud Theatre in honour of Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday, and also in tribute to the late Sam Wanamaker. When Wanamaker's reconstruction of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre on the south bank of the Thames opens next year, it will be the only Globe Theatre in London. Janet Holmes a Court went to school and university in Perth, and spent three years teaching science, but says she has always enjoyed being around creative people and that her link with London theatreland was something she was determined to maintain after her husband's death. 'Theatre is the best business to be involved in, and London theatre is - or should be - the wellspring of what happens in theatre around the world. If I weren't involved in theatre I would like to make motorway cones. The money there must be in motorway cones] 'One thing that concerns me is that there are so many revivals on in London at present. There is very little new writing happening in West End theatre. 'In addition, many of the backers have been affected by the fall-out at Lloyd's. Yet the theatre business is cyclical, as are most others. That is why it pays to diversify one's interests. When Stoll Moss is doing well in London, the Australian construction business may well be in the doldrums. 'I visit the theatre every night when I am in London. Although I feel safe in Soho, there is a lot more that could be done to perk-up theatreland. For example, there appear to be more people living on the streets.' Homelessness, she said, had many costs, some less obvious than others. Another of her passions is Australian Aboriginal art. She has held on to the collection of Aboriginal art formed by her husband, and has added to it greatly, so that she now owns about 1,500 Aboriginal items, out of a total art collection of about 3,500 pieces. On the other hand, many other works were sold off.' When I looked into it, there was an enormous amount of stuff in Heytesbury, including, for example, a remarkable number of racehorses: about 160 brood mares, four stallions, four studs and horses in training all over the place, including England and the US. 'However, what Robert had done was put in place the foundation of great success. The operation is now much simplified - 50 mares, three stallions, just one stud farm - and is now, for the first time, making money, having recorded some notable achievements.' Racing is an 'interest' rather than a 'passion' for Janet Holmes a Court, though for all her jet-setting, her favourite place appears to be her racehorse stud, 40 miles from Perth. 'It is the place where I would like to finish up.'</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Faces turn green as the green stock fades / Charting the decline into shareholder revolt at Tace THE BOARDROOM musical chairs at Tace and Goring Kerr, its controlled subsidiary, comes at the end of an unhappy period in which the environmental monitoring and control equipment group has passed from takeover candidate to an under-performing market laggard. But if Sir David Nicolson, the chairman who is currently being stalked by rebellious institutions, is to be believed, Tace's assets are being thoroughly under-utilised. While some of the shine has worn off green stocks, the company which Mr Jock Mackenzie floated more than 20 years ago, operates in areas which continue to grow by 30 per cent a year. 'The company should have sales 10 times bigger than the Pounds 36m it enjoyed in 1990,' Sir David said last month, shortly after his controversial appointment and before the institutions resumed their efforts to install Mr Michael Beckett as chairman. Tace's strength lies in environmental pollution monitoring equipment and contaminant detectors. In the US, the 1990 Clean Air Act has stipulated that companies must monitor airborne particle emissions by size and quantity. Tace is confident it now makes a monitor that has become the industry standard, partly because it is used by the Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, the EPA is using Tace's equipment in the joint studies of air pollution levels it is conducting with the EC in Europe. Another development fueling growth in the US, where the group derives half its sales, is the tightening controls on gas emissions from land-fill sites. Some 50 states have approved Tace's equipment to test emission levels, and the group says this should enhance the dominant position it already has monitoring emissions from the pulp and paper industry. The other focus is contaminant detectors for the food and pharmaceutical industries. The equipment is designed to identify bone, plastic, glass and metal in food on production lines that are moving at speed. Tace says that a number of UK food manufacturers and some retailers have bought machines to test and that the order book has rocketed because of fears of liability claims. The two areas evolved from the 51 per cent-controlled Goring Kerr, which in the early 1980s supplied equipment to the food industry and spun off cash for Tace to develop its environmental services activities. The strategy was to seek niche markets that would be supported by increasingly stringent national and international legislation, Sir David says. An impressive growth of return on capital, earnings per share and cash flow came to a grinding halt in 1988. Tace stopped making acquisitions for shares that the market was more than happy to finance and started to raise debt. The share price, which had been more than Pounds 5 in 1985 and above Pounds 3 after acquisitions in 1989, fell to a low of 130p. At the same time, Mr Mackenzie resigned as chairman of London &amp; Northern, a go-getter mini-conglomerate stock of the 1960s, after selling his stake to Evered Bardon. Tace took over the entire running costs of the L&amp;N premises off London's Fleet Street, from where, in a corner, it had operated a head office. By 1990, despite reporting pre-tax profits of only Pounds 3.9m, the group was paying Pounds 1.7m in head office costs. Tace recently announced it would move out of these offices. Sources close to the company and the proposed new board say the head office was constantly draining cash from the operating groups and preventing essential investment. This process led to severe demoralisation in the operating companies. At one stage Mr Dick Richardson, Tace's managing director, held letters of resignation from most of middle management in his briefcase, according to Mr David Floyd, of Belmont Bank. Following efforts by Sir David to persuade management that things would change, most resignations have been withdrawn. Behind the institutions' move yesterday to remove the entire Tace board and replace it with a team led by Mr Beckett, lies the knowledge that Sir David had decided not to remove any of the board that had allowed Tace's costs to get so badly out of control. Illust. Sir David: the assets are thoroughly under-utilised</p>

New tariffs for electric power for public utility needs will  double in April, the newspaper points out, recalling at the same  time that the average tariffs for electric power in Russia are  lower than the world ones by a factor of three to four while the  prices of metal, pipes, power equipment and spares "have already  attained the world level".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI also reports the signing of 20 documents  on  Russia-Kazakhstan cooperation during Kazakhstan President  Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to moscow, the long-awaited  agreement on Baykonur cosmodrome, in particular.    TRUD and other newspapers also dwell on the baikonur topic.  TRUD carries an article headlined "Baykonur ceases to be an  'apple of discord', Russia leases the cosmodrome for 20 years".    ROSSIYA newspaper carries an interview with Anatoliy Sliva,  chairman of the State Duma committee on local self-government  matters.    "Local self-government in Russia is in a unique position  now:  the rights of local power bodies have been formulated and  stipulated in the constitution at the level of the highest world  standards, whereas the current legislation, decrees, various  decisions, and subordinate legislation obviously contradict the  constitution," Sliva said.    ROSSIYA runs an interview with Russian Liberal-Democratic  Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who does not rule out, in  particular, the emergence of some new self-proclaimed  state-of-emergency committee in the country. "Something is  certain to happen in a period from April to November -- either  an emergency committee or developments similar to the October of  1993 or some other version of events", he maintains.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an article dedicated to  the birth anniversary of legendary aircraft designer Sergey  Ilyushin.    "Even in the present-day difficult economic situation,  Russia  has got to find strength and wisdom to maintain the research and  production potential which in future will enable it to remain  among the world's leading aircraft makers", the newspaper  emphasises.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on a rising suicide rate in Russia:    "This always happens during election campaigns: a great  number of people from among the socially most vulnerable  sections of the population -- tramps, unemployed, students and  pensioners -- commit suicides upon becoming convinced of the  unrealistic nature of political parties' election-campaign  promises".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the problems of the Crimea:    "Following the elections to the Crimean parliament and an  opinion poll, president Yuriy Meshkov's slogan 'my goal is to  secure the reunification of the Crimea with Russia', due to  which he scored an electoral win, "acquires increasingly  distinct contours".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Russian State  Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin.    "We should not allow a recurrence of the October 4, 1993,  events which signified our overall defeat", Rybkin stated,  voicing confidence in the success of reforms being effected in  the country.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reprints an interview of Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk with the newspaper KRYMSKIE VESTI  (Crimean News) under a headline quoting his as saying: "I stand  on this: Ukraine should be side-by-side with Russia, not under  Russia."    PRAVDA runs an interview with writer Yuriy Vlasov, a member  of the State Duma.    "It would be the greatest sin if all upright people fail to  rely on the sense of patriotism in resisting the tough struggle,  a struggle of expermination [as received], which is now under  way in Russia and against Russia", the newspaper quotes Vlasov  as saying.</p>

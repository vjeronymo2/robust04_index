			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> BOY DIES BEFORE PLANNED TRANSPLANT  </P> <P> A 4-year-old Buenaventura, Mexico, boy who was minutes away from a liver  transplant died before surgeons in Dallas could begin the operation.  </P> <P> Parents and physicians at Children's Medical Center had been elated but anxious  when they learned Friday that a liver had been found for Sammy Aguirre, but  doctors said the boy's condition had seriously deteriorated. The donated liver  came from a Florida child who was slightly larger than Sammy, said Sammy's  doctor, Dr. Troy Reyna. The organ was sent to another liver transplant patient,  hospital spokeswoman Sylvia Bodell said.  </P></p>

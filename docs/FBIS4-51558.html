			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei  Kono urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Saturday to resign his  post as soon as the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 budget.    Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), made  the appeal in an NHK television talk show videotaped Saturday to  be aired Sunday. Kono said the country's two largest political  parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), have not  participated in Hata's minority government, which is made up  only of smaller parties.    He said the danger facing Hata is that his cabinet revolves  around just one or two people who represent and manipulate all  the parties in it, in an allusion to the coalition's two key  strategists -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. "The  Hata administration will have nothing to do after the budget is  passed by the Diet and we will seek it to hand over power at  that stage," Kono said.    Debates on the budget up for parliamentary approval have  been  stalled during the transfer of power to Hata from his  predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, who stepped down earlier this  month due to a scandal over his personal finances.    Kono said the LDP wants the next general election to be held  under a new system combining single-seat and proportional  representation formulas. He said he has in his mind the  presentation of a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet  to the Diet to force it to resign en masse. He indicated the LDP  will promote collaboration with the SDP, which broke away from  the ruling coalition Tuesday over a dispute with other alliance  parties.</p>

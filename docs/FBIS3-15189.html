Kravchuk will "probably" use the visit to exchange  letters ratifying the START-I strategic arms reduction treaty,  said Anton Bouteiko, the president's adviser for international  relations.    US and Ukrainian officials will also discuss the "practical  implementation" of a tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons  signed on January 14 in Moscow by Kravchuk and US and Russian  Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, according to  Bouteiko. The agreement calls for a total denuclearisation of  Ukraine, which inherited Soviet nuclear weapons along with  Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. [passage omitted]    "The main purpose of this visit to encourage economic and  trade relations between Ukraine and the United States. We are  not asking for aid but we want to attract investments," Bouteiko  said. The Ukrainian delegation will propose 24 economic  projects which are open to US investors, he said. Kravchuk will  also meet senior officials of the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund. He will be accompanied to  Washington by interim Prime Minister Efim Zviaginsky, Defence  Minister Vitaly Radietsky and Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko.</p>

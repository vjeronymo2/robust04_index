			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Oilseeds row has used up options AS FAR as Gatt's formal disputes machinery is concerned, the US-EC oilseeds dispute has gone as far as it can. Gatt officials acknowledged yesterday that nothing more could be done within the Gatt framework if the two partners were not able or prepared to reach a negotiated agreement. Strictly, in imposing trade sanctions without Gatt authorisation, the US is violating Gatt procedures which require such decisions to be made by consensus. The EC, which in effect vetoed that consensus, would be equally in breach of the rules by retaliating. However, the US undoubtedly has the better moral argument, since the cause of its action remains the failure of the Community to comply with earlier Gatt decisions. Washington can reasonably claim to have 'gone the extra mile' to resolve the five-year-old dispute within the multi-lateral system. In 1989, a Gatt panel ruled that the EC's oilseed subsidy regime impaired the benefits of duty-free access for oilseeds into the EC granted in a 1962 US-EC deal. Earlier this year, the same panel ruled that the EC's new subsidy scheme, changed in response to the first judgment, was no better. The EC refused to amend the scheme again. Instead, it took the second option proposed by the panel, offering compensation by way of trade concessions on other items. These offers proved unacceptable to the US and other oilseeds producers. In September, the US proposed binding arbitration on the amount of trade damages involved, put by Washington at Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.03bn) and by the EC at no more than Dollars 400m. This procedure, unprecedented in Gatt, was refused by the EC. Subsequent bilateral negotiations on the issue finally broke down in Chicago earlier this week. Gatt officials admit the organisation's disputes procedures have been stretched to the limit in this case, but point out that sanctions do not solve the problem either.</p>

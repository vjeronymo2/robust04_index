			<p>BFN     [Text] Labour protests used to be rare in Indonesia under  President Suharto. Jobs were in great demand and people who had  them worked uncomplainingly. Labour unions existed, but they  were never instruments of agitation unlike in the old days of  the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Industrial peace helped  the government attract foreign investments, which in turn  created economic growth and generated more jobs. The net effect  was that workers in Indonesia gained from greater prosperity,  which has been a hallmark of Mr. Suharto's rule, especially in  the last 10 years. But prosperity leads to rising expectations  and the mood of Indonesian labour has changed in recent years.  Workers are increasingly aware of their rights. They demand  better wages and are now less inhibited about agitating for  better working conditions. Interestingly, the rising militancy  of Indonesian workers coincides with a new United States policy  this year to advance the cause of workers worldwide by insisting  on minimum working conditions. Against Indonesia, the U.S. has  threatened to suspend concessions under the Generalised System  of Preferences (GSP) unless Jakarta improves working conditions  for its 80-million workforce. As if in response to such  pressure, the Indonesian Government announced that from Jan. 1  this year the legal minimum daily wage would be raised from  3,000 rupiah to 3,800 rupiah for Jakarta and its outskirts.    Demanding better working conditions is legitimate for  workers  anywhere. But it becomes a problem when the demands are out of  step with reality or are externally inspired with little regard  for domestic conditions.    Worse, it becomes tragic when frustrations arising from  unfulfilled expectations turn political. Sadly, this appears to  have been the case in Medan. Medan workers, at the prodding of  the independent union, the SBSI [Serikat Buruh Setiakawan  Indonesia or Indonesian Solidarity Trade Union], agitated for  minimum daily wages to be raised by 100 percent from 3,100  rupiah to 7,000 rupiah -- twice the minimum daily wage in  Jakarta. When the demand could not be met, the workers went on  a rampage and turned it into an anti-Chinese riot. In  Indonesia, it is easy to turn mob aggression into a protest with  ethnic overtones. The authorities deserve credit for acting  swiftly to contain the situation.    Indonesia does not need troubles like this. Riots and  protests drive businesses and investors away -- and this Jakarta  simply cannot afford. Two million new workers join the labour  force each year. For them to find jobs, entrepreneurs and  businesses must feel comfortable about sinking their capital  into Indonesian soil. It will be foolish to expect them to do  so if the country lacks a sense of stability and security. And  if they don't invest, there will be no economic growth and no  job creation. As the Indonesian authorities act to stabilise  the situation, it is crucial that the Medan incident be seen in  perspective. Investors should feel assured that the protest was  more a single incident of labour unrest, not a racial riot.  Indonesian workers ought to realise that mindless rioting is  not the way to solve their problems. In fact, it only makes  things worse. Last but not least, the U.S. needs to see the  danger of blindly imposing its labour standards on others. The  Medan riot has shown just how explosive this can be.</p>

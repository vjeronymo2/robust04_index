V. Adushkin, A. A. Spivak and V. I. Kulikov, </F> Dynamics of Geospheres Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences;  UDC 550.34+622.235]    [Text] The characteristics of a real geophysical medium,  governed by tectonics (anisotropy, spatial nonuniformity of  deformation and strength characteristics, as well as stressed  state, accumulation of irreversible effects of a different  character on structural dislocations), exert a substantial  influence on the nature of the mechanical effects of an  underground nuclear explosion [1, 2, 3]. The position of  deformations near structural dislocations (zones of reduced  medium strength) may lead to the appearance of quite large  relative movements of structural blocks, and accordingly, the  freeing of stored energy, even in the case of external  disturbances insignificant in amplitude. The appearance of  clearly expressed irreversible effects in the medium (ruptures,  fractures, faults, overthrusts, intensification of relaxation  processes, etc.) at epicentral distances from the place where  the underground explosion is set off considerably exceeding the  extent of the zone of regular failure of the medium [4] (zone of  local irreversible effects), for example, is noted.    The seismic effects of an underground explosion, as the most  sensitive to a spatial change in medium properties, best reflect  the influence of its structural-tectonic organization. In  addition to a sharp change in the amplitude characteristics of  seismic explosion waves with propagation across large fractures  and faults [5], an indirect effect of tectonic dislocation as a  result of freeing of a part of the stored elastic energy, which  is clearly manifested in a sharp change in the directivity  pattern of surface and transverse waves [6, 7], has been  repeatedly noted.    In this article a study is made of the influence of the  structural organization of the geophysical medium on the  principal effects of an underground nuclear explosion set off on  8 July 1989 (03[.sup]h[/]46 min 57.64 sec) in the Balapan  rock mass at the Semipalatinsk test site (coordinates 4952  min 05.7 sec N and 7846 min 45 sec E, power q = 35 kt,  depth 550 m).    The rock mass at the place where the explosion was set off  consisted of volcanogenic-sedimentary and metamorphosed rocks of  the lower part of the Carboniferous system and  volcanogenic-metamorphosed and sedimentary rocks of the middle  part of the Cambrian system, formed in the Hercynian and  Caledonian folding epochs respectively.    Figures 1 and 2 show geologic sections of the rock mass --  summary submeridional and more detailed for the shot hole, with  an indication of the principal types of rocks. The principal  characteristics of the rocks typical for Balapan are represented  in Table 1.    A number of large and small tectonic dislocations, breaking  the bedrock basement down into tectonic blocks of different  order (Fig. 3), were discriminated within the limits of the  explosion sector. A distinguishing feature of the sector is the  presence of a large deep first-order tectonic dislocation  (Kolba-Chingiz regional fault).    The Kolba-Chingiz fault separates two very large folded  systems: Chingiz-Tarbagay meganticlorium formed in the  Caledonian epoch of tectogenesis and psephytic rocks of the  Middle Cambrian and the Zaysay meganticlinorium of Hercynian  age, represented by terrigenous rocks of the Lower  Carboniferous. Both systems are characterized by an intensive  superposed folding of different periods and the broad  development of dislocations of a fault character, predetermining  the complex block structure of the considered rock mass. The  average width of the fault zone is about 300 m. The fault zone  also was traced from the results of magnetic prospecting work  with a positive anomaly having an intensity up to 800 nTl.    Tectonic dislocations of different order and large fractures  are accompanied by fine tectonic fracturing which is manifested  in brecciation, schist formation in rocks, presence of  slickensides and glide striae, noted in a number of control  holes. The span of the tectonic fractures is 1-5 mm.    The discriminated tectonic dislocations are accompanied by  zones of reduced velocities of propagation of oscillations (Fig.  1).    The Chinrauz and Shagan faults with a fault width of several  tens of meters with a lower rank are discriminated to the north  of the Kolba- Chingiz fault within the limits of the Balapan  test site. Their orientation duplicates the strike of the  Kolba-Chingiz fault.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-63A>      Fig. 1. </FIG>     The seismic effect of the explosion was investigated in a  network of permanent and mobile seismic stations whose location  in the Semipalatinsk test site region is represented in Fig. 4.  Some of these stations were located in populated places; the  others were field stations. The same figure shows the epicenter  of the explosion of 8 July 1979, regional faults and boundaries  of the Balapan test site in which borehole shots were set off.  The epicentral distances to the seismic stations were from 30 to  200 km.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-64A>      Fig. 2. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-64B>      Fig. 3. </FIG>     1. Registry Method    As a rule, in the near seismics zone seismic oscillations  are  registered by magnetoelectric SM-3 and VEGIK pendulum  seismometers with a characteristic period 2 s and an S5S  seismometer with a characteristic period 5 s and an attenuation  0.5. The signal from the working winding of the seismic  detector, proportional to the velocity of ground oscillations,  goes to the input of the unit for shaping characteristic curves  having a plateaulike amplitude-frequency curve in the frequency  band from 0.5 to 20 Hz. Then the signal in analog form is  registered on magnetic tape using a standard compact cassette.  The response of such a seismic channel is 10[.sup]4[/] V  (m/s)[.sup]-1[/]. The dynamic range of the magnetic recorder  with frequency modulation is 38 db.    The registered seismograms are processed using an IN-1200  specialized computer having an analog input and a package for  processing the seismograms. The seismogram, reduced to digital  form, is stored in a winchester or is rewritten on a diskette. A  considerable number of seismograms was registered on paper using  light-ray oscillographs with galvanometers operating in an  aperiodic mode with a high damping factor of about 0.7. The  galvanometer channel ensured registry of ground displacements  with a magnification up to 1200 and in the same frequency band  as the channel for registry of displacement velocity. The  dynamic range of the channel is approximately 46 db. The maximum  error in determining the amplitude of ground displacement,  determined statistically using data from numerous records made  using several seismometers of the same type at one seismic  station, does not exceed 6%. Some of the seismograms  registered  during the explosion of 8 July 1989 are represented in Fig. 5.  The three components of ground oscillations were registered at  most seismic stations: vertical Z, radial horizontal X  (direction to explosion epicenter) and tangential horizontal Y.  The seismic detectors were mounted (freely, without attachment)  on prefabricated concrete pedestals or on bedrock outcrops.    Seismic stations (Fig. 4) with the numbers 1-9 were set up  on  outcrops of weathered bedrock; the others were set up on  unconsolidated deposits with a thickness of several tens of  meters.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-65A>      Fig. 4. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-65B>      Fig. 5. </FIG>     2. General Description of Seismic Oscillations    In the near seismics zone the general train of oscillations  was rather clearly divided into trains of P, S and R waves. The  periods of oscillations in the Rayleigh wave are greater by a  factor of 4-10 than in body waves. The maximum amplitude of the  velocity of oscillations is usually attained in the body waves.  The maximum amplitude of the displacements, on the other hand,  was in the surface wave.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-66A>      Fig. 6. </FIG>     The trains of oscillations have rather many phases, which is  associated with stratification of the real geophysical medium;  the influence of the Conrad and Mohorovicic discontinuities  stands out very clearly. Figure 6 shows experimental traveltime  curves of different phases of seismic oscillations which can be  identified with and related to known crustal discontinuities.    The P[.sub]1[/] wave is a longitudinal wave refracted in  the upper crustal layers. It is traced in the first arrivals to  150 km. Its propagation velocity is from 5.3 to 6.6 km/s.    The P[.sub]2[/] wave is a longitudinal wave refracted at  the Moho at angles greater than the critical angle. Its  amplitude is greatest at epicentral distances 100-130 km; its  propagation velocity is from 7.7 to 9.1 km/s.    The S[.sub]1[/] and S[.sub]2[/] transverse waves are  analogues of the P[.sub]1[/] and P[.sub]2[/] waves. The  propagation velocity of S[.sub]1[/] is about 3.1 km/s and  that of S[.sub]2[/] is from 3.9 to 5.5 km/s. Beginning at a  distance of about 100 km the amplitude of the S wave is maximum  in the group of body waves.    The surface wave R is a wave of the Rayleigh type. Its group  velocity of propagation is 2.75 km/s. It is characterized by  polarization in the vertical plane.    We note that the constructed traveltime curves are virtually  not dependent on the azimuth relative to the explosion epicenter.    Table 1.

Explosion Energy    The seismic network in the test site region was established  for ensuring seismic safety when setting off underground nuclear  explosions. In addition, it solves the problem of determining  explosion energy. The basis of the method for determining the  power of an underground nuclear explosion at the Semipalatinsk  test site [17] was the dependence of the maximum displacements  W[.sub]R[/][.sup]z[/] and W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] in  the surface Rayleigh wave on explosion energy q and epicentral  distance R, which is described by the formula:    W[.sub]R[/][.sup]z,x[/] = Aq[.sup]0.9[/]  R[.sup]-1.4[/] mm,    where q is the explosion energy, expressed in kt of TNT, R  is  the epicentral distance in km. In this dependence A is a  coefficient dependent on seismic station i, that is, the station  coefficient. The need for introducing station coefficients is  illustrated in Fig. 7, where on the rays constructed from the  azimuths of the seismic stations dots are plotted for the  amplitudes in the Rayleigh wave for the explosion of 8 July  1989, reduced using the epicentral distances, that is, the  W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] R[.sup]1.4[/] values. Thus, the  attenuation of Rayleigh waves on seismic paths different in  distance was taken into account. In actuality, Fig. 7 shows the  surface wave radiation diagram. The circle in the figure was  constructed with a radius equal to the mean value of the reduced  amplitude 44.6 mm km[.sup]1.4[/]. However, as indicated by  Fig. 7, the procedure for reducing amplitudes by distance does  not transform the Rayleigh wave radiation diagram into an  azimuthally symmetric diagram; the deviations of the reduced  amplitudes from the mean attain 100% or more. This scatter  naturally also persists when computing explosion energy from the  amplitude of Rayleigh waves if use is made of the dependence  W(q,R) with the single coefficient A, not dependent on the  seismic station. (The explosion energy q is virtually  proportional to the reduced amplitude W[.sub]R[/]  R[.sup]1.4[/]).    The introduction of the station coefficients A considerably  increases the accuracy in determining explosion energy. The  station coefficients for the seismic stations at the test site  were determined empirically and are shown in Fig. 8. Their value  varies from 3.5 to 12.3. The circle is drawn with a radius equal  to the mean value of the station coefficients A = 6.4. The  station coefficients and their weighted values were used in  computing the explosion energy for the X and Z components of  displacements in the Rayleigh wave, which was constructed in the  form of the diagram in Fig. 9 demonstrating the dependence of  explosion energy on seismic station azimuth. The circle in Fig.  9 was constructed with a radius equal to the mean explosion  energy q = 33 kt. The relative error in determining the mean  power by this method is 6%.    The explosion energy, determined from the amplitude of the  surface waves, is close to the 35 kt which was determined by  physical methods. The lesser quantity of the mean ``seismic''  energy is possibly related to the condition of positioning of  the explosion hypocenter in the zone of the Kolba-Chingiz fault.    The station coefficients take into account both the geologic  conditions at the registry point and the characteristics of the  seismic wave propagation path. When the wave propagation path is  examined, it is found that it is necessary to take into account  not only the azimuth of wave propagation, but also the place  where the explosion epicenter is located. For example, it was  noted in [17] that at the Balapan test site three zones with  locations of epicenters were discriminated, for which their own  sets of station coefficients were introduced. And it is  important to note that the boundaries of these zones coincided  with the Chinrauz and Shagan tectonic faults which intersect the  Balapan test site. Thus, it can be assumed that the station  coefficients also reflect the influence of faults and the block  structure of the test site on the seismic effect of the  explosion.    The introduction of station coefficients when solving the  problem of determining explosion energy from surface waves in  the near seismics zone is similar to the magnitude corrections  procedure, which is necessary for determining explosion energy  from the magnitude of body waves at teleseismic distances [18,  19].   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-67A>      Fig. 7. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-67B>      Fig. 8. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-67C>      Fig. 9. </FIG>     4. Propagation of Seismic Waves Across Faults    Some of the principal factors determining asymmetry of the  complex radiation diagram of a surface wave (Fig. 7) and the  values of the station coefficients are the tectonic faults on  the wave propagation path, which also form that which we have  called the ``characteristics'' of the path. The experimental  data registered during the explosion of 8 July 1989 and during a  number of explosions set off earlier make it possible to  evaluate the influence of the Chinrauz and Shagan faults,  located to the north of the epicenter of the explosion of 8 July  1989. This is traced most simply using the parameters of the  Rayleigh wave registered on paths intersecting and not  intersecting these faults. Figure 10 is a diagrammatic map of  the region on which the epicenters of explosions with the  numbers 1-6 and seismic stations Nos. 1 and 12, for which the  seismograms were analyzed, are plotted. The epicenter with the  No. 1 corresponds to the explosion of 8 July 1992. Figure 10  shows that epicenters 1-4 are separated from epicenters 5-6 by  the Chinrauz and Shagan faults. For explosions 5-6 the seismic  paths at seismic station No. 1 intersect the faults, but for  explosions 1-4 they do not intersect the faults. With respect to  seismic station No. 12, the situation is directly the opposite.  In the remaining details (azimuths of wave propagation,  epicentral distances, other faults of a lower rank and  inhomogeneities encountered on the wave path) the seismic paths  for these explosions are virtually identical.    Tables 2 and 3 give the epicentral distances and  displacements in the Rayleigh wave at seismic stations Nos. 1  and 12 for six explosions. These data and the power of the  explosions were used in computing the reduced wave amplitude    W[.sup]*[/] =  W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/]R[.sup]1.4[/]q[.sup]0.9[/],    which also is given in the tables (here, as before,  W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] is expressed in mm, q is in kt of  TNT and R is in km). The mean reduced amplitude W[.sup]*[/]  was computed for experiments 1-4 and 5-6. Table 2 shows that for  explosions 5-6 the amplitudes of the waves at point No. 1 on the  average is less by a factor of 1.5 than for explosions 1-4.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-68A>      Fig. 10. </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-68B>      Fig. 11. </FIG>     This difference can be attributed to the attenuating  influence of the Chinrauz and Shagan faults.    A similar result can be seen from the data in Table 3. The  wave amplitude at station No. 12 for explosions 1-4 on the  average is less by a factor of 1.6 than for explosions 5-6. It  is natural to assume that here also the reason was wave  attenuation during propagation across the Chinrauz and Shagan  faults. The attenuating influence of the faults is virtually  identical both for explosions 1-4 and for explosions 5-6, that  is, is not dependent on the direction of wave propagation across  the faults.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-69A>      Fig. 12. </FIG>     The noted effect explains why for the established seismic  network in the test site region the Balakan test site was  divided into three zones precisely along the Chinrauz and Shagan  faults, for each of which their own sets of station coefficients  were introduced [17] and demonstrates the contribution of these  two faults to the asymmetry of the experimentally registered  surface wave radiation pattern.    A model of a fault in an ideally elastic medium in the form  of a plane slot with an elastic filler was examined in [5, 20].  According to this model the attenuation of the amplitude of a  wave propagating across a fault is related to its reflections on  the interfaces of media with different acoustic hardness. In  particular, for waves close to harmonic, with a characteristic  period T and a propagation velocity c with passage across a  fault of the width L their amplitude decreases by a factor K = 1  + g[.sup]2[/] [Note: this term is under a radical sign],  where the parameter g = L_g_/cT. Here _g_ =  _r_c[.sup]2[/]/_r_[.sub]1[/]c[.sub]1[/][.sup]2[/] is  the ratio of the hardness of the rock mass to the hardness of  the fault filler, in other words, the fault ``contrast.'' Using  the experimental data: attenuation of the amplitude of the  Rayleigh wave K = 1.5, its period T = 1 s, propagation velocity  c = 2.75 km/s and assuming a common width of the Chinrauz and  Shagan faults equal to L = 200 m, we obtain their ``contrast''  _g_ = 5. A subsequent geophysical investigation of these faults  makes it possible to obtain reliable information concerning them  necessary for computing the propagation of seismic waves across  faults.    Among the experimental seismograms shown in Fig. 5 the  record  of tangential horizontal oscillations at seismic stations Nos. 9  and 12 stands out; at these stations the arrival of a transverse  wave SH, considerable in amplitude, can be seen very distinctly.  This wave is evidence of the release of tectonic energy during  an explosion set off on 8 July 1989. Unfortunately, during this  explosion the tangential component of oscillations was  registered only at an insignificant number of seismic stations  and therefore it is impossible to estimate the freed tectonic  energy using data for close seismics.    5. Residual Seismic Effects of Underground Nuclear Explosion  in Inhomogeneous Medium    Aftershocks are some of the most interesting phenomena of a  seismic character accompanying an underground nuclear explosion  [8, 9, 10]. The aftershocks associated with relaxation processes  in the medium are of special interest with respect to  description of the behavior and properties of the geophysical  medium, and also in monitoring the conducting of underground  nuclear explosions [11, 12]. In contrast to the aftershocks  caused by the collapse of an unvented cavity, the aftershocks  caused by medium relaxation are characterized for the most part  by small amplitudes and a short duration [10]. These aftershocks  are observed over a prolonged period after an explosion, which  is especially important when organizing the monitoring of  nuclear explosions (on-the-spot inspection) because the  monitoring side in this case has adequate time for organizing  observations in the selected territory.

Instrumental observations were made using a  small-aperture seismic registry network and instrument complexes  described in detail in [10, 12].    First, for the purpose of obtaining the comparative  characteristics of pulsed microseismic effects of the wave type  constantly present in the real geophysical medium, seismic  registry was carried out for the two weeks preceding the  explosion. After the underground nuclear explosion was set off  constant operational seismic observations were made over the  course of three months. The measurements were made at nighttime  when the technogenic effects on the geophysical medium were  minimum.    Figure 11 shows characteristic records of a pulsed  microseismic effect in the medium before the explosion and  aftershock. A comparison of pulsed effects of natural origin  (before the explosion) and those initiated by the explosion  reveals their qualitative similarity, which makes it possible to  postulate an identity of sources, and accordingly, an identity  of the mechanisms of radiation of pulsed oscillations.    The discrimination of pulsed microseismic signals against a  background of natural microseismic oscillations was made in an  automatic mode on the basis of computation and comparison of the  dispersion relations in narrow and broad time windows, and also  using frequency selection. The optimum filter was chosen by  means of spectral-temporal analysis. The method was applied by  making a moving evaluation of the intensity of seismic  oscillations in different frequency ranges. In this case the  useful pulsed signal corresponded to a region of increased  dispersion values, which determined the frequency range and the  position of the signal on the time axis (Fig. 12).    The range finding (determination of coordinates) of pulsed  microseismic effects of the wave type was accomplished using one  of two standard methods: on the basis of a correlation analysis  of the oscillations registered at spatially separated seismic  stations and an analysis of the records registered at a central  three-component registry point and at peripheral  single-component registry points.    An analysis of the seismic records made prior to the  explosion shows that the number of pulsed microseismic  oscillations of natural origin distinguishable using the  employed methods in the explosion region of interest to us [See  Footnote 1] with a relative radius of 1000 m/kt[.sup]1/3[/]  [4] did not exceed 1.4 per hour (as an average for the 49 hours  of registry the relative number of signals was 1.08 1/hour). The  rms amplitude of the natural signals in the frequency range 5-10  Hz did not exceed 0.3 m/s. The horizontal spatial  distribution of their foci is virtually uniform (Fig. 13) and  the depth does not exceed 300 m. One notes the fact that the  signals characterized by a great amplitude are grouped closer to  the body of a deep fault.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-70A>      Fig. 13. </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-71A>      FIG. 14. </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-71B>      Fig. 15. </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-71C>      Fig. 16. </FIG>     In the analysis of the aftershocks of an underground  explosion only pulsed signals with an amplitude exceeding 0.4  m/s were taken into account. It was assumed that in the  first  approximation in this way it is possible to discriminate seismic  effects initiated by an explosion.    Figure 14 shows the intensity distribution of aftershock  emission with time. The determined dependence N(t), where N is  the number of aftershocks per unit time, t is time from the  moment of the explosion, representable in the form:    N(t) = 2228t[.sup]-1[/] hour[.sup]-1[/] when 200 &lt; t  &lt; 2000 hours (1)    It must be noted that the experimentally determined  dependence (1) corresponds to the known temporal distribution of  aftershocks of natural and technogenic earthquakes (Omori  frequency of recurrence law [13]).    The data represented in Fig. 14 demonstrate the impairment  of  the monotonic character of the dependence N(t) on the 18th day  after the explosion (in Fig. 14 this place is designated by an  arrow). A more detailed analysis indicated that this can be  attributed to an anomalous change in atmospheric pressure on 27  July 1989. As an illustration, Fig. 15 jointly shows a graph of  the change in atmospheric pressure P in the region where seismic  observations were made with time and the relative value of the  deviation _D_N(t) of the number of aftershocks registered per  unit time from the averaged dependence N(t), designated in Fig.  14 by a solid line. Figure 15 clearly shows that both  dependencies _D_N(t) and P(t) correlate well with one another.  The intensity of aftershock emission drops with an increase in  atmospheric pressure and clearly increases with its decrease.  The lag in the _D_N change is about a half- day. The noted  correlation between relaxation processes and a change in  atmospheric pressure is consistent with the earlier discovered  correlation between deformation processes in the geophysical  medium and atmospheric pressure variations [14].    The law of frequency of recurrence of aftershocks has the  nature of the Gutenberg-Richter dependence (lgN =  const[.sub]1[/] - bM, where M is the magnitude of the seismic  event [15]) and is representable in the form (Fig. 16):    lg N = 1.6 - 1.1 lg A,    where A is the amplitude of the aftershocks in m/s.    The value of the b parameter retrieved using the relation  lgE  = 11.8 + 1.5M (where E = Const[.sub]2[/]A[.sup]2[/] is the  energy of a seismic event in erg [16]) in our case is 0.83.    The spatial distribution of the foci of aftershocks is of  fundamental interest with respect to the influence of the  structural organization of the rock mass on the seismic effects  of an explosion. As it appears, the presence of a well-developed  deep fault results in a considerable spatially nonuniform  distribution of aftershock foci. Figures 17 and 18 show the  distribution of the foci of aftershocks of the investigated  explosion in azimuth and depth. It can be seen clearly that the  overwhelming majority of aftershock foci were concentrated in  the structural block in which the explosion was set off. A deep  fault is clearly manifested in the form of some boundary beyond  which the relaxation processes initiated by an explosion  transpire considerably less intensively. This means that the  fault impedes transfer of the energy of the explosion event, as  a result of which in a structural block separated from the  explosion first of all there is no additional reserve of elastic  energy, and second of all, the disturbance from the explosion is  insufficiently great for initiating the freeing of the tectonic  energy initially present in the medium.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-72A>      Fig. 17. </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-72B>      Fig. 18. </FIG>   Bibliography    1.

Redmond said UN officials had received new assurances from  Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-led Bosnian Government about the  safety of aid flights, suspended after a rocket landed on the  runway on January 5. The countries participating in the  operation -- Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Britain  and Norway -- had agreed to the resumption of flights, he added.    Redmond said 21 flights into the Bosnian capital were  planned  for Tuesday. The first aircraft of the day would be a Canadian  plane flying out of Ancona in Italy.    An attempt was made on Sunday to resume the aid operation,  but stopped after four flights because of the security situation  around the capital.</p>

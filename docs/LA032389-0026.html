			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MCGUIRE WINS COUNCIL SEAT  </P> <P> Jacqueline McGuire, 42, opponent of a group of longtime council members in  Rolling Hills Estates, won a special council election Tuesday, defeating  candidates who had adopted more conciliatory positions.  </P> <P> McGuire won with 56.5% of the vote. Defeated were William Ailor, with 33.6%,  and Robert Schacter, with 9.9%.  </P> <P> McGuire, a special education teacher with the Palos Verdes Unified School  District, supported the recall movement that ousted veteran Councilman Jerome  Belsky in a recall election last November and created the vacancy.  </P> <P> Endorsed by the leaders of the recall movement, McGuire campaigned by attacking  the present council, which she said does not adequately represent residents,  and the city administration, which she said is not responsive to residents  requesting information.  </P> <P> Elected to complete Belsky's term, McGuire said she intends to run in November  for a full four-year term.  </P> <P> Ailor, 44, an engineer with Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, said during the  campaign that he had no problem with council members. Endorsed by Belsky and  Mayor Nell Mirels and Councilmen Hugh Muller and Warren Schwarzmann, Ailor had  said he would work "within the system."  </P> <P> The third-place finisher, Robert Schacter, 38, an attorney, said during the  campaign that he would be willing to listen to all sides.  </P></p>

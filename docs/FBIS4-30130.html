			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is  poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet  to the Diet. Commenting on the LDP's move at a 23 June meeting  of members of the House of Representatives and the House of  Councillors who are affiliated with the ruling Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP], DSP Chairman Takashi Yonezawa pointed  out: "If the no- confidence motion against the Hata cabinet is  approved in the Diet, then the Hata cabinet would resign en  masse, leaving no possibility of Prime Minister Hata becoming  again prime minister." He went on to say, "the Hata cabinet  should think of its voluntary general resignation while watching  as the LDP submits a no-confidence motion to the Diet." He also  stated that the Hata cabinet should study the possibility of  resigning en masse depending on the outcome of talks with the  opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on forming a  new coalition and the SDPJ's internal situation.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Privatisation has made little difference to BT performance Sir, Michael Cassell's article on privatisation and prices ('On the bandwagon', August 27), raised important questions, but I am afraid fell into some usual traps. There are no absolute yardsticks in the utility price game. Even foreign comparisons are meretricious because of the near impossibility of comparing like for like and the constant shifts in exchange rates. He also failed to recognise the profound effect of variables specific to the industries. In the case of British Telecommunications the telephone system grew by a factor of three between 1970 and 1992; and usage grew even more. By privatisation, unit costs were steadily dropping; and the sheer volume of revenue was so great and it was growing so fast that the price increases needed to maintain profitability were bound progressively to drop. The enduring economic boom of the 1980s intensified the effect. History does not begin at privatisation. The useful analysis is over significant periods before and after privatisation; using variables which have an independent meaning. Inflation raised prices generally by a factor of 7.6 over the 22 years 1970-1992. Those of BT rose only by a factor of 4.3 over the same period. They have fallen steadily below general inflation ever since 1982. Privatisation in 1984 had no perceptible effect on this trend - up or down. BT's real output per head of staff, measured at constant BT prices, has been rising remarkably consistently at 7.5 per cent ever since 1970. The only significant setback to this trend was immediately after privatisation. It has been retrieved by the recent staff reductions. There is a similar pattern in improvement in network service; 3.4 per cent of local calls failed in 1971, but by 1992 the percentage had been reduced to 0.2 per cent. Again, there was a setback after privatisation, but it has now been retrieved. The true lesson in BT's case once trends are measured over time seems to be that privatisation has made little difference. It would be interesting to see a similar analysis for the other industries.

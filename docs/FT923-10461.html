			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Phone code changes to be delayed CHANGES to telephone codes planned for Easter 1994 are to be delayed for a year, the Office of Telecommunications announced yesterday. Mr Bill Wigglesworth, acting director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, also said that the period of parallel running  -in which both old and new numbers would operate together  - would be extended from three months to seven months. Oftel decided to postpone the national code change (NCC) and extend the period of parallel running after pressure from telecommunications users and equipment manufacturers to allow them more time to prepare for the planned changes. The NCC will introduce a 10-digit numbering scheme throughout the UK to meet the growing shortage of telephone numbers arising as new services are introduced. There are 25m to 30m telephone customers in the UK and the demand for numbers is growing at a rate of about 5 per cent a year, Oftel said. Under the proposed scheme, a single digit '1' would be added to all codes of the form 0XX or 0XXX after the initial '0'. For example, London 071 would become 0171. However, mobile services, freephones and premium rate services would not be affected. Five cities - Nottingham, Bristol, Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield  - which are facing a more urgent number shortage, would be given new seven-digit local numbers, Oftel said. However, since the code changes were initially approved last September by Sir Bryan Carsberg, then director-general of Oftel, there has been strong criticism from the Telecommunications Managers Association over the costs of introducing the changes. The association believes those costs would be more than Pounds 3bn. Oftel counters that the figure would be closer to Pounds 500m.</p>

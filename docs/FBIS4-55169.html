			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(mrk)"-signed report: "Millions for the Ethnic Press"] </F>   [Text] Prague -- Almost 20 million korunas was earmarked  from the state budget in 1993 to support the publication of the  ethnic press. This is apparent from the report that I. Nemec,  minister and chairman of the Council for Ethnic Minorities,  submitted to the government last week. A total of 12 ethnic  publications received support -- three Polish, three Romany, two  German, two Slovak, one Hungarian, and one Ukrainian. Apart  from this, the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Physical  Training is still subsidizing two Polish children's magazines.  According to A. Sulitka, the Council for Ethnic Minorities'  secretary, state support is an important condition, without  which the ethnic press could not be published. Support is linked  -- strictly purposefully -- to ensuring the publication of  individual titles and is always granted to the civic association  of the appropriate minority, which guarantees to publish the  title. The amount of the subsidy depends on specific  conditions: Publications from the Romany minority received the  most support in 1993. Approximately the same amount as last  year has been earmarked to support the ethnic press this year;  the number of subsidized titles should also be the same.</p>

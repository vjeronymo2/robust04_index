			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Tax rise for high earners wins support The Liberal Democrat conference yesterday approved the broad thrust of the leadership's tax and benefit plans despite considerable uncertainty about details of their fiscal proposals. In the party's principal debate on economic policy, delegates approved plans to increase the tax burden on high earners while increasing the amounts of a number of social security payments including child benefit and income support. Senior Liberal Democrats were relieved that the conference had rejected the introduction of a partial citizens' income. This would give all UK citizens a tax credit, but would add another 10 per cent to the basic rate of tax. However, the conference approved other measures that would lead to a drastic increase in the tax burden on middle-income earners, despite the concerns of some MPs. The party approved proposals to integrate national insurance into the income tax system. This would probably add 10 per cent to the tax burden for anyone earning more than Pounds 25,000 a year. Delegates also endorsed proposals to tax those earning more than Pounds 100,000 a year at a maximum of 60 per cent. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's Treasury spokesman, again insisted he would press for a 50 per cent rate at the party's federal policy committee. In a radical redistribution of benefits, the party approved proposals to abolish mortgage interest relief and the married couple's allowance. In turn, the party would retain and increase universal child benefit. It would also restore the full entitlement to income support for those between the ages of 16 and 25. Mr Bruce insisted yesterday that the full costings of all these proposals would be worked out by the party's executive bodies in the run-up to the next election. He said the party leadership's hands had not been tied by the decisions. 'The new policy is detailed in its proposals, but the actual rates are not determined.' However, one MP admitted that he would have preferred to see the proposals sent back to the federal policy committee, fearing that they will give the Liberal Democrats the image of a 'high-tax party'.</p>

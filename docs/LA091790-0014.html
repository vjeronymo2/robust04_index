			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN LAWS AND VIOLENT CRIME  </P> <P> Your editorial cites a few recent events and then calls for "more effective gun  legislation."  </P> <P> There are already laws against everything you mentioned. It is illegal to "pack  a piece," to threaten anyone with a gun, to shoot guns in public, etc. Most  gang members have criminal records preventing them from legally even owning a  gun.  </P> <P> Our problem is not needing more laws -- it is enforcement of existing laws.  Tougher judges, more prisons, the death penalty, etc. are the solutions. Why  doesn't The Times take the lead on these issues? Without enforcement and  punishment, laws are useless. Our gang and drug problems are proof of that.  </P> <P> JOHN PEARSON  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Cautious budget for Canadians CANADA'S finance minister yesterday tabled a cautious pre-election budget, avoiding tax increases and making an unexpectedly modest dent in government spending. Mr Donald Mazankowski forecast that the federal budget deficit would fall to CDollars 32.6bn (Pounds 16.8bn) in the fiscal year to March 31 1994, from CDollars 35.5bn in 1992-93. Last year's shortfall was CDollars 8bn higher than the 1992 budget projection, and more than CDollars 1bn above estimates made last December. The 1992-93 deficit, the second highest on record, was blamed on shrinking tax revenues caused by the recession and low inflation. The Progressive Conservative government has repeatedly failed, during its nine years in office, to meet its deficit-reduction targets. However, Mr Mazankowski pledged yesterday to eliminate all new government borrowing within five years. Federal spending will rise by 1.5 per cent next year - a zero increase in real terms. However, with a general election likely to be held in September or October, Mr Mazankowski's belt-tightening excluded touchy political subjects such as social security programmes and revenue transfers to the provinces. Even so, grants to special interest groups will be cut by 15 per cent in the 1995-96 fiscal year, with further reductions later. Several government agencies due to be disbanded as part of the budget measures exist only on paper. Mr Mazankowski forecast that Canada's growth rate would accelerate to 4.6 per cent in real terms in 1994, from 2.9 per cent this year.</p>

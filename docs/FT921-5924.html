			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: CBI challenges the view that UK is in longest and deepest recession Sir, It appears to be accepted that the UK economy is in the longest - though not the deepest - recession since the second world war. This was the main theme of your coverage last week of the provisional gross domestic product figures for the fourth quarter. A closer examination reveals that this is not the case. The longest continuous period of decline is still the five quarters ending in the first quarter of 1981. This is because the decline in GDP that has been under way since the middle of 1990 was interrupted in the third quarter of 1991 by a slight rise. The rise in GDP in the third quarter of last year has now turned out to be a blip caused by a bounce back in oil production. However, if we are to exclude such blips in activity from our calculations, the decline in GDP in the mid-1970s appears to be the longest, with GDP falling from the third quarter of 1973 and a sustained recovery not beginning until two years later. Douglas McWilliams (Letters, November 25, 1991) suggested an alternative definition of recession: the period of time until the economy has recovered to reach the previous peak in output. On this definition, the recessions in the mid-1970s and early 1980s both lasted over three years. By this rule, we will not know whether we have been in the longest post-war recession until we have the figures for GDP in the third quarter of 1993. In all this analysis, we are not really comparing like with like. The historical data, with which the most recent figures are compared, have been significantly revised since their first publication. Such revisions have often been much larger than the 0.2 per cent rise in GDP recorded in the third quarter of 1991, or the 0.3 per cent fall in the fourth quarter. It is, therefore, premature to describe the current recession as the longest since 1945. Such statements may well be proved incorrect by subsequent events - and data revisions - which economic commentators may not have been very good at anticipating] Andrew Sentance, director, economic affairs, Confederation of British Industry, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Crvenkovski Moderate Optimist"] </F>   [Text] Reserved optimism for the course of the  Macedonian-Greek negotiations was expressed by Macedonia's [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign  Relations Minister Stevo Crvenkovski in his statement for  MAKPRESS after yesterday's one hour meeting in New York with the  UN and U.S. mediators Cyrus Vance and Matthew Nimitz.    Reminding of the agreement reached with the [words  indistinct] details of the negotiations, Crvenkovski did not  want to comment on the basis for this feeling that "there are  possibilities" that things will move from the standstill.    Commenting on the proposal for a new name, "Northern  Macedonia," that was allegedly made by the American mediator  Matthew Nimitz, Crvenkovski said: "In this phase we have as yet  not reached any concrete proposals, especially not about the  name," but ways are being sought out to continue the dialogue  which is in the interest of both sides.    It is reported from New York that, depending on the results  of the meeting with Vance scheduled for late last night,  Minister Crvenkovski may leave for Washington for several  meetings.    Up until today no progress has been made, stated yesterday  in  New York the Greek ambassador Zaharakis after the meeting with  Cyrus Vance. Zaharakis denied the speculations in the press  according to which the U.S. mediator Nimitz presented proposals  for the name: "New" or "Northern" Macedonia. Replying to a  question Zaharakis said: "Mr. Nimitz has not presented any  proposals, he simply participates in the procedure for the  exchange of opinion."</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Sharp increase in housebuilding starts welcomed The number of homes started by housebuilders continues to race ahead of levels prevailing 12 months ago, according to separate figures published yesterday by the government and the industry. The Department of the Environment said builders in Great Britain started work on 41,000 homes during the three months to the end of February - 5.6 per cent more than the 38,800 started during the corresponding three-month period a year earlier. The figures show that private-sector starts over the same period rose by 14.4 per cent from 27,800 to 31,800. However, starts made on homes for housing associations fell from 10,300 to 8,800, reflecting continuing reductions in government spending. Housing starts and completions by local authorities, new towns and government departments also remained at a low level. Separate figures published by the National House Building Council, which claims to register about 90 per cent of all new homes in the UK, show that 48,700 starts on new homes were registered with the council in the first three months of this year. The council said this represented a 19 per cent increase on the first three months of last year and was the highest number of starts in any quarter since the beginning of 1989. About 10,500 homes were being built on behalf of housing associations. Mr Basil Bean, the council's chief executive, said: 'Housebuilders have been very active during the first quarter of this year. 'The first couple of months showed a considerable increase in new home starts and March continued this encouraging trend, although at a slightly lower level.' He added: 'There is no sign of the upturn in the market faltering, and the next few months are traditionally an important season in the home-buying calendar. However, it will be interesting to see how the recent tax increases affect the attitude of potential homebuyers.'</p>

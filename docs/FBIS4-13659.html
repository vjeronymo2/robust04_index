			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 22 Apr (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR describes the  United Nation's claim that it is afraid its military  intervention against the Serbs would lead to a conflagration in  other areas of Europe as a feeble excuse to justify its  nonintervention.    In its commentary today, the paper denounces the UN Security  Council's insistence on not allowing the Bosnian people to  obtain weapons to defend their lives, entity, and future,  describing it as an ugly crime.    The paper says that the United Nations has left the Serbian  gangs to carry out their war against the unarmed Bosnian people  without any serious, genuine attempt to put an end to the  Serbian aggression, which has been going on for the past two  years.    The paper appeals to the states that defend justice to raise  the issue at the International Court of Justice after the  responsible organizations have abandoned the people and failed  to fulfill their sacred duty.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: MG Refining sacks top executives Leading executives of MG Refining and Marketing, the US oil and gas arm of Metallgesellschaft group, the troubled German mining and metals conglomerate, have been sacked and a number of senior subordinates have been suspended. Mr W. Arthur Benson, and his son, Mr William Benson, were sacked 'for cause,' the company said. In addition, a number of the senior Mr Benson's subordinates at MG Refining and Marketing have been suspended from their jobs. Mr Arthur Benson was president of MG Refining and Marketing until mid-December, when he was relieved of his executive duties in the wake of an investigation by Metallgesellschaft into the unit's oil and gas dealings and related hedging strategies. Sources said he was not asked to leave at that time because his knowledge was needed to sort out the company's tangled busin-esses. Mr William Benson served as a senior vice-president and risk manager for MG Refining and Marketing. Metallgesellschaft was gripped by a severe liquidity crisis late last year largely as a result of problems in the US. The crisis led to the replacement of the group chief executive.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Honesty is the best business policy - Encouraging open dialogue is the best way to achieve change in a company's structure and its underlying culture Is honesty becoming a hallmark of business? There were two noticeable examples at last week's Institute of Personnel and Development conference. One involved the admission by Paul Preston, president of McDonald's restaurants in the UK, to something of a marketing gaffe. Without any market research, the company launched a cheese, salad and pickle sandwich snack, called a 'McPloughman's'. It never took off. The other featured a warning by Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, that the shake out from restructuring in the UK banking industry would grow worse before it grew better. Pay expectations would have to be dampened  -a 1 per cent rise equated to 650 lost jobs at Lloyds, he said. Sir Brian was laying the message on the line in a way that rarely happened in the past. He argued that top managers needed to be brutally honest with staff and involve them in the process of change. But can managers' accept it when the dialogue is two-way and employees are encouraged to be honest about them and the company? Preston admitted McDonald's UK management was surprised when it discovered three years ago that staff were less than enamoured with McPloughman's. It was equally surprised when it heard some of the adverse comments from customers. McDonald's discovery, which was well heeded, could be a lesson in openness and frank, two-way dialogue for all companies. Jean Boulton, of Hay Management Consultants, suggests saying the unsayable - what she calls corporate blaspheming - can be a useful way to tackle change. Only by confronting the culture of the organisation, she argues, can anything be done to change it. Boulton believes it is the people working for organisations that most inhibit change, even after the need for it has been recognised and processes have been introduced to bring it about. 'Companies spend enormous amounts of time and money restructuring, re-engineering, decentralising, centralising. But somehow the people of the organisations slip unscathed through the process, hanging on to the same attitudes, behaviours and beliefs they always had,' she told delegates at a recent Hay client issues conference in London. Very often the only thing that has really changed, observes Boulton, is language. While people might feel comfortable talking about empowerment and customer focus, what they actually do changes remarkably little. The problem for many, she finds, is that as the structure of the organisation and its ways of working change around them, people feel less supported and less understood as they find themselves deprived of the informal methods by which they got their work done. Their behaviour is embodied in the culture of the organisation, and only when this is recognised and changed can a real transformation be achieved, she says. She breaks down culture into four elements - the unconscious, the conscious, the espoused and the unspoken. Unconscious culture, she says, is 'probably the most influential and the hardest for organisations to recognise and handle'. The recent departure of Peter Sherlock as chief executive at National Freight Corporation seems a classic example of unconscious culture at work. The company recruited someone it thought it needed but whose way of working, it found afterwards, could not be accommodated by other board members. The existing culture prevailed and Sherlock departed. Boulton says the conscious aspects - those values, usually positive, that we are aware of - must also be acknowledged. What she calls espoused culture is what an organisation says it is like. Boulton claims this oftens equates to its ideal rather than what it is really doing. Boulton gives some examples of unspoken culture, what she terms the 'dark mutterings in the corridor', that need to be brought out into the open if things are to change. These include: 'Everyone knows that the people who get on around here are the ones who don't put their heads above the parapet. Look at Martin. He's always the one that tries to challenge the boss, point out what the problems are, but it doesn't get him anywhere, does it?' 'They say they want us to take risks but every time you disagree with the boss's pet idea, that's it.' 'We say we want to reward output and productivity and customer service, but we all know that technical excellence is what really counts in this engineering culture. Look at our senior managers. They are our most able engineers but they don't manage anyone. All they're interested in is their own technical work, but they still get promoted.' Are any of these familiar? Boulton argues that only if they are be brought into the open can change be achieved. Boardrooms are sluggish in responding to demands for changes to the role of non-executive director. This is suggested by the findings of a survey of company chairmen of UK-listed companies, conducted by Pro Ned, the non-executive selection company, and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The independent non-executive as a guardian of accounting and remuneration standards seems to be a rare animal. Of the 585 chairmen surveyed - representing about a third of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange  -60 per cent admitted their last non-executive appointment was made through personal connections without an objective appraisal of the skills required. Some 41 per cent intended to create more specific arrangements for future appointments. These included using a more formal specification, involving more of the board in decision making and appointing a nomination committee. Most of the chairmen thought fees for non-executives would rise in return for a greater time commitment. A rise of 10 per cent during the next two years was envisaged, and two-thirds of the chairmen anticipated upward pressure because of the increasing responsibilities of the job. Where is the upward pressure coming from? It suggests the sector is a seller's market. Should this be the case when annual fees paid to non-executive directors are at present between Pounds 600 and Pounds 1,200 a day? One problem may be that many companies are casting their net for non-executives far too narrowly. They could broaden their search within the business arena, or look to areas outside business - the public sector and the professions. Most of all, they could look more favourably at women. Surely there is room for broader-based recruitment if the alternative is yet more boardroom pay increases - large rises for executives are finding few champions these days. Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, points out that the few big pay increases that make the headlines mask the more modest salaries paid to thousands of other directors. Nevertheless, he says, directors need to be more open about their pay awards, and to justify them. He and the institute are working on guidelines that will in effect call for greater disclosure of salaries, closer links between rewards and the long-term financial performance of a company, and greater consideration of whether any rise reflects that granted to other employees. 'There is nothing wrong in substantial rewards for substantial achievement - but there should be no rewards for failure,' he says.</p>

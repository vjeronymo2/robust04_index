			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Jubilee Line rescue ruled out PLANS to extend London Underground's Jubilee Line to the London Docklands redevelopment zone appeared to be on the brink of collapse last night. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, emphatically ruled out the possibility of government intervention to save the line. He made clear that he was not prepared to let London Underground start work on the Pounds 1.7bn extension unless the private sector contributed the money originally promised by Olympia &amp; York, the developer of Canary Wharf, now in administrative receivership. Mr MacGregor said: 'As I have made clear, we need Pounds 100m in cash during the construction period. That is what was promised, and no public funds are available in replacement. 'Similarly, after construction is completed, we must look for developer contributions with a net present value equivalent to that of the stream of post-construction payments originally promised by O&amp;Y. All contributions must, of course, be assured before construction starts.' Mr MacGregor made his position clear in a reply to the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, which had urged him to consider rescheduling the private-sector contribution so that work on the project could start. Olympia &amp; York had agreed to pay Pounds 40m towards the line's construction by March 31 this year and another Pounds 60m by March 31 next year. It had also promised a further Pounds 300m, but that money was to be paid in stages over 25 years from the end of the construction period, so its net present value was only about Pounds 56m. Work on the line is due to start now, and completion is due in 1996. Mr MacGregor's statement appears to allow for payment of the initial Pounds 100m to slip by up to three years, because it would still fall within the construction period. There are still no indications, however, that any possible buyer of Canary Wharf would be ready to assume Olympia &amp; York's commitments to the Jubilee Line extension. Meanwhile, London Underground has said it will disband its Jubilee Line project team if work has not started by the end of the month.</p>

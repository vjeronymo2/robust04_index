			<p>BFN     [Text] In addition to extending condolences on the death of  Her Majesty Queen Zayn al-Sharaf, the Jordanian queen mother,  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to Jordan on Thursday [28  April] was a political opportunity to exchange views with Jordan  on developments in the Arab situation and Jordanian-Syrian  coordination on the political settlement. This is especially  true in view of the fact that the visit coincided with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher's regional tour and the  announcement by Israel and the PLO that they have reached an  agreement on the implementation of the Oslo agreement on  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, and that the agreement will be  signed on Wednesday under U.S.-Egyptian sponsorship.    During their meeting, King Husayn and President al-Asad  stressed adherence to a comprehensive and final solution. They  emphasized that Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese coordination will  continue and that any new separate deals that would weaken other  positions will be avoided.    Jordan explained that it rejected and continues to reject  U.S. proposals on the formation of a four-way  Egyptian-Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian committee whose task  would be to help implement the self-rule agreement.    Jordan proposed that a six-way committee be set up within  the  framework of the Washington negotiations to discuss appropriate  ways to link the Palestinian self-rule agreement to other tracks  of bilateral negotiations.    For this six-way committee, which would be comprised of  representatives from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the  Palestinians, and Israel, to advance the peace negotiations on  all tracks, including the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, Jordan  believes that U.S. and Russian participation will be useful and  will help bring views closer. However, the United States,  Israel, and Egypt believe that any formula of this kind means a  return to an international peace conference. The three parties  believe that a solution can only be reached within a bilateral  framework following the example of the Camp David and Oslo  agreements. Moreover, Christopher told King Husayn that Arab  coordination prevents parties from moving toward separate  settlements, for bilateral negotiations are held in isolation  from other parties and it would be faster to reach bilateral  solutions.    In their meeting, which was held during a working luncheon,  the Jordanian monarch and the Syrian president agreed that a  meeting of the foreign ministers of the Arab parties to the  negotiations will be held in Amman soon after the conclusion of  the U.S. secretary of state's tour. The aim of the meeting will  be to assess the results of this tour and to adopt a unified  stand on the resumption of the bilateral negotiations, which are  supposed to resume in Washington in mid-May.    According to both sides' assessment, the Jordanian-Syrian  meeting was successful. It was agreed to intensify contacts to  emphasize coordination.</p>

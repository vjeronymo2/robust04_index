			<p>BFN     [Text] On the eve of his official visit to the United  States of America, which begins on 13 June, Ukrainian Army  General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine's minister of defense, met  representatives of the U.S. mass media accredited in Kiev.    Vitaliy Radetskyy related that he would be meeting the U.S.  vice president, the secretary of defense, well-known senators,  and the Ukrainian diaspora. Ukraine's minister of defense will  also visit a number of military bases and observe the process of  destroying a strategic ballistic missile and its launching silo.  Among the issues it is planned to discuss during the week-long  visit the problems of the development of Ukraine's armed forces,  the continuation of nuclear disarmament in accordance with the  trilateral statement by the presidents of the United States,  Ukraine and Russia, national security, Ukraine's participation  in the Partnership for Peace program, the problem of Crimea and  the division of the Black Sea Fleet occupy an important place.    When the U.S. journalists asked where, in the opinion of the  Ukrainian military minister, Ukraine's Navy should be based,  Vitaliy Radetskyy replied:    [Begin Radetskyy recording] There is no talk about this  because [words indistinct] the Crimea is a constituent part of  Ukraine. This issue is not even being raised, and it should not  be raised either. Only one issue is being raised -- the site  for the temporary basing for the Russian Navy. [end recording]</p>

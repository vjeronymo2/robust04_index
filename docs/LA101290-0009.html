			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COP  </P> <P> What irony! On Page 1 of Metro is a story of an extraordinarily talented and  dedicated black LAPD officer who is battling a Board of Rights hearing (and  possible month's suspension without pay), for yelling at his white captain for  burglarizing his car.  </P> <P> Then on the letters page is Chief Daryl F. Gates' "recruiting piece," which  boasts of 1,128 blacks, 1,772 Latinos, 1,068 woman and a motto that LAPD  officers "come only in one color -- blue."  </P> <P> It would seem, however, that a few of his staff are green -- apparently with  envy. Could it be that a black officer is accepted in the department as one of  L.A.'s finest as long as he keeps "his place" and doesn't garner too much  personal recognition?  </P> <P> Since McGill admits to losing his temper and yelling at his captain -- who  steadfastly denies the car burglary -- it will be interesting to see how the  chief and his Board of Rights view captain-bashing by this black officer in  comparison to perjury committed by a white sergeant.  </P> <P> GEORGE V.

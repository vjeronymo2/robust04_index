Within this framework, U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke to  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and asked him to decide on a new  date for talks with Israel. In a telephone conversation, Warren  Christopher also called on Yasir 'Arafat to begin negotiations  with the Zionist regime. Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator in  the compromising talks, endorsed the issue in his meeting with  'Arafat in Tunis.    With this concerted effort, the United States is seeking to  salvage the Zionist regime and to depict the blood of the  victims of the catastrophic massacre of the fasting Muslim  worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi shrine in occupied Palestine as  worthless. The more the level of the direct involvement of the  Zionist regime's armed forces in the tragedy of the massacre of  the Palestinians transpires, and new documentary evidence  continues to emerge, the greater the White House effort to  support the terrorist echelons in Israel.    U.S. President Bill Clinton is quite unattentive to the  wounded sensitivities of the Palestinian Muslim nation and the  indignation of the international public and the people of the  Islamic world and is ignoring the repeated violations of human  rights and international norms by the Tel Aviv officials. He is  expected to meet Yitzhaq Rabin, the Zionist regime's prime  minister, at the White House. Rabin has met the U.S.  secretaries of state and defense in Washington and had military  and political coordination with them.    It is being stated that this Friday, that is, three weeks  after Hebron, finally, the Security Council will issue a  resolution regarding the killing of the fasting worshipers at  the shrine of the Prophet Abraham, peace be upon him. Since the  incident, a resolution has repeatedly been promised; in  practice, it has not been issued, due to U.S. opposition.    It appears unlikely that this promise will be fulfilled to  mitigate people's anger over the meeting between the U.S.  President and the terrorist head of the Zionist regime.  Washington's unconditionally supportive policy for the Zionist  regime's officials, which can have no other effect but to  enhance their audacity to suppress the Palestinian Muslims,  remains a source of concern.</p>

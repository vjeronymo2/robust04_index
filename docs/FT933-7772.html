			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: German banks' 1993 earnings up 13.5% OPERATING profits for the German banking sector rose by 13.5 per cent last year, reaching a total of DM40bn (Dollars 23.6bn), the Bundesbank has calculated. The main reason for the increase was a 10 per cent surge in earnings from interest income, reflecting a DM9.5bn increase in bank lending volume, the German central bank says in its August monthly report, published today. As a result, the banks were able to improve interest margins and capital ratios, in spite of the onset of recession in Germany in the second half of last year, the Bundesbank found. Recent interim figures from the banking sector showed that banks have maintained their immunity to the downturn in the German economy, even as the economy has deteriorated further during the current year. This has been mainly because of strong profits on own-account trading, though growth in interest income has also proved resilient.</p>

Security Council (UNSC). In its political platform for  fiscal 1994, the DSP declared it would push for permanent  membership in the 15-member council as well as give its  wholehearted support to U.N. operations, including peacekeeping  activities.    The DSP also called for amendments in the Self-Defense  Forces  Law to institutionalize the SDF's contributions to U.N.  peacekeeping operations as its main or sub-main task. The  platform will be formalized at a party convention in April,  party officials said.</p>

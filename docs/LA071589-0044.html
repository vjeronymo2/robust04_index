			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: BEST WAY TO SEE OTL: INCOGNITO  </P> <P> True confessions time. I went to Fiesta Island last weekend for the Old Mission  Beach Athletic Club Over-The-Line World Championship Tournament. Please don't  tell my mother.  </P> <P> OTL, you see, has a reputation that makes Wade Boggs seem like the old image of  Steve Garvey. If these were Biblical times, Lot's wife would be looking back at  Fiesta Island from her seat in the shuttle bus and turning into a pillar of  salt.  </P> <P> That's how these festivities are viewed, particularly from afar.  </P> <P> Even the initials "OTL" have taken the form of culprits, as though they stand  for One Tumultuous Lark. In truth, OTL in its recreational form is played 50  weekends a year hereabouts. No one pays much attention, except for wives and  girlfriends and husbands and boyfriends. Not that they bother going.  </P> <P> However, most folks think OTL is something that comes each July for two  weekends and then goes away. It is on those two weekends that OTL ceases to be  recreational and becomes, at best, socio-cultural and, at worst, downright  bacchanal.  </P> <P> To be sure, were OTL a person, I wouldn't want any of my kids dating it . . .  or visiting it. The program is something you take home in a manila envelope and  hope Aunt Maude doesn't stumble across it. It would get as R as a movie, though  some detractors would certainly give it an X.  </P> <P> Having been away from the spectacle for a while, I ventured to Fiesta Island  for the first of two weekends. I wanted to see if OTL had matured or mellowed  in its 36th year.  </P> <P> I found that OTL really has two personalities, one no more (or less) obnoxious  than any weekend at any beach and the other as loud and outlandish as the most  abrasive Las Vegas comic.  </P> <P> You see, with OTL, you are dealing with both video and audio.  </P> <P> With the exception of the games themselves, which are not a high spectator  priority, Fiesta Island in a visual sense is like a walk on the boardwalk any  weekend. The difference, of course, is that there is no boardwalk.  </P> <P> What you see are people dressed anywhere from scantily to casually. They are  carrying beverages, beverage containers and folding chairs. Collectively, they  are covered with enough oil to fill the tanks of the Exxon Valdez and leave a  slick from here to the Aleutians.  </P> <P> Indeed, on these two weekends a year, I would like to open a concession stand  on the corner of E. Mission Bay and Fiesta Island Road. I would sell suntan  oil, beverage containers and folding chairs, and I could retire and play OTL  recreationally the other 50 weekends of the year.  </P> <P> These people, at least 95% of them, are going to Fiesta Island to either get  some sun or look at each other or both, exactly the same reasons they would go  to Mission Beach or La Jolla Shores or Moonlight. On these weekends, they all  go to Fiesta Island because that is where everyone is going, except for the  people who are convinced no one goes anymore because it is too crowded.  </P> <P> This game of OTL, thus, plays the role of the host who gets everyone together  and then cannot get anyone's attention. To a great extent, the guests turn  their cheeks -- yes, those cheeks -- on the games themselves.  </P> <P> Most folks do not know who is playing whom or where. At least on this weekend,  spouses and lovers pay attention. After all, world championships will be  decided sometime Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> Now, there is one way to follow exactly what is going on.  </P> <P> You listen to the public address announcer. This is the audio part. This is  where the character of these weekends is defined. Understandably, there are  folks who find the P.A. announcer to be offensive, though it has nothing to do  with his breath or his clothes or the way he cuts his hair.  </P> <P> No, this fellow has to announce what teams are playing where. To do so, he has  to identify the teams. He can do it there, but we cannot do it here.  </P> <P> Many, maybe most, of the team names are ribald or vulgar or insensitive or . .  .  </P> <P> You get the idea. The team names, in fact, differentiate one year from another  more than anything else, because darn near everything else stays the same.  </P> <P> This is the year, for example, that Pete Rose, Steve Garvey, Wade Boggs and  Richard Silberman are taking a licking in team names. You get a little bit of a  black eye, and these folks will come up with a team name that'll punch you in  the nose.  </P> <P> Name anyone who has been touched by controversy in the past 36 years, and I  guarantee you that OTL teams have been named in his or her dishonor. You can  trace history by OTL team names, though the city schools are unlikely to adopt  this approach to keeping munchkins interested.  </P> <P> Of course, I do have a solution for anyone who would like to enjoy Fiesta  Island this weekend without being exposed to the obscene and outrageous side of  the OTL experience.  </P> <P> Wear ear muffs.  </P> <P> You wouldn't be the first. Right, Mom?  </P></p>

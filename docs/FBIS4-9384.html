			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic] </F>   [Excerpt] Gorazde -- The chetniks have not pulled back to  a distance of 3 km from the town center, as stipulated by the  NATO ultimatum. The UN forces still have not occupied a single  position in the region as envisaged by the NATO ultimatum. The  chetniks are settling Kopaci and Zubcici with civilian  populations. These villages are in the direct vicinity of  Gorazde. At the same time the chetniks are concentrating major  forces on the territory around the free part of the Gorazde  district.

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia ripe for state sell-off - The Swedish drug group is in form Steering one of the world's top 20 pharmaceuticals companies through Sweden's largest privatisation would have seemed a remote prospect indeed to Mr Jan Ekberg eight years ago. The Pharmacia chief executive was more concerned with saving his loss-making Nordic-orientated company from extinction. The company survived, thanks to restructuring and a spectacular acquisition programme which has taken annual sales to SKr27bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in 1993 from SKr1.5bn in 1986. 'This company has done more deals than some merchant banks,' jokes one observer. The result is that the group has become the true multinational of Mr Ekberg's aspirations, ranking as Sweden's fifth-biggest company by market capitalisation. The SKr10bn privatisation gets under way today with the launch of the prospectus. The state plans to sell up to 82.2m A shares in the group - 47.4 per cent of the votes - to retail investors and international institutions. It will, however, hang on to a 10.1 per cent voting stake to ensure ownership stability and prevent a hostile takeover. This is an important consideration, given that Pharmacia's second-largest shareholder, the vehicle group Volvo, plans to sell its 28 per cent stake in 1996. In terms of sales, Pharmacia is even bigger than Astra, Sweden's high-flying drugs company, although the two companies are very different. Astra has achieved its growth organically, whereas Pharmacia has depended heavily on acquisitions. While Astra's fortunes have soared on the back of several blockbusters, Pharmacia has relied on dominant market positions in niche areas. This dominance is reflected in the fact that in no fewer than five areas - cataract surgery, allergies, growth hormones, nutrition and smoking cessation - the group has the leading world position. Because of this profile, Mr Ekberg does not appear unduly worried about the company's exposure to government efforts to reduce healthcare spending. Its broad product spread lessens the impact of a clampdown in any particular area. However, it also benefits by having a relatively high exposure to the hospital sector, rather than the retail market where many of the cuts have been focused. A good example is Italy, Pharmacia's third-largest market. Pharmaceuticals sales there are estimated to have fallen by around 20 per cent in the first quarter - yet Pharmacia's sales were down just 1 per cent. Following its extensive acquisition programme, culminating last year in the Dollars 1.3bn purchase of the Italian pharmaceuticals group Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Fice), Pharmacia's immediate focus is cost-cutting. It aims to achieve annual savings of SKr1.2bn by 1996 as part of a drive to lift its operating margin, to 20 per cent from 13.5 per cent at the end of last year. The group has already merged its marketing companies with Fice's: now the main task is to reduce production capacity, spread over 46 plants in 15 countries, by as much as 50 per cent over the next five years. Cost-cutting was the main reason for the company's unexpectedly-strong first-quarter performance. The operating margin rose to 16 per cent, despite a sluggish 3 per cent increase in volumes and lower sales of the company's two main drugs, Genotropin (growth hormones) and Healon (cataract surgery). Longer-term, Mr Ekberg's target is to grow at least as fast as the market. For this, he is pinning his hopes on a much greater presence in the US market, which accounts for just 14 per cent of sales, and on a range of products in the company's R &amp; D pipeline. The US effort will be assisted in late 1995, when the group will be free to market Genotropin, a drug jointly developed with Genentech, for the first time. Pharmacia's R &amp; D pipeline includes seven drugs in phase III of clinical trials and six in phase II. The most promising of the former group are Latanoprost (for the eye disorder glaucoma), Eltanolone (an anaesthetic), Factor VIII (a blood-clotting agent) and Cabergoline (for Parkinson's Disease.) Each of the drugs is expected to have annual sales of at least SKr500m. Some analysts grumble that Pharmacia hasn't got a billion-dollar blockbuster up its sleeve. 'We'll never get one. We're not even aiming for one,' says Mr Ekberg only half-jokingly. It is part of the niche strategy that the group avoids over-dependence on one or two drugs. The danger is that as competition intensifies in the big therapeutical areas, some of the world's leading drugs groups will begin to target the niche areas in which Pharmacia operates. Mr Ekberg, however, does not seem to be worried by this. 'These fairly limited areas might not be of core interest for the big companies. If you are a company with sales of SKr50bn looking to grow by five to 10 per cent, you must go for huge market areas.'</p>

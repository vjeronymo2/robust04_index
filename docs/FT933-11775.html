			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Nuclear Electric to shed 2,000 jobs NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned electricity generator, said yesterday it expects to shed up to 2,000 jobs, more than 15 per cent of the total, this financial year. It made the announcement as it disclosed an operating profit for 1992-93 of Pounds 661m. The staff reduction, the biggest annual employment fall proportionally since the company was formed three years ago, is being implemented as the company prepares for a government review of nuclear power which Nuclear Electric hopes will lead to privatisation. Mr John Collier, chairman, said any privatisation decision rested with the government. However, he said, the company's commercial success would soon mean that a move out of the state sector would be seen as feasible and desirable. Environmental groups said the results for last year were misleading. Mr Clive Bates of Greenpeace said that without Pounds 1.3bn from the nuclear levy paid by electricity consumers Nuclear Electric would have made a loss of Pounds 619m. Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear power stations in England and Wales, said the levy is to cover problems inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board, from which it was formed three years ago. However, Mr Bates insisted that part of the subsidy was being used to prop up the on-going business. Nuclear Electric plans to reduce staff to between 9,300 and 9,500 by next March, compared to 11,377 at the start of the financial year four months ago, and 14,164 when the company was formed in 1990. A staff reduction of 1,300 in the year to March 31 helped the company improve operating profits by 37 per cent from last year's Pounds 482m. Also influential was the radical improvement in the performance of advanced gas-cooled reactor stations which Nuclear Electric - and the CEGB before it  -have struggled for years to make perform at full efficiency. The company said yesterday all such stations were 100 per cent available for large parts of the winter. This enabled it to increase its share of the electricity market by 14 per cent to 55 terawatt (55m MW) hours and win 21.6 per cent of the electricity market in England and Wales, an improvement of 3 percentage points. Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said he expected his company to overtake PowerGen in 1996 as the second-largest generator. This would become possible after the Sizewell B power station starts producing electricity next year.</p>

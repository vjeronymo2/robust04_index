(Both Houses rise on Thursday for the summer recess, returning on Monday, October 19.) RESULTS DUE OWNERS ABROAD, the holiday company, is expected to announce half-year pre-tax losses on Thursday of between Pounds 23.5m and Pounds 26m, compared to Pounds 21.4m last time. The figures in themselves are of little interest. Holiday companies have large costs in the first half and receive most of their payments in the second. More eagerly awaited will be a statement on high season bookings and the dangers of continued discounting. A sluggish season could signal another price war. Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate run by Mr Greg Hutchings, is likely to report today an increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended April of around 15 per cent. The consensus forecast is Pounds 131m against Pounds 112m a year earlier. The US continues to provide the group's growth, with the latest period benefiting from a full-year contribution from Philips Industries, now operating under the umbrella of Tomkins Industries, the group's predominantly US arm. While the market is always interested in where Mr Hutchings' acquisition ambitions might take him next, he is unlikely to give many clues with the results. Ellis and Everard, the chemical processor and distributor reporting today, has recently suffered a minor profit downgrading to around Pounds 13m pre-tax for the year ended April from Pounds 17.5m a year earlier. The downturn reflects the recession and a likely exceptional charge. Wednesday is Cider Day, with Taunton Cider closing its share offer and H P Bulmer (Holdings) producing its annual figures. The latter will have the better of it. Pre-tax profits at Bulmer have risen to about Pounds 16m from Pounds 14.4m thanks to growth of the UK market. Although Taunton has enjoyed similar gains, its offer is unlikely to appeal right now to shareholders giving a wide berth to any new issue.</p>

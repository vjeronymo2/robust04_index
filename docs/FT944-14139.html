			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Irish police raid republican dissidents Nationwide raids by Irish police on terrorist targets at the weekend provide the first evidence of opposition in republican circles to the IRA ceasefire and the peace process. The raids by Gardai officers in four counties near the Ulster border resulted in the seizure of guns, ammunition, hand grenades and detonators belonging to a previously unknown group called the Irish National Republican Army. The operation, coming as it did on the eve of yesterday's meeting at Chequers between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr John Major, his UK counterpart, will underscore the Irish desire to accelerate the peace process and harness Sinn Fein and the broader republican movement to the peace process. The operation follows a meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, last Thursday. A Gardai statement said the raids were directed against 'breakaway factions such as Republican Sinn Fein and the Irish National Republican Army' which were involved in 'criminal and subversive activity'. Republican Sinn Fein is a splinter group established after a break with Sinn Fein in 1986, when Mr Adams abandoned the movement's policy of boycotting elections in the republic in a bid to raise local support. The RSF, with the more extremist IRA offshoot, the Irish National Liberation Army, has refused to endorse the August 31 decision to call a ceasefire. The weekend finds came as the Gardai reportedly withdrew border checkpoints at four locations in the Sligo Leitrim area in the wake of improvements in the security situation. In a related development British troops have reportedly reduced their presence in both Londonderry and Tyrone, two nationalist areas in the north. For the first time in more than 20 years a number of border crossings were reportedly unmanned at the weekend, a development which one unionist councillor yesterday condemned as a concession to the IRA.</p>

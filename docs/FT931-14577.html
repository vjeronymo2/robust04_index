			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Squabble over jobs sours transition: Republican resignations could lead to early chaos in the new administration ONE of the recurring sounds of the last two months has been that of President-elect Bill Clinton saying how fully he supports outgoing President George Bush in his handling of foreign policy challenges such as Somalia and Iraq. At home, however, there has been more friction between the departing Republicans and the arriving Democrats; in the days before Mr Bush hands over to his successor on Wednesday, relations between the two transition teams have turned sour over the question of jobs. A new president in the US always brings a turnover in federal staff that is unmatched in other western democracies, but the Clinton team has irritated the Bush officials handling the transition by asking for an unusually sweeping and immediate set of resig-nations. The White House has taken the Clinton request literally, and will put the resignations of about 650 top officials, whose replacements are subject to Senate confirmation, into effect at noon on Wednesday. This creates the potential for chaos, as Mr Clinton has fallen behind schedule in picking people to fill second- and third-tier jobs in his administration, and will have no one ready to pick up the reins of government. Mr Kevin Moley, deputy secretary of health and human services, told the New York Times that the resignations would make clear the Clinton team's lack of expertise. 'That's what the American people voted for on November 3. Now the consequences will come home to roost,' he said. At the same time, however, the Bush administration has decided to give Mr Clinton no help in rooting out lower-level political appointees, whose resignations have also been asked for. Despite Mr Clinton's early talk of including Republicans in his administration, it is clear there are too many Democrats looking for government jobs to keep more than a tiny handful of Bush appointees in office.</p>

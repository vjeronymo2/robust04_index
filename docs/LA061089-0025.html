			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY TROOPS FIRE ON BEIJING CROWDS  </P> <P> Seeing the televised excerpts of demonstrations at the various Communist  Chinese embassies and consulates throughout the United States, I noticed that  the demonstrators appear to be almost exclusively people of Chinese descent.  This disturbs me. Although the fight for freedom in Communist China is  primarily the responsibility of the Chinese people, it is a fight that should  be actively supported by all people who cherish freedom.  </P> <P> Personally, I believe that if freedom-loving Chinese citizens are willing to  take a bullet in the back at Tian An Men Square, the least I can do is  demonstrate in support of their cause in front of the Chinese consulate on a  safe street in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> On June 4th I was one of the relatively few Caucasians at the demonstration in  front of the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. A makeshift memorial was  assembled consisting of candles, flowers and a makeshift coffin. As I stood  near the coffin, a young man of Chinese descent, wearing a black shirt,  approached the memorial. On the back of his shirt was the color photograph that  appeared on the front page of the Los Angeles Times showing the Goddess of  Democracy statue in Tian An Men Square with the large picture of Mao in the  background. After leaving a flower near the candles, the young man placed a  small American flag on the coffin and quietly walked away.  </P> <P> My eyes were filled with tears.  </P> <P> ALLAN J.

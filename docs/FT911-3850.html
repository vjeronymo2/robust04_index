			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Retail sales The quirky nature of the latest UK retail sales figure leaves the markets in the dark on consumer spending just when guidance is most needed. Analysts were yesterday kicking themselves for forgetting that the last VAT rise in 1979 led to a near-7 per cent jump in sales on the month, followed by a 10 per cent plunge the month after. But the rise in the VAT rate this time is insignificant compared with last, especially since many retailers were prompt to announce that they were not passing it on. If there has been a real underlying recovery, it will be the more welcome after a run of seven months in which retail volume was down on the year before. It is also the more vexing to have to wait another month to find out. That apart, the prospects for a consumer-led recovery are as opaque as ever. It might be thought that real wage increases would be an important determinant. But it remains to be seen what will happen if workers settle for low nominal rises on the basis of plunging headline inflation, only to find that the stubbornness of core inflation leaves them worse off than before. The markets may have to settle for guidance on production rather than consumption. Next Tuesday's quarterly survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which ought to show the first signs of revival, will be the most closely scrutinised for a long while.</p>

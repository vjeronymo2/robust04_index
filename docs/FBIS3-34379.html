			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our sources in Iraq have monitored extensive  movements for tyrant Saddam's forces on the road linking the  Governorates of al-Najaf and Karbala' in central Iraq. Our  sources said in an urgent dispatch received today that dozens of  armored military units and tank battalions were seen taking up  positions along the road. Most of the tanks deployed by the  regime, our sources added, are sophisticated Russian-made T-72's  used by the Republican Guards.    Our sources cited well-informed sources that the deployment  came after antiregime popular moves in central Iraq, especially  in the Governorates of Karbala', al-Najaf, and al-Hillah. The  sources said the command of the deployed force was instructed to  hold military exercises and training for occupying imaginary  targets inside cities.    It should be noted that the Governorates of al-Najaf and  Karbala' were in the past few weeks the scene of heroic  operations carried out by the Islamic resistance forces. The  regime's centers, headquarters, and its security and party  services were attacked, and leaflets urging citizens to rebel  against and overthrow tyrant Saddam's regime were distributed.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOSTAGE RELEASE 'CERTAIN' DESPITE U.S. 'ARROGANCE'  </P> <P> The reputed mentor of kidnapers holding three American educators said today  that the release of a hostage is certain despite complications caused by the  United States' "arrogant . . . cowboy" behavior.  </P> <P> "The delay is certain, the complications are certain, but the release is also  certain," said Hussein Musawi.  </P> <P> Musawi, a Shiite Muslim, heads Islamic Amal, a faction within the pro-Iranian  Hezbollah that advocates strong links with Syria.  </P> <P> Asked when he expects the release to take place, Musawi said, "That depends on  how farsighted the Americans might become. So far, their behavior is arrogant  and one of cowboy mentality."  </P></p>

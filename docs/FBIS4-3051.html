			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zhejiang Provincial People's Government held the  Third Plenary Meeting yesterday afternoon. The meeting aims to  make plans for carrying out the current tasks in accordance with  the guiding spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth  Provincial People's Congress, which emphasizes the division of  labor and the importance of defining responsibility.    Governor Wan Xueyuan spoke at the meeting. After analyzing  the current situation and defining the major points of this  year's work, he put forward the following requirements for  carrying out the work.    First, continued efforts should be made to improve the  division of labor as well as the supervision and inspection  system. Each department should further divide its tasks and  assign such tasks to specific units and personnel. The work  responsibility system should be strengthened. Particularly  important is the establishment of the responsibility system for  major leading personnel. It is necessary to carry out routine  supervision and inspection, as well as routine feedback to  ensure work accomplishment. Such work should be integrated  with an evaluation conducted by each organization so as to  ensure each and every public functionary will conscientiously  work hard to achieve Zhejiang's goals and tasks.    Second, it is necessary to strengthen our investigation and  research in a bid to find out new situations and problems.  Leaders of each department should determine the topics of  their investigation and conduct research in the light of their  own work. They should focus their studies on special issues and  current trends. Particularly, they should study various new  situations and problems that appear during the course of reform.  In conducting such investigation and research, they should try  to achieve results applicable to the real work. During their  investigation and research, they should try to determine various  work models. In this way, they can push forward all kinds of  work by showing such exemplary models.    Third, it is necessary to tighten administrative disciplines  and ensure that such administrative disciplines are unified and  are universally observed. Many reform measures will be  introduced this year. During the course of reform, interests  involving many factors are bound to be readjusted.  Consequently, the interests of some localities and departments  will be affected to some extent. All departments concerned  should have a correct understanding and firmly foster an  awareness of the overall interest so as to ensure that partial  interests will be subservient to overall interests and current  interests will be subservient to long-term interests. They  should never use various excuses to delay the implementation of  the central authorities' policies and measures because of the  interests of their own departments or localities. Leaders at  all levels should conscientiously become a supporter for the  unification of administrative disciplines and ensure that all  policies and measures introduced by central and provincial  authorities will be carried out smoothly.    Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the unity among all  leaders so as form a great force in carrying out our tasks.  Great efforts should be made to maintain unity in our leading  groups. To achieve unison among all leading personnel, we  should pay more respect to others' opinions, have more  discussions with others, give more support to each other, and  advocate criticism and self-criticism. We should further uphold  and improve the responsibility system for administrative  leaders, have a rational division of labor, clearly define the  responsibility, and be more coordinated in our work. Meanwhile,  we should pay attention to ideological and political work among  our workers and staff personnel.    Wan Xueyan said: Building a socialist market economy is a  completely new subject to us. Cadres at all levels face a  tremendous task of learning this subject. In this year, we  should pay particular attention to theoretical studies,  particularly Volume Three of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping." We should try to have a profound understanding of  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  We should study well recently-promulgated economic laws and  regulations as well as economic policies and improve our  knowledge about market economy. [passage omitted]</p>

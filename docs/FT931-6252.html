			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moscow diamond exchange planned MR VALERY Rudakov, president of the Russian diamond producing company Almazy Rossii-Sakha, said yesterday he would soon set up an exchange in Moscow to sell rough diamonds to the country's diamond-cutting factories. He said this would reorganise on market principles the system whereby only the Committee for Precious Stones and Metals could sell rough stones to cutters and industrial diamond users. In future, both the exchange, which would start up in a month or two, and the committee would be allowed to sell rough stones, he said. One western expert said, however, that this only underlined the continuing rivalry between Mr Rudakov and Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, the head of the Committee for Precious Stones and Metals. The two men locked horns two years ago when they were respectively head of the old Soviet Glavalmazzoloto diamond and gold monopoly and the state depository Gokhran. 'Almazy Rossii-Sakha is supposed to have a monopoly to sell Russian rough to De Beers and factories. If the committee goes on selling, it will be an unusual situation,' said the western diamond expert. 'One side will have to win out in the end. While Rudakov is more savvy, Bychkov has good connections (in Russia).' Under an agreement with De Beers that expires in 1995, Russia can sell only 5 per cent of its rough diamonds on international markets, though De Beers claims that additional quantities are smuggled out. The committee wants to be in charge of selling this 5 per cent (designed to help Russia monitor the prices fetched by De Beers), while Mr Rudakov suggested that his exchange should carry out this function. The western expert said that if given a monopoly on sales, the exchange could prevent Russian diamond-cutters from undermining western markets. This is because they would have to bid for stones and De Beers could compete as well, driving up the price of rough stones, and preventing cheap Russian cut-diamonds from indirectly depressing the rough-stone market. Mr Rudakov said an additional exchange would be set up in Yakutsk, the capital of the autonomous republic which produces 98 per cent of Russia's diamonds, to sell diamonds to its fledgling diamond-cutting industry. So as to make more of its diamond wealth, Russia is trying to improve its inefficient diamond-cutting industry by bringing in foreign partners. For the moment, however, prospective foreign partners have to choose between whether to team up with Mr Rudakov or Mr Bychkov.</p>

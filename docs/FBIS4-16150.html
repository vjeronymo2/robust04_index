			<p>BFN     [Text] Problems of the Black Sea Fleet are going to be  resolved in the spirit of the Massandra protocol. A preliminary  understanding to this end was reached last Tuesday in Kiev at  the meeting of President Leonid Kravchuk and a Russian  delegation, which included among others ambassador Yuriy Dubinin  and the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral Feliks  Gromov. This was reported to the press on Wednesday in  Sevastopol by Admiral Gromov who came to the Crimea together  with Dubinin to study the situation involving the fleet.    Under the Massandra protocol the Ukrainian part of the fleet  should be surrendered to Russia as a form of payment for  Ukrainian debts for Russian fuel and energy supplies.    However, according to well-informed sources in the staff of  the fleet, the essence of the protocol is going to be slightly  changed. Russia will be getting only the part of the fleet  stationed in Sevastopol together with the infrastructure of the  city. Ukraine will keep the other naval facilities and ships  located and stationed in Ukraine and Crimea.    Dubinin described the meeting with Kravchuk as constructive.  He said that immediately after returning to Moscow the Russian  delegation is going to submit a detailed report about its visit  to Kiev and Sevastopol to the president and prime minister.  Dubinin and Gromov hope that the information about the meeting  with Kravchuk and the report as a whole will help ease the  tension caused by the latest incidents related to the fleet and  resolve the fleet problem as a whole.    Gromov regretted the refusal of the Ukrainian authorities to  permit the Russian delegation to Odessa where it intended to  sort out the difficulties. He stressed that it is quite  difficult to establish the truth and added that he did not see  anything wrong in the steps taken by the Cheleken ship. Last  Saturday the ship took navigation equipment from Odessa to  Sevastopol.    "That is why I think the conflict was to a certain extent  provoked by the actions of Ukrainian naval representatives who  came to detain the hydrographic vessel," Gromov said. According  to him, the seizure of the conservation ships in Odessa was a  direct violation of all agreements between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

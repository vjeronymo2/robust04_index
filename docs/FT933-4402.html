			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World reviews Pretoria policy GOVERNMENTS yesterday began re-examining their policies on South African sanctions after the agreement reached on Tuesday night to form a multi-racial transitional executive council. The US said the stage was set for the return to South Africa of foreign investors who would ultimately play a role in helping a democratically elected government deal with the legacies of apartheid. A State Department spokesman said Washington would take steps to remove its ban on support for IMF lending to Pretoria once the council was established. Remaining federal sanctions - relating to the sale and import of arms - are based on UN resolutions. 'It will be up to the UN to take action to rescind those resolutions,' he said. Australian and New Zealand officials were quoted as saying that Commonwealth nations were likely to move quickly, with one report saying an announcement on lifting remaining financial sanctions could come within 24 hours. Once the transitional council is in place, international financial institutions are expected to move quickly to bring their resources to bear. Mr Edward Jaycox, World Bank vice-president in charge of Africa, said recently his organisation had identified projects totalling about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 648m) aimed at redressing the imbalance in the supply of basic services.</p>

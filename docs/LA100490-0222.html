			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAYORS BELIEVE 30% JUMP IN FUEL COSTS WILL LEAD TO CUTS IN BASIC CITY SERVICES  </P> <P> Among the early American victims of the Persian Gulf crisis may be city  dwellers who suffer cuts in basic services because of the sharply rising cost  of gasoline, the U.S. Conference of Mayors said today.  </P> <P> A "snapshot" survey of 50 cities found the overall cost of fuel needed to run  police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, sanitation equipment and public  transportation jumped 30.6% during August and in some cities -- Cleveland;  Milwaukee; Tulsa, Okla., and Atlanta -- the rise was well over 50%.  </P> <P> Cleveland, for example, reported an 81.7% increase in gasoline costs in August.  Milwaukee reported a 62% rise, Tulsa had a 57% jump and Atlanta's was 50.7%.  </P> <P> Los Angeles experienced a 27% jump in gasoline costs.  </P> <P> According to the survey, all but one of the 50 cities said they experienced a  "substantial" increase in the cost of fuels in August. The only exception was  Austin, Tex., where officials said they expected the increase to hit in  September.  </P> <P> The survey found three out of four mayors saying they believe the money to pay  for the cost increases will come by cutting other areas of the budget.  Officials from six cities said they will both cut services and increase local  revenues -- meaning higher taxes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 26 (AFP) -- Twelve percent of French  voters would back a "Sarajevo" list of candidates protesting  against Western policy over Bosnia if the group carries out its  threat to stand in next month's European elections, a poll  showed.    The survey by pollsters IPSOS showed 12 percent would back  the "Europe begins at Sarajevo" list in the June 12 elections to  the European parliament. The poll is to be published in the  Saturday edition of the weekly LE POINT.    French intellectuals led by journalist and writer  Bernard-Henri Levy have warned they will present the Sarajevo  list if the political establishment fails to embark on a  "ethical about-face" to place the Bosnian capital "at the heart  of Europe."    According to the survey, all major French parties barring  the  extreme right National Front would lose votes if the threat is  carried out.    The group says five conditions must be fulfilled if the  "Sarajevo" candidates are to back down prior to the May 27  closing date for registrations.    These include lifting the arms embargo to former Yugoslavia  in favour of Bosnian Government forces -- which both France and  Britain said Thursday they opposed -- and withdrawing a European  plan earmarking 51 percent of the republic for the new  Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs.    The IPSOS survey was carried out between May 19 and 24 among  a representative sample of 1,000 French voters.</p>

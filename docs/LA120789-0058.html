			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BOOKSHELF: NO EASY ANSWERS IN ELDERLY CARE  </P> <P> Eighty-Five Plus: The Oldest Old by Sally Bould, Beverly Sanbourn and Laura  Reif (Wadsworth Publishing Co.: $16; paper).  </P> <P> Indeed, as the authors state, "People who reach 90 are different."  Gerontologists, engaged in different areas of specialization, distinguish  between the "young old" (67-74), "old old" (74-85) and "oldest old."  </P> <P> People in the 85-plus group have achieved extreme longevity, which often proves  a mixed blessing. Unlike several Scandinavian countries whose "oldest old"  outnumber America's, we lack a strong family network and an adequate medical  delivery system.  </P> <P> Analyzing different ways the rich and poor are treated (there's a passage about  the Duchess of Windsor, who died at 89 in a nursing facility, contrasted with  an ordinary woman on Medicaid), the authors say middle-class people frequently  must "spend down" their assets, often becoming impoverished.  </P> <P> There are no easy answers, but there are sensible beginnings to the problem,  say the authors, utilizing both private and governmental resources. In the  meantime, those responsible for nonagenarians must manage their finances  skillfully, make sure physical needs are met and provide dignified,  compassionate care "as long as needed."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with OPEC Secretary General Dr. Ahmed </F> Subroto by Hugo Pedersen in Vienna; date not given]    [Excerpt] Vienna -- He knows very well that Norway has  invested billions in oil production and that we are dependent on  the income from this money being in some way in proportion. If  not, investment will decrease and access to new oil will  disappear. But whether he likes Norway's position is a  different matter.    "We see that the burden of cuts in production is great, for  Norway too. This is not what OPEC primarily wants, nor do we  accept responsibility for the fact that the price of oil is low.  However, we would like to cooperate with oil exporters outside  OPEC to maintain a stable oil price at a level which is  acceptable both to producers and consumers," [OPEC Secretary  General Ahmed] Subroto told AFTENPOSTEN.    We met the popular secretary general at OPEC's headquarters  in Vienna, a little less then a month before he is to leave his  post. This will happen on 15 June, after six years as head of  the secretariat. But if the members of OPEC want it, Dr.  Subroto is ready for another term as secretary general. Next  week Subroto will visit Stavanager and deliver an address to the  World Petroleum Conference (WPC 94).    "If OPEC wants me to, I would be glad to continue," he said.  And this decision will be made at the OPEC meeting in Vienna on  15 June. Both Venezuela and Iran have candidates for the  secretary general post, but there is every indication that, at  present, Subroto is the only candidate on whom the 12 member  nations can agree, even though it could only be for a rather  short period. The sociable 65-year-old from Indonesia is a  well-respected secretary general whose qualities as a diplomat  have greatly helped to keep OPEC together.    At a time of record-low oil prices and great internal  disagreement surrounding the correct methods to adopt, the rest  of the world has formed the impression that OPEC is in the grip  of its worst crisis.    "The question being asked is how to define the word  `crisis.'  It is no crisis for OPEC that we are unable to control the price  of oil. We want a stable oil price and see nothing to be gained  from the price swinging out of control. It is only those active  on the commodities markets who make money out of such swings.  Today OPEC is the only organization in the world which  coordinates member nations' energy policy. We try to make sure  of a stable income from oil without setting concrete goals about  how high the oil price should be. If we look at members'  incomes and the development of oil prices, there can be no doubt  that over time income would have been less if OPEC had not  protected member countries' interests," Subroto said.    He definitely believes that the organization has a mission  and pointed out that OPEC is one of the most reliable suppliers  of oil, in both the short and long terms. Even during the Gulf  war, when oil production from the two major member countries  Iraq and Kuwait disappeared, OPEC succeeded in maintaining oil  supplies.    Iraq's reentry to the oil market will sooner or later be one  of OPEC's biggest headaches. As soon as UN sanctions against  Iraq's oil exports are lifted, the organization will be faced  with a major problem. This will mean that there will be around  a further 500,000 barrels of oil on the market -- oil for which  there is no room on today's market. This is great threat to a  positive price development.    "Iraq is a member of OPEC on a par with other members, and  what we have said is that when the UN sanctions are lifted OPEC  must meet in order to find room for Iraq's oil, too. With the  present production ceiling there is no room for Iraq, and either  the other countries will have to reduce their oil production or  we will have to find a solution where Iraqi oil production will  gradually meet increased demand on a world basis," he said.    Even though Subroto talks warmly about stable oil prices,  there are countries among OPEC members who always want to force  up prices as high as possible. The price hawks, represented by  countries like Libya, Algeria, and Nigeria, want high prices and  the biggest possible income in the shortest possible time.  Against them stands the largest OPEC member, Saudi Arabia, with  oil reserves which will last for 130 years to come. This  country takes a longer-term view and wants a price that remains  as calm as possible. The Saudi Arabians dominate OPEC, and as a  rule Oil Minister Hisham Nazir gets things the way King Fahd has  told him they should be. However, there is no getting away from  the fact that the low prices of the last few years have put  great pressure on the OPEC countries' budgets which are  dominated currently by high foreign debt.    "The budget cuts will go on, in 1994 too, even though so far  the price of oil has increased by $3 per barrel. We do not know  what the future will bring. Even though there are positive  signs, our production quota of 24.5 million barrels of oil a day  will be adhered to," Subroto said.    Nor is he worried by Saudi Arabia's dominant role in the  organization.    "In OPEC we have lived with each other for 34 years, and we  will probably be able to continue to live together. Also, it is  not only in OPEC that we see the mixture of small and big. Just  look at the OECD. The problems are the same," Subroto said.    The development of oil prices in recent years has been  worrying, and the markets fear that the price rise of the last  few months will tempt OPEC to exceed its production quotas  again. For it is OPEC which is being given the glory for the  price increase, thanks to the fact that member countries have  finally shown some discipline with regard to the quotas. But  OPEC still has spare capacity -- probably around 3 million  barrels a day -- which could ruin oil prices completely.    In this situation is it often Dr. Subroto's silken diplomacy  which saves the day when member countries' individual interests  upset negotiations.    "I am not sure how much of a diplomat I actually am, but I  often have to be the link between the parties which difficulties  talking to each other at OPEC negotiations. Once arguments and  problems have been explained to the parties involved, and there  has been a new exchange of views, things normally resolve  themselves for the best for all parties."    Subroto is also the man who has to tackle a baying corps of  press and analysts at every OPEC meeting. He does so on the  whole with charm and humor, even though his role as information  provider can often be hopeless. In the oil industry every piece  of news has an effect on prices, and the battle to get hold of  news which could affect oil prices goes to extremes. It has  actually happened that during extremely difficult negotiations  with no great measure of agreement Subroto has had to open a  press conference with the words: "I have nothing to tell you;  have you any questions?"    Oil price movements also attract those who play the markets  who, according to Subroto, are the only ones who make money from  the fact that oil prices move up and down dramatically. He is  worried by the power of the markets over the price of oil. The  speculators are chiefly active in the unpredictable futures  market, precisely because of the movement and the chance of a  profit. Subroto believes that the spot market will take over a  larger share of the trade in oil -- something which will reduce  the influence on prices of the paper markets.    "The markets do not care whether the price of oil is high or  low, as long as it goes up and down. We will probably have to  live with these speculators, but a stable and a more predictable  market would limit their influence." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  troops on the northern border and in the security zone have been  placed on alert, and Israel is closely following what is  happening in the north.    Military and political sources say that a trend of  escalating  terror attacks has persisted since the beginning of the dialogue  with the PLO. In 1993, the number of terror attacks in Lebanon  doubled, the number of infiltration attempts increased  considerably, and the organizations opposed to the peace process  have exhibited a higher motivation to infiltrate into Israel and  carry out attacks. The sources say Syria will continue to use  Hizballah, as it has in previous years, according to its  political needs.</p>

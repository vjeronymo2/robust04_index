			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Archer ordered shares in prohibited period Directors of Anglia Television were warned in writing almost two years ago that neither they nor their spouses should ever deal in the company's shares from the end of its financial year of December 31 to the date of publication of its financial results, normally mid-March. In mid-January this year Lord Archer, best selling author and Conservative politician, whose wife is an Anglia director, placed orders to buy 50,000 Anglia shares. The share orders have been the subject of a Department of Trade and Industry investigation into alleged insider dealing. The disclosure that no Anglia director or spouse should have dealt in the first two months of any year is contained in formal rules for share dealings by 'officers' adopted by the television company's board on September 23 1992. It explicitly prohibits share dealings by directors and their spouses during the 'close period'. Anglia directors were asked to inform their spouses of the new dealing rules. One of Lady Archer's fellow directors said that she was 'punctilious', and always followed company instructions to the letter. The rules are based partly on the London Stock Exchange's Yellow Book and partly on company law. All directors were required to sign a copy of the rules indicating that they would 'act in accordance with them'. A lawyer said yesterday that the definition of 'dealing' in the context of Anglia's rules was ambiguous. Lord Archer placed the share orders on behalf of an acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib, so in that sense he may not have 'dealt' in the strictest sense. However, he did have an 'interest' in the transaction, because the stockbroking firm which received the order, Charles Stanley, was only prepared to carry it out because of its knowledge of Lord Archer. Charles Stanley had never before heard of Mr Saib and had no knowledge of whether he had sufficient cash to pay the Pounds 245,000 needed to buy the 50,000 shares. It carried out the deal because it believed Lord Archer would cover the payment. Mr David Howard, Charles Stanley's managing director, said it is well established in contract law that as 'agent' for the deal, Lord Archer would have been liable in this sense. It also emerged yesterday that Charles Stanley had been advised, a few days before the official payment date in February this year, by its solicitor not to pay the Pounds 77,219.62 profit on the Anglia share transactions. There was a risk, according to the solicitor, that Charles Stanley could face a court case if the market makers who sold the shares to Mr Saib via the broker sued on the basis that the purchaser might have benefited from inside information. Anglia's rules also say there should be no dealings in Anglia shares by directors, their spouses or other 'connected' persons when the directors are 'in possession of information likely, upon publication, to affect the market price of those securities'.

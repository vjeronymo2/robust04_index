			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The president of the Senate, Senator Firmin  Jean-Louis, this week issued a statement condemning the  installation of Justice Emile Jonassaint as Haitian president.  Here is this statement:    On 11 May, a tragic new scene was played at the Haitian  parliament with the alleged appointment of Justice Emile  Jonassaint as provisional president of Haiti. We are frankly  surprised that Attorney Jonassaint, who was a senator of the  Republic, judge of the highest judicial authority of the  country, and president of the 1987 Constituent Assembly, agreed  to be a party to such a joke by shouldering the responsibility  for such a crude violation of the same Constitution [of 1987],  writes Firmin Jean-Louis.    As president of the National Assembly, we make a point of  drawing the attention of the entire nation and the international  community in general to the fact that this new abuse of  authority is assumed by only five out of 17 senators of the  normalized Senate and by eight senators elected in the contested  18 January 1993 elections who are awaiting the verdict of the  arbitration committee provided for in the New York pact.    As of that moment, as an institution which has rules  governing its functioning and a defined procedure, the Haitian  parliament is not bound by this new political adventure which  has no grandeur and no future. It is not a parliamentary act.  Consequently, it is a usurpation of power and must be considered  as such, Jean-Louis says. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Move to attract foreign companies to Ulster More than 400 international companies are being invited to the International Investment Forum on Northern Ireland, to be opened by Mr John Major in Belfast on December 13. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, is expected to address the conference, which is aimed at boosting the number of foreign companies investing in the province as part of the process of reviving its economy in the wake of IRA and Loyalist ceasefires. Tackling Northern Ireland's endemic high unemployment is seen as an important part of the peace process. The province's unemployment rate - 12.7 per cent - remains about 3 percentage points higher than the national average. Unemployment is particularly high among males in city centres such as Belfast and Derry. The Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland says the province has enjoyed one of its best years for foreign investment. In the 12 months to March 1994 new investment totalled Pounds 505m, of which Pounds 260m was new foreign inward investment. The inward investment created 2,300 new jobs net. The investment figure for this year should be higher because of the controversial Hualon project from Taiwan. The IDB believes that the province's violent image has deterred potential investors. The conference will be told that a peaceful Northern Ireland holds considerable attractions for foreign investors - with a highly skilled workforce based on engineering industries and wage levels 16 per cent lower than those in mainland Britain. The IDB says land and property is considerably cheaper than in Great Britain. It is able to offer a package of incentives which can include 50 per cent of start-up costs. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, is expected to receive a rapturous reception from the 600 delegates to the party's 24th annual conference over the weekend. His keynote speech is expected to cover the future of the peace process in the next 12 months. Opening the conference at Cookstown, Co Tyrone, yesterday, Mr Mark Dirkan, the party chairman, reiterated the SDLP demand for a dual referendum on both sides of the Irish border on any political agreement reached about the future of Northern Ireland.</p>

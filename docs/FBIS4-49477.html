			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Lu's Visit Need Not Be a Waste"] </F>   [Text] Let's face it, the visit to Hong Kong by Lu Ping,  director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, has been  a public relations disaster. We can all live with public  relations disasters, but it is more difficult to live with the  underlying cause of the problem.    There are no prizes for identifying the source of this  problem. It lies in the paralysis of leadership which afflicts  China as the leaders of the Communist Party mount their morbid  deathbed watch over paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.    In these circumstances no one aspiring to high office in  China dares put a toe out of place. They are all waiting and  watching to see what will happen in the post-Deng era. Not  surprisingly, Lu Ping is also affected by this climate of  uncertainty and probably assumes that a low profile is the only  profile worth adopting.    Chinese bureaucrats are rarely punished for doing nothing,  but any positive action carries the risk of retribution. Were  Lu to take the relatively bold step of publicly restoring  relations with Governor Chris Patten, he may well expose himself  to all manner of criticism. Far safer is the option of never  venturing beyond the walls of Chinese-owned premises and never  meeting anyone likely to say anything critical about Chinese  government policy.    We have a sneaking suspicion this must be extremely  frustrating for an intelligent man like Lu Ping, who is well  aware of the limitations of his current position but is  seemingly incapable of doing anything about it. It is too much  to expect Lu to suddenly perform an about-face and trot along to  Government House for tea, biscuits and a chat with the Governor.  Even less likely is the prospect of a quick yum cha [tea and  dim sum] with Martin Lee and his fellow democrats.    Yet there is an opportunity to snatch victory from the jaws  of defeat. Lu can use his presence in Hong Kong to work behind  the scenes and give a much-needed kick up the backside to the  many matters stuck in the logjam of stalled Sino-British  negotiations.    Where to start? There is so much to be done. Maybe it would  be best to focus on the obvious. Shrieking out loud is the need  for an agreement on financing for the new airport. This could  literally be settled in a day of talks, given goodwill on both  sides and bearing in mind the issue has been so comprehensively  discussed. Neither side has an excuse for holding out for more  information.    Then there is the equally pressing matter of the ninth  container terminal which appears to have retreated entirely from  the public view.    Also on the wish list of things which need to be done  urgently are arrangements for the future of the civil service.  There is nothing so demoralising as uncertainty. So, if the  Special Administrative Region wishes to inherit a demoralised  civil service, they are doing everything in their power to  guarantee such an eventuality.    Uncertainty also hangs heavily over the future of the legal  system, given the lack of agreement on the formation of the  Court of Final Appeal. Everyone says Hong Kong's legal system  underpins the stability of our society. This, then, is clearly  a matter of some importance and should not be allowed to fester.    Aside from specific things which need to be done, the very  least Lu can do is ensure the orderly resumption of regular  meetings between representatives of the Chinese and British  governments. The brutal fact of the matter is that for the past  five years these meetings have been erratic and largely  unproductive.    In the unlikely event that Lu could secure progress on all  these fronts, he would be doing no more than ensuring the  progress of business as usual. In other words, these are modest  aspirations, delivered in circumstances where even modest  expectations remain unfulfilled.    Patten, for his part, has something important to contribute  to the process of removing the logjam. He should immediately  lift the ban on civil servants having dealings with China's  Preliminary Working Committee. This may well be emerging as a  pale imitation of a shadow government and may also be designed  to undermine the authority of the current administration, but it  is a reality in Hong Kong's emerging power structure. No harm  can be done by recognising this and providing its members with  full access to the civil service. Once the ban is removed China  will be deprived of yet another excuse for not re-establishing  normal relations with the Hong Kong government.    Waiting two years before returning to Hong Kong, Lu Ping has  only himself to blame for creating exaggerated expectations of  what his visit can achieve. Were he to be a regular visitor to  the territory, his presence would cause less of a stir. It  would be so easy to throw away every opportunity to make  progress on the arrangements for Hong Kong's transfer to Chinese  sovereignty. It would come as more than just a pleasant  surprise if the temptation to throw away yet another opportunity  was resisted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Harbin, June 22 (XINHUA) -- China has launched a new  move to auction off more wasteland to farmers in an effort to  quicken the building of water and soil conservation projects and  help farmers achieve greater economic gains.    To date, the use right of a total of 500,000 hectares of  wasteland in north China's Shanxi, Shaanxi and Heilongjiang  Provinces had been sold to farmers, according to a national  wastelands auction held in Mudanjiang city of northeast China's  Heilongjiang Province.    China has more than 300 million hectares of wasteland  suffering from serious water loss and soil erosion, over ten  percent of which (about 30 million hectares) can be developed.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng sent a message, hailing the  opening ceremony of the auction, saying the new move is an  extension of China's household contract responsibility system,  with remuneration linked to output, that started in rural areas  in the late 1970s.    It is a new step, under the new market economic conditions,  to initiate a mass movement to tackle soil erosion, he said.    According to the state councillor, the right of development  and use of wastelands sold legally allows farmers to explore and  use the land for a period of 50 to 100 years. It can be  inherited and transferred, he said.    The move helps to bring into full play the initiative of  local peasants to control water loss and soil erosion and tap  natural resources and further develop agricultural production,  Chen said.    He added, it also opens a new way for the surplus labor  force  in the rural areas to find jobs and helps raise necessary funds  for the country's water conservation projects.    Due to various historical reasons, he said, soil erosion in  China is still serious. It is of great significance to tackle  the problem by mobilizing the masses of people, he said.    He urged governments at all levels to understand and carry  out the policy in spirit and to the letter and in the light of  the real situation in each locality.    According to the meeting, the main bidders for the use right  of large tracts of wasteland are farmers, but personnel from  governmental bodies, workers and staff members from state-owned  and private enterprises, as well as overseas business people,  are also encouraged to participate.    Wasteland that suffer from serious soil erosion, including  barren mountains, valleys, hills, rivers and streams, will be  given priority in the sales.    Money raised will be used solely as a special fund in  tackling soil erosion problems in other areas.    More than one hundred representatives from the governmental  water and soil conservation departments at all levels across the  country are taking part in the meeting.</p>

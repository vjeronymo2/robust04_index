			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Zale seeks court protection ZALE CORPORATION, the world's largest jewellery retailer with around 2,000 outlets in the US, last night decided to seek protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. In doing so, the company was acceding to an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed by some of its bondholders in the Texas courts on January 1. The bondholders' action followed an interest payment default by Zale on certain junk bonds. Zale had a set 'window' in which to respond to the petition, and this expired yesterday. Zale had suggested that it would prefer to negotiate a financial restructuring outside the bankruptcy courts, although some analysts believed that it proposed to use the brief 'pre-packaged bankruptcy' mechanism to implement this. Last night, it reiterated its belief that the Chapter 11 filing was 'regrettable'. However, as part of yesterday's package, Zale will also get up to Dollars 510m (Pounds 281.7m) of debtor-in-possession working capital and accounts receivable financing from Chemical Bank. The funding is for a proposed two-year term, and subject to bankruptcy court approval. DIP financing is often used in bankruptcy situations, with lenders ranking at the forefront of the repayment queue. A few days before the bondholders' bankruptcy petition was filed, Zale outlined a reorganisation scheme which involved the closure of 400 stores and a 'downsizing and cost reduction' plan at its headquarters. That, said the company, was going ahead as planned, with 300 stores already closed. The heavily-indebted retailer is based in Dallas, although it is owned jointly by Peoples Jewellers in Toronto and Zurich-based Swarovski International Holding - a vehicle for the wealthy Austrian Swarovski family. Part of the loss-making group's problems stem from hefty debts taken on when the company was acquired by Peoples and Swarovski in 1986, and then again when Zale bought out the rival Gordon jewellery chain in the late-1980s. The group has also blamed the recession, and its impact on the jewellery market in particular, for its current troubles. Debts of Zale, and other subsidiaries involved in the filing, are put at around Dollars 1.45bn. Around Dollars 200m is owned to trade creditors, Dollars 300m to banks, and Dollars 950m to bondholders.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: European exchanges map out futures expansion AS competition between futures exchanges intensifies, European exchanges are hurriedly drawing up plans for international expansion. Potential routes involve forging links with other exchanges; joining Globex, the international after-hours trading system jointly developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters; or pushing ahead with the development or expansion of rival systems. So far, the Matif, the Paris-based exchange, is the only European exchange to have signed up to join Globex. Its French bond futures will start trading on the system in the first quarter of next year. The two European exchanges closest to joining Globex are the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) and the Deutsche Terminborse, the German screen-based exchange. However, both exchanges point out that negotiations are still at a preliminary stage. 'We put the terms under which we would join to the CBOT a month ago,' said Mr Michael Jenkins, Liffe's chief executive, 'but we have not taken it any further.' However, discussions will be held next week in Chicago with further talks early next month. The main stumbling block is likely to be the length of Liffe's initial commitment to the system: Liffe wants a short-notice period, Globex is asking for a 20-year commitment. 'One of our concerns is that the ultimate control of all the major issues rests with the CBOT and the CME,' said Mr Jenkins. 'Although this may not be a problem, we would like to have a short contract in the early stages, until we understand quite how their agreement with Globex works.' Liffe seems to be softening its stance on its earlier objections to the issue of exclusivity. Under Globex rules, if a contract commands more than half the volume in a particular underlying market, no rival contract can be listed on the exchange. Liffe would prefer contracts to be freely listed but seems to have given up the struggle on this issue. 'I do not think there are a lot of hard issues to be dealt with,' said Mr Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex. In addition, Liffe has to decide the future of its own APT after-hours trading system, which will be discussed at a board meeting today. There have been suggestions that the system could be developed, but no decision has yet been taken. Globex, on the other hand, is not yet a robust suitor. The three-month-old system's volume has reached only about 2,500 contracts per day, with only about 230 terminals in place and another 60 on order. Most of those terminals are in the US, although, significantly, the 30 Globex machines in London are the highest volume producers in the system. The partnership of the world's three largest futures exchanges would lend muscle to Globex. Liffe's European interest rate contracts, particularly bund futures, would complement the foreign currency and US Treasury and Eurodollar instruments already listed on Globex. More importantly, it would plant more traders and terminals across the European time zone, extending the reach of the futures products on both sides of the Atlantic. Competitive factors are a primary reason the exchanges are talking now. Liffe currently has about 60 per cent of the German bund futures market, but cannot ignore its rival at the DTB. Listing the Liffe bund on Globex would throw trading open to the US. But the DTB is also in negotiations with Globex, and is also considering links, outside Globex, with the CBOT, or with other exchanges. 'We've got our feelers out,' said a DTB official. The DTB is also planning to expand internationally by establishing trading terminals throughout Europe. The exchange hopes to have terminals in London during the first half of next year. Meanwhile, smaller European exchanges are joining together to spread their distribution. The European Options Exchange in the Netherlands, OM Group, with exchanges in Stockholm and London, and Switzerland's Soffex signed a co-operation agreement in May. The alliance, known as First European Exchanges (FEX) was expanded by the admission of Otob, the Austrian exchange, last month. They plan to offer local access to derivative financial products developed in other countries.</p>

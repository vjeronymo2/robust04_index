			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Observer: Lascivious drones The jibe 'No sex, please: we're British' may look to be confirmed by the Automobile Association's survey which shows that the Brits are no longer seduced by sexy car ads. They're now far more turned on by things like mechanical reliability and good all-round vision. But lust hasn't entirely lost its commercial pull - or so hopes lutenist Anthony Rooley, at least, who is pressing it into service in launching a record label specialising in early music. Having set up the Consort of Musicke 23 years ago, he is seeking backers under the tax-relieving Business Expansion Scheme for a new record-producing company with the self-effacing name of Musica Oscura. It should nevertheless stand out clearly among most of the other ventures formed under the scheme, which is due for to be scrapped at the end of next year because it had largely degenerated into a tax-break for private landlords. The Pounds 350,000 the company hopes to raise will go towards 10 new discs of works by composers such as Cipriano De Rore and Luca Marenzio. But while their names seem unlikely to draw the millions, Musica Oscura is certainly doing all it can to breathe fire into their compositions. Take for instance its sleeve notes for the disc featuring Marenzio, which proclaim: 'Only classical Indian music, with its lascivious drones and ululating melodies, can rival the renaissance madrigal in creating wanton bliss. Luca Marenzio is one of the recognised gurus of this sensual art-form, perhaps the greatest - from the lofty Petrarchan conceit addressed to the ineffable and unattainable Laura to the highly erotic world of post Guarini love poetry. . . .' Not to mention 40 per cent tax relief, to boot.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ALGERIAN HIJACKS JET, SURRENDERS  </P> <P> An Algerian expelled from France hijacked an Air France jet with more than 100  people aboard today by threatening to blow up the plane over the Mediterranean,  but he was armed only with soap and toilet water and surrendered peacefully.  </P> <P> The hijacker, a 30-year-old shopkeeper identified as Said Jamel, stepped off  the Airbus at Algiers airport brandishing a plastic bag holding the soap and a  bottle of cologne, to give an impromptu Tarmac news conference.  </P> <P> Shortly before being arrested, he told assembled journalists that he had wanted  to draw attention to the situation in Palestine and war-torn Lebanon. France  has warships off Lebanon to protect its citizens there.  </P> <P> Jamel, described by French radio as "mentally deranged," had been placed on the  flight by French police at Paris' Orly airport after being expelled from France  for "disorderly conduct," a Paris airport source said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HIGHER HANGAR RENTS IN HAWTHORNE DRAW FIRE FROM PILOTS  </P> <P> The Hawthorne Aircraft Owners and Pilot Assn. this week strongly criticized the  City Council for increasing hangar rental fees at the airport and violating a  1985 agreement to set the fees.  </P> <P> In August, the Hawthorne City Council voted to increase numerous municipal fees  -- including hangar rental fees -- to help balance the city's budget deficit.  Hangar fees at Hawthorne Municipal Airport, which had been raised in July to  $210 per month, were raised again to $280 last month.  </P> <P> Emil Michaels, president of the 160-member pilots association, told the council  Monday night that the city made an agreement with the pilots in 1985 to  increase rental fees gradually from $125 per month to $200 over a four-year  period and then tie future increases to the consumer price index. The four-year  period ended in July, and the index increased the fee to $210.  </P> <P> Michaels, who was joined by about 20 members of the association in City Hall on  Monday, told the council that the additional $70 increase violated the  agreement and asked that it be rescinded. He said the association would discuss  an increase with the city.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert asked the staff members to meet with the  association to study a fee increase that would be acceptable to both the city  and the association. The City Council will reconsider the matter within the  next month, City Manager Kenneth Jue said.  </P> <P> In an interview after the meeting, Airport Administrator Robert Trimborn  acknowledged that the city had broken its agreement with the pilots  association, but said the council needed to increase the hangar fees to help  reduce the budget deficit.  </P> <P> To offset a $2.5-million deficit in the city's 1989-90 budget and avert as many  as 32 layoffs, the council voted last month to increase fees in numerous  departments, including building, planning, engineering, police, airport and  recreation.  </P> <P> City officials say the deficit is primarily due to a projected shortfall of  $1.1 million in sales tax revenues and paramedic fees in the 1988-89 fiscal  year. An equal shortfall is expected for 1989-90, the officials say.  </P> <P> The new fees will raise nearly $800,000 annually, with $50,000 coming from the  new hangar rental fees, according to city officials. The remainder of the  deficit will be made up by personnel cutbacks, new trash collection fees, the  repayment of a city loan to build the Hawthorne Plaza shopping center and the  collection of delinquent sales taxes from Northrop Corp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fees in the Middle Range  </P> <P> Trimborn said that even with the recent increase, hangar rental fees in  Hawthorne are in the middle range for area airports. The monthly rental fees  for hangars at 10 municipal airports are between $201 and $397, he said, citing  a 1987 state Department of Transportation study.  </P> <P> Michaels said the fees at the Hawthorne airport, however, should be lower  because the hangars are dilapidated and need substantial improvements.  </P> <P> Trimborn said the city had postponed repairing the hangars because of its  financial problems.  </P> <P> Michaels said his group was concerned because the association was appointed in  1985 to be the city's unofficial airport advisory committee, and the city did  not notify the association before increasing the hangar fees.  </P> <P> "If there is something that should be discussed, we are all willing to talk,"  said Chuck Walker, a member of the association and pilot for 26 years.  </P> <P> Trimborn said the city did not notify the association before increasing the  fees because of the immediate need to approve the city budget and address the  city's financial problems.  </P></p>

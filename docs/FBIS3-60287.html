			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Filimonov under the rubric "Ecology": </F> "Underwater `Groundskeepers' Promise Us an Opportunity To Rest  Easy"]    [Text] It was resolved at a meeting of an  interdepartmental commission for ecological safety to embark on  preservation of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine, which rests  at the bottom of the North Sea.    At the outset there were several drafts. Over a period of  three years a 30-volume work submitted by the Committee for  Special Underwater Projects of the Government of Russia was  selected on a competitive basis. More than 40 organizations took  part in developing it. Specialists rejected the proposed  scenarios for raising the Komsomolets. The reactor of the  nuclear vessel is shut down and does not pose any danger. In  addition, the gas which ensures a certain pressure level inside  the reactor is subject to considerable outside pressure at a  depth of 1,700 meters. If the Komsomolets is raised, the  existing equilibrium will be disturbed. The danger is real that  gas will force out a kind of "radioactive broth" which will  cause pollution of the sea. This was not the least important  reason why the project to seal two torpedoes with warheads which  pose the greatest danger was preferred.    A special compound made of crab shells will be pumped into  the unsealed torpedo tubes. Tengiz Borisov, one of the authors  of the draft and the chairman of the Committee for Underwater  Projects, is convinced that the use of such unique technology  will guarantee the preservation of the submarine for 30 to 50  years. The interdepartmental commission which is a part of the  Security Council of Russia has confirmed the proposed draft.  Underwater sealing work will begin in the summer of next year.  Otherwise, the specialists expect leaching of the products of  plutonium corrosion, a massive discharge of radioactive  elements, and pollution of the natural environment for 600-700  years by the end of 1994. Only domestic organizations are to be  used for work. The St. Petersburg TsKB [Central Design Bureau]  Rubin, the St. Petersburg Technology Institute, and a number of  defense enterprises act as leading developers.    In the words of Tengiz Borisov, the main task of the  committee is to conduct continuous ecological monitoring of  Russian coastal waters. In the summer, the area of Novaya Zemlya  where nuclear waste was actively dumped in the 1960's and 1970's  was surveyed for the first time. The committee is also working  vigorously on the use of the preservation technology to  neutralize a tremendous amount of chemical ordnance in the  Baltic Sea which was dumped by allied troops after World War II.    As the chairman says, the Committee for Underwater Projects  which was created a year ago is called upon to play the role of  a "groundskeeper" of the depths of the sea. Some 17,500  containers with radioactive waste were dumped in the northern  seas of Russia, 6,000 containers in the Far East. Eight nuclear  reactors and two nuclear submarines rest in the Gulf of Biscay  and near Cuban shores. The committee has offered a unique, just  developed technology for the purification of liquid nuclear  waste for joint use with the Japanese and South Koreans. If this  technology is implemented, it will be possible to ultimately  abandon the dumping of poisonous waste into the water as early  as the coming year.</p>

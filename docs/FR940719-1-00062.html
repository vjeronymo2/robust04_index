			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the provisions of paragraph (f) the operator is required to specify the action that will be taken to protect miners from the hazards of spontaneous combustion. This requirement would be triggered if the mine has a demonstrated history of spontaneous combustion, or, if an evaluation of the susceptibility of the coal seam to spontaneous combustion leads to a mine operator determination that a bleeder system should not be used. In these cases the approved ventilation plan must specify the methods that the operator will use to control spontaneous combustion, as well as accumulations of methane-air mixtures and other gases, dusts, and fumes in the worked-out area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During informational meetings and through the application of this standard, the Agency has become aware that the conditions under which air flow can be adjusted within a bleeder system is the subject of some concern. The following discussion is intended to address this concern and clarify the Agency's position. When adjustments to air flow in the bleeder entries are needed to assure proper functioning of the system, these adjustments would be made in accordance with &sect;75.324, Intentional changes in the ventilation system. As explained in the preamble discussion of existing &sect;75.324, when the adjustment in the bleeder system results in a change in direction of the air in the bleeder entry, this is a change in ventilation that could materially affect the safety or health of miners, and the precautions of &sect;75.324 apply. As addressed under &sect;75.324, other changes to air flow in the bleeder entry may also materially affect the safety or health of miners, and the precautions of &sect;75.324 would apply. However, it is not intended that each and every change to bleeder ventilation be considered to materially affect the safety or health of miners. For example, minor changes needed to correct a localized condition, such as removing a methane accumulation in a high spot, may be possible. The operator must evaluate each change prior to its implementation and, if doubt exists as to whether the change is material, safety dictates that the change be treated as a material change and the provisions of &sect;75.324 be followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.340&blank;Underground Electrical Installations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSHA proposes to revise paragraph (a) of existing &sect;75.340 for the purpose of clarifying the standard and to add requirements that a visual and audible alarm be provided on installations utilizing automatically activated doors and that, for installations equipped with sensors, monitoring of intake air ventilating battery charging stations be done with sensors not affected by hydrogen. For clarity, requirements for underground electrical installations to be in either noncombustible structures or areas or to have fire suppression systems have been put into separate paragraphs. Paragraph (a)(1) sets out the requirements that apply when a noncombustible structure or area is used for underground electrical installations. Similarly, paragraph (a)(2) sets out the requirements that apply when a fire suppression system is used. A provision has been added to proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) that requires that electrical installations be equipped with a device to activate a visual and audible alarm located outside of the enclosure on the intake side of the installation. In addition, to maintain consistency with proposed paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) would be revised to include the provision that monitoring of intake air ventilating battery charging stations be done with sensors not affected by hydrogen. Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) addresses installations which are ventilated with intake air and equipped with sensors to monitor for heat and for carbon monoxide or smoke for the purpose of activating and automatically closing doors. The device would activate when the temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit or the carbon monoxide concentration reaches 10 parts per million above the ambient level for the area, or the optical density of smoke reaches 0.05 per meter. The visual and audible alarm required should be situated so that it can be seen or heard by persons traveling in the intake entry immediately adjacent to the installation. It was suggested to the Agency that these electrical installations may be susceptible to fire and the fire could go undetected. The visual and audible alarms would provide additional safety at these installations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.342&blank;Methane Monitors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Informational meetings, later discussions on the rule, and recent experience have indicated that simply requiring methane monitors to be maintained in permissible condition does not completely satisfy the need for assuring proper maintenance. It was suggested that it is necessary to have a requirement that a trained person perform maintenance to preclude the possibility that a person with less than the necessary understanding of the monitor and the permissibility requirements would be assigned the task. Under the proposal, methane monitors must be properly maintained at all times. Like the existing rule, proposed paragraph (a)(4) would require that each methane monitor be calibrated with a known air-methane mixture at least every 31 days. The Agency would expect that, when necessary to maintain permissibility, methane monitors would be calibrated more frequently. To assure the appropriate level of maintenance, paragraph (a)(4)(i) would require that this maintenance be done by a trained person. To further assure the adequacy of the maintenance provided, paragraph (a)(4)(ii) would require, similar to the previous standard, the operator to develop and adopt a written maintenance program, a copy of which would be made available for review by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners. The investigation into the recent explosion at the No. 3 Mine, Southmountain Coal Company, Inc., illustrates the importance of proper maintenance of methane monitors and the need for assuring that maintenance and calibration are being done properly. Although the Southmountain investigation report did not conclude that the methane monitor on the continuous mining machine was involved in the explosion, it did state that, ``*&blank;*&blank;* the methane monitor was likely in a condition that would not have allowed for accurate atmospheric monitoring of the area prior to and at the time of the explosion *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Appendix H of the report states, ``The methane monitor was not maintained as approved due to the use of a rag in place of the sintered metal screen filter in the dust guard. The methane monitor was not properly calibrated, as received. If this condition existed at the time of the explosion, the methane monitor would not have been able to accurately detect the presence of methane.'' The Agency believes that the best way to assure that maintenance and calibration are properly done is through a written maintenance program with which everyone involved is familiar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

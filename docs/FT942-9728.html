			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Mexican rivals debate on television The first televised presidential campaign debate in Mexican history was watched by an estimated 30m viewers - and delivered a victory for the least known of the three main candidates. Yet, the mere fact that the leading contender, from the party which has governed the country for 65 years, shared the podium in Thursday night's debate with the opposition was considered a turning point for the country's political system. The candidates in the August election generally agreed on the issues confronting Mexico. They discussed corruption, poverty, the discredited legal system, the need for more democracy, and faster economic growth. They exchanged insults, offered different solutions, but overall eschewed radical policies and sought to identify themselves with the political centre. Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the candidate of the centre-right National Action party, emerged as the clear winner; Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) in second place; and Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Party of Democratic Revolution as the loser, according to the telephone polls conducted for Multivision, a pay TV station, Telemundo, a US Spanish language station, Reforma, an independent newspaper, and for Economista, a financial daily. Such polls have to be treated sceptically, in part because only the relatively well-off, who are probably less inclined to back Mr Cardenas, have telephones. But the low support for him coincided with the view of most independent analysts that the PRD candidate failed to impress in his hour-and-a-half before the cameras. Mr Fernandez de Cevallos's success may be the best outcome for the PRI. It suggests that he can prevent the opposition vote coalescing around Mr Cardenas and may even overtake him as the main opposition candidate. Mr Cardenas came close to winning the 1988 presidential election, and his attacks on the PRI and lack of democracy have damaged the party's legitimacy at home and abroad. The PAN has generally co-operated with the PRI. Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is a trial lawyer by profession, and proved the most engaging and natural speaker, the most willing to depart from his prepared text, and most effective at attacking the other candidates, especially Mr Cardenas. Mr Zedillo, was less adept in debate and at times appeared stiff and self-conscious. But he offered a clear and coherent view of the policies he would implement. While Mr Cardenas sought to come across as moderate and reasonable, he was perceived by many as being too critical, and as the least articulate of the candidates.</p>

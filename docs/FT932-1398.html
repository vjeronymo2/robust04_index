			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / German court rules on Somalia GERMANY'S constitutional court last night upheld the government's right to keep German troops in Somalia, provided parliament agrees to it. The court's decision, a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union (CDU), could pave the way for Germany gradually playing a greater role outside the Nato area. It could also strengthen Germany's position in its attempts to gain a seat in an expanded United Nations Security Council. Opposition to the court's ruling is unlikely since the three-party coalition government agreed last month to send the troops. The opposition Social Democrats last week asked the court for an injunction against Germany's involvement on the grounds that the fighting had changed the operation from a humanitarian to a combat mission. It argued that this change of role violated the constitution, which limits any military activities by the German military to Nato territory. The government insisted the mission remained humanitarian. Germany has deployed 300 troops in Belet Huen, north of the Somali capital, Mogadishu. An extra 1,400 troops are to be sent in mid-August. The court's decision follows a similar injunction aimed at preventing German pilots from flying air surveillance missions in Nato Awacs aircraft over the former Yugoslavia, which eight judges overruled. Earlier in the day, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, said the UN would be undermined as a body if Germany decided to withdraw its troops. Speaking in Bonn, he said: 'I hope the German soldiers will stay in Somalia so that they will be able to continue their humanitarian action there in favour of peace and security. Our success in Somalia is not a success for peace as such, but a success for the actions of the UN as a whole.'</p>

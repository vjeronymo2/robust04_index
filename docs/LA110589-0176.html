			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> TV NEWS: IS SEEING BELIEVING?;  </P> <P> SIMULATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE BROUGHT MAKE-BELIEVE TO NETWORK NEWS. BUT  THEY MAY BLUR TV'S BEST ASSET -- REALITY.  </P> <P> The woman on the train said she didn't hate Deborah Norville. She just felt bad  for Jane.  </P> <P> You know, Jane Pauley is so sensitive, she said, such a good mother. And, the  woman said, she didn't really know Norville, Pauley's replacement on NBC's  "Today" show, at least not yet.  </P> <P> Her seatmate nodded understandingly.  </P> <P> In truth, of course, the woman had confused television with reality. She had  never met Pauley or Norville.  </P> <P> But this intellectual sleight of hand is the central magic of television news.  The images on the screen look real, and so people believe them to be real. That  is why Americans say they have seen John Kennedy's funeral, the Challenger  disaster or men walk on the moon.  </P> <P> Today, however, many researchers believe television news is at a crossroad,  technologically and journalistically. Increasingly, the TV images on which this  trust is based can be manipulated -- or manufactured.  </P> <P> And depending on the choices television makes today, viewers may soon conclude  that seeing is no longer believing.  </P> <P> Pressured by economics, and the success of so-called tabloid-TV shows featuring  news re-creations, the three major networks are looking for new ways to tell  stories, and increasingly the distinctions between entertainment and news are  blurring -- particularly on a spate of new prime-time news magazines that use  docudrama, news simulations and audience participation.  </P> <P> At the same time, television news is acquiring new tools that make it easier to  alter and create video images. One NBC news magazine regularly superimposes  correspondents into scenes where they never actually were, using the same  technology used to make Superman fly in the movies.  </P> <P> And such technology is advancing rapidly. Last year engineers from Pixar in San  Rafael, Calif., won an Academy Award for a short video starring a baby who was  entirely generated by computer.  </P> <P> "Fifteen years ago, I could not put on my newscast something that I had not  heard or seen or recorded, unless it was something that an artist might have  sketched," said Walter Porges, vice president of news practices at ABC. "Now I  can create pictures and sounds to go with them that never happened. And that  opens up all kinds of ethical moral problems for everybody."  </P> <P> What are the implications of all this? The answers go well beyond whether it is  journalistically responsible to simulate news.  </P> <P> On the simplest level, substantial scientific evidence suggests that even if  simulations are carefully labeled, viewers will remember them as real,  confusing TV imagery with actual events.  </P> <P> Some experts warn that Americans over time will come to see their primary  medium for news, which currently has a high level of credibility, to be suspect  -- hardly better than advertising. If so, TV news could be tampering with its  greatest strength.  </P> <P> Others think staged news and simulated images are part of a larger social  change in which real events generally are being subsumed by synthetic ones. It  has already occured, they say, in political campaigns.  </P> <P> Nonsense, say those involved in the experimental programs. The good or evil of  these techniques depends on their use.  </P> <P> But all agree that simulated and altered news images are more than a fad, and  television must begin to develop a new set of ethics to handle them -- much as  medicine must wrestle with such technology as genetic engineering.  </P> <P> Change in television news is nothing new. The medium is far different from when  Douglas Edwards first read radio copy on camera for CBS.  </P> <P> The most important difference, say news executives, is the march toward better  pictures. Where once anchormen held up still photos on camera, now viewers get  live video from anywhere in the world instantly.  </P> <P> One result, some newscasters believe, has been the diminution of the  journalist. Many say that while TV journalists like Dan Rather are certainly  celebrities, today they are more narrators of pictures than authoritative  figures interpreting unseen events. Who has the prestige of Walter Cronkite,  whose on-air comments about Vietnam convinced President Lyndon B. Johnson that  public support for the war was lost?  </P> <P> "You are getting a lot more coverage and a lot less journalism, a lot more show  and a lot less tell," said Lawrence Grossman, former president of NBC News.  </P> <P> Even network executives like Robert Siegenthaler, president of Broadcast  Operations and Engineering at ABC, worry that better visuals "have  de-emphasized the words, and concomitantly the thought. . . . There is a fall  off in the communication of understanding. The audience is in video overload,"  unable to retain all the pictures.  </P> <P> If the move toward better pictures in the early 1980s was rooted in the  improved technology of video and satellites, the current move toward new ways  of telling stories is grounded in the declining economics of network  television.  </P> <P> As cable television and independent stations proliferated, offering more than  just reruns, the networks saw their share of the prime-time audience shrivel  from 92% in 1978-79 to 67% this year, Nielsen Media Research reports. The  network oligarchy was dying. The old way of business was failing. And by 1986  new owners had taken control at all three networks: Capital Cities  Communication at ABC, General Electric at NBC and hotel magnate Lawrence Tisch  at CBS.  </P> <P> Their mandate was to cut costs and find new ways to attract audiences -- news  suddenly was going to have to turn a profit.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Ronald Reagan Administration's deregulation of television  eliminated one of the major purposes of the network news divisions, to provide  public service broadcasting that would keep the Federal Communications  Commission off their backs.  </P> <P> The perfect model for news in this new world was CBS News' "60 Minutes." For,  blessed with talent, an original format and a time slot pitting it against  Sunday children's shows, it became a news show with entertainment-sized ratings  in prime time -- and subsidized the rest of the news division.  </P> <P> The allure was powerful. Prime-time magazines such as "60 Minutes" were more  profitable because they were cheaper to produce and the networks owned them  outright, while communications regulations mandated that most entertainment  programs come from outside producers.  </P> <P> ABC succeeded with "20-20." CBS tried to attract younger audiences with "West  57th Street." And then came the rise of so-called "reality programming," or  Tabloid TV, initially produced by non-network producers called syndicators.  News-as-entertainment shows, such as "America's Most Wanted," "Unsolved  Mysteries," "A Current Affair" and "Hard Copy," demonstrated that big audiences  could be had by staging news-style dramatizations.  </P> <P> Soon network entertainment divisions were producing such programs, too. And  this year all three networks added new hourlong prime-time magazine news shows  that borrow the techniques of entertainment. "Saturday Night With Connie Chung"  on CBS and "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow" on NBC both use actors in  re-creations. "Prime Time Live" on ABC involves participation by a live studio  audience.  </P> <P> All three networks gave their producers more freedom to experiment with these  prime-time formats, from the conviction, deeply held, that to succeed in prime  time, newscasters must tell stories in new ways.  </P> <P> But simulations are not the only innovations. Other techniques of entertainment  programming in general are being mixed with news -- giving rise to  "info-tainment," or what some have called TV's New Journalism, a reference to  the blending of fiction and nonfiction writing techniques newspapers explored  in the 1960s.  </P> <P> "You cannot produce a prime-time TV program the way you do a Sunday morning  (news magazine) program," said Sid Feders, executive producer of "Yesterday,  Today and Tomorrow." "People want to be entertained more, they want their  attention held more."  </P> <P> And the search for new ways to tell stories is also a matter of technology.  </P> <P> Feders' program regularly alters news images by superimposing correspondents on  scenes, even if they never actually were there. The machine used, called the  Ultimatte, mates two images so cleanly that the alteration is not detectable to  the viewer. It even adds the correct shadows.  </P> <P> Another machine, the Paint Box, allows producers to change the image's colors,  to add or delete objects from the image, or to turn video images into sketches.  </P> <P> Other machines can make objects spin, expand or shrink, add animation to video,  change the focus, or obscure the faces of anonymous sources.  </P> <P> And there is more to come.  </P> <P> In laboratories and universities around the world, computer researchers are  working on the science of simulating reality.  </P> <P> "The state of the art now is we can simulate man-made things realistically,"  said Alvi Ray Smith, co-founder and executive vice president of Pixar, the San  Rafael company that is one of the leaders in the field called computer-aided  visualization.  </P> <P> Images of buildings, furniture, machines and automobiles, moving and stationary  -- anything made by humans -- can be simulated to the point that they are  indistinguishable from reality.  </P> <P> Simulating plant life is getting closer, researchers say. A company in France  is starting to sell plant models on computer to architects.  </P> <P> Simulated images of animals and humans are harder.  </P> <P> Pixar made its first significant attempt this year by simulating a baby in "Tin  Toy," the Oscar-winning video, which appears to be halfway between a cartoon  and a photographic movie.  </P> <P> But researchers say the technology is not yet there to simulate physiology.  Pixar had to create 40 sets of muscles just for the baby's face.  </P> <P> "The skin doesn't fold quite right," said Smith. "We still weren't close enough  to reality to claim it was a real baby."  </P> <P> The new technology has potential to improve television news, especially  covering topics the medium once found difficult, such as science or economics.  </P> <P> When a plane crashes, for instance, the Paint Box makes it possible to  immediately create an animation from federal records of what happened.  </P> <P> Proponents of the new techniques also argue that so-called reality programming  is reaching audiences that otherwise would not watch news. "If you simulate  socially significant things that otherwise people would be missing, you might  be doing a service," said Doris A. Graber, professor of political science at  the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of "Processing the News."  </P> <P> Andrew Lack, executive producer of "Saturday Night with Connie Chung," said he  is "much more concerned that all we show them (on the news) is Mexican bus  crashes" than he is that networks are looking for new kinds of stories and  formats.  </P> <P> But the machines also carry obvious potential for deception.  </P> <P> ABC News, for instance, used some of this technology when it staged a picture  of someone playing the part of suspected spy Felix S. Bloch handing over a  briefcase to a supposed Soviet agent. ABC technicians added a digital time code  to the corner of the faked photograph to make it look more like a real  surveillance photo.  </P> <P> And, privately, television staffers admit other indiscretions. NBC News  employees tell of one editor who regularly "sweetens" boring footage with bird  sounds he has collected. That occasionally brings a letter from some astute  birding enthusiast complaining of a bird heard singing in the wrong habitat.  </P> <P> But potential transgressions could be much more serious. "If I were a budding  dictator and I wanted to influence the minds of the people of the small island  of X," Siegenthaler said, he could simulate television images "to make the  current opposition leader look bad. If drinking were forbidden, I could make  him look like he was coming out of a bar."  </P> <P> Many critics, of course, have opposed all re-creations of news events.  </P> <P> "You don't have to be a journalism school fuddy-duddy to wonder if CBS News  hasn't invaded a realm from which it might better exclude itself," Washington  Post TV critic Tom Shales wrote after the debut of Connie Chung's show.  </P> <P> But perhaps seeing the issue as an ethical debate over simulations misses the  point. This is more a matter of economics and technology.  </P> <P> "It is like genetic engineering," Siegenthaler said. "You can tell the doctors  not to mess with genetics, but, in point of fact, science marches on.  </P> <P> "In the same way, the Ultimatte will be a cleaner clip, so more easily  inserted, the Paint Box will get cleaner."  </P> <P> What is needed, most argue, is a new set of rules for the new era of  television.  </P> <P> "Most of these tools are sort of neutral and it depends on their use," said ABC  media critic Jeff Greenfield.  </P> <P> "I suspect we will go through a whole period where we exploit this technology  to the hilt, until we get to the point that we develop some proper standards,"  said Smith of Pixar.  </P> <P> At this point, the ethics are sketchy. NBC News President Michael Gartner has  issued rules that re-creations be restricted to prime-time magazine shows. They  are not to appear on the nightly news.  </P> <P> But former NBC correspondent Ken Bode asks: "Once you say you are no longer a  virgin, what's the difference? What Gartner is doing is offering a lofty  rationale for slipping standards."  </P> <P> All three networks also assure audiences that any simulated, animated or  re-created images will be carefully labeled.  </P> <P> But some who have studied the impact of television believe that these new lines  being drawn fail to account for how television actually works.  </P> <P> Specifically, scientific research shows that people soon forget and confuse  where they saw news. "We have known since the 1950s that source and message  divorce over time," said Kathleen Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of  Communications at the University of Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> In fact, people tend to remember things as coming from more credible sources  than they really did, in part because they don't like to think of themselves as  manipulated.  </P> <P> Hence, if people remember simulations, "it is a reasonably good guess" people  will believe "they had seen the real McCoy," said Graber of the University of  Illinois at Chicago.  </P> <P> What's more, researchers believe that labeling simulations and issuing verbal  warnings probably won't change that. Research shows that people process visual  images separately and less critically than written or spoken information.  </P> <P> The result, said Jamieson, is that "people believe what they see even if you  put a notice up saying it's simulated."  </P> <P> In the short term, "people will believe a lot of things that are not real,"  Jamieson said.  </P> <P> And in the long term, some believe, television news could be tampering with its  most precious power -- the sensation, clearly identified by research, that  people believe television to be real.  </P> <P> "People believe it because they think it is actually happening," said Shanto  Iyengar, a professor of political science and communication at UCLA and  co-author of "News that Matters." If info-tainment, simulations and simulated  reality become commonplace, the effect would be to weaken "that exalted status"  Iyengar said.  </P> <P> "They are risking their credibility," Jamieson said of television news in  general. "If you deceive the American audience, they ultimately will come to  question news."  </P> <P> Already, audiences make clear distinctions in the way they perceive different  kinds of television, researchers said. They regard advertising with great  skepticism, for instance, and view some kinds of news, such as foreign affairs,  as more important and persuasive than others, such as celebrity interviews.  </P> <P> But other researchers have less faith in the viewing audience and believe that  the confusion over what is real will deepen.  </P> <P> "Increasingly, Americans are going to be unable to tell the difference between  reality and illusion," said Jack Solomon, a UCLA professor and author of "The  Signs of Our Time," a study of semiotics, or social symbols.  </P> <P> "We live in a commercial culture whose main job is to sell things. It is  spilled out into politics and it is now spilling out into the news."  </P> <P> And some see this debate over effects as overheated speculation.  </P> <P> On one level, said Smith of Pixar, "the act of editing (videotape) is already a  corruption of reality. . . . Once you are willing to rearrange time with  editing, why not rearrange space a little bit."  </P> <P> In the end, the debate in television news is not over simulating reality at  all, but over values.  </P> <P> Producer Feders is fond of quoting Bob Wright, the president of NBC. "He says  you cannot set a table and then serve food that is so unappetizing that it  drives them away."  </P> <P> Don Hewitt, the respected executive producer of "60 Minutes," believes the  decisive factor in TV news' future is not the journalists but the owners. He  notes, for instance, that TV stations owned by major newspaper companies have  helped popularize news re-creations by airing tabloid TV shows.  </P> <P> And he was particularly upset, he said, when CBS' flagship station in New York,  which is network owned, bumped "The CBS Evening News" from 7 p.m. to the  lower-rated 6:30 p.m. time slot to make room for "USA Today on Television."  When "USA Today" bombed, it substituted the tabloid TV show "Hard Copy."  </P> <P> "If the pressure comes from the top, I think what will happen is the nature of  the people who work in the business will change," Hewitt said.  </P> <P> Even the vice president of standards at ABC, Porges, sounds uncertain at times:  "I would hate to think I wasted 35 years trying to be right."  </P></p>

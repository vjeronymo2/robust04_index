			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEGGARS AND PEDDLERS  </P> <P> I was interested in your News and Briefs article Aug. 12 about the improved  conditions of the beggars and peddlers in Acapulco.  </P> <P> I just returned from there and was saddened by the number of beggars and  peddlers on the streets. You could not walk five steps without being accosted  by someone. You cannot help them all. There are too many.  </P> <P> I saw a woman nursing a baby as she sold gum. I saw women dragging children who  were so tired I could have cried for them.  </P> <P> It seems to me that the authorities should clean up the area, not just talk  about it. It is a shame.  </P> <P> J. MOELICH  </P> <P> Las Vegas  </P></p>

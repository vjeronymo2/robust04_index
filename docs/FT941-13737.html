			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: BCI to step up control of French unit Banca Commerciale Italiana will take nearly full control of its 48-per cent unit Banque Sudameris as a result of Dresdner Bank, Banque Indosuez, Paribas and Union Bank of Switzerland pulling out, Reuter reports from Paris. Dresdner, UBS, Paribas and Cie de Suez's Banque Indosuez each have 12 per cent of Banque Sudameris. Sudameris said the shareholders were planning to give up their participations whereas Banca Commerciale Italiana, through its wholly owned subsidiary Comit Holding International, would increase its own to take majority control. Banque Sudameris, a French bank whose main business is in Latin America, said it would propose a capital reduction through a share buy-back, to a shareholders' meeting on February 23. An official said the bank would buy in the four banks' stakes and cancel them, leaving BCI with 99 per cent. The price of the buy-back would be announced later. The bank's total assets were FFr26.37bn (Dollars 4.51bn) on June 30 1993 with a net worth of FFr2.46bn. The Italian government plans to privatise BCI next month.</p>

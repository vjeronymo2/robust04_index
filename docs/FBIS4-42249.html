			<p>BFN     [Text] Industry in Norway is threatening to transfer its  operations abroad unless Norway joins the European Union [EU].  Norwegian industry, which is in difficulties, is operating on  the strength of considerable state subsidies. According to  recent European Free Trade Association [EFTA] statistics,  industry in Norway receives subsidies that are nearly twice as  high as in Finland, for instance. Ulla-Maria Johansen reports:    [Johansen] Of the countries seeking EU membership, Norway's  industry is in the relatively weakest position because it  receives most state subsidies in relation to each industrial  job. According to EFTA's state subsidy statistics, each  industrial job in Norway received over 15,000 kroner or over  11,000 markkas in state subsidies in 1992. Finnish industry  came second, with each industrial job receiving a state subsidy  of over 6,000 markkas, nearly 50 percent less than Norwegian  industry. Sweden comes third and Austria fourth in the  statistics.    Without EU membership, it is feared that the position of  Norwegian industry and industrial jobs will weaken considerably.  Both Norwegian and major foreign enterprises are threatening to  leave the country if the Norwegians say no to the EU in next  November's referendum. Kvaerner, Europe's biggest shipbuilder  and owner of the Masa-Yards shipyard in Finland, will be moving  its head office to the EU region. Of foreign companies, Alcatel  STK and ABB are threatening to move their production and  investments away from Norway if the nation says no to the EU.  Japanese companies that are currently investing in the  Norwegian market also intend to leave the country along with the  EU membership plan [as heard]. The latest threat comes from the  Japanese giant (Itoshu) Corporation, which has a turnover of  nearly 1 trillion markkas. (Itoshu), investing in anything  from the fishing industry to the car industry, has so far  invested less than 1 billion markkas a year in Norway, but the  company's plans are grand if Norway joins the EU. If Norway  remains outside and Sweden and Finland become members, (Itoshu)  regards the future of Norway's neighboring countries as bright  for Japanese investments. This is Ulla-Maria Johansen in Oslo.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / S Korea bans false-name dealings SOUTH KOREA'S President Kim Young-sam, in a surprise announcement, last night ordered immediate implementation of a key financial reform to reduce the large underground economy. Mr Kim invoked emergency powers to introduce a real-name financial transaction system, which bans the use of false or borrowed names in financial dealings. Although action could have an adverse short-term impact on the already weak Korean economy - by prompting a fall in the stock market through the sale of shares held under false names - many analysts welcomed the move. 'This signifies that the new government is committed to economic deregulation and financial liberalisation,' said Mr Andrew Holland, head of research at BZW in Seoul. Mr Kim described the real- name system as 'the most important reform for the construction of a new Korea' because 'it would stamp out corruption'. An estimated Won3,000bn (Pounds 2.48bn) is held in false-name accounts. Those holding assets under false names will have two months to deposit them into real-name accounts, which would then be subject to taxation. Those failing to do so will be subject to tax investigations and penalties. Shares held under false or nominee names account for about 7 per cent of stock investor accounts. In an attempt to persuade these investors to keep their money in the bourse, Mr Kim promised not to impose a capital gains tax on stock investment during his term, which ends in 1997. The government will also call on institutional investors to buy shares if panic selling seizes the bourse. But some analysts predict that may not be necessary. 'The initial market reaction may be negative, but that will likely subside quickly as investors begin to understand the positive aspects of the real-name system on the stock market and the economy,' said Mr Edward Kim of Korea Development Securities. There is concern, however, there could be an immediate squeeze on short-term funds as some institutional investors, such as securities houses, borrow money to buy stock under government direction. The government is also taking measures to prevent the flight of capital abroad or attempts to switch hidden assets from bank and stock accounts into property. This includes requiring those engaged in financial transactions to provide identification proving asset ownership.

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Travel: A reinvented city that lives on in dreams - Modern Alexandria is hopelessly dilapidated, crowded, and decaying. But, it can still be a place of wonder 'For the majority of people, Alexandria was a dull hole with only good bathing and many French restaurants to recommend it. 'There is nothing to see]' they repeated endlessly, and this, too, was true' - Lawrence Durrell on Alexandria of the 1940s. THERE was nothing to see then, and there is nothing to see now. Today, even the French restaurants and good bathing have all but disappeared. The city hugs the shoreline, a linear sprawl of shabby dilapidation squeezed between the desert and the sea. Its greatest age, when its philosophy, religion and science made it the heart of the Hellenic world, lies buried under 2,000 years of urban detritus. Alexandria's memory is hardly that long: palaces and villas, the vestiges of an elegance lost earlier this century, sit forsaken and disintegrating among a swirl of anonymous bazaar crowds oblivious of their existence. It is a city of ruins, of old colonial ruins and over-crowded ruins jerry-built just yesterday; of cracked concrete and peeling paint; of rising damp below and tangled festoons of telephone lines and drying laundry above. It is a city of desperate rural migration, shabby Egyptian holiday-making and stop-gap civic management. It is a place of some pathos but no obvious appeal. To anyone with romantic notions of Antony and Cleopatra, the library of 500,000 scrolls or that wonder of the ancient world, the 400 ft-tall Pharos lighthouse, it is all, of course, a great disappointment. This was the city that for centuries acted as a spiritual bridge between two continents; a place where a dozen races met and mingled; a seat of urbanity and eclecticism, intellectual synthesis and knowledge. For most visitors, it is now a decaying, forgotten backwater. Where is the tomb of Alexander the Great, the city's founder? I asked not long after arriving. Nobody knew. Eventually, with the help of EM Forster's Alexandria - published 70 years ago and the last guide to be written on the city - I made my way to the intersection of rue Fuad and Nabi Daniel. If Alexander's tomb ever existed there, it has disappeared in a thundering of traffic and a puff of diesel smoke. Even 70 years ago, Alexandria was what it had been in the beginning: a Mediterranean city looking northwards across the sea to Europe. Today, it is Arab - al-Iskandariya, a heavily-populated, industrialised African city. If it looks anywhere for inspiration, it is southwards across the desert to Cairo and, further, to Mecca. But even 70 years ago, long before Nasser's socialist revolution, before nationalisations and expulsions drove 150,000 Europeans away, Alexandria was far from being the romantic city of popular conception. Forster lived in and wrote about Alexandria only because World War One caught him there on his way to India. A generation later, Durrell also pitched up, fleeing the German invasion of his beloved Greece. Both found the city a hopelessly dull and bourgeois place. 'One can't dislike Alex,' Forster wrote, 'because it is impossible to dislike sea and stones.' Durrell begged to differ; he described it as 'a smashed-up, broken-down, shabby Neapolitan town, a saturated, middle-European boredom laced with drink and Packards and beach cabins. No subject of conversation except money.' Yet, from the life of the city, both men extracted a flavour, a hint of some inner being, that allowed each to recreate Alexandria in his own manner. In his guide, Forster brought back to life a classical, ancient city of which no sign had remained. More important, Alexandria was literally his 'passage to India,' the city where experiences ranging from philosophical debate with the Alexandrian poet CP Cavafy to a love affair with a tram conductor formed his outlook on the meeting of east and west. And as uninspiring as Durrell might have found the place, there was something there that allowed for its transformation into the dreamy, lyrical city of his Alexandria Quartet. What was it? The answer is not to be found in Alexandria's sagging tenements, its refuse-littered streets or horn-blaring traffic. It is not to be found in any material aspect of the city at all but, instead, in the spirit and imagination of those Alexandrians who remain aware of its past. So great is its weight of history that, for them, a second, grander city, insubstantial and ghost-like, rises out of the visible city's decay and neglect. To see it, you have only to look through the eyes of Alexandrians who, despite the evidence before their eyes, continue each day to re-invent the place. * * * Although now less and less common, such people can be found in the most ordinary of places. Shahira, for example, grew up in a land-owning family which, in pre-Nasser days, claimed large Nile delta tracts and feudal ownership of entire villages. Wealthy and educated, equally proud of her Arab traditions and cosmopolitan upbringing, she might do anything with her life. What she chooses to do much of the time is hunt around in junk and second-hand furniture shops. There, surrounded by an age that no longer exists, she finds objects of beauty and brings them back to the present. It is her way, perhaps, of slowing the ebb of time. In an old shop off the Sharia El Hurriya, I watched Shahira digging about in a room stuffed with sagging bedsprings, chipped china dogs, veneer-peeled armoirs and broken typewriters; along with a hundred other things, they imitated the larger life of the run-down, limp-along city outside. No-one, I thought, could find anything of value here. But, from under a battered metal table, Shahira hauled out a straight-backed chair. Covered in grime, its upholstery ripped, it was old and once valued, a stray heirloom that spoke for the existence of another Alexandria. For Shahira, its restoration would be the building of another bulwark against the slippage of time. Inspired, I took to spending rainy afternoons in the city's antique shops. In bronze statues, ormolu clocks, ivory canes and gilt-framed mirrors I met the lingering spirits of Alexandria's past. * * * Like Shahira, Christina is another backwards-looking visionary. She takes her place every day behind the cash register at the Cafe Elite, one of the community of expatriates to whom those sad antiques once belonged. Alexandria is no longer the Paris of the east but, like an antique itself, the Elite hangs on unchanged, a fading Gallic outpost for a demi-monde that no longer exists. Christina sat me down, had a cream pastry brought and, in polished French, recounted the visits of Piaf, Josephine Baker and others who once visited the Elite. For Christina, the elegant theatre crowds might have left only the evening before. She sees them still: the Greek and Italian cotton brokers, the English shipping agents, the Levantine factory-owners, the socialites, cafe philosophers and sybarites of a score of nations. Alexandria was, for all, a summer idyll that would last forever. No one questioned the villas, the servants, garden parties, idle promenades, fashionable clothes, private schools. Not even Christina, daughter of a Greek shopkeeper, questioned ancient Greek and Latin at the Lycee Francaise. Why should she? Even the shabbiest of quayside cafe waiters served up coffee and small talk in the languages of three continents. Now, her schoolmates are gone, scattered to the ends of the earth. Like a handful of others Christina stays on, her head full of the cabaret songs of her youth. It is too late now, she says, to go anywhere else. * * * Mohammed, too, knows phantom Alexandria. An architect, he has welded his own life to the life of the city. He is a distillation of its past, a product of marriages between Greek and Egyptian grandparents, a Moslem who attended a Christian school, an African who borrows ideas and attitudes from around the world. He is forever busy with a dozen projects, but it is no accident that his greatest sense of architectural duty lies in preserving Alexandria's old buildings. In attempting to save them from decay and destruction, he sees some way of saving himself. I met Mohammed for dinner one night in a restaurant overlooking Stanley Bay, on the sea-front Corniche. The meal lasted until midnight, the talk very much longer. The real Alexandria, he wanted to convince me, is not so very far removed from the Alexandria of the imagination. At 2am, we set out so I could see for myself. Perhaps it all worked because no city seems entirely real at that time of night. We drove through silent, deserted streets half-lit by weak and occasional lamp standards. The crowds, the noise, the grime, the distractions had disappeared. In the dark, modern Egypt was minimised - the kebab shops, bazaar stalls, rubble heaps and weary housing blocks faded into obscurity. What emerged from the gloom in their place, animated by Mohammed's vision and enthusiasm, were a thousand splendid faces from Alexandria's past. We gazed at formal Italianate residences, their facades, dirty and blotched by day, now new and unsullied again under the obscuring cover of night. We drove past fussy neo-Gothic follies, around the smooth rotundities of art deco villas, under the complex wrought ironwork of art nouveau - all repaired by the night's blurring sleight-of-hand. Porticoes, pediments, columns, caryatids, pilasters, friezes - across the city, darkness smoothed over the damage time had done them. Alexandria was given new life. Finally, very late, in the old Jewish quarter of Moharem Bey, we stopped outside a house. A chain and padlock held together a rusty iron gate. Inside, I could make out neglected and un-pruned date trees, a sweeping stairway overgrown with creepers, a tiled balcony where dead leaves swirled in the night wind. Behind rose a dark house and tall tower. What is it? I asked Mohammed as he switched off the ignition. Durrell's old place, he replied. We sat gazing at the house for a long moment. Durrell, of course, was not telling the whole truth - no artificer does. Ignore the bathing, the French restaurants and the other blowsy attractions and there is plenty to see in this city. Of phantom Alexandria, you make what you will. First published last year, Egypt: A Traveller's Anthology, by Christopher Pick, is now available in paperback (John Murray, London, Pounds 11.95).</p>

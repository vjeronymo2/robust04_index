			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Securing pensions AS Maxwell company pension scheme members besieged the House of Commons yesterday Mr Peter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security, confirmed that the government is to begin making payments to dispossessed pensioners and is launching an independent inquiry into the legal framework under which pension schemes operate. For obvious reasons the government is playing down the implications of its financial support. This is, it says, only a temporary grant of funds until assets illegally diverted can be recovered from the banks. Obviously Mr Lilley is anxious to avoid any general commitment to bail out troubled occupational pension schemes. He prefers to argue that by putting legal and moral pressure on the banks and others involved in this pensions debacle he can recover the government's money. But it is not clear that the state's responsibilities can be judged tangential. Certainly, the occupational pensions industry will take these developments seriously. The hint of a central state guarantee for occupational schemes could potentially cost schemes very dearly in terms of operational restrictions and legal constraints. The actual and potential risks of occupational schemes have barely been recognised officially, but now they must be considered, whether directly by the state or, more likely in due course, through a formal industry-wide compensation scheme. Pension schemes will have to be run in ways that make them, in effect, insurable. This will mean following laid-down rules not only on the questions of safe custody of assets and independent inspection of operations which arise directly from the Maxwell affair, but also on prudence in investment and on the maintenance of minimum funding standards. Even the pronouncements of venerable actuaries on the solvency of schemes might need to be brought under the microscope. The independent committee under Professor Roy Goode has, rightly, been given a broad remit to examine pension scheme law as a whole. It has taken a shocking case of fraud to trigger such an inquiry, but the committee should not feel obliged to confine itself to narrowly criminal questions of security and supervision. Millions of scheme members in the past have suffered losses on a smaller but still serious scale through the inequitable operation of scheme rules; hazards have included poor transfer values and the inadequate protection of pensions against inflation. The ability of employers to access surpluses through contribution holidays, early retirement initiatives and scheme mergers also needs examination. The role of the government itself must also be examined. Pension law needs to be reconsidered even in respect of such relatively recent law as the Financial Services Act of 1986. Fraud has prompted this welcome review, but the committee will only do its job if it roams across the whole field of occupational pensions.</p>

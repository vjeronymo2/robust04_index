			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: MTM's Pounds 10.5m sale MTM, the chemicals group, has agreed to sell its agrochemicals subsidiary to United Phosphorus, an Indian group, for about Pounds 10.5m in cash. The disposal will leave MTM with net cash of Pounds 16.2m which it plans to use for the acquisition of businesses with good profit growth potential. In the year to last December the agrochemicals business contributed turnover of Pounds 21.4m and operating profits of Pounds 300,000 to group turnover of Pounds 53.6m and operating profits of Pounds 1.2m. The division's net assets had a book value of Pounds 9.3m at the year end. MTM, whose shares closed up 5p at 71p yesterday, said the division had insufficient growth potential to justify retaining it as a core business. The consideration includes a goodwill payment of Pounds 572,580 over net asset value.</p>

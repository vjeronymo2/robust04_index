			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Beverley holders to decide over CVA Beverley Group shareholders are faced with the most crucial of recent crisis decisions, after their company proposed a Company Voluntary Arrangement to stave off liquidation. According to Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, it should be an easy choice. Liquidation would return nothing to shareholders, and only 0.6p in the pound to unsecured creditors. A CVA will offer 4p in the pound to creditors. A CVA provides for partial repayment of creditors, but leaves a clean shell company with a solvent operating business, and therefore some future. This may be only limited consolation for shareholders who have seen the value of their investment plummet from 68p in 1990 to their pre-suspension price of 6 1/2 p last June. The company never fully recoverered from its failed bid for James Wilkes in 1992, which cost more than Pounds 2m. A series of asset disposals in January, many to companies controlled by Beverley's directors, did little to halt the slide. The final blow was a failed reverse takeover by a Hong Kong Chinese group, costing another Pounds 450,000 in fees. Mr Robinson claims that Beverley has one potentially profitable business, Beverley Fluid Engineering (BFE), which has been starved of cash due to parental difficulties. By providing a structure for repaying creditors, the CVA will take those liabilities off the balance sheet. Mr Robinson said this should add about Pounds 3.5m to Beverley's asset value. A CVA for its BFE subsidiary will enable part repayment of a Pounds 1.42m loan from its parent at an eventual 20p in the pound. Beverley plans a placing to raise about Pounds 450,000, which will be channeled straight into BFE, providing the funds necessary to pay off creditors, who will receive tranches in April and May 1995, and April 1996. Creditors and shareholders meetings will both be held on December 20.</p>

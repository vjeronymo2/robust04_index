			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Letter: Students' search for employment Sir, I read with some deep concern the recent article ('School's out - and nowhere to go', June 6) regarding the number of graduate students that are unable to find work six months after graduation and their low starting salary expectation. Our statistics show a different story. I can find no recent graduate willingly out of work and our statistics indicate an actual average starting salary in excess of Pounds 18,000 per annum. Perhaps one can suggest that companies are becoming more selective, and are focusing on students most able to offer quick effectiveness in new jobs. Our graduates, with fluency in three European languages, experience of four different commercial organisations - two at least outside the UK, and a sound knowledge of business functions and subjects - provide a well rounded individual well able to contribute from day one. Graduates have received a four-year training in presentation skills. The total mix is aimed at producing managers that can perform and use the theory they have learnt - and this, after all, is what business keeps saying it wants.

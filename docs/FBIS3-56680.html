			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Kolesnikov article: "`Party of the Street' Can Only </F> Lead to a Dead End"]    [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] is  the party of the street. The arrogance of urban teenage louts  and losers has taken parliament by storm. The seats in the hall  are occupied by standard-issue street riff-raff who have  somewhat outgrown the romantic age of hooliganism for its own  sake. There are some doubts whether the street "barons" should  be represented in the lower chamber of the new parliament.  However, the voters, having sent the "delegates of the lower  depths" to parliament, have perhaps thereby expressed their  attitude to the Russian parliamentary system.    Zhirinovskiy's lieutenants, who will act as catalysts in the  State Duma, will, as is clear from the behavior of deputies of  the extreme left and extreme right "wings" of various  parliamentary factions, be augmented by representatives of a  moribund caste of the Soviet people. They may be dubbed social  constructivists. These deputies, who as a rule are of the age of  vague anti-liberal convictions (I stipulate for the last time  not anti-liberal as regards the LDPR), inscribe nightly -- until  cockcrow -- in grubby, thick exercise books, in their uneven,  old woman's hand, global plans for the revamping of Russia.    In the blessed times of perestroyka, efforts were made to  prevent their getting within firing distance of the USSR. They  laid siege to the theoretical and political journals in  accordance with all the rules governing the art of war, bent on  seeing the fruits of their lucubrations published. They  ransacked the classical tomes of Marxism and found there words  and expressions unused at party congresses and sought to impart  their discoveries to the world. This author, who worked during  those years on a sociopolitical journal, would take cowardly  refuge in the mazy corridors of the editorial office from the  abundant drivel spouted by the transformers of society on the  pretext of a "summons from the leadership." The names of  certain of my clients now adorn the pages of PRAVDA, to which in  better times they were denied access by the militia.    Now the social constructivists will try to test out their  crazy, hare-brained schemes on the country. Of course, their  action won't go beyond empty parliamentary rhetoric, but they  will be able to stymie some fruitful work. It is no wonder that  the instinct of self-preservation is quite unerringly forcing  the representatives of Russia's Choice to fight for leading  positions on the financial and economic committees.    From the emotional standpoint, the refusal of Russia's  Choice  representatives to negotiate with the Communists, the agrarians,  and the LDPR is understandable. One can understand Russia's  Choice's action in human terms, but not politically. The alarm  bell tolled too loudly during the elections, and too little time  is allocated the liberals to implement their economic program.  If the program is to be implemented they have to be real  politicians for a while and play the most diverse, sometimes  unpleasant, political games with their ideological opponents.  Political fastidiousness could cost dear.    Is it necessary to beat one's breast and shout in advance  that it is impossible to cooperate with the "Communists"? It is  not difficult to see (and if the democrats have not noticed this  they will always remain a minority in the State Duma)  that at the present political stage the extreme left-wingers and  extreme right-wingers are still, as it were, getting accustomed  to one another again, they are having to work out a new code of  relations -- they can no longer play according to the rules of  the National Salvation Front of blessed memory. The LDPR plays  without rules -- that's why it is a party of the street. The  Communists and agrarians by their very nature need rules of the  game. And one can and must cooperate with them on particular  questions of legislation where there should in principle be no  antagonism. Nationalities policy and the protection of the  rights of the Russian-speaking population could be such an area  of contact -- otherwise the democrats will be unable to seize  the initiative here and it will be impossible for anyone to  prove that it was Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev rather than  Komsomol member Dima Rogozin who really helped the Russians  living in the former Soviet Union.    Is there any point in frightening oneself yet again? Fear  can become chronic if you don't get rid of it promptly and start  engaging in normal work and normal politics.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] and the Ministry of Construction decided to set new JIS  (Japan Industrial Standards) for high-quality steel products for  construction use from June this year, and to instruct the steel  and construction industries to use these steel products.    This decision was made in view of reported cases of welded  parts of construction-use steel breaking, which have become a  social problem. A new set of JIS will be designated  specifically for steel products for construction use--standards  used to be uniform for all steel products used in the  automobile, construction, and other industries.    Nippon Steel Corporation and other steel manufacturers will  start making products under the new JIS, and shipment of such  products will start toward the end of 1994.    As a result of this decision, foreign steelmakers will have  to obtain certification under the new stricter JIS in their  attempts to enter the Japanese market for construction materials  used in public work projects. This may give rise to the  criticism that the new JIS constitute a nontariff barrier.    The introduction of the new JIS was a result of the incident  in 1991 where JIS-certified steel sheets sold in the domestic  market broke at the welded portions, and the involved  manufacturers were penalized. The main point of the new  standards is that by reducing the sulfur and phosphorus content  in steel products, faulty welding and inadequate strength can be  prevented. In terms of product shapes, maximum permissible size  differences will be reduced to increase precision in welding.  The new JIS will apply to steel sheets, shape steel, flat steel  and other products used as construction materials.    Along with the MITI's setting of new JIS in June, the  Construction Ministry will amend its guidelines based on the  Construction Standards Law, and issue directives encouraging the  use of new JIS products.    However, the depression in demand for steel products has  caused an increase in the inventory of products certified under  the old JIS. To prevent confusion in the market due to a sudden  switch over, the old standards will still be retained beyond  June. A transition period of one to two years will be set,  after which old JIS only for steel for construction use will be  abolished.    Regarding the purpose of its efforts to popularize the new  JIS, the Construction Ministry says, "This is to improve the  safety of architectural structures in response to demands from  the related industries and the people" (according to the  Building Guidance Division).    Since new JIS products will require the meticulous removal  of  impurities, and other additional procedures in the production  process, "production cost will be about 10 percent higher than  existing products" (according to Tokyo Steel Manufacturing  Company, Ltd.). The current market price for H-shape steel is  from 30,000 to 40,000 yen per ton. A price increase is being  considered for the new JIS products.    On the other hand, it is believed that foreign companies  selling steel products used in construction and public work  projects will also require the new JIS certification. Many  industry sources think that this will make foreign participation  even more difficult.</p>

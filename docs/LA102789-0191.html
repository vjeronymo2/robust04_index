			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LENDL THINKING OF BOYCOTTING ATP TOUR  </P> <P> World No. 1 Ivan Lendl said he may boycott the new Assn. of Tennis  Professionals' tennis tour in 1991 because it forces him to play in too many  tournaments.  </P> <P> Lendl was reacting to a suggestion by Olympic champion Miloslav Mecir that top  players might simply drop the ATP tour, which starts in January, and  concentrate on the more lucrative Grand Slam events to allow themselves more  time off.  </P> <P> "I'd consider it quite seriously because the number of tournaments they (the  ATP) are asking is a bit too high, and if it doesn't change I'm definitely  going to do it some time in the future," said Lendl at the European Community  tennis championship.  </P> <P> But Lendl said he will wait to see how the first year of the ATP tour goes  before taking any further steps.  </P> <P> "I signed for the ATP tour because I think I should support it at least in the  first year and see what happens then in 1991," Lendl said.  </P> <P> Mecir said that the rules of the ATP tour, run by the players, are too strict  and that a Grand Slam circuit would suit the players much better.  </P> <P> "We would have more time for training and for relaxing and more time to  concentrate on the Grand Slams," he said.  </P> <P> A "Grand Slam tour" would comprise the four major tournaments -- the Australian  Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open -- plus a new Grand Slam Cup  with a purse of $6 million.  </P> <P> Players would also take part in Davis Cup matches, exhibition tournaments and  special events and would have more practice time and longer rest periods.  </P></p>

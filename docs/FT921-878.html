			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Anti-climax for the venture adventure - The sale of Hill Samuel's development capital arm VENTURE CAPITAL is acknowledged to be a risky business. The small, unquoted companies in which venture capitalists invest are more prone than their larger, quoted counterparts to go bust. But this week's decision by Hill Samuel, the hard-pressed merchant banking arm of the TSB banking group, to put its development capital arm up for sale, demonstrates that risk is not always in the most obvious place. Hill Samuel's move will have caused managers in the UK's other large bank-owned venture capital companies to ponder their parent company's commitment to the sector. Most of the large clearing and merchant banking groups have venture, or more usually, development capital arms. Many of the banks, like Hill Samuel, are nursing large provisions made necessary by losses in other areas. Hill Samuel decided to pull out of venture capital not because it was making losses  - the bank insists it was successful  - but because of a need to concentrate on activities with a more rapid pay-off. It expects to contract out the management of its portfolio. 'Business was going very well,' said Mr Andrew Joy, managing director of Hill Samuel Development Capital (HSDC). 'The TSB Group has decided to concentrate on businesses which don't require a medium-term view.' Hill Samuel is the first of the major UK banking groups to withdraw from venture capital. But this is the second time in just over a year that a UK-based venture capital company has fallen victim to a change of strategy at group headquarters. In February 1991 Security Pacific Hoare Govett Equity Ventures was closed down by Security Pacific as part of a restructuring of its worldwide operations, in spite of making Pounds 14m profit in the year before it closed. These two venture capital closures have come at a time of growing pressures on the industry. Ironically, most concern within the sector had been focused on the independent firms which have to raise their funds from fickle institutional investors. A growing number of the independents have been unable to raise new funds for investment and are now engaged in managing their existing portfolios until they mature. Further discreet withdrawals among the independents are expected. But Hill Samuel demonstrates that even venture capitalists within a large financial group cannot count on continued access to funds. HSDC's operations were very modest  - it had a fund of just Pounds 20m plus a further Pounds 100m allocation from Hill Samuel Bank  - so its disposal will not have a significant financial impact on the industry. But the decision to withdraw emphasises the uncertainty facing the sector, which has suffered a severe bruising over the past two years. In the early 1980s venture capital had a glamorous image and banks and other financial groups were only too keen to move into this market. But recently venture capital has been hit by a combination of self-inflicted blows and adverse developments beyond its control. It has: failed to deliver the annual returns of 30 to 40 per cent promised in the early 1980s; come under pressure from institutional investors to provide better value for money from the management fees it charges; suffered damage to its image as a backer of small business because of a shift in emphasis to large management buy-outs, some of which have run into difficulties; seen the recession batter the small and medium-sized companies in which it invests. After a decade of rapid growth the venture capital industry is now having to cope with the problems of retrenchment. The indications are that it will get worse before it gets better. This is the second timein just over a year thata UK-based venturecapital company hasfallen victim to achange of strategy atgroup headquarters</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL PTA, SCOUTS FEUD OVER PICKING TROOP LEADERS;  </P> <P> ORGANIZATIONS: NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OVER LIABILITY BREAK DOWN.  THE DISPUTE COULD SEVER LONGSTANDING LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS.  </P> <P> The Boy Scouts and the PTA, two "apple pie" groups, can't agree on who should  assume liability for any "bad apple" Scout leaders.  </P> <P> The California Congress of Parents, Teachers and Students Inc., the state PTA  organization, has told its local chapters to stop sponsoring Boy Scout troops  or Cub Scout packs.  </P> <P> Of 10,000 Scout units in California, about 600, mostly Cub Scout packs, are  currently sponsored by neighborhood school PTAs, according to Richard Parker,  assistant director of the Boys Scouts' Western region.  </P> <P> The action could sever relationships between school PTAs and Scout units, both  composed of parents usually from the same neighborhood, that have existed for  as long as half a century.  </P> <P> The California PTA action, contained in a memo this fall from state PTA  President Dorothy Leonard, came after the national PTA and the Boy Scouts  failed to reach agreement after more than a year of negotiations over who  should take responsibility for screening Scout leaders.  </P> <P> Each Scout troop or pack is sponsored or chartered by an organization, such as  a school PTA, church or civic club.  </P> <P> The Boy Scouts in 1988 wrote new charter application and renewal forms that  place the responsibility for screening, selecting and approving local Scout  leaders on the sponsoring organization.  </P> <P> "Our position is the sponsoring organization should be primarily responsible  for screening local Scout leader candidates. Who can better assess them?" said  Lee Sneath, Dallas publicist for the Boy Scouts.  </P> <P> National PTA President Manya Ungar wrote in an October, 1988, letter to state  and local PTAs, "In the view of our legal advisers this responsibility could  result in increased liability to PTA units, and possibly to their leaders,  should some unfortunate situation develop involving the leadership of the local  Scout organization."  </P> <P> The two national groups began negotiations in mid-1988 that continued through  this year. During that time, until July 1, 1989, the Boy Scouts agreed that the  use of the new forms would not change the relationship between the two groups  that existed before the forms were introduced.  </P> <P> However, since 1976 the California PTA has been using its own form for  sponsoring Boy Scouts and other youth groups. That form committed the local PTA  only to helping secure qualified adult leadership, helping arrange for a  meeting place and providing opportunities for youth service.  </P> <P> The July 1, 1989, deadline came without a resolution to the problem on the  national level.  </P> <P> The national PTA informed its state chapters of the deadlock and is leaving  decisions up to them.  </P> <P> "We have nothing that says they can or cannot sponsor Boy Scout troops. That's  up to the local units," said Tari Marshall, public relations director for the  national PTA.  </P> <P> She said a few states have recommended that local units not sign charters.  </P> <P> The Illinois PTA advised its local units not to sign Boy Scout charters in  October, 1988, said Illinois President Gretchen McDowell. "Our liability  insurance put a waiver in so it will not cover any Boy Scout activity."  </P> <P> "We know it's a very difficult issue. My kids were Boy Scouts. It has nothing  to do with a very fine organization, the Boy Scouts. It has to do with us  accepting responsibility for their leaders."  </P> <P> She said other youth groups, such as Girl Scouts, recruit and train their own  leaders and do not require sponsoring organizations to accept responsibility  for the leaders.  </P> <P> Leonard of the California PTA sent her letter to local units in September, just  as the school year began and many Scout troops and packs were organizing for  the year.  </P> <P> "Since no agreement between PTA and Boy Scouts has been reached, and since the  California State PTA youth group sponsorship form is no longer being accepted  by the Boy Scouts, PTA units in California are to refrain from signing any  youth group sponsorship form with the Boy Scouts of America," the letter  stated.  </P> <P> Leonard said she plans to meet with Parker, who is based in Sunnyvale, to try  to resolve the problem.  </P> <P> "We do have a problem, but we believe it can be worked out," said Parker, who  said the two groups are meeting both on the state and national level.  </P> <P> "We met in June, but you can't really call it negotiations," said Marshall of  the national PTA, based in Chicago. "The Boy Scouts have set up things the way  they want it set up. Really, it's up to Boy Scouts to come back to us if they  feel they want to make a change."  </P> <P> Parker notes that the Boy Scouts carries liability insurance for all its  registered leaders.  </P> <P> "Since the Boy Scouts was started, we have asked chartering partners to screen  or approve leaders," he said. "The leadership comes out of their neighborhoods  and they know them better than we do. We then train them."  </P> <P> He said if a school's PTA won't sponsor a Scout group, then a group of parents  in the neighborhood could get together and sign the charter.  </P> <P> "Not in one instance have we had a PTA say we don't like you and don't like the  program," said Parker.  </P></p>

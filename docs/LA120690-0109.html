			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BADER CONSIDERED FOR EQUALIZATION BOARD  </P> <P> Charles Bader, who lost a bitterly contested state Senate election last month  to incumbent Ruben S. Ayala, is among a handful of prospective nominees under  consideration by Gov.-elect Pete Wilson for a seat on the State Board of  Equalization, according to several Republican sources.  </P> <P> The seat is expected to become vacant after current board member Paul Carpenter  is sentenced next week for his conviction on felony charges in a federal  anti-corruption case.  </P> <P> Bader, a Pomona Republican who had served in the Assembly since 1982, said he  is interested in the seat but is uncertain whether he would accept the  nomination because of doubts that a Republican could win in the heavily  Democratic board district.  </P> <P> "I have mixed emotions on it," Bader said. "It's an important job, but on the  other hand, party registration would make it difficult for a Republican to get  elected."  </P> <P> The district that Carpenter has represented since 1987 encompasses about  two-thirds of Los Angeles County, including the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> A former Pomona mayor, Bader gave up his Assembly seat to challenge Ayala  (D-Chino) in a race that attracted statewide attention. Ayala narrowly won.  </P> <P> Bader said he has not spoken to Wilson directly about the board job. But he  acknowledged that Ernest Dronenburg, a Republican member of the board, sounded  him out recently about his interest in the appointment, which would require  confirmation by the Legislature.  </P> <P> The Board of Equalization, a five-member panel composed of four members elected  from districts and the state controller, decides tax cases ranging from  individual income tax appeals to multimillion-dollar corporate tax disputes. A  board seat pays $95,052 a year and includes a state-provided automobile and  personal staff.  </P> <P> The Republican sources, who asked not to be identified, said names of other  people that have surfaced for the board post include state Sen. Frank Hill of  Whittier; Matthew K. Fong of Hacienda Heights, who ran unsuccessfully for state  controller in November; Sen. Robert G. Beverly of Manhattan Beach; and Oscar  Wright, a U.S. Small Business Administration regional administrator based in  San Francisco. All are Republicans.  </P> <P> Bill Livingstone, Wilson's transition office press secretary, said he could not  confirm names under consideration. Livingstone said Wilson's attention is  focused on selecting people for higher-profile positions -- including the U.S.  Senate seat he must give up before his inauguration as governor next month --  and on putting together a state budget.  </P> <P> Hill, who after several years in the Assembly won his Senate seat in a special  election earlier this year, said he was not interested in the board seat.  </P> <P> Fong expressed interest in the slot, saying he wants to sit on the board "to  make California a more hospitable place for business." Fong, the son of  Democratic Secretary of State March Fong Eu, said he has lobbied Wilson for the  appointment.  </P> <P> Beverly said: "My quick reaction is that I would be interested, mostly because  it is something different. I've been (in the Legislature) a long time."  </P> <P> Beverly, who was elected state senator in 1976 after 10 years in the Assembly,  said that he has not spoken to Wilson's transition staff about the appointment  and that he is "not actively seeking" it.  </P> <P> Wright said he is pleased with his current job, which Wilson helped him obtain,  but would consider an appointment to the board. He added that his candidacy is  being promoted by other black Republicans in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Even before the recent passage of Proposition 140, which limits legislative  terms, jobs on the Board of Equalization were increasingly attracting the  interest of lawmakers.  </P> <P> Though the post does not carry the prestige and public visibility of a  legislative seat, historically it has offered more job security. Once elected  or appointed, incumbents have rarely been defeated.  </P> <P> The most recent example of the security of incumbency was offered by Carpenter,  a former Democratic state senator from Cypress. He easily won reelection in  November to a second four-year term despite being convicted in September in  U.S. District Court on four counts of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy.  Carpenter's reelection was attributed, in part, to the heavily Democratic  nature of his district.  </P> <P> Under state law, he must formally forfeit the seat when he is sentenced Monday.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Virginia Ellis contributed to this story.  </P></p>

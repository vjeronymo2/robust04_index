			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Uranium dispute delays signing of accord A dispute over uranium sales is delaying the signing of a comprehensive trade and co-operation accord between the EU and Russia, EU officials said yesterday, AP reports from Brussels. Moscow wants to increase its sale of uranium under the terms of the proposed accord. France, meanwhile, is seeking more protection for its own producers. Signing of the accord was twice postponed last year. The EU's top trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, yesterday urged the west to do more to help eastern Europe and Russia.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US price boost for Canadian lumber A SURGE in North American lumber prices to near-record levels is bringing some welcome relief to Canada's hard-pressed forestry industry but signals an unusual degree of uncertainty about future timber supplies. MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry group, reported last week that lumber was the only one of its major products for which prices had advanced in the past year. Despite the continuing lull in the US and Canadian economies, Madison's Canadian Lumber Reporter this week quotes the price on 2 x 4 inch planks from the west coast at USDollars 240 per 1,000 board feet, up from Dollars 201 a month ago and Dollars 156 at this time last year. The jump, which has been mirrored on futures markets in Chicago, has brought prices within a few dollars of record levels. The increase has occurred despite demand for timber remaining subdued. Mr Roy Carroll, president of Angus Forest Products, a Toronto-based wholesaler, says that 'there's quite a lot of anticipation, but so far we haven't seen it take hold'. This 'anticipation' reflects low interest rates and President Bush's proposal of a Dollars 5,000 tax credit for first-time home-buyers. Housing starts, which were running at an annual rate of 1.1m last December, are expected to climb to at least 1.2m this year. Mr Tom Martin, a Chicago lumber analyst, says many timber dealers are covering their entire expected commitments for the spring construction season in the cash market to protect themselves against possible price increases in May or June. Prices of the 2 x 10 inch planks used mainly in housing have risen even faster than the 2 x 4 inch. According to Madison's, they are changing hands at about Dollars 294 per 1,000 board feet, up from Dollars 170 a year ago. But most of the impetus for the price jump has come from supply uncertainties. Late in 1991 the US Forest Service virtually stopped sales of timber from government-owned forests in Oregon and Washington in response to environmental pressures to protect the northern spotted owl and other wildlife. More than 5 per cent of total US timber production is expected to be withdrawn between the second half of 1992 and the end of 1993. The future pricing of Canadian lumber has been thrown into doubt by a heated trade dispute stemming from Ottawa's removal last October of a 15 per cent export tax on shipments to the US. The tax was imposed in 1986 to forestall a US countervailing duty against low stumpage (tree-cutting) fees charged in provincially-owned forests. Some provinces have subsequently raised these fees. But US lumber producers are now also complaining that British Columbia's curbs on unprocessed log exports amounts to a subsidy. By not allowing them to bid for the logs, the US industry contends that the restrictions keep prices low for Canadian sawmills. The US International Trade Commission issued a preliminary ruling in December that the low stumpage charges were still injuring US lumber producers. The Commerce Department is due to issue a final ruling on March 5, which could be followed by a countervailing duty of as much as 20 per cent. Mr Martin estimates that fears of a countervailing duty have added Dollars 10 to Dollars 15 per 1,000 board feet to current lumber prices. Sawmills in British Columbia warned customers last week that they will be expected to absorb any new duties.</p>

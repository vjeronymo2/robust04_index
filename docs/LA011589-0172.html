			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE RISES UP, DOWNS SAN JOSE  </P> <P> UC Irvine, the groundhogs of college basketball, dug another deep hole Saturday  night, but this time the Anteaters managed to burrow out and bask in the light  of a victory for a change.  </P> <P> The Anteaters trailed San Jose State, 10-3, before rallying for a 71-62 Big  West victory over the Spartans in front of 1,166 at San Jose Civic Auditorium.  </P> <P> Irvine (4-8 overall and 1-2 in the Big West) gained its first road victory  since winning here last Feb. 15. The struggling Spartans fell to 5-10 and 1-5  in conference.  </P> <P> "Both of these teams desperately needed a win," Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan  said. "We were fortunate enough to get it. Every time we come up here, it's a  war. I'm absolutely delighted with the win."  </P> <P> Coming into the game, Mulligan was more worried about his team's mental state  than its ability to run, jump, shoot and defend.  </P> <P> "This whole thing has become a mind game with us," he said while relaxing in a  hotel Jacuzzi before the game. "We need to take a psychiatrist on the road with  us."  </P> <P> "The Dok" was in Saturday night, but it was 6-foot 9-inch senior Mike  Doktorczyk, not an analyst, who got the job done for Irvine. Doktorczyk led  Irvine with 19 points and 10 rebounds, and, perhaps most important, he made 8  consecutive free throws in the final 7 minutes.  </P> <P> It's not especially difficult to understand how the Anteaters won this game.  They were 25 of 26 at the free-throw line and made 6-of-11 3-point attempts.  Add that to the fact San Jose State guard Steve Haney, who came in with a  19-point-per-game average, managed just 4 points and you get an Irvine win.  </P> <P> But this was not your standard Anteater victory -- if there is such a thing  when you've only won 4 games all season. Irvine's top 3 scorers -- Doktorczyk  and guards Kevin Floyd and Rod Palmer -- were a combined 12 of 31 from the  field. Palmer finished with 16 points and Floyd had just 11.  </P> <P> Forward Jeff Herdman, who had not started since the first game of the season,  earned his starting spot back and made the most of it. The 6-6 sophomore from  Mission Viejo made 6 of 7 shots from the floor -- including 3 of 3 from 3-point  range -- and tied his career high with 15 points. He also had 5 rebounds.  </P> <P> And the Anteaters excelled in a couple of facets of the game that they often  choose to ignore . . . like rebounding and defense.  </P> <P> The Anteaters, who have been outrebounded by an average of 5 per game, beat the  Spartans on the boards to the tune of 34-21, including a 19-9 first-half margin  that helped them take a 34-31 lead at the intermission.  </P> <P> Irvine also managed to hold San Jose far below the 96-point average opponents  have been scoring this season. And the Spartans' 45% field-goal percentage,  while certainly respectable, was considerably less than Irvine's opponent  average of 52%.  </P> <P> "We worked our butts off on the boards," Doktorczyk said. "Santa Barbara killed  us on the boards last Saturday so we've really been working on it.  </P> <P> "I told Kevin (Floyd) at halftime that we couldn't let this game come down to  the wire."  </P> <P> Irvine led by as many as 13 early in the second half, but the Spartans cut the  lead to 4 (55-51) with 3:47 remaining. The Anteaters made 12 free throws  without a miss and Floyd scored on 2 coast-to-coast driving layups to seal the  victory.  </P> <P> "If Irvine hadn't shot quite so well at the line and on 3-pointers, it might  have been a different story," Spartan Coach Bill Berry said. "I'm not sure what  to say about us except that we're going to have to make some changes.  </P> <P> "Our effort was pretty good, but we forced some shots and missed some layups."  </P> <P> Forward Dietrich Waters led San Jose with 19 points and 6 rebounds. Reserve  Tony Farmer (12 points) was the only other Spartan in double figures. Haney's  off night left a huge void in San Jose's offensive attack.  </P> <P> "Steve just sort of took himself out of the game emotionally," Berry said.  "They did an OK job of defending him, but he was just flat tonight. There were  a lot of times he passed up shots. We need him to shoot."  </P> <P> Palmer was guarding Haney most of the night and admited that he was surprised  as anyone the San Jose guard attempted just 7 shots and only a single  3-pointer. Haney had attempted 94 3-pointers before Saturday night.  </P> <P> "I was expecting him to shoot the lights out. . . . any time he wanted from  anywhere on the floor," Palmer said. "We knew they were going to use a lot of  double picks to free him up, and I just tried to beat him to the spot. But I  was really surprised he didn't shoot more."  </P> <P> Indeed, it was a somewhat strange game. But Irvine isn't complaining. The  Anteaters get the rare opportunity to enjoy a road victory. . . . for one day,  anyway. Monday night, they travel to Logan, Utah to meet Utah State, a team  that was also celebrating Saturday night. The Aggies defeated previously  unbeaten UC Santa Barbara, 78-65.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sergey Baburin, MP, a leader of the Russian  All-People's League, officially left the opposition movement  Concord for Russia.    Vasiliy Lipitskiy, chairman of the Social-Democratic Popular  Party of Russia, told journalists that Baburin had made his move  following the State Duma's vote Wednesday on the 1994 budget.  Communist Party and Agrarian Party leaders Gennadiy Zyuganov and  Mikhail Lapshin voted for the budget draft while Baburin  rejected it.    Baburin jointly with former Russian vice-president Aleksandr  Rutskoy, Zyuganov, Lapshin, Constitutional Court Justice Valeriy  Zorkin and the Duma's Economic Policy Committee Chairman Sergey  Glazyev founded the Concord for Russia opposition movement and  attended last May's session of the movement's National Council.    A week later he said in Novosibirsk, however, that the  Russian All-People's League would not support Rutskoy, who could  become the opposition candidate in the coming presidential  elections.</p>

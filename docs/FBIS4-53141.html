			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Vietnam and Myanmar [Burma] are two countries in  Southeast Asia which have traditional relations. The late  President of Vietnam Ho Chi Minh visited Myanmar 35 years ago,  and that visit was a turning point in the road of mutual  understanding between the two nations.    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit also left a deep  impression on the Myanmar people. Despite the changing weather,  thousands of people in their colorful traditional costumes,  lined up along the road leading to the center of Rangoon to  welcome Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his party. On the very  first day of his visit, all newspapers in Myanmar frontpaged  portrait and biography of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. They also  carried editorials praising relations between the two countries.    Various meetings among state leaders of the two countries  took place in the atmosphere of mutual understanding. Future  economic and trade cooperation between Vietnam and Myanmar was  an important topic at the talks. An agreement on trade was  signed in 1976, but trade turnover was very modest, mainly in  exchange of consumer goods and family facilities. Therefore,  this time both Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his  Myanmar counterpart Than Shwe expressed the determination to  further strengthen cooperative relations between the two  countries.    Prime Minister Than Shwe said that he has been following,  with keen interest, the successful process of renovation in  Vietnam. He said that there was no obstacle for Myanmar to  develop its relations with Vietnam.    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: Vietnam always attaches  great importance to the development of more bilateral  cooperation with Myanmar. An agreement on trade, tourism  cooperation and the establishment of a joint commission of  bilateral cooperation was signed during the visit. It is the  concrete manifestation of the two countries' determination.    Myanmar is now in its process of renovation. Hence, Vietnam  and Myanmar share much in common. The existing fine relations  between Vietnam and Myanmar and the outcome of the visit by  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will usher in a new stage of  relations and cooperation between the two countries. This was  assessed by the foreign ministers of Vietnam and Myanmar. And  now the two nations are trying their best to make their  cooperation more effective and fruitful.</p>

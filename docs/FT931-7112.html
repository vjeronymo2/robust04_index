			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Indian security forces thwart BJP mass rally INDIAN security forces yesterday thwarted an attempt by militant Hindus to hold a banned mass rally in New Delhi, at the cost of bringing the capital to a virtual standstill. Some 80,000 police and troops kept demonstrators out of the city centre, forcing thousands of protesters to gather instead at five points where they staged noisy rallies and fought running battles with security forces for much of the day. Thousands of protesters were detained, including Mr LK Advani and other leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the right-wing Hindu party which organised the rally. The BJP said 50 demonstrators were injured, among them Mr MM Joshi, the party president, who was taken to hospital with head injuries. The BJP claimed success in having forced the government to deploy so many police and troops. Mr Advani said the government had gone 'berserk' and had 'let loose a reign of terror' in the city. The BJP said 100,000 supporters had taken to the streets, though the figure was difficult to substantiate. Crowds at the biggest rallying point, in the BJP stronghold of Rajinder Nagar, numbered no more than 10,000. The ruling Congress (I) party blamed the BJP for the disruption and said the rally had been a 'complete failure and a flop'. It said the rally had been banned because of the threat to public order. Although the BJP had promised to stage a peaceful event, the government is wary after its supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque last December and set off nationwide inter-religious violence. The BJP staged the demonstration to press demands for lifting bans on Hindu militant organisations proscribed after the Ayodhya incident, including the RSS, a shadowy group from which many of the BJP's own cadres are drawn. The BJP wants elections in the four states in which BJP-controlled assemblies were suspended after the mosque's destruction, and are also seeking a general election. It is not clear how much yesterday's protests will have advanced the BJP's cause. Some New Delhi residents blamed the party for disrupting their daily lives, but others condemned the government. BJP officials plan to decide their next step today. The rally showed the BJP's organisational power and the dedication of its supporters. Because of the government ban, supporters had to smuggle their way into the city in ones and twos, then keep a low profile until yesterday. They were housed and fed for up to five days by party supporters in the capital. Among these was Mr Ramesh Babu, owner of a small bookbinding business, who said 25 people slept in his home. 'I was proud to do it,' said Mr Babu, who attended the rally. The demonstrators travelled from as far away as Kerala, in the southern tip of India. They were young and old, with a strong middle-class element - including a tax consultant from Madras, a marine engineer from Bombay and a lawyer from Rajasthan. Their common wish was to give India a greater sense of identity as a Hindu nation. They said this meant removing privileges given to India's Moslems, notably the right to observe Islamic civil laws. Harking on a standard BJP theme, Mr Babu added that India's Moslems could not be fully trusted because they favoured Pakistan.</p>

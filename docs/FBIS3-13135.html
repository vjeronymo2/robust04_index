			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Text] Two Palestinian commissions of inquiry into the  Hebron massacre are currently operating in Hebron: one set up on  5 March by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and the other appointed  by the Islamic administration in Jerusalem.    The investigation of the Islamic commission focuses on three  aspects. The first regards the guard procedures at the Cave of  the Patriarchs by the Islamic Waqf and the Israel Defense Forces  [IDF] prior to and on the day of the massacre. The commission  found that the four IDF soldiers who were present at the site  during the massacre fled from the cave as soon as the shooting  was heard. The other issue this committee is investigating is  the events during the massacre, mainly those pertaining to the  evacuation and treatment of the wounded. The committee found  that IDF soldiers fired at the Palestinians who wanted to  evacuate the wounded and at ambulances. This caused a delay of  more than one hour in the evacuation, which caused the death of  some of the casualties. The third issue under the commission's  investigation deals with events during the two days following  the massacre, the manner in which hospitals treated the wounded  from the cave, and casualties from IDF soldiers' fire during  clashes in the city.    Palestinian sources from Hebron associated with the Islamic  commission have said that the commission obtained a document  which contains a plan by the Jewish settlers to push the Muslims  out of the Cave of the Patriarchs. According to the sources,  Supreme Court President Me'ir Shamgar, head of the Israeli  commission of inquiry, has, through intermediaries, requested a  copy of the document. The members of the Islamic committee have  not yet decided whether to accept the request, the sources said.    The committee appointed by the PLO is about to present an  official request to Israel's top echelons -- including Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin; Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of  the IDF units in the West Bank; and Brigadier General Gadi  Zohar, head of the Civil Administration -- asking for permission  to collect testimonies from IDF soldiers who were at the Cave of  the Patriarchs and its vicinity.    The PLO committee, the headquarters of which are located at  the Hebron Academics Association building, has so far collected  40 testimonies of Palestinians who were present during the  massacre, 12 testimonies of people who were wounded during the  massacre, and the testimonies of four Islamic Waqf guards who  were at the site during the massacre. The committee has also  drafted charts of the site and the circumstances of the  massacre. The committee's findings will be handed over to the  PLO Executive Committee in Tunis.    The PLO committee is made up of 11 Hebron residents: five  lawyers (including two former judges), three physicians, an  engineer, a surveyor, and Shaykh Muhammad Nazim Tahbub, the  Hebron area mufti, who is also a member of the Islamic  commission board. The committee is headed by Attorney Hashim  al-Qawasmi, a former district court judge and West Bank district  attorney. It also includes engineer Mustafa al-Natshah, former  Hebron mayor and a leading Fatah public figure in the region.    The PLO committee is divided into four subcommittees, each  having a separate area of investigation. A subcommittee  investigating the legal aspects, assigned with conducting a  debriefing of the chain of events during the massacre and after  it, has so far collected 40 testimonies of Palestinians who were  at the Cave of the Patriarchs during the massacre. A medical  subcommittee is examining the issue of the massacre fatalities  and is questioning the wounded. A technical subcommittee is  examining the site layout, and preparing drafts and diagrams. A  shari'a (Muslim-religious) subcommittee is dealing with the Cave  of the Patriarchs status as a holy site and the ritual  procedures in it. Attorney Hashim al-Qawasmi, committee head,  said yesterday he believes the committee will end its work in  two weeks.    The Islamic committee is made up of four members, all  residents of Hebron: an attorney, a university professor, and  two clergymen. Two members of the committee, including Dr. 'Aziz  Duwayk, who was deported to south Lebanon, are supporters of  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The head of the committee  is Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Muhtasib, the Hebron shari'a qadi  (ruling on Islamic laws). The committee was set up the day  after the massacre by the Higher Islamic Council and the Muslim  Waqf Council in Jerusalem.    The members of the committee collected 30 testimonies of  eyewitnesses and Cave of the Patriarchs Waqf officials. It  intends to question Palestinian casualties who are hospitalized  in al-Muqasid in Jerusalem and government hospitals in Bayt Jala  and Ramallah. The committee has asked the Civil Administration  for permits to leave the Hebron area, which is under curfew, and  travel to the government hospitals to collect testimonies there.  This committee has stated, giving a preliminary figure, that 36  Palestinians were killed on the day of the massacre by Barukh  Goldstein and IDF soldiers' fire throughout Hebron. The  committee will soon publish its findings.</p>

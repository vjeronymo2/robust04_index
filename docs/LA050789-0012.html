			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS: A L'ORANGE;  </P> <P> THE FRESHEST COLOR IN FASHION INSPIRES A TANGY NEW TWIST IN MAKEUP SHADES  </P> <P> ORANGE -- A COLOR born in Southern California -- is emerging as a major  spring/summer fashion shade. Now orange lipstick, nail polish, blusher and even  eye shadow are part of the trend. As Vivian Behrens, vice president of  marketing for Estee Lauder, says: "Orange is going through a major  reawakening."  </P> <P> Once pegged as a makeup color for casual, beachy, California types, orange  became sophisticated and internationally important last fall when French and  Italian designers showed their purple and khaki spring fashions on models  wearing orange cosmetics.  </P> <P> Jean Paul Gaultier not only featured orange on his models' lips and eyelids but  also scattered a few "I Love Lucy" redheads throughout his fashion show.  Gianfranco Ferre used deep mango and persimmon shades on lips and nails to  accent his elegant evening gowns and swimwear. And New York's pricey designers  -- Donna Karan, Louis Dell'Olio for Anne Klein and the upstart Isaac Mizrahi --  all have used orange as a spring staple.  </P> <P> In the past, many women would not wear orange clothes because the yellow  undertones in pumpkin-orange seemed to drain their complexions of color. But  this season, fashion designers are using oranges that are rich with red or gold  undertones. With the right makeup, the new oranges can make skin tones come  alive.  </P> <P> Estee Lauder is offering bold oranges in its Heading West and Perfect Lipsticks  collections. Behrens of Estee Lauder reports that consumers are eagerly opting  for the bright new oranges. A new Lauder moisturizing lipstick called Perfect  Orange has been a sell-out success in every store that carries it, she says.  </P> <P> "The sun-streaked look is hot right now, and the trend is going to continue  through the summer," Behrens says, adding that touches of orange makeup are the  perfect complement to the sunny look.  </P> <P> Clinique's newest shades include Sun Tang, a rich coral lipstick pencil with a  built-in sun-protection factor.  </P> <P> Princess Marcella Borghese's Tangeri is a deep, true-orange lip color that is  sold in the same collection with orange eye shadow from Borghese's Solare  collection.  </P> <P> In its see-through tube, Sunshine gloss from Christian Dior looks just like  Crayola orange, but on the lips it becomes a sheer, golden tint. Yves Saint  Laurent's summer line features a lip and nail color called Golden Apricot.  </P> <P> Max Factor's Chameleon, a versatile coral, can be worn with pink and red  outfits as well as with shades of orange. Maybelline is promoting mocha- and  ginger-color lipstick that is worn with apricot blusher.  </P> <P> Whether intense or barely there, the overall effect of beauty's new oranges is  decidedly tawny yet sophisticated. As Gale Hayman, the Beverly Hills cosmetics  manufacturer, says: "This is the look that started in California and came back  via Paris."  </P> <P> Model: Nancy Sheppard / Prima; makeup: Dominic Cervantes / Zenobia; stylist:  Karen O'Neill  </P></p>

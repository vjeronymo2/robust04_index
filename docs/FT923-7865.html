			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Sharpest jobless rise in south UNEMPLOYMENT continued to grow more rapidly in the south of England than elsewhere in the UK between June and July, according to the Department of Employment. Of the 29,100 seasonally adjusted increase in the number of claimants over 18 recorded in the month to July 9, 16,100 occurred in regions south of a line from the Wash to the Bristol Channel. Unemployment in the south-east, including greater London, is running at record levels. Just over 30 per cent of UK unemployment is now con-centrated in the south-east, where the seasonally adjusted jobless figure was 845,300 last month. Unemployment in greater London was 427,600, or 10.6 per cent of the area's workforce. In the UK as a whole last month's seasonally adjusted jobless total was 2.75m, or 9.7 per cent. Recorded unemployment is much higher among men. The latest figures put the seasonally adjusted male jobless total at 2.11m in July, or 13 per cent, against female unemployment of 644,600, or 5.3 per cent. Yesterday's figures nonetheless suggested that the rise in unemployment may be past the worst. Last month's increase was sharply lower than the seasonally adjusted jump of 69,600 in July last year. The average monthly increase of 19,400 in the last three months was well down on the 29,400 monthly increase in the three months to April. In addition, the number of employees in manufacturing industry in June fell by only 2,000 to 4.52m, the smallest such decline since July 1990.  --------------------------------------------          UK UNEMPLOYMENT: July 1992  -------------------------------------------- Northern Ireland                14.7% North                           11.2% west Midlands                   10.6% north-west                      10.5% Yorks &amp; Humber                   9.8% Wales                            9.6% Scotland                         9.5% south-east                       9.3% south-west                       9.1% east Midlands                    8.8% East Anglia                      7.6% UK                               9.7%  -------------------------------------------- Seasonally adjusted  --------------------------------------------</p>

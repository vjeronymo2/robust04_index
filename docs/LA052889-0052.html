			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE IN 'FAST LANE'  </P> <P> "Fast-Lane Environments" predicting that future commuters will ignore clean air  plans and spend more time "car-cooning" on the freeways was dismaying at the  very least.  </P> <P> As a newcomer to Southern California, I've received an overwhelming impression  of a public longing for a solution to jammed freeways and smog and willing to  abide by rules and regulations if fairly applied.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, a dearth of leadership means there is no one in government or  the press with the guts to demand that the people be  </P> <P> served.  </P> <P> We could start by insisting that the automotive designers -- so intent upon  providing us with car phone, fax &amp; TV -- give us a small one-person  commuter vehicle that would not only conserve fuel but would save room on the  highways. And, oh yes -- It could be made comfortable as well.  </P> <P> MARGARET SMITH  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

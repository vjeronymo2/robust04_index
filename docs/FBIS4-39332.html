			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen authorities have denied ex-speaker of  the Russian parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov the right to live in  their republic. During a joint meeting of the Chechen  government, parliament and security council, the residence right  was also denied to some Chechen opposition leaders engaged in  illegal activity.    The Chechen Foreign Ministry told Interfax that the list of  people accused of anti-Chechen activity and collaboration with  the Russian imperial forces included Doka Zavgayev, the last  Chechen-Ingush Communist Party leader who lives in Moscow, and  Yaragi Mamadayev, the head of the Government of People's Trust  he has established on his own.    The joint session adopted a resolution which says that the  leaders of the opposition, in conjunction with the Russian  leadership, had drafted plans for the elimination of independent  Chechnya.    It also says that these plans included the introduction of a  state of emergency in a part of Ingushetia's Sunzhen and  Malgobek regions bordering on Chechnya, and the attempted  assassination of President Dudayev.    The Chechen Foreign Ministry also alleges that on the eve of  the opposition congress, which was to be held last Saturday in  Chechnya's Nadterechnyy Region, Russian troops were concentrated  near the Chechen borders, and 26 helicopters were put in a state  of combat readiness in North Ossetia.    "The aggressive plans were a failure because the congress  was  not held in the absence of the quorum," said a representative of  the Chechen president's staff.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Booker at Pounds 87m and debt cut The first fruits of the new management regime at Booker, the food group, were shown in a 1993 rise in profits from Pounds 67.9m to Pounds 86.9m. The figures were struck after losses on disposals of Pounds 2.8m, against Pounds 2.5m. Underlying earnings per share rose by 16.8 per cent to 28.5p, covering a maintained total dividend of 21.75p by 1.3 times. Mr Charles Bowen, the chief executive who joined the group last summer, said the group had begun to meet its three prime objectives of generating more cash, increasing the focus of the group, and improving head office control of the business. Investors were surprised by the reduction in net debt the group had achieved, with borrowings down from Pounds 155m to Pounds 125.7m, cutting gearing from 95 to 71 per cent. The shares rose 18p to 429p, against the market trend. Mr Bowen said further sales of small, non-core activities could be expected this year, with some likely soon. Booker would concentrate on three areas, food distribution, processed food and fish, and agriculture. He said after cutting debt by Pounds 29.3m in 1993, there were aggressive targets to cut working capital further in 1994. Capital expenditure would not be cut, indeed investment hurdle rates had been reduced from 25 to 15 per cent. Group sales were 3.7 per cent up at Pounds 3.57bn, and operating profits rose 5.6 per cent to Pounds 103m. Profits from continuing operations were 10.4 per cent up at 100.2m. Interest took Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 20.6m). Food distribution profits rose 13.7 per cent to Pounds 48.1m despite flat sales in the UK. Costs were cut and there was strong growth in Portugal. Profits from the food service division, which suffered severe problems at Booker Fitch in 1992, recovered to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 9.6m). Fish processing profits were flat at Pounds 8.4m, while prepared foods profits fell from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 13m as margins were squeezed by supermarkets. Changes in demand patterns for chicken meat hit profits from US agribusiness, down from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 6.8m. But in the UK a recovery in salmon farming and the devaluation of the green pound lifted profits from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 9.3m. COMMENT Mr Bowen appears to be working wonders already at Booker, if only by giving investors pleasant rather than nasty surprises. These figures showed a new clarity and also demonstrated how getting basic things right could transform cash flow. That said, the trading environment is still poor and profits are unlikely to rise much this year, perhaps to about Pounds 92m pre-tax. However, the quality of earnings is improving more rapidly than the quantity, and though the prospective p/e of around 15 is not particularly attractive, a yield of 6.3 per cent - which looks increasingly secure - is and the shares should rise with Booker's credibility.</p>

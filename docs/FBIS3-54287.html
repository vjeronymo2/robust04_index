			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riyadh, Jan 25 (AFP)--PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat has  sealed a reconciliation with Saudi King Fahd in a bid to revive  political and financial backing from the oil-rich Gulf  monarchies, Palestinian officials said Tuesday.    "This meeting was a success. It opens a new page in  relations between the two sides," said an aide to 'Arafat.    King Fahd and the PLO chairman spent an hour on Monday  "reviewing bilateral relations and developments in the Middle  East peace process, especially the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy  negotiations," he said, declining to be named.    Saudi television showed footage of the meeting but there was  no comment from officials in Riyadh, which has spurned the PLO  for the past three years for siding with Iraq during the Gulf  crisis.    "King Fahd expressed his support and that of the Saudi  Government to the Palestinian cause and people," senior PLO  official Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh told reporters.    A Palestinian diplomat added: "The meeting was very friendly  and it helped to blow away the summer storm in bilateral  relations. The future is promising."    On Tuesday, 'Arafat met Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz, who  is the emir of Riyadh and an influential member of the royal  family who heads a Saudi committee in charge of collecting funds  for the Palestinians.    'Arafat later visited the mausoleum of the Prophet Muhammad  in the western town of Medina and was to leave for Egypt to meet  President Husni Mubarak for further talks on the launch of  Palestinian self-rule.    On Sunday, he made a pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrines  in  Mecca.    Since the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, 'Arafat was not  welcome in Saudi Arabia because of the Palestinians' support for  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn.    Saudi Arabia, which had been the PLO's principal financial  backer, cut off its annual 85.5-million-dollar subsidy in  retaliation.    'Arafat last met King Fahd on August 8, 1990, six days after  the invasion, and failed to persuade him to agree to an "Arab"  solution to end the crisis instead of a Western military  intervention.    The king spurned 'Arafat's initiative, and a US-led  multinational coalition used Saudi Arabia as its launching pad  for "Operation Desert Storm" which drove the Iraqis out of  Kuwait in February 1991.    Fellow Gulf monarchies also cut off aid to the PLO,  triggering a financial crisis within the organisation.    But the Saudi authorities allowed Prince Salman's committee  to continue its work after the war, collecting 10 million  dollars a year in voluntary contributions and deductions from  the salaries of Palestinian workers.    By 1993 the kingdom had begun to soften its stance, pledging  100 million dollars to help implement Palestinian autonomy  starting in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank region of Jericho.    "Relations with Saudi Arabia are a top priority for us," a  Palestinian diplomat said.    Attempts for a reconciliation a year ago fell apart when  'Arafat received the "Mother of All Battles" medal from Saddam  in Baghdad.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation is anxious to restore  close ties with the kingdom, which is seen as the leader of the  Gulf Arab states and would be a powerful ally as the PLO tries  to launch its self-rule deal with Israel.    In September, 'Arafat visited Oman, the first Gulf monarchy  to ease strains with the PLO. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain  and Qatar have also improved ties, but Kuwait insists on an  official apology before it "forgives" 'Arafat.</p>

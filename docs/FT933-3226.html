			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Usdaw voting boost for Smith MR JOHN SMITH yesterday won a potentially significant victory in his battle to introduce one-member-one-vote in the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates. The Labour leader's campaign is opposed by some of the biggest unions affiliated to the party. The executive of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union which is the sixth-largest affiliate to the party, decided that the union's delegation to the party conference at the end of the month should be free to back Mr Smith's reform proposals. Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary and a keen supporter of Mr Smith, said that as the vote at the union's conference had not considered Mr Smith's latest formula, the delegation should be free to back the leader. The formula gives trade unionists who pay the political levy a cheap way to become full party members. The move will cause some ill-feeling in the union because its conference voted against an earlier version of the Smith formula. But Mr Davies is expected to get his own way. Attention will now focus on whether leaders of Nupe, the public services union, can make a similar shift. Even if both Usdaw and Nupe do shift their votes, Mr Smith is not assured of success. He will have to rely on either greater than expected support for his reforms from constituency parties, or a stalemate in which no position wins, allowing him to impose his wishes on the party.</p>

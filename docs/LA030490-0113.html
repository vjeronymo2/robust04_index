			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL KINSHIP, KEY TO SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: THE SOURCE OF WEALTH IS NOW KNOWLEDGE AND KNOW-HOW. THE WORLD HAS  REASON, ROOM AND RESOURCES TO STOP WAGING WAR.  </P> <P> It is humbling to face the fact that virtually none of the crucial events of  recent decades -- the Nazi-Soviet pact, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan's rise to  economic leadership, the advent of glasnost, perestroika and the unraveling of  communist hegemony in Central-Eastern Europe, to name several -- were  anticipated. Accordingly, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that what we  can most confidently expect is the unexpected.  </P> <P> If we recognize and accept the reality that we cannot reliably predict future  events, should ordinary people be expected to sacrifice their lives and  liberties in pursuit of certain ends that are likely to prove unattainable?  Halina Bortnowska, a lay Catholic who has advocated the causes of Polish  steelworkers, is unequivocal: "We're not laboratory rats here, and really,  we've had enough of grand experiments. Truly, one mustn't experiment with the  lives of people who have only one life to live."  </P> <P> Oliver Cromwell said essentially the same thing to the General Assembly of the  Church of Scotland on Aug, 3, 1650: "My brethren, I beseech you, in the bowels  of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken." Much more so than in  Cromwell's time, it behooves us to think of the possibility of being mistaken  -- to guard against any dogma or set of beliefs that we have elevated above  reappraisal. In a world changing infinitely more rapidly than Cromwell's, dogma  must give way to working hypotheses.  </P> <P> One such hypothesis centers on the widely and loudly acclaimed "people power."  This power was dramatically manifested in 1989 with the breaching of the Berlin  Wall, the toppling of communist rule in Poland, Hungary, East Germany and  Czechoslovakia -- and the clamorous assertiveness of subject nationalities,  including Hungarians in Romania, Romanians in Soviet Moldavia, Germans in  Poland and Ukrainians and Muslim Central Asians in the Soviet Union. People  power also overthrew the shah in Iran, Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua, Ferdinand  E. Marcos in the Philippines and fueled popular movements against apartheid in  South Africa and against communist gerontocracy in China.  </P> <P> We are witnessing, then, a participatory impulse on a global scale and not only  in politics but in all aspects of life, whether in the family, in the  classroom, in gender relations, in the workplace or in environmental affairs.  </P> <P> This participatory impulse, it should be noted, is discernible throughout  history, or at least since the appearance of the state, with its division of  rulers and ruled. Since then, the most influential society of each historical  period has been the one that reduced the gap between top and bottom by raising  the level of mass participation. In so doing, these pioneering societies  attained a qualitatively superior social cohesion and dynamism, enabling them  to prevail over all other contemporary societies and to stamp their imprint on  their times.  </P> <P> In our time, we have developed the technological capacity to build a new world  but have failed to evolve the social capacity for making it a world worth  living in. We now face the formidable task of taming our creation --  technology. In his later years, Bertrand Russell was skeptical that humans were  up to such a task. He viewed the antics of his fellow humans as comparable to  those of "apes playing with matches on a petrol dump."  </P> <P> Russell's apprehension may prove justified. Yet a historical perspective that  encompasses millions of years of prehistory and millennia of history adds three  basic and positive factors to the equation: the "non-zero-sum effect," the  "guillotine effect" and the "Paleolithic heritage."  </P> <P> The "non-zero-sum effect" refers to new social relationships made available,  for the first time, by technology. All previous civilizations have been  zero-sum civilizations, that is, only finite pies of natural wealth were  available. Contenders, both within nations (class wars) and between nations  (state wars), claimed and fought over the pieces. The Roman Empire was typical,  requiring 80% of the population to work the land to feed 100%. Roman cities  seem to have been always about three weeks from starvation. This was a zero-sum  situation: Someone could get more only if others got less.  </P> <P> Today, the situation is precisely the opposite because the main source of  wealth is not natural resources but scientific knowledge and technological  know-how. The available pie is potentially no longer finite. As such, we would  no longer be trapped in a contest in which someone's gain is not another's  loss.  </P> <P> War and conquest are hardly the road to riches any more, as the Germans and the  Japanese discovered during and after World War II. The problem we now face is  not a finite pie that leads to struggle for the largest slice. Thanks to  labor-replacing technology, it is a large and growing pie resulting in a global  glut.  </P> <P> The reality of the glut is reflected in chronic overproduction, chronic unused  capacity and the multitude of overt and covert trade restrictions designed to  keep out the flood of foreign goods seeking markets. Although the Germans and  the Japanese were defeated in World War II, they emerged as economic victors  because of their technological comeback. After this experience, it is unlikely  that future Germans or Japanese leaders will use the Lebensraum argument for  war, as Hitler and Tojo did in the 1930s.  </P> <P> Not only is there no longer an economic incentive to wage war, but there is  also a powerful disincentive not to wage war because of the "guillotine  effect." There is an old French saying that the guillotine "powerfully focuses  the mind." When the threat of nuclear winter hangs overhead vividly and  literally, the guillotine effect is very much a reality. It was evident when  Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) explained why President Ronald Reagan, who for so  long had excoriated the Soviet Union, changed his position and signed a treaty  with Moscow banning medium-range missiles.  </P> <P> "As he (President Reagan) and all of us get older, we realize the threat of  nuclear weapons to our survival. And the President has reached the conclusion  that he has to do something about this." In an address at Camp David on April  14, 1982, Reagan expressed this "no war" conclusion forcefully: "Nuclear war  cannot be won and must never be fought."  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was equally emphatic in a Moscow address Feb.  15, 1987: "The stockpiling and sophistication of nuclear armaments means the  human race has lost its immortality. It can be regained only by destroying  nuclear weapons . . . . A nuclear war would leave no problems, and there would  be no one left to sit at the negotiating table, let alone the negotiating tree  stump or stone."  </P> <P> Which brings us to our "Paleolithic heritage." Recent anthropological research  has debunked the once-popular theory that our early ancestors used their  superior brains and tools to prey on other animals, thereby acquiring a taste  for flesh and becoming carnivores. Over the millennia, according to this school  of thought, Homo sapiens became genetically programmed for aggressive behavior.  Hence, the increasingly bloody conflicts throughout history, culminating in the  two world wars and the holocausts of the 20th Century.  </P> <P> By contrast, the overwhelming majority of contemporary scientists agree that  humans, like other animals, formed cooperative kinship societies during the  Paleolithic millennia precisely because these were so well-suited to their  survival. Human young are wholly dependent -- not for one year like monkeys or  three to four years like apes, but for six to eight years. The survival of the  human young during their years of dependency was best secured by a system of  cooperative base camps that assured the necessary food and protection.  </P> <P> Because communal kinship society met the basic survival needs of our  prehistoric ancestors, it persisted through the Paleolithic era, which  encompasses more than 95% of the history of our species. If human societies  were for so long nonaggressive, scientists reason that the idea of genetically  determined human aggressiveness is a myth. They consider the violence so  prominent in modern times to be the product of aggression-promoting conditions  within society.  </P> <P> Human nature, then, is neither pacific nor violent, neither cooperative nor  predatory. It is largely determined by "society" or "culture." But society and  culture are made by humans and can be changed by humans. It follows that future  societies and future humans will not be determined by genes programmed for  acquisitiveness or aggression -- as our recent historical experience sometimes  appears to suggest -- but by people who have the potential to live up to their  proud and beneficent Paleolithic heritage.  </P> <P> It may be argued that we have little chance of redeeming this heritage because  our prehistoric ancestors had access to the never-depleted granary of the  surrounding wilderness. Hence, there was no need for those Paleolithic  food-gatherers to fight each other for survival. But with the advent of the  agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, the ever-full and ever-accessible  wilderness granary was supplanted by cultivated fields owned by a few landlords  and worked by landless peasants. This argument persuasively explains the  unending social conflicts and wars of modern times, but it needs to be carried  further to take into account modern high technology and its non-zero-sum  effect.  </P> <P> Today, for the first time in 10,000 years, the ever-accessible wilderness  granary theoretically can be restored and once more made accessible to all. Our  Paleolithic heritage now is within reach. Whether we reclaim it depends on our  ability to make the adaptations necessitated by rampant technology.  </P> <P> Innumerable species have disappeared simply because they were incapable of  adapting to changing environments. But we humans are responsible for  environmental changes. So our problem is not one of adapting to an environment  beyond our control, but one of adapting our human-made environment to our human  needs. This would appear to be a relatively easy task for self-styled Homo  sapiens or thinking persons.  </P> <P> While recent experiences warn us to expect the unexpected, as a thinking  species we do have the option of being the creators rather than the creatures  of our destiny -- of recharging our history rather than ending it, like  Russell's apes playing on the petrol dump.  </P></p>

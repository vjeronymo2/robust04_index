			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hungarians of Vojvodina are not satisfied with  the stability process. Szilveszter Varga reports:    [Varga] The drafts coming before the Paris stability  conference do not meet the demands and the situation of the  Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK], Andras  Agoston [VMDK chairman] said in his interview to Hungarian  Radio. The VMDK chairman added that the other minorities  probably have a similar standpoint. Asked what chances there  are for dialogue between Hungary and Yugoslavia, in harmony with  the assumption of bilateral relations -- which is being urged by  the French -- Agoston said the following:    [Begin Agoston recording] In view of the fact that the text  itself, which is now on the agenda, says that those who want to  enter Europe must sign this stability agreement, I hope that the  taking up of Hungarian-Serb relations will be possible in this  matter as well. A Hungarian-Serb dialogue could evolve between  the countries as well.    At the same time, I consider it important to stress here too  that we should take part with an appropriate role in this  dialogue, since in the course of the discussions it is us that  they will be talking about. I think that in the coming period  this taking up of contacts, of dialogue, will get under way,  both between the Hungarian community and the Serb -- or Yugoslav  -- government, and between the two governments. [end recording]    [Varga] In answer to the same question, Momcilo Grubac,  former minister of minority and human rights of the Panic  government, replied that discussions between neighboring  countries, where bilateral agreements should also be concluded,  are useful, but that much more important is the internal  political aspect of this issue, in other words, whether dialogue  evolves between the powers that be and the minorities, because  it depends on this dialogue how great will be the harmony  between the neighboring countries.</p>

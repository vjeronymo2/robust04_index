			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: HE'S LIKE A NEW MAN -- HIMSELF  </P> <P> Over the years, Robert J. Hunt has duped hundreds into thinking he was an  astronaut, professional baseball player and fighter pilot. But he doesn't think  the people of Revere, Mass., will be anybody's fool, so Hunt's planning to run  for mayor of the blue-collar beach city as the real thing -- himself. "People  like me," said Hunt, who was trained as a plumber. "I know how to talk to  people. I'll make a great politician." In his heyday, Hunt's favorite guise was  that of an astronaut, and armed with a uniform and aviation wings that he  ordered from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Hunt lectured  to groups of pilots, went to the Marine Corps Ball in Washington, and drank tea  with the lord mayor of Dublin. "I went to the White House, I was made citizens  of countries, I was an impersonator and there's no law against that," said  Hunt. There was a law, however, against Hunt's swindle of a couple for $4,000,  for which he was ordered to pay restitution and sentenced to a year's probation  early this year. That experience convinced Hunt to go straight, he says, and  now the impersonator-turned-politician spends his days more quietly, strolling  on Revere Beach to collect some of the 50 signatures he needs to run against  incumbent Mayor George Colella in November.  </P> <P>  -- A real-life astronaut will be making a special appearance next month in  France to mark the 20th anniversary of man's first steps on the moon. Neil A.  Armstrong, the space pioneer who made the "giant leap for mankind," will join  John Glenn, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. and James A. Lovell Jr. as well as  Alexis Leonov and Valery Koubassov of the Soviet Union and French astronauts  Patrick Baudry and Jean-Loup Chretien for a television special to be taped July  7 in Toulouse and broadcast July 19 by Antenne 2, a state-run network. The show  will focus on the men who landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, and on the  progress in telecommunications, meteorology and medicine that resulted from  space exploration.  </P> <P>  -- The star of "The Graduate" will actually become one, the Santa Monica  College board has decided, voting to award actor Dustin Hoffman an honorary  associate in arts degree. Hoffman had enrolled in Santa Monica College in 1955  to study music but changed to theater arts and never graduated. SMC President  Richard Moore said Hoffman sent word through his agent that he would be honored  to accept the degree. The Oscar award-winning actor -- for his performances in  "Rain Man" and "Kramer vs. Kramer" -- is currently appearing in "The Merchant  of Venice" in London. ANN CONNORS  </P></p>

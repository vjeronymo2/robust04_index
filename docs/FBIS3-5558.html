Yi Chol, North Korea's ambassador to Geneva, told the  conference that the South Korean Government is a "military  regime disguised in the mask of a civilian regime."    Seoul retains fascist laws, Yi said, apparently referring to  the national security law which prohibits any unauthorized  contact with North Koreans. Yi reminded that even U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher has stated as Washington's  official position that he wants to see this law repealed.    South and North Korea signed an historic agreement in 1991  on  reconciliation and agreement, Yi said, pointing out that Seoul  should remain faithful to this accord.    Yi's statements came in reaction to Seoul's protest a day  earlier charging that human rights in North Korea are infringed,  that individuals are kidnapped or go missing and that individual  freedoms are ignored.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Sanctions Against Croatia"] </F>   [Text] It is high time that observers of the tragedy in the  former Yugoslavia increased the pressure on Croatia and took  steps to impose UN sanctions against the country based on  reports in recent days of the deployment of regular Croatian  forces in the struggles in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If these reports  are put next to the Serbs' preparations for full military  mobilization and the deadlocked situation at the peace  negotiations, the supposition increases that both Serbs and  Croats are now getting into position for the last push on the  battlefields and the final division of Bosnia.    Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen's move to introduce  the call for sanctions at next week's meeting of European Union  foreign ministers is thus, given the present situation, correct  and necessary. In addition, there are better prospects that the  sanctions can be made effective and will have some effect as  compared with the sanctions against Serbia. Croatia's borders  with Slovenia and Hungary will be easier to monitor than the  borders between Serbia and her neighbors. Furthermore Croatia is  far more sensitive to western pressure than the Serbian  government in Belgrade. As their stated goal, the Croats want to  link themselves closely to the rest of Europe and even have  ambitions of becoming a member of the European Union. So the  prerequisites for the sanctions, or perhaps just the threat of  invoking them, to affect Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and  the government in Zagreb are in place. But all of that does not  remove the impression that the threat is being made far too  late. It has long been clear that Croatia is deeply involved in  the war in Bosnia even if there are insistent and unceasing  denials from the official Croatian side. It is also very obvious  that statements from Bosnian Croats about eventually being  incorporated into Croatia have never been convincingly  contradicted from Zagreb. So there were good reasons to take a  firm stand against the Croats as parties to the war at a much  earlier time. The fact that this was not done tells us something  about the impotence, the divisions, and the lack of  international activity that have unfortunately characterized the  rest of the world's stand on the drama in the Balkans right from  the start.    There are exceptions. Yesterday the flow of news from war  observation posts contained the remarkable bit of information  that Bosnian Serbs had withdrawn from a blockaded road leading  to Sarajevo becauses of threats from the UN to use armored tanks  to clear the road with force. The episode took place 24 hours  after the UN's top commander in Bosnia announced a new and  tougher policy to get emergency supplies through. Of course  there was talk of an isolated incident -- but all the same. Just  think if this tougher course had been taken somewhat earlier.</p>

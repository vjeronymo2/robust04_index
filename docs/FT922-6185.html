			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Five regional radio permits to be offered THE RADIO Authority announced yesterday that it is planning to advertise five regional commercial radio licences covering up to 4.5m adults in the autumn. They will be advertised in areas where FM frequencies are available. The regional stations, in addition to Radio Authority plans for three national commercial stations, will cover central Scotland, north-east England, the west Midlands, north-west England - the largest - and the Severn estuary, covering south Wales and Avon. The Radio Authority said applicants would have to offer something different from existing radio stations in the area. The way is clear for those wanting to offer thematic stations offering a particular music format. Mr Peter Baldwin, director of the Radio Authority, sees the new regional stations as a way of offering other parts of the UK some of the commercial radio choice available in London. The formal announcement about the stations came as the Radio Authority yesterday published a consultative document on the re-advertisement of 55 independent local radio licences that expire by February 1995. The authority plans to begin the re-advertising process and complete it by the end of 1993. The controversial element of the plan is to advertise AM and FM frequencies separately. Many local stations have been running dual-frequency transmissions served by a single news operation. The Radio Authority may decide that an existing local station should keep only one of its frequencies. Mr Baldwin believes that there is likely to be a reasonable degree of stability but that each case will be judged on its merits. If two frequencies are awarded in a particular area to two different companies then it will be up to them to decide what economies of scale are possible through co-operation. Senior executives of the Radio Authority are also due to meet Mr David Mellor, National Heritage secretary, next month to discuss the future of radio in the UK. The Radio Authority would be horrified if, as some are suggesting, BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 should take advertising at a time when national commercial stations offering classical music, pop and speech are trying to establish themselves.</p>

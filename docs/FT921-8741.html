			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Off The Wall - An Arts Diary: Heritage still slips away THIS WAS the week in which the dam finally started to crack. For years the heritage lobby has wrung its hands over the weak defences that the UK has in place against the loss of its arts treasures to rich foreigners. The jeremiads always seemed overdone. Did the export of the Badminton cabinet really matter? The British do not like furniture and anyway it was pure Florentine 18th century workmanship. As for Constable's 'The Lock', most of the paintings in the series are safely in museums and it will be a good advertisement for British art to see it hanging in Baron Thyssen's new Madrid Gallery. And Turner's 'Folkestone'? - the Tate is hardly short on Turners. But on Wednesday Christie's announced it was selling off three undoubted masterpieces which have nestled for centuries in private English collections, works by Holbein, Rembrandt and Canaletto. With the total purchasing grants of our nationally funded museums frozen for a decade at Pounds 8.47m there is not the remotest chance that they can raise an anticipated Pounds 15m-plus to buy the Holbein, Pounds 8m or more for the Rembrandt, or even the Pounds 4m for the Canaletto. The National Heritage Fund, with just Pounds 12m a year with which to safeguard everything from threatened wetlands to literary archives, is not going to splash it all on one painting. So rich Germans are expected to sniff around the Holbein portrait of a young girl who was probably a German living in London in the 1530s; the Americans will fancy the Rembrandt, a tiny cabinet painting which passed with flying colours the committee of experts which is re-attributing so many of the artist's works to his followers; and the Canaletto, a view of Whitehall, could even appeal to the Japanese, who like pictures that look like post cards. This sudden cashing in of their family heirlooms by the English aristocracy has caused a crisis in the art establishment, making Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery very cross, and, one imagines, Tim Renton, Minister for the Arts, very worried. MacGregor thinks that the Holbein belongs in the National Gallery. Rarely does a painting of such national importance come on the market. In addition it will appeal to the public. More to the point a Cholmondeley relative, Philip Sassoon, was chairman of the Trustees of the NG for many years and always assumed the Holbein would end up there. But the new Lord Cholmondeley wants the largest possible sum of money for the picture, partly for family reasons (as the only son he inherited everything in 1990 - Pounds 100m-plus  -and wants to help out his sisters), partly to shore up his old houses at Cholmondeley and Houghton. Unlike the owners of the Canaletto and the Rembrandt, he made no attempt to negotiate a private treaty sale with the National Gallery, which would have produced less money but saved a considerable amount of tax. His advisers, Christie's, itself facing a loss following the slump in the market for Impressionist and Modern art, obviously also has an interest in an auction. Neil MacGregor is upset at the precipitate announcement and at the speed with which the painting is presumably being rushed abroad. Tim Renton must be doubly worried, partly because the Government has for years ducked the whole business of establishing stronger export controls, and partly because his pet solution to the problem, the creation of a list of national treasures which would not be allowed out of the UK, could well have precipitated the current rush of masterpieces on to the market. He now seems to be backtracking furiously. The list rallied few supporters. Even the committee that produced the idea did so unwillingly and naturally the salerooms and the dealers are opposed. If he drops the list Renton will have to come up with an alternative. The options are limited. It could be more money, either for museum purchasing grants, or for the Heritage Fund. Or he could try to persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer to introduce tax advantages for donators of art works to museums. Or he can wait for the national lottery to produce the cash to solve the problem. None of these approaches will be in place in time to save the Holbein. But there is one escape clause for Mr Renton. He has floated the idea that a few really exceptional works of art should be refused export licences. In effect he would put the national interest before that of owners. The Holbein would fall into that category. As an imaginative electioneering gesture the Minister could, with one hand, conjure up some extra heritage cash to sweeten Lord Cholmondeley, while decreeing with the other that the Holbein would be refused an export licence. Anyone going down to the Tate Gallery on Monday is in for a big surprise. Virtually every painting and sculpture on show - has been replaced. The third annual re-hang, paid for thanks to a Pounds 150,000 handout from BP, is now complete. It means that many famous works associated with the Tate - Rodin's 'The Kiss', for example, and the celebrated run of Mark Rothkos - have temporarily disappeared, but since the Gallery only has space to show around 15 per cent of its holdings, the replacements punch their weight. There are Rossettis which have not been seen in public for over a decade and Constables which have lingered in the vaults for even longer. Eric Gill's formidable sculpture 'Mankind' is appearing at Millbank for the first time in a generation. This year the British rather than the international side of the Tate's collection is getting the boost, in particular the Pre-Raphaelites, Gainsborough, and 20th century British sculptures. The re-hangs have proved a resounding success. In three years they have boosted attendances from 1.2m to over 1.8m in 1991. The idea has attracted the interest of overseas museums, and galleries in Rotterdam and the Pompidou in Paris are about to pursue frequent change arounds. They have brought neglected artists to prominence - Spencer was the undoubted star of the 1991 re-hang. This time Whistler, who is being pushed into the limelight as a run-up to a major Whistler exhibition in 1994, is expected to draw the critical applause. They have also helped remedy the ridiculous situation in which only a tiny proportion of the Tate's collection of 5,500 works was on view to the public. Already the re-hangs have aired 1,700 works.</p>

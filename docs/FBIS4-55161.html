			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- Ondrej Hanko, spokesman  for the shadow cabinet of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS) described as an  "extraordinary press conference of victims" a meeting of  representatives of companies whose privatization projects  approved in February and March have been canceled.    The new Slovak Government of Premier Jozef Moravcik canceled  on March 29, due to legal and factual shortcomings, 13 of the 45  privatization projects approved by the government of ex-premier  and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar at a time when its remaining  at power was already questionable. At that time the projects  were also questioned by the media because the ex-premier's  co-workers and their relatives were to participate in the  projects.    However, "the harmed entrepreneurs" at today's meeting  maintained that the privatization projects were legally correct  and were canceled for political reasons on minor pretexts.</p>

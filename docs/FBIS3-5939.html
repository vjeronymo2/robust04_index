The head of the North side's delegation said at the contact  that the exchange of presidential envoys between the two sides  had been proposed by the North side and it had made all sincere  efforts for its realisation.    Noting that the South side which had opposed this exchange  last year has accepted our proposal and is willing to exchange  special envoys, he said he was going to make clear the following  points now.    He said:    Firstly, it is required of the South side to admit that it  had categorically opposed the exchange of special envoys when we  proposed it.    It is a matter which must be clarified for a successful  realisation of the exchange of special envoys in the future.    Secondly, the South side had consistently refused top- level  talks which we had proposed in the past.    As far back as more than 20 years ago when the first  North-South dialogue began, our side proposed to the then  authority of the South side to have top-level talks between the  two sides and, in the later period, proposed to the South side a  summit meeting between the two sides officially and unofficially  several times.    Especially, in early April, 1992, a special envoy of our  side  visited Seoul and invited the South Korean top authority to  Pyongyang.    At that time, heads of state and government and prominent  figures of many countries came to Pyongyang and congratulated  our respected leader President Kim Il-song on his 80th birthday  and had significant meetings with him.    The South side of the same nation, however, turned down our  special envoy's invitation to visit Pyongyang and so a summit  between the North and the South could not be held.    But we had never mentioned it.    Today we are clarifying these facts in the hope of strictly  preventing the recurrence of the unhappy things of the past  concerning the question of the exchange of special envoys  between the North and the South.    Stating that the North side had deeply studied and examined  the proposals and remarks made by the South side at the last  working contact and the one-to-one contact between the heads of  both sides, the head of the North side said:    In this we have reached the conclusion that your side  suggested that the issues of discontinuing all large-scale  nuclear war manoeuvres and stopping seeking an "international  cooperation system," which were raised by the North side, might  be discussed and resolved when the sides exchanged special  envoys.    Your side also said that it had decided not to stage the  "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and greater efforts  should be made from the national viewpoint with regard to the  issue of the "international cooperation system."    And your side said the situation has changed now because  your  side had already decided to shelve the plan to introduce Patriot  missiles and as for the remarks of your side's top authority  that he "cannot shake hands with a party possessed of nuclear  weapons", he made them in June last year and later said judging  from information available, the North had no nuclear weapons.    The head of the North side delegation said although this  position of the South side was still not satisfactory enough,  the North side took note of it, regarding it as an expression of  understanding of the reasonableness of the four-point demand  raised by the North side.    Then he proposed to the South side, as a dramatic step for  the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the  South, to announce at home and abroad in the form of joint  communique that the North and the South confirmed again each  other's intention to exchange special envoys and reached a  complete agreement on the exchange of special envoys at the  earliest possible date, and to discuss the drafts of agreement  on working procedures put forward by both sides and finalize it  at the contact today.    After the speech of the North side the two sides entered  into  the discussion of detailed matters.    The North side repeatedly urged the other side to take a  joint step of announcing to the nation in a joint communique  that they confirmed again each other's intention to exchange  special envoys and agreed to realize it at the earliest possible  date.    The South side, however, refused to accept it under  unreasonable excuses and pretexts.    The North side stressed again that because both sides  confirmed their will for the exchange of presidential envoys and  agreed to realise it at the earliest date possible, there is no  reason to refrain from reporting about it.    It suggested releasing news reports separately according to  each side's convenience if a joint communique was not to be  published. The South side opposed it, too.    The North side said it would publish a news report of its  own  in disregard of the South side's opinion.    The sides entered into a discussion of the working  procedures  for the exchange of presidential envoys.    Out of the 28 points of 13 articles contained in the drafts  put forward by the sides, they reached an agreement in principle  on all but four articles.    The South side insisted on its unreasonable position and  took  a negative attitude toward principled and important matters  related to the tasks of the special envoys such as adherence of  the North and the South to the principle of national  independence, confirmation of the way of national reunification  and promotion of great unity of the whole nation.    Then followed a tete-a-tete contact of the chief delegates  of both sides.    It was agreed that the seventh working contact would be held  at the Thongil House in the North side's portion of Panmunjom on  March 16.</p>

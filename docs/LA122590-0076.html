			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. SANCTIONS LIMIT MEDICINE, DOCTOR SAYS  </P> <P> The U.N. trade embargo is depriving Iraqi civilians, including children, of  critically needed medical supplies, a U.S. doctor who recently toured the  region said Monday.  </P> <P> "We found that sanctions are working, and working brutally, right now," Dr.  Bernard Lown of the Harvard University School of Public Health said in an  interview on NBC-TV's "Today" program.  </P> <P> Baghdad hospitals, including pediatric hospitals, lack insulin, intravenous  solution and injectable forms of other antibiotics and anesthestics, he said.  </P> <P> However, the U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,  allow trade in medicine and some foodstuffs.  </P> <P> Lown is co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear  War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.  </P></p>

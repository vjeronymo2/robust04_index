			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> ALL-WOMAN FIRE CREW A 1ST FOR CYA  </P> <P> Among the hundreds of firefighters who heroically battled the disastrous fires  in Santa Barbara and Ojai recently, this crew of 16 hardly stood out.  </P> <P> Yet, they were making history as the first all-female crew from the California  Youth Authority to be dispatched to fight fires.  </P> <P> When the fires were contained, the women, 18 to 22 years old, returned to the  prison at Camarillo's Ventura School, where they are incarcerated.  </P> <P> The women spent nearly two rigorous months training to become firefighters at  the nearby Ventura Public Service and Fire Center Program.  </P> <P> Selected by a prison screening board, the female firefighters must have between  four and 24 months remaining to serve, said Cynthia Brown, program  superintendent. That's so they can put their training to use for at least one  fire season. Those convicted of arson or sex offenses are not allowed in the  program.  </P> <P> The first training phase consists of physical conditioning, including  weightlifting, running, hill-climbing and other cardiovascular and strength  exercises. The program's second phase is a one-week classroom course covering  types of fires, firefighting techniques and safety, potential risks and how to  avoid them.  </P> <P> The women receive $5.50 a week for the first 30 days of the program. Pay can  range up to $8.50 a week for seasoned members. In addition, they receive $1 an  hour for each hour spent fighting a fire. Some earned as much as $200 fighting  fires in Ojai and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Even though the women are still battling physical and emotional exhaustion from  seven straight days of battling the two blazes, they spend at least four hours  each weekday clearing brush from the dry hills surrounding Ojai.  </P> <P> Some don't like it.  </P> <P> "I hate this," said Kianya Fleming, 18, after a brush-clearing session in  90-degree temperatures last week. It's not the hard work she minds, but the  fact that prison officials gave her no choice but to join the crew, she said.  </P> <P> "They don't treat us right," Fleming said. "They expect us to do as much work  as the boys, but the boys always come first." Fleming and others complained  that members of CYA's four other fire crews, all male, seem to receive  preferential treatment such as trips to movies or restaurants, a television in  their ward, and more free time.  </P> <P> Prison officials said the program, which started in March, is still new and  they are still working to get some details in place.  </P> <P> Other crew members, however, said the challenge of firefighting beats sitting  in prison with little to do.  </P> <P> Laura Stark, 20, hopes to become a professional firefighter when her prison  term ends in a year and a half.  </P> <P> Shannon Byrket, 22, said she likes the hard work -- and the hot temperatures.  "I don't mind it," she said. "I grew up in the high desert, so I know about  heat." ADRIANNE GOODMAN  </P></p>

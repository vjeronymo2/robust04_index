			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Biggest impact will be in Japanese market THE Scotch whisky industry reacted with cautious satisfaction to the news that the four Quad members - Japan, the US, the EC and Canada - are to abolish tariff barriers to imports of spirits. For whisky producers the market most affected will be Japan, where high import duties are levied. There was caution because the removal of import duties appears to depend on the entire Uruguay Round being concluded. Furthermore, the whisky industry is still trying to persuade Japan to end its discriminatory regime on taxing whisky, which is seen as a much bigger impediment to whisky exports than import duties. The effect of the abolition of import duties will also be felt in the US and Canadian export markets, but duties in these countries are moderate compared with those in Japan. French brandy is another EC product that will benefit. 'This is potentially very good news,' the Scotch Whisky Association said yesterday. 'It is something we have always sought.' Exports of Scotch whisky to Japan totalled Pounds 178m in 1992, amounting to 18.56m litres. Each litre pays about Pounds 1 in import duty. On liquor tax, Japan has been urged to comply fully with a Gatt ruling of 1987 which said the liquor taxation system discriminated against imports. Tax on whisky and brandy is nearly Pounds 6 a litre but only 50p on high quality Japanese shochu, a potato-based liquor.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / LWT in talks with US media company to fight Granada bid London Weekend Television is in talks with US West, the Denver-based telephone company, over its taking a large stake in the ITV company, which is attempting to fight off a hostile takeover bid by Granada. The deal would be the most far-reaching move yet by a US company into British television, by pulling together powerful cable and traditional broadcast television interests. US West already has significant cable television interests in the UK through Telewest, its joint venture with Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US cable television operator. Plans are in train for a Pounds 400m flotation of Telewest. Through the joint venture, US West has an interest in television franchises covering slightly fewer than 3m homes. That puts it in second place in the UK cable industry, just behind Nynex, the New York and New England telephone company. If talks succeed, US West would almost certainly take a stake of up to 29.9 per cent in LWT. Companies from outside the European Union are prohibited from controlling ITV franchises, but the definition of control is left to the judgment of the Independent Television Commission. The National Heritage Department confirmed yesterday that no maximum percentage stake for non-EU companies is specified in broadcasting legislation. Mr Greg Dyke, LWT's chief executive, has been one of the first in the conventional television industry to take cable television seriously. He argued for collaboration with ITV at last year's annual cable convention. Mr Dyke yesterday declined to comment on talks the company might be having with potential suitors. He said the central plank in LWT's defence against Granada remained 'our record in the past, what we can achieve in future and we believe the best is yet to come'. It is thought that LWT has had a number of approaches from large US media companies interested in taking a stake. US West is seen as the present favourite, although it is far from clear whether the US company would be able to move fast enough to clinch any deal in the timescale of the Granada bid. The final date for acceptance of the Granada offer, which values LWT at about Pounds 670m, is February 4. US West in Russia, Page 3</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Digital decides to leave its historic Mill home DIGITAL Equipment is leaving its historic headquarters at The Mill, in Maynard, Massachusetts. The move reflects the drastic changes that are under way within the company as it streamlines operations and struggles to regain competitiveness. 'This was a very difficult decision for the company to make,' said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive of Digital, who last year succeeded Mr Ken Olsen, Digital's founder. 'This site holds a very special place in our history. As the location where the company first planted its roots, The Mill has acted as a strong symbol for Digital,' he said. Built in 1847 as a woollen mill, Digital's headquarters building dominates the small New England town of Maynard. It is a warren of stairs and wooden-floored offices, full of character and tradition, but lacking the efficiency of a modern office block. 'The spacious, idiosyncratic Mill was a home that suited a growing engineering company,' Mr Irving Burg, property manager of The Mill, recalls in a company history. 'The challenge of negotiating the byways of connecting floors and buildings still satisfies the 'Mill rats',' the name Digital gives to Mill employees. Digital will keep its headquarters in Maynard, but many employees will be transferred to other sites, primarily in eastern Massachusetts. Digital said it would work with local officials on plans for The Mill complex.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Mar. 19 (ANTARA) - President Suharto  assured the nation that there was no reason for anxiety about  the country's presidential succession when he received 56 ulemas  [Muslim scholars] for a post fasting get-together at Merdeka  Palace Saturday.    Speaking without text, Suharto said there was no need for  the  public to be restless as the existing mechanism for national  leadership change in a cycle of every five years through general  elections followed by election of president and vice president  by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) sitting a plenary  session has been practiced without fail all this time.    He said the election of a president would move smoothly as  long as the MPR sticks to the procedure of drawing up the state  policy guideline (GBHN) first and choosing the MPR's mandatory  or president (to execute the GBHN) second, and not the other way  round.    He said: "There will be no problem for the MPR as long as it  discharges its duty in accordance with the mechanism that has  proven its effectiveness all this time."    The president counselled, however, that the public should  not  magnify whatever weaknesses the candidate for president might  have in such a fashion as to brush aside the positive qualities  that he may also be blessed with. For no person is faultless,  including the future presidential candidate, he said.    But even if there is no perfect person, he added, someone  has  to be trusted to act as a mandatory of the MPR or president.  "Someone just has to be trusted as leader," he said.    The ulemas hosted by the president represented Indonesia's  major Islamic organizations such as the Council of Indonesian  Ulemas (MUI), the Nahdlatul Ulema (NU) [Association of Muslim  Scholars], the Indonesian Islamic Missionary Council (DDI), and  Muhammadiyah. Among them were K.H. Hasan Basri, Anwar Haryono,  Azhar Basir, Jakiah Drajat, Tuti Alawiyah, and Suryani Tahir.</p>

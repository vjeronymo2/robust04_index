			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wills Group Wills Group, the engineering products group, reported pre-tax profits almost doubled from Pounds 1.56m to Pounds 2.96m for the year to July 2. The advance was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 31.5m - including Pounds 6.33m from acquisitions - and after an increase in the interest charge from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 166,000. The directors said that as a result of acquisitions made in the last few months of the financial year, the accounts did not reflect the current size of the group, and turnover for the current year was expected to be considerably higher. Earnings came out at 1.85p (1.6p), or 1.79p (1.28p) fully diluted. A proposed final dividend of 0.385p (0.3p) raises the total for the year to 0.5p (0.4p).</p>

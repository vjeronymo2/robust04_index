Spokesman Wu Jianmin said that China never takes exception  to  non-governmental contact between Taiwan and countries having  diplomatic relations with China.    "However," Wu said, "The relations between some of those  countries and Taiwan have recently gone beyond that limit." The  Chinese Government "firmly opposes any form of official contact  between Taiwan and those countries having diplomatic relations  with China," he added.    Wu made the statement when commenting on the so-called  "vacation diplomacy" by the Taiwan authorities as Lien Chan paid  a visit to some countries having diplomatic relations with China  in the name of "a private vacation".    Wu pointed out that the so-called vacation diplomacy is but  a  new trick of "pragmatic and elastic diplomacy" of the Taiwan  authorities whose aim is still to create "two Chinas" or "one  China, one Taiwan", which is against the fundamental interests  of the Chinese nation including the Taiwan compatriots.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Putting sales in a spin after costs squeeze: Andrew Baxter sees Whirlpool's European white goods strategy enter a new cycle Like an old-fashioned mangle squeezing clothes dry, Whirlpool is coaxing extra profits and productivity out of the former Philips white goods business. The US domestic appliances maker completed the two-stage Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 700m) purchase of its Dutch rival's operations in the sector in 1991. By the end of the first quarter of 1995, Whirlpool Europe executives at Comerio in northern Italy will have completed detailed discussions with unions and staff on shedding about 2,000 of the company's 13,000 employees. A cut of this size smacks of a company in trouble. In fact, the plan announced in November is the next logical step in a relentless drive to transform the inefficient, underperforming business which Michigan-based Whirlpool inherited from the Dutch electronics and electrical group. The aim is to raise Whirlpool Europe's profitability to levels achieved by its sister business in North America, secure its future in the highly competitive European white goods market, and advance Whirlpool's long-term strategy in an industry where the big players are increasingly thinking global. But Mr Ivan Menezes, Whirlpool Europe's vice-president for group marketing, stresses the changes are not about 'going in and slashing out costs. The emphasis is very much on how we go to market, clearly recognising we needed to be far more efficient.' Whirlpool executives see themselves as leading the battle to close what Mr Menezes calls the 'value gap' between Europe and US, to give European consumers a better deal. Because of Europe's fragmented industry, and big national differences between products, Whirlpool estimates it took an average 7.7 days of household income in 1992 to buy a dishwasher in Europe, against just 3.8 days for a comparable machine in the US. Over the past two years, phase one of the process has focused on the big items in Whirlpool Europe's cost structure - products, manufacturing and materials and components supply. The result mirrors the transformation at Electrolux, the Swedish-based European market leader - a pan-European production base created out of former national centres, and a big, continuing product-renewal programme based on brands to suit customers with different pockets. Employment at Whirlpool Europe has fallen from 16,000 in 1991, partly because of a sharp reduction in indirect workers, the spin-off of compressor production and the sale of a factory in Barcelona. Organic growth and acquisitions in central Europe offset some of the reductions. The changes, coupled with much tighter management of working capital, are already showing through in improved financial results. Profits before tax and interest rose from Dollars 92m in 1990 to Dollars 123m in 1993 as sales hovered between Dollars 2.16bn and a peak of Dollars 2.46bn in 1992. Market share in Europe has risen from 11.5 to 12.5 per cent. The rise in profits has come in spite of industry-wide declines in retail prices of 2-3 per cent a year, restructuring costs and heavy promotional costs incurred by Whirlpool to establish its name in Europe. The Philips name, which disappeared first from appliances in the Dutch market, will be dropped in the last two markets, France and Germany, early in 1995. Now comes phase two. After a two-year investigation, Whirlpool is replacing its traditional country-based sales organisations with two pan-European sales organisations based around the two big 'trade channel' groupings for white goods - built-in and free-standing equipment. Mr Jeff Fettig, president of Whirlpool Europe, says these support activities are typically conducted in Europe with 'fragmented infrastructures, inconsistent business processes and service levels'. The aim is for them to be 'consolidated, re-engineered and standardised across borders'. Each European country used to have its own sales force, trade marketing, order processing and back office support, but while trade channels are evolving at varying paces in the countries, Mr Menezes says the investigation showed that 'channels across borders have a lot more in common than different channels within a country'. Two multiple retail chains in France and the UK, for example, would have much more in common than either would have with a neighbouring small independent retailer, or a kitchen boutique. And as the 'winning channels' - big retail chains - form links across borders, Whirlpool needs a matching structure so that it can manage the relationship more effectively. 'Our analysis was done before the Kingfisher/Darty deal,' says Mr Menezes of last year's takeover by the UK retailer of the French electrical store group. 'We had predicted those kind of alliances would continue.' The shake-up is also intended to address a competitive issue peculiar to Whirlpool in Europe. 'We cannot win the game in Europe by competing on a country-by-country basis,' says Mr Menezes. 'Whether it be Hotpoint in the UK, Thomson in France or Bosch-Siemens in Germany, we have competitors who are much larger than us in each of those markets, and so will always beat us on selling and administration costs.' The solution, he says, is for Whirlpool to take the advantage of its European size and scale to each local market, enabling it to beat a strong, entrenched national competitor. A key element in the shake-up, therefore, is increased regionalisation and centralisation of back office and support services. Transaction and processing activities will be moved into regional centres, and one centre will be set up to handle administration of payables and other accounting matters. Several sites are being evaluated, says Mr Glen Walker, Whirlpool Europe's chief financial officer. The changes will be completed next year, and will save Dollars 80m, on an annualised basis, that will be spent elsewhere, for example on advertising. Mr David Newkirk, a consultant at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton who has been working with Whirlpool since 1991, sees the restructuring as a 'very keen two-edged sword. It cuts out the last pocket of tricky cost, but more than that it creates an organisation with much greater control of the products and the channels'. A lower cost base will help Whirlpool Europe address what Mr Menezes sees as the biggest challenge for it and the industry in 1995. Double-digit increases in raw material prices forced Whirlpool Europe to raise its own prices in the third quarter, but the picture has worsened since then, he says. 'Outrageous' price increases of 20-30 per cent are being sought for some grades of steel, he says, and suppliers of other raw materials - and component suppliers using them - are also seeking big increases. 'The number one challenge will be in recovering these cost increases', he says. This could mean 'high single-digit increases, and in some cases double-digit increases' in Whirlpool Europe's selling prices. Further globalisation across Whirlpool as a whole, and new programmes in Europe to increase brand loyalty among customers - a perennial problem for the white goods industry - are likely. But achieving parity with Whirlpool in the US on operating margins is 'absolutely achievable' without moving to this next stage, Mr Menezes says. 'We are two or three points off at present, and are making progress. We have always maintained that we can do it.'</p>

The TSE announced at 0100 (0700 GMT) that it would not  provide further information for several hours, because "most" of  the votes had been tallied, and only 843 out of 5,897 polling  stations had not been counted.    According to this latest official report, which politicians  and authorities have recognized as practically unequivocal, the  negative votes added up to 12.95 percent, with null or blank  votes at 19.3 percent. President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said he  was satisfied with the "yes" victory and downplayed the  abstention, although he admitted it was "worrisome."    The 43 approved amendments make it possible to hold  anticipated elections this year to name a new Congress and  Supreme Court, two branches that de Leon has wanted to purge due  to the charges of corruption that were leveled against those  institutions. Unexplained bomb attacks that had begun in the  past few weeks continued on voting day. Two devices exploded in  Guatemala City, and the police defused three others.</p>

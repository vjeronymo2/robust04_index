Shipping percentages for individual supply plants and units of supply plants are reduced to 1 percent and 4 percent, respectively, for the month of September. The action is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient movements of milk to qualify plants for pooling. A proposed reduction for the month of August was found to be not necessary. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> effective date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment number 1 is effective September 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment number 2 is effective September 1, 1994, through September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment number 3 is effective October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Constance M.

Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 720&hyph;2357. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> supplementary information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Prior document in this proceeding:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued July 11, 1994; published July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36094). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions of &sect;1030.7(b)(5) of the Chicago Regional milk order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 36094) concerning a proposed temporary relaxation of the supply plant shipping percentages under the Chicago Regional milk order. The revisions were proposed to be effective for the months of August and September 1994. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments by July 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments supporting the proposed revision for the month of September were received. The comments agreed that the degree of adjustment that the order allows the market administrator to make in supply plant shipping requirements would be sufficient for the month of August. No opposing comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: The Bundesbank marks time FT-SE Index: 2,490.8 (-29.3) Despite the headlines about the surging dollar, the real story in the foreign exchange markets still looks to be the weakness of the D-Mark. Given the dissent among the Group of Seven, there might seem a hint of perversity about this. Germany argues for monetary tightness and the US for laxity, yet money continues to flow from the D-Mark to the dollar. Allowing for the difficulty of measuring the unified German economy, it is not even clear that money supply growth in the two economies is wildly different by now. With the help of such mishaps as Chancellor Kohl's election defeat at the weekend, sentiment on the D-Mark is running downhill. To an extent, one can see the market's point. The way ahead for the US economy is pretty clear, apart from matters of timing. The outlook for Germany is profoundly unclear on virtually everything, including basic economic policy. The risk premium on the D-Mark, as measured by the interest rate differential, has been rising steadily for the past six months and now stands at a full 3 percentage points. For the Bundesbank, the immediate problem is that the US interest rate cycle may already have hit bottom, so that a rise in German rates may be needed merely to stop the differential widening further. It is hard to see how the Bundesbank can reassert its authority other than by catching the market unawares with the timing and extent of its next rate rise. By definition, if the Bundesbank gets it right there could be shocks ahead for the other members of the ERM.</p>

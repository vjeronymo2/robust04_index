			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- Ten sailors died in an  accident Wednesday [30 March] aboard the French Navy  nuclear-powered Emeraude submarine off the Mediterranean naval  base of Toulon, military sources said.    They said the accident aboard the sub, armed with ballistic  missiles, took place in a turbo engine room where electricity is  produced with steam and in no way damaged or affected the  nuclear part of the vessel.    The 10 men were in the engine room when the accident  occurred. No further details on the cause of the disaster were  immediately available.    The submarine surfaced after the accident and sailed back to  base under its own steam.    Defence Minister Francois Leotard and Navy Chief of Staff  Admiral Alain Coatanea were on their way to the base, the  sources said.</p>

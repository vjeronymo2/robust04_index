			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ford to increase stake in Hertz to 54% Ford, the US motor vehicle manufacturer, is planning to increase its stake in Hertz, the world's largest vehicle rental company, to 54 per cent. Ford said that it is to take over the 5 per cent stake held by Commerzbank of Germany, which made the first approach to Ford to dispose of the holding. None of the financial details of the deal have been disclosed. Hertz is currently 49 per cent owned by Ford, while Volvo, the Swedish vehicle maker holds a 26 per cent stake and 20 per cent is controlled by Hertz management. The car rental group is the largest single private purchaser of new vehicles in the US. It has a domestic rental fleet of around 230,000 vehicles and a worldwide fleet of 420,000. Vehicle makers have established dominant positions in most of the world's leading vehicle rental groups in recent years, and Hertz already plays a key role for Ford as its biggest single private customer. Around 70 per cent of Hertz's vehicle purchases in the US are from Ford, while the US carmaker supplies a third of Hertz's fleet in Europe. Last year Hertz marginally improved its net income to Dollars 53m from Dollars 51m on a turnover of Dollars 2.85bn compared with Dollars 2.82bn a year earlier. Ford first acquired an 80 per cent stake in Hertz at the end of 1987, when it assisted the vehicle rental group's management to purchase the company from UAL (Allegis Corporation) for Dollars 1.3bn. Ford said at the time that it planned to expand the ownership base in order to reduce its holding to a minority position, and it later sold stakes to both Volvo and Commerzbank. The US vehicle maker said yesterday that it had obtained all the necessary US regulatory approvals to return to a majority position in Hertz, and that it expected the deal to be approved by the European Commission. The Commission said yesterday that it may investigate the deal and competitors must file their submissions by February 22.</p>

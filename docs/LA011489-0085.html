			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball may be allowed to change his guilty plea in  a drunk-driving manslaughter case to safeguard insurance money for victims and  their families, his attorney said.  </P> <P> The guilty plea Kimball entered Wednesday could amount to a breach of contract  and allow his insurance company to cancel a $1.3-million liability policy,  Frank Quesada, a lawyer for the 1984 silver medalist, said.  </P> <P> "The company could cut Kimball loose," he said. "It has nothing to do with the  way Bruce feels. . . . A change (in pleas) would be all for the victims."  </P> <P> Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe III said he would accept a no-contest  plea if it's proven that Kinball's policy would be canceled.  </P> <P> Kimball had pleaded guilty after listening to only a few minutes of testimony  about the Aug. 1 crash, which killed two teen-agers and injured four others. He  said he wanted to spare the families the grief of hearing descriptions about  how his car plowed into the youths on a dead-end road in Brandon, Fla.  </P> <P> There are four civil lawsuits pending against Kimball stemming from the  accident, which occurred a month before the 1988 Olympic diving trials. He  participated in the trials but failed to make the team.  </P> <P> If the victims' lawsuits are successful, money from Kimball's liability  insurance policy could pay for damages.  </P></p>

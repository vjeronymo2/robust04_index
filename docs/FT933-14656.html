			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Japanese builder's debt downgraded MOODY'S, the US credit ratings agency, has downgraded the long-term debt rating of Hazama, the Japanese construction company. Hazama faces government penalties due to the involvement of executives in an alleged bribery scandal. Moody's said the company's operating performance and financial flexibility will be damaged by penalties, effectively contract bidding suspensions, and downgraded its long term debts to B2 from B1. The Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Transportation and local governments have suspended Hazama from bidding for new public projects in the near term, after three executives were arrested. Moody's said the penalty could affect Hazama's profits for the next few years due to the company's dependence on public works projects. Some 30 per cent of Hazama's non-consolidated revenue for the year ended March 1993 was generated by public sector work. The agency said the case would affect the company's relations with banks and investors, and its private sector business. Hazama already faces asset problems due to aggressive business expansion in the late 1980s, and Moody's said the company was not prepared to face a further fall in revenue.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMMONIA TANK HEARING POSTPONED  </P> <P> A South Coast Air Quality Management District panel decided Thursday to  postpone until Nov. 16 a hearing on whether it should cancel a permit it issued  for the construction of two anhydrous ammonia tanks at Southern California  Edison's Redondo Beach power plant.  </P> <P> The hearing, originally set for Thursday, was rescheduled to give the city of  Redondo Beach time to replace its attorney in the case, Curtis Coleman.  </P> <P> Coleman, a former AQMD general counsel who left the agency in April, withdrew  from the case when air quality attorneys expressed concern that he might have a  conflict of interest.  </P> <P> The city is seeking a hearing because it believes the AQMD failed to meet state  environmental review requirements before issuing a permit Sept. 7 for  construction of the twin 10,000-gallon tanks.  </P> <P> City officials assert that the ammonia, a potentially toxic substance, could  pose a public health risk. But Edison says the chemical is key to a pollution  control system that the utility needs to install to meet AQMD air quality  standards.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPLEMENTING CAR INSURANCE REFORMS  </P> <P> Proposition 103 is not a moral weapon of some kind just because a majority of  voters approved it. Your editorial "No More Mr. Nice Guys" (June 25) is yet  another in a long line of Times articles that trash the free enterprise system.  </P> <P> The voters had no right to enact Proposition 103 and the state Supreme Court  had no right to uphold it. Of course insurance rates are high. So are food  prices, theater tickets, new car prices, and health care costs. Yet no one has  seriously proposed that we vote to reduce these items.  </P> <P> The Times opposes the right of insurance company officials to defend themselves  from a bureaucratic onslaught of state-approved rates and mindless regulations.  I applaud the Allstate representatives who bluntly called Proposition 103 what  it is -- an attempt to be "socially fair" while ignoring economic realities.  </P> <P> I assume that your editorial writer lives in central Los Angeles, drives a  sports car, is single, and has a chargeable accident and a few speeding tickets  on his record. I say this because those who favored Proposition 103 had the  most to gain from its passage.  </P> <P> The individual thus described would receive lower rates, while a married  50-year-old farmer from Bakersfield who drives a Chevy and has a perfect  driving record would likely receive higher rates. This is the trade-off. Rates  cannot be lowered in a vacuum. That is the major flaw of 103.  </P> <P> Instead of more regulation we need less. The free market will provide the  lowest insurance rates if it is allowed to operate without restriction.  </P> <P> There are more than 700 casualty insurance companies in California, with wide  fluctuations in prices. Shop around if you want lower rates. Examine your  coverage. You likely can cut some coverage here and there and save. Raise your  deductibles. Discover your options. And repeal Proposition 103 before it is too  late.  </P> <P> TED BROWN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

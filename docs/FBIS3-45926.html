It is the third such selection and is significant as this  year is the International Year of the Family.    According to Zhang Lianzhen, a member of the secretariat of  the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), it is aimed at  promoting the development of family culture and guiding people  to pursue a civilized, healthy and scientific life style.    "The 30 families are excellent representatives of the more  than 200 million families in China," Zhang said.    They represent a happy family atmosphere and colorful family  life. All the family members are actively taking part in  China's economic construction and making contributions to  society, said Zhang.    Among the 30 families, ten will be awarded gold and silver  prizes through a public ballot and specialists' appraisal, Zhang  said.    The selection process was jointly organized by the ACWF,  China Central Television, four magazines and a newspaper  specialising in women and the family, and an enterprise in  Sichuan Province.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASY-TO-MAKE GIFTS THAT ARE STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART AND THE KITCHEN;  </P> <P> HOLIDAYS: FOODS THAT FREEZE WELL OR DON'T REQUIRE REFRIGERATION MAKE THE SAFEST  EDIBLE PRESENTS.  </P> <P> A flood of letters overwhelms The Times Food Section this time of year with  requests for making ahead and mailing edible gifts to loved ones both near and  far. There's something extra special about gifts of food -- they show  thoughtfulness and are the perfect addition to a holiday celebration.  </P> <P> Foods that freeze well, such as quick breads and muffins, or those that require  no refrigeration, such as cookies, candies, preserves, sauces and cakes travel  and store best. They can be frozen or covered tightly and sealed, then  decorated in festive wrappers that boast the colors of the season. Dress up  packages with ribbons and holly leaves and include the recipe so the recipient  can make them next year.  </P> <P> Proper wrapping is essential to ensure the quality of the gift, regardless of  the type of food that is stored. Without it, it is impossible to preserve color  or flavor. After consulting several published sources on the subject, The Times  was able to compile the following suggestions for freezing, storing and mailing  edible gifts.  </P> <P>  -- Use a moisture / vapor-proof wrapping paper that is intended for freezing.  </P> <P>  -- When foil is used as a wrapper, heavy foil is preferred. Put foil-wrapped  bundles in plastic bags for additional protection against punctures or holes in  the freezer compartment.  </P> <P>  -- Wax paper doesn't provide adequate protection and isn't recommended for  freezing. But transparent plastic wrap, with its tremendous clinging quality  that eliminates air pockets, is very pliable and an acceptable covering.  </P> <P>  -- Make sure all containers are clean or sterilized.  </P> <P>  -- Don't freeze cake batter, cream fillings, puddings and custards, mayonnaise  or potato salad.  </P> <P>  -- Wrap cookies, cakes, breads and candies individually in plastic and store  in airtight containers for maximum freshness.  </P> <P>  -- Freeze fragile or irregularly shaped items on a baking sheet, then wrap as  desired. But do not leave in the freezer more than 24 hours since unwrapped  goods develop off flavors. A few hours to stiffen should be sufficient for  packing.  </P> <P>  -- Fill containers with shredded tissue paper or packing straw to keep fragile  gifts from breaking. Do not use popcorn or other edibles that may absorb fumes  during transit.  </P> <P>  -- Use freezer tape or fabric tape to seal lids of containers that might open  or spill.  </P> <P>  -- Keep perishable foods refrigerated or frozen until ready to eat. Provide  instructions for thawing and serving, if necessary.  </P> <P>  -- Label everything.  </P> <P> DRIED APRICOT-PUMPKIN BREAD  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin puree  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 cup oil  </P> <P> 3 eggs  </P> <P> 2 1/4 cups flour  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 (4 3/4-ounce) package vanilla pudding and pie filling mix  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups chopped dried apricots  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts  </P> <P> Combine pumpkin, sugar, oil and eggs in large bowl and mix until blended.

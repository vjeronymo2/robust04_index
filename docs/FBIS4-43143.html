			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F> Political Staff]    [Text] A jubilant Labour Party was today celebrating its  sweeping gains in the European elections, hailing a "triumph and  great victory." As Labour took more seats today, party leader  Margaret Beckett denied that they had peaked too soon. "We gave  Mr Major and his whole Government notice to quit. The electors  are giving them notice to quit," she told a London news  conference. The mantle of trust had passed to Labour. "Where  we need the votes to win a general election we are getting them."    But the Tories insisted their fortunes were at a turning  point. "This represents the trough of our fortunes," said  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The results were "poor, but not  disastrous." Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 Committee of  Tory backbenchers, moved to dispel speculation that the Tories'  humiliation would lead to a leadership contest. He conceded  that the results were a "setback" but added: "Let me just make  this absolutely clear. John Major is our Prime Minister and he  will remain so."    With only a few seats still to declare, the Tories had just  16, with 13 losses, and the Liberal Democrats won their first  two seats ever in the European Parliament. Their leader Paddy  Ashdown said they had achieved their target of capturing between  one and three seats. "We have achieved that target. We have  increased our vote in every single constituency across the  country," he said.    The Tories slumped to less than 28 percent of the vote,  their  lowest ever in a national election, while Labour had a massive  45 percent. The Liberal Democrats were well behind their recent  opinion poll ratings, on 17 percent.    With the Tories' losses in double figures, Mr Major will  face  strong demands for a wholesale Cabinet reshuffle in which John  Patten, the Education Secretary, would almost certainly be one  of the casualties.    In Scotland the Tory vote plunged to a humiliating 14  percent  as Labour strengthened its already dominant position, winning  all the seats so far declared. But with two seats due to  declare later today, the jubilant Scottish National Party was  hoping to snatch North East Scotland from Labour and break  through the crucial 30 percent of the vote barrier.    Mr Ashdown said the Lib-Dems [Liberal Democrats] were going  to look at the result in the Devon and Plymouth Euro  constituency where a "Literal Democrat" may have robbed them of  victory. Tory Giles Chichester -- son of round-the-world  yachtsman Sir Francis Chichester -- beat Liberal Democrat Adrian  Sanders into second place by just 700 votes following a recount  after "Literal Democrat" Richard Huggett polled 10,203 votes.    Labour Party chairman David Blunkett declared: "Labour is  the  only truly national party now." He added: "These superb results  confirm that Labour is not only on course to defeat the  Conservatives in the General Election, but has finally laid to  rest the Liberal Democrat myth that Labour cannot win in the  South of England."    As Labour and the Liberal Democrats blamed each other for  preventing further Tories losses, Mr Blunkett said: "If the  Tories hadn't been rescued by the Liberal Democrats in Thames  Valley, Sussex South and Crawley, and the Cotswolds, they would  have suffered an even worse humiliation than they did in the  end."</p>

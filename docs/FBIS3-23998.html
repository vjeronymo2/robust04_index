			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Anin: "P.S."] </F>   [Text] Although the parliamentary Committee for CIS Affairs  of the new convocation has only quite recently become a subject  of big politics, and did not take part in the predatory  military-political operation, with an Abkhazian leaning, for the  "voluntary" inclusion of Georgia in the Commonwealth, the  document presented above fits well into the known concept of  Russian policy regarding relations with nations from the new  frontier. Specifically, those who resisted to the last the  incorporation of post-Soviet space into the sphere of Moscow's  vital interests. Even more specifically, that same Georgia.    When we distill from it the acid syrup of diplomacy and  analyze the dry residue of the real policy, this cunning concept  reduces to two or three mundane formulas: 1. If some independent  state does not wish to enter the sphere of Russian interests on  its own, then it should be compelled to do so through economic  influence or by bringing up military-political arguments. 2.  After this, it would be preferable to structure relations with  such an independent state in such a way that a) it would have  the appearance of a gesture of good will, b) it would secure for  Moscow the right of primarily military presence on designated  territory, and c) it would postpone distribution of rewards for  loyalty to some indefinitely remote future. 3. The ultimate  objective would be a state of affairs under which the content of  item 2 is perceived by public opinion as incredible generosity  on Russia's part, bordering on extravagance. It wouldn't be  difficult to note that the statement of the Duma's Committee for  CIS Affairs provides for implementation of item 3, which is  essentially an ideological cover for actions it itself  criticizes.    After all, the reason the president signed a treaty which he  doesn't intend to submit for ratification is that for Moscow,  this document is but formal confirmation of the new geopolitical  reality in relations with Georgia: It in no way ensures equal  cooperation and Russia's fulfillment of its obligations of  reviving the Georgian economy and supporting the national  integrity of the Republic of Georgia.    The reason why the "Grachev-Patsatsiya Protocol" is not  subject to ratification but becomes effective directly is that  it discusses some very serious things--establishing Russian  military bases on Georgian territory. (Only Georgia of the three  Transcaucasian republics is objectively capable of serving as a  strongpoint for Russian influence in the region. Neither  Azerbaijan nor Armenia is fit for this role, first  geographically and second because in the context of the  permanent Karabakh crisis Moscow has been pursuing a "pendulum  policy" in its relations with the warring sides for a long time.  And alternating manipulation by the carrot and the stick doesn't  favor establishment of a dependable, permanent  military-political beachhead on these territories.) What is  important is not what is being substituted--regiments for  divisions or armies for regiments (by the way, what is important  in these things is not the number of personnel but the nature of  their combat use and the quality of their training): The main  thing is that Moscow now has the legal right to maintain a  military presence in Georgia.    As for possible use of equipment supplied by Russia and  personnel trained by Russia against Russia, the concern  expressed by the Committee for CIS Affairs in this regard  appears fully justified. Pharisaism is all right as long as it  doesn't transform from a spicy complement to political soup into  total policy. Then the burdened and humbled people will begin to  resist, giving no thought to who gave them the weapons and who  taught them how to use them.</p>

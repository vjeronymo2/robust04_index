			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> UES to Shed Schools: United Education &amp; Software, a troubled Encino  operator of trade schools, said it plans to close or sell about seven of its 32  schools, which will result in a loss of about $8 million in its fiscal fourth  quarter ended Jan. 31. UES, which lost $6.7 million in its third quarter, said  the decision reflects dwindling enrollments at some UES inner-city schools  caused by recent drops in unemployment and tighter federal restrictions on  student loans.  </P></p>

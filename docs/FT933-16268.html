			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / German chambers have more resources CHAMBERS OF commerce in Britain have only a fraction of the resources available to their German counterparts, a study published today shows. British chambers have only one fifteenth of the resources of German chambers on average, while staff numbers are just one sixth of German levels. This means UK chambers often offer a far narrower range of services. In spite of their limited resources the British chambers are active in helping their members develop business in continental Europe, their unit costs are lower and they are more commercial in their approach to the needs of business, the study says. Official backing for the German chambers and the requirement for businesses to register with their local chamber make for a much larger organisation. The German chambers have 3.2m members employing 25m people. The UK chambers of commerce and chambers of trade, with voluntary membership, have just 210,000 members with 4m employees. The report says: 'The British chambers suffer the disadvantages of smallness, unevenness and competition with other organisations but have potential advantages deriving from having to be close to the market needs of their members. German chambers, by their public law status, are assured of critical mass.' Chambers of Commerce in Britain and Germany.

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Nissan to expand dealer network Nissan, the Japanese car-maker, plans to expand its UK dealer network from 294 to 330 by the end of the year, Kevin Done writes. Mr Andy Green, sales director of Nissan Motor (GB), said the company aimed to increase its sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles this year by 18 per cent to 110,000 from 93,650 in 1993. It is forecasting growth of about 7 per cent in the overall market for new cars to 1.9m from 1.78m last year. With an expanded dealer network it is seeking to raise its share of the UK new car market to 5.5 per cent from 5 per cent last year. Nissan is seeking to rebuild its share of the UK market following the setbacks it suffered during its legal battle with Nissan UK, its former independent importer/distributor. It took direct control of its UK sales and marketing operations in 1992. Nissan also plans to change its vehicle distribution system with the creation of a central vehicle storage centre in Sunderland.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Amerada Hess aims to raise Dollars 400m AMERADA HESS, the independent US oil and gas group, is hoping to raise more than Dollars 400m by way of a share issue to finance projects including its share in a North Sea oil field. The company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it will offer 10m common shares, of which 8m will be available in the US. Goldman Sachs will manage the US offer and the international portion. Based on yesterday's share price of Dollars 41 7/8 , the issue of 10m shares would raise Dollars 418.75m. In the SEC filing the company said it would use proceeds from the issue to repay part of debt related to major projects. Among these projects is Hess's commitment to develop its share of the Scott Field in the North Sea.</p>

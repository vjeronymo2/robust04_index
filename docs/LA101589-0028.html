			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SEX' AND ART  </P> <P> O'Neill displays shortsightedness when, in his assessment of "sex," he mistakes  a laconic style for shallowness. He refuses to believe that this "yuppie soap  opera" could reveal the emptiness of modern life. (A stronger argument might  have been that the use of yuppies to depict emptiness was too easy.)  </P> <P> O'Neill obviously has definite ideas about what constitutes a work of art, and  anything that does not conform to those preconceived notions doesn't deserve  further consideration. This is so much easier than trying to approach a work on  its own terms. But that would require thought.  </P> <P> MICHAEL BALLARD  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

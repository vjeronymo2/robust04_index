			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: NEC aims for Y200bn profits NEC, the Japanese electronics company, is aiming to increase pre-tax profits to more than Y200bn (Dollars 1.9bn) by 1999, or eight times last year's level. It also intends to raise overseas sales to 40 per cent of total revenues over the same period. The profits target would top NEC's previous record of Y174bn, achieved in 1990. In the fiscal year ended March, the group made consolidated pre-tax profits of Y25.1bn and is forecasting profits of Y60bn in the year to next March. The proportion of overseas sales targeted would also be a record for NEC, which currently derives about 24 per cent of sales overseas. In a speech commemorating the company's 95th anniversary, Mr Hisashi Kaneko, NEC's new president, outlined the strategy for achieving those goals. While restructuring and cost-cutting will contribute to the increased profits, Mr Kaneko expects new businesses, particularly in multimedia, to be a significant contributor to profitability. The company is a leader in advanced multimedia technologies, such as screen technologies, and its business centred on monitors for workstations is already worth more than Dollars 1bn, the company said. To achieve its goal of becoming a front-runner in multimedia, NEC plans to create an 'internal information highway'. It will also place more emphasis on services and software, such as systems solutions, application software and global information services, along the lines of Internet. Mr Kaneko said the marketing framework needed to be revamped to create a structure more responsive to consumers' needs. As markets become increasingly global, NEC expects overseas sales to make up a larger proportion of overall sales. By next March, for example, more than half of NEC's output of 11m 4-megabit D-Ram chips chips will be manufactured outside of Japan.</p>

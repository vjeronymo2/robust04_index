			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Technology: Future is home to odd ideas / Outlining a curious Californian vision of tomorrow's house Only in California, perhaps, could a house with a three car garage be built to exhibit the latest ideas in energy conservation and efficiency. Yet E3, the 'Energy Efficient Environment' project in Rocklin, near Sacramento, is a serious attempt to encourage builders and homebuyers to adopt energy waste reducing technology. The experimental 'thinking, talking home for the 21st century' is a project of the Building Industry Association, the California Energy Commission and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Californians are not ready to sacrifice their cars for the cause, but they are concerned about the economic and environmental costs of squandering energy. In a state where homes have long been built without regard for energy conservation, E3 may signal change. E3 is full of electronic gadgetry that is fun, but impractical. The house boasts a Dollars 100,000 computer network linking appliances and a security system. It can be operated by touching the computer screen, voice activation, hand held remote control, wall buttons or touch tone telephone. The awakening occupants of 'E3' can switch to 'Good morning mood', turn on their favourite TV programme, open the motorised blinds, and run a bath at a specified temperature, merely by touching a screen. Returning in the evening Mr and Mrs E3 might call from their car phones; he to turn on the lights and start the garden hot tub, she to select music for the outdoor speakers. Although such automation may seem to be anything but energy efficient, the computer is crucial in reducing energy consumption and bills. Stan Kataoka, PG&amp;E's Program manager, says that his company recognises the difficulty of changing people's habits. The aim is to mitigate energy use for a Californian life-style and to spread the demand for electricity more evenly across the day. PG&amp;E charges customers different rates for electricity at different times. The computer ensures that dishwashers, washing machines etc. operate only during low-rate periods. The heating system can be programmed to warm the house to, say, 72 degrees when rates are low, allowing it to cool to 65 degrees before activating the boiler during peak periods. The system is too expensive for most homes, but simpler versions that control basic functions such as lighting and security are available for less than Dollars 10,000. Some of the construction aspects are more widely applicable. Indeed, some of the energy saving techniques are available now and are only a matter of good design and construction practice, costing little. The orientation of the home and the siting of the rooms within it are examples of that. More costly, but estimated to pay for itself within a year, is the use of an air infiltration barrier. That is a layer of energy saving synthetic material wrapped around the home before the external facing is applied. Those who want to lower their energy bills without buying a new home can also incorporate some of E3's features. State of the art gas boilers, low emissivity glass, and low voltage fluorescent lighting can be fitted in older homes. Glazing which reduces heat loss in winter and reflects the summer sun is estimated to pay for itself within 5 to 10 years. Does energy efficiency really bother home owners? Garen McCune, President of GLM Custom Homes Incorporated, which built the Rocklin house, says American consumers generally are becoming more worried about the energy efficiency of their properties. Energy savers like those on display in E3 are requested more frequently. The Building Industry Association admits that not all the show home's features are likely to catch on. For example, E3's extra thick building shell requires 50 per cent more timber for the studs. Techniques such as the raised heel truss on the roof - to prevent compression of the insulation - or the method of wiring to reduct air penetrations are unlikely to be worthwhile except in extreme climates. Even so, California, which has led the world in many technological and environmental trends, will be only a follower when it comes to energy efficiency in the home. Blessed with a mild climate and relatively low energy prices, Californians have not made energy use in the home a high priority until environmental concerns forced a change of attitude. In Rocklin, E3 will be tested and monitored for two years, with families living in the home during 1993. Meanwhile, builders are expressing interest and the project's sponsors hope that at least some of E3's features will become standard in California, long before the 21st century.</p>

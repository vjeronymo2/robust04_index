			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Child's surgeon complains of underfunding - Consultant's letter tells father that the wait was unacceptable - Cash problems in the district outlined This letter was written on February 17 by Mr Alan Ardouin, consultant at Kent and Canterbury Hospital, to Mr John Bennett, father of the child portrayed in Labour's election broadcast as having to wait months for surgery. Dear Mr Bennett, Thank you for your letter. I hope by the time that you receive this letter that Jennifer will at least have had a date for an admission if not already been in. I have been discussing the problem with your general practitioner, Dr Cwynarski, and I have also had copies of correspondence between Mr John Bragg our district chairman and Roger Moate your MP, to whom I am sending copies of this reply. I agree with you that it is unacceptable for children, especially if they have had deafness, to wait as long as Jennifer has had to wait for her surgery. One of the problems in this particular unit is that we only have seven children's beds suitable for accommodation of overnight stay patients. In addition there is insufficient funding to allow us to have nursing cover on Sunday nights when we would normally admit four patients and on Friday nights, which prevents us doing anything on a Friday which requires an overnight stay. As a result the waiting list for overnight stay patients has climbed enormously in spite of our protestations that we needed nursing cover on Sunday nights and Friday nights. Recently the district have allocated further funds on a temporary basis for us to have the extra nursing cover that we require. Also we have had the opportunity of having one extra operating list and this is enabling us to clear 50 or so cases off our waiting list. I only hope that it will be possible to maintain the staffing levels after this exercise so that we can continue at a steady rate to clear the waiting lists and not go through the stop/start procedure that we are having at the moment. Some of our problems are in relation to the funding of the district as a whole which has been poor, related to other districts in Kent. This is being redressed but the effect will not be immediate. We suffer from the fact that this district has two district hospitals and not just one and therefore the funding and development monies have to be shared between the two and at the present time the lion's share is going to Thanet which is rather underdeveloped in comparison with Canterbury. It is a matter of priority as to which hospital gets the lion's share of the money available. These are political matters outside our influence. Finally the last point you made in your letter, why in 1992 do children have to wait for over a year for treatment which was available to you in two weeks 40 years ago, I think it was fortunate that you could have treatment in that time 40 years ago but when I came here the waiting list was only six weeks and now it is over a year principally because there are no more consultants here now in ear, nose and throat surgery than there were 40 years ago yet some specialities have increased by as much as six times. There is the possibility of an additional consultant being appointed next year but this is to replace an existing associate specialist so I doubt whether this will improve the productivity. Our greatest need is for continuing nursing cover on our children's ward and sufficient beds in the hospital to prevent medical emergencies constantly invading our beds necessitating frequent cancellations of operations. Yours sincerely, AP Ardouin, FRCS, DLO, Consultant Otolaryngologist.</p>

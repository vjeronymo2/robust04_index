			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Corruption inquiry starts in Brazil BRAZIL'S financial authorities yesterday began investigating the bank accounts of nearly 40 Congress members allegedly involved in the corruption scheme unearthed in the government's budget. Eight of the country's biggest construction companies will also have their bank accounts and phone records opened to scrutiny as the parliamentary inquiry into the allegations gathers pace. The inquiry is into allegations made 10 days ago by Mr Jose Carlos Alves dos Santos, a former budget official. He claimed Congress members and other politicians received fees for arranging the inclusion of construction projects in the government's budget, and diverted budget funds to personal schemes. So far 37 politicians have been implicated, including several senior figures and five former and serving government ministers. But the inquiry is having difficulty finding documentary proof that payments were made and hopes for a breakthrough from the bank accounts. The 44 congressmen sitting on the inquiry voted to open their own bank accounts to scrutiny, to avoid allegations of involvement in the scheme.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dakar, Feb 6 (AFP) -- Mali's new Prime Minister  Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was facing a serious political crisis  Sunday [6 February], just two days after being appointed,  because of an unexpected withdrawal of two parties from the  governing coalition.    The National Congress of Democratic Initiative (CNID) has  not  made public its reasons for the departure, announced Sunday by  its ruling committee, but one faction has complained of the  government's "unpopularity".    It had three cabinet ministers covering justice, mining,  energy and water. [as received]    The Assembly for Democracy and Progress (RPD) pulled out its  one minister, for youth and sport, complaining that it had not  been consulted on the new list of government members.    The new premier, from the Alliance for Malian Democracy  (ADEMA) of President Alpha Oumar Konare, had returned everyone  to their former posts.    Both withdrawing parties had only joined the government last  April. During the last few weeks the CNID had led a strong  campaign against the former premier, Abdoulaye Sekou Sow,  accusing him of not implementing the government programme and  calling for a government of national unity.    The radical wing of ADEMA wants the party to govern on its  own.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sales ahead at Comparex COMPAREX, the mainframe computer subsidiary of the German chemicals giant BASF, managed slight growth in the first half of the year, in spite of deteriorating market conditions. Mr Rolf Brillinger, Comparex CEO, said that turnover rose 3 per cent to reach DM536m (Pounds 191m) compared with DM522m in the same period last year. The company does not disclose half yearly profit figures, but it is thought to have made moderate profits, in contrast to other European-owned mainframe manufacturers which have been reporting heavy losses. Mr Brillinger was pessimistic about the outturn for the whole year, citing economic weakness, lack of capital investment and fiercer competition. He also pointed out that the computer boom in Germany following unification had been short lived and a backlog of demand for Comparex' new high end machines was now satisfied. The company markets mainframe computers which are functionally identical to those made by International Business Machines, the US-owned market leader. Comparex' mainframes are manufactured by Hitachi of Japan. Comparex also markets computer peripherals and is seeking to increase the proportion of its revenues derived from computing services.</p>

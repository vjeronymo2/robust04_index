			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jagmohan: "Independent Kashmir"] </F>   [Text] Of late, there have been a few significant  developments which indicate that the US is adopting a new  posture towards India, particularly in relation to the Kashmir  issue.    President Clinton, in his speech to the U.N. General  Assembly  on September 27. 1993, said: "Bloody ethnic, religious and civil  wars were raging from Angola to Caucasus to Kashmir." On October  29, 1993, Robin Raphel, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, at a  "background briefing' for the South Asian journalists, observed:  "We do not recognise the instrument of accession as meaning that  Kashmir is for ever an integral part of India....The people of  Kashmir have got to be consulted in any kind of final settlement  of the Kashmir dispute." A clarification, subsequently issued by  the State Department, confirmed what was stated by Raphel. It  did not change the content of the dish but merely the manner of  serving it.    On December 27, 1993, President Clinton wrote to Ghulam Nabi  Fai, 'Executive Director', Kashmiri-American Council, saying  that he shared the latter's concern for human rights and looked  forward to working with him to help bring peace in Kashmir. In  reply to a letter from Congressmen Gary Condit and 15 others,  President Clinton observed: "I am aware of the chronic tensions  between the lndian Government and the Sikh militants, and share  your desire for a peaceful solution that protects Sikh rights."    All these statements and letters, issued in a short span of  about four months, clearly point to the direction in which the  wind is blowing. President Clinton's address to the U.N.  Assembly where he virtually equated Kashmir situation with that  prevailing in former Yugoslavia and Somalia; his warm response  to Fai, a self-styled interlocutor whose activities are funded  by Pakistan, and who is fuelling terrorism in the Kashmir  Valley; his reference to Sikh rights as if Sikhs are not like  other Indian citizens; and Raphel's highly provocative  observations, questioning even the validity of the Instrument of  Accession, are all manifestations of U.S. increasing disposition  to ignore Indian sensitivities, lean towards Pakistan and  indicate, in the process, a subtle preference for independent or  semi-independent Kashmir.    There are other straws in the wind which point in the same  direction. On September 27-28, 1993, the Kashmir Bar Association  organised a "Lawyers Meet" at which a series of resolutions were  passed. One resolution (No. 5) says that the people should be  given 'an option not to accede to either of the two countries,  India or Pakistan'. Reading between the lines, it is evident  that public opinion is being created to secure modification of  the U.N. resolutions and provide for the 'third option' --  independent Kashmir. Efforts of this nature, there are  reasonable grounds to believe, are being surreptitiously  encouraged by U.S. policy-makers.    For the last two years, the U.S. Institute of Peace,  Washington, a 'think tank' funded by U.S. Congress, has been  showing inordinate interest in Kashmir affairs. In continuation  of the January 1993 meeting, another meeting was organised by  the Institute in January 1994 and 15 non-officials from India,  Pakistan and `both parts of Kashmir', who are believed by the  Institute to exercise influence over public opinion were  invited. The `framework' papers and pattern-of discussions,  albeit informal, seem to suggest that the `position, of  Kashmiris as central actors' need to be given a `top slot'. The  intention was clear. It was to prepare a background for a change  in the thinking of both India and Pakistan. One of the Indian  participants, in an article written after the Washington  meeting, argued: "How long can India be indifferent to the  status damage it suffers as a result of the continuing  blood-letting in Kashmir?".    Earlier, some academicians like Prof Cohen who have a  substantial say in the formation of American policy on South  Asia had begun arguing that "the road to accession to  Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] runs through Kashmir", implying  thereby that India's current difficulties with regard to the  Valley could be used to pressurise it to sign the NPT.    Taking an overall view of the situation and long-term  interests of the US in the region, its policy-makers seem to be  seriously thinking that it would be best to have an independent  or semi-independent Kashmir. Such a state could serve as an  effective instrument for putting pressure on China, if the need  for doing so arises in future. It could also help in acquiring a  stronger foothold in five Central Asian Republics and  manipulating events in Russia to prevent an unfriendly  power-structure emerging there once again. Pakistan could become  a client state to a greater degree and India's arm twisted more  forcefully to sign the NPT.    The United States is seeing new opportunities for itself in  the troubled waters of Kashmir and it is moving, albeit  unobtrusively, to seize these. Its basic objective is to remain  as the only superpower in the world. President Clinton, in his  address to the U.N. General Assembly, made it clear: "The United  States intended to remain engaged and to lead". An influential  section of American academics have also been arguing that the  "bear may be dead but snakes and scorpions still roam".    If India encourages U.S. moves on Kashmir with a determined  stand and by mobilising strong opinion in its favour, the U.S.  could well abandon or modify the course it has presently taken.  After all, Washington cannot afford to incur the hostility of a  nation of 880 million people. In this connection, it is worth  recalling that when the die-hard Tory members of the British  Parliament, like R. A. Butler and Winston Churchill tried to  browbeat India by espousing the cause of the Nizam of Hyderabad,  the `faithful ally of the empire', Sardar Patel firmly told them  not to stand by the `old world' . He made it clear: "It is only  in goodwill spirit, and not on the malice and venom of Mr  Churchill's tongue, that an enduring relationship of friendship  can be built between India and Britain and other members of the  Commonwealth." He thus successfully prevented Hyderabad, which  he described as an 'ulcer in the abdomen of India', from  becoming cancerous. Such a forthright and fearless stand towards  Washington's new posture, I am sure, would help India in  retrieving the situation, besides sending the right signals to  the secessionists in the Valley.    Unfortunately, India is taking a characteristically meek  stand. When President Clinton wrote to Fai, virtually ignoring  the savagery of terrorism in Kashmir, I wish someone from our  foreign office had invited his attention to what Senator Jackson  said when the safety of American citizens was itself under  terrorist threat. Jackson observed: "The idea that one person's  terrorist is another's freedom fighter cannot be sanctioned.  Freedom fighters or revolutionaries do not blow up buses  containing non-combatants; terrorist murderers do. Freedom  fighters do not assassinate innocent businessmen or hijack and  hold hostage innocent men, women and children; terrorist  murderers do. It is a disgrace that democracies should allow the  treasured word 'freedom' to be associated with acts of  terrorists."</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Harolyn Blackwell - Recital Looks do matter, and the way they are used matters more. On Friday, the young soprano Harolyn Blackwell (best known in the UK from Glyndebourne performances, notably as Clara in Porgy and Bess) made an immediate impression of dignity and glamour as she arrived on the Wigmore Hall platform. She is slim, black, erect, and she wore a scarlet bare-shouldered gown that matched her earrings and lipstick. Her physical relaxation while singing was perfect - neck and shoulders never disturbed by any quick intake of breath - and she created an image of utterly classical repose. In some ways, she is a classical singer. Her vowels and consonants are perfectly married, her utterance is always precise, and she enters notes cleanly. Her phrasing is so finely judged that you soon sense her intelligence, but she never becomes precious or excessively contrived. She does not, however, sound all that she looks. Her voice is not only small, it is also lightweight. She has no chest register to speak of, and her attack is restricted. Though she can swell a note gorgeously - the final note of Norina's scena from Pasquale was a beautiful crescendo - she can seldom ever take a note by force, and she lacks the brio to make Norina's 'Conosco' aria bounce. It is a pretty voice that often reveals real loveliness, but it usually has a tremulous kind of vibrato that robs her singing of the kind of repose that makes her appearance so appealing. No doubt she was nervous on Friday, but a singer with her experience should not be alarmed by the Wigmore Hall. Yet twice, a hairline crack appeared during a sudden vocal ascent, and raised a question about the basic firmness of her breathing. Her singing of a group of Rakhmaninov songs also suggested that she had learnt the Russian words by rote, with recurrent mispronunciations. But none of these flaws spoilt the amiable and touching feeling she created in everything she sang. Essentially, she is a Romantic, reflective and sensitive. Even when she cannot lay forth Purcell songs with the calm command you feel she intends, she remains eloquent at every point, especially in recitative. Rakhmaninov is nearer the heart of her style, and here she revealed more variety of colour. Likewise Strauss, who suits her yet better. She closed with Genius Child, a recent song-cycle written for her by Ricky Ian Gordon (b. 1956). The poems (by Langston Hughes) have no great importance, but Gordon has a real feeling for words, and for lyrical singing. His style here derives chiefly from Britten and Copland. I think the music has wider contrasts than Blackwell is able to reveal, but she was at her most assured in it. In the falling iambs of Prayer (strong shades of Britten's Hymn to Saint Cecilia), the voice was at its best - fluent, communicative, moving affectingly between shadow and light. The spirituals she sang as her first two encores were no less fine.</p>

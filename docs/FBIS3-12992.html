			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As reported earlier in the bulletin, a press  conference was held today on an official visit by a Latvian  Government delegation to Israel. The head of the delegation,  Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, briefly described it as follows:    [Begin Birkavs recording] The visit to Israel took place in  a  very complex situation regarding foreign and domestic policy,  which has evolved in Israel after the Hebron tragedy when many  dozens of people were killed in a sacred place. There were  perhaps only small schedule changes during the visit; in general  the visit proceeded according to schedule. I think that this is  an indicator of Israel's especially favorable attitude and wish  to maintain contacts with us on a wide scale.    As far as the main essence of the visit itself, in several  words I would characterize it as a new leaf which has been  turned over in our mutual relations, a leaf on which we made  several significant inscriptions. These inscriptions are an  agreement on cooperation in the spheres of education, culture  and science, and on promotion and mutual protection of  investment.    But all the talks which we held with the Israeli president,  the Israeli prime minister, the Israeli foreign minister, and  other ministers are practical evidence of the fact that we have  very wide possibilities for mutual cooperation. And Israel, if  the peace process develops successfully there, will be a country  which will develop rapidly. And as we do not have a  representation in that region, then the government's plan to  open an embassy in Israel -- possible in the fall -- was  received with great understanding and it will be a guarantee  that our relations will widen. [end recording]    Mr. Birkavs also reported that during the visit, the Latvian  Government delegation received from the Israeli Government an  offer for arms sale. Representatives of the Latvian Government  also visited a language teaching center in Israel, where they  familiarized themselves with the system of teaching Hebrew. As  Birkavs said, discussing problems of citizenship in Latvia,  representatives of the Israeli Government stressed that the  knowledge of the language should be put forward as the main  criterion for granting citizenship. A visit by Israeli experts  in power engineering and internal affairs to Latvia is also  expected soon, as well as a visit by representatives of the  Knesset, i.e. parliament.</p>

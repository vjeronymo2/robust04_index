Your esteemed  newspaper on 31 January published an article on page 18 by Dr.  Muhammad al-Mahasinah under the headline "Was Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah  a Victim of Polarization or Peace?" In view of the errors  contained in the article and given the freedom of the press and  opinion, we would like to have the following explanation  published with our thanks and appreciation.    Dealing with the difficult and critical situation in the  Islamic world requires all of us to pool our efforts and remain  vigilant to foil the plots by the enemies of the Islamic nation.  This requires wariness and alertness in order to avoid being  dragged behind the venomous and propagandistic media of world  arrogance and Zionism that is aimed against the entire Islamic  world. In this regard, writers should rise to their  responsibility and be truthful and sincere, and to play their  role in enlightening people and exposing these desperate  attempts.    However, and with deep regret, certain people are  contributing to strengthening the trend that serves our common  enemy. Yet, we are certain that, although they make mistakes in  analysis and interpretations, these pens do not have aims or  ambitions other than to present their own views and to reveal  facts.    The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Amman  respects  and appreciates such honest writers but will not remain silent  toward those who do not appreciate the situation and who are  unaware that they are serving sides that want to harm  inter-Islamic relations, especially between the Islamic Republic  of Iran and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Therefore, we find  it necessary to reply to what Dr. al-Mahasinah wrote in his  article.    1. The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran denounces and  condemns the terrorist and cowardly act which led to the death  of Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut. The embassy can only extend  its sincere sympathy and condolences to his family and the  sisterly Jordanian family as whole and to beseech God almighty  to have mercy on his soul and to grant his family solace and  patience.    2. It is a source of consternation that this article, which  lacks objectivity and logic, should be written by a Jordanian  figure of the status of Dr. al-Mahasinah, who is the professor  of Law at the university. In his article, al-Mahasinah tried in  vain to link this cowardly act with the Islamic Republic of  Iran's stand on the so-called peace or with the issue of the  reduction of the number of Iranian diplomats in Jordan.    How did he link these two issues, which have nothing to do  with this criminal act, unless it was something out of his own  creation and imagination? It is regrettable that in this  regard, the voice of a Jordanian brother joined the voices of  Westerners and Israelis who continue their feverish efforts to  shake and confuse relations between Islamic countries in  general, and countries in the region in particular.    Moreover, Dr. al-Mahasinah should not have announced his  stand off the cuff. He should have waited until things became  clear and facts became solid before leveling accusations at  others. In order to put him in the picture along with others  who do not know, we say that the Islamic Republic of Iran's  stand toward the Zionist enemy is a principled and constant  stand that will not change one iota under any circumstance.  This stand was not developed yesterday or by chance. Indeed,  it is older than the victorious Islamic revolution in Iran.  History recorded the Islamic and principled stands adopted by  Imam Khomeyni, may God sanctify his secret, throughout his life  against the occupying enemy whether in the Shah's dungeons, in  exile, or in power. Therefore, our stand toward what is now  called the peace process emanates from this principled and  deep-rooted stand.    As regards the issue of reducing the number of Iranian  diplomats in Jordan, we would like to emphasize that the warm  relations between the two fraternal countries, which are  permeated by the spirit of brotherhood and love, are proceeding  forward under the wise leaderships of the two countries.    For our part, we are concerned about maintaining these  relations and we will not allow anyone to undermine them. From  this particular premise, we say that the reduction of the number  of diplomats is purely an organizational issue as stated by  responsible quarters in Jordan. Here, we also reaffirm our  concern about maintaining the higher interest of the two  countries and about proceeding forward with these active  relations no matter what the sacrifices are. We have no doubt  at all that the Jordanian leadership shares the same feeling and  that the recent statements by the wise leadership in Jordan are  evidence of this. Hence, while we reiterate our deep regret  about what was written outside the realm of logic, we ask the  honorable and esteemed SAWT AL-SHA'B newspaper to be accurate  and cautious more than ever before.    [Signed] The Embassy of The Islamic Republic of Iran in  Amman</p>

The bodies  of an elderly Hemet couple, Robert Reid, 84, and Thelma Reid, 75, were found  late Thursday amid debris from the wreckage of the Lucky R, the cabin cruiser  owned by their son, Charles Reid of Long Beach. Relatives told Coast Guard  officials that Charles Reid also was aboard the boat, which was found  demolished about 10 miles northeast of Avalon.  </P></p>

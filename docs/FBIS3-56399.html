			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the `Radio Slavyanka' program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Excerpts] Continuing the theme of international military  political events, I would like to draw your attention to the  results of the NATO meeting in Brussels last week. [passage  omitted] Listen to how the Russian Defense Minister Army General  Pavel Grachev assesses the situation.    [Begin Grachev recording] We take an understanding attitude  toward the sovereign right of every state, including those of  eastern Europe, to choose a path for ensuring its own security.  Such a choice could be participation in military political  alliances. We would not like the states of central and eastern  Europe, or the Baltic region, to speculate on a mythical threat  from Russia. We do not understand their aspiration to defend  themselves from Russia by membership of NATO. We, for our part,  welcome the decision by the meeting of the NATO council, at the  foreign minister level, in Brussels on 3 December, to remove  this question from the agenda.    We are supporters of the kind of path which leads to a  genuine all-European system of security, that is, collective  actions--but not by the criteria of belonging to blocs--with a  view to preventing and settling the crises and conflicts  currently convulsing Europe. We believe that security and  international stability should be indivisible and rely on  all-European structures. Russia takes as its premise that our  relations with NATO should be richer and develop across a broad  range of interaction. Russia's rapprochement with NATO, it  seems to us, should proceed at a rapid pace. The east Europeans  could, of course, also join this process.    We have met with Mr. Woerner, the president has met him, and  I was there, and we reached this agreement--that we set up  groups, they have already been set up, expert groups of  specialists, from NATO on the one side and Russia on the other.  Over the course of January we are going to study a plan for  Russia to cooperate with NATO, and sometime in January, perhaps  in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where I have been invited, so as  fully to explain every text of our military doctrine to the  members of NATO and other interested persons, and maybe we'll  sign this agreement there, if the president instructs me to do  so, on behalf of the government. This matter has been studied.  In addition, I have had a meeting with the commander in chief  of the joint armed forces in Europe, an American general, with  whom we also agreed during January to study an agreement, at a  purely military level--the other one was at a military political  level, while this is at a purely military level--between the  commander in chief of NATO's joint armed forces in Europe, and  the Russian armed forces.

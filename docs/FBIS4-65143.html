			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, 11 May (EFE) -- In a brief visit on his  way to Turkmenistan, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella  today termed Turkey as a "bridge that leads to the Turkish  countries of the old USSR."    Di Tella arrived at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport from South  Africa. On 12 May he will travel to Turkmenistan as part of a  tour through the old USSR that will include a visit to Moscow  between 14 and 17 May.

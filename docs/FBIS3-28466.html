The information says the recent bayonet and teargas  suppression proves that the Kim Yong-sam group is a pack of rare  traitors, fascist gangsters and foolhardy blackguards.    It goes on:    What must not be overlooked is that the traitor Kim Yong-sam  issued a repressive order, branding the righteous struggle of  South Korean people as "violence", and that even Kim Chong-pil,  a remnant of the "Yusin" system, arbitrarily insulted the  resistance of peasants, saying "to totally deny the Uruguay  Round in the era of internationalization means that they are  ignorant of what is going around the world."    As for Kim Yong-sam and Kim Chong-pil, they are the very  ones  who directly sold off the South Korean rice market to the United  States. They are despicable criminals who committed a  never-to-be-condoned arch crime against the nation.    Repression can by no means be almighty, the information  says,  stressing:    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must immediately stop playing  such foolish tricks as trying to prolong at the point of the  bayonet the remaining days of the "civilian regime" now in the  grip of a crisis and step down without delay.</p>

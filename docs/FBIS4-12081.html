			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 4 Apr (WAKH)--A responsible source at the  Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has denied  that the Salalah meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid was held at al-Bid's request.    The source added that the Salalah meeting was the outcome of  a proposal made by the Sultanate of Oman, Jordan, the United  Arab Emirates, and Egypt, because the four countries were  concerned that Yemen not slide into a civil war. The source  went on to say that these countries advised the Yemenis and the  Yemeni leaders to opt for either confederation or federation,  particularly since the merger unity has failed due to doubts,  suspicion, and mistrust between the two parties to the merger  unity.</p>

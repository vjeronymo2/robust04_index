			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> ORGANIZER CANCELS BETTE DAVIS SERVICE  </P> <P> The organizer of a beachside memorial service for Bette Davis has canceled the  event, saying that mourners of the late actress should send money to help  victims of the San Francisco earthquake.  </P> <P> Longtime Laguna Beach resident Harry Moon said Wednesday that he decided to  cancel the scheduled Friday memorial service as he watched television accounts  of the 6.9 temblor that killed scores in the Bay Area.  </P> <P> Moon had organized an informal service to be held on the shore, in the shadow  of the bluff where Davis once lived. Davis, a one-time Laguna Beach resident,  died at 81 on Oct. 6 in a French hospital. She had been suffering from breast  cancer.  </P> <P> Moon had initially asked residents and fans of the two-time Academy Award  winner to send flowers in honor of Davis, who once starred in the Laguna Beach  Pageant of the Masters summer festival.  </P> <P> "I feel that the donations to the Red Cross (for aid to earthquake victims)  would be more in keeping with the spirit of Bette Davis," Moon said. "She was  quite generous and giving to the poor and needy. I feel that her films at this  time are a fitting legacy." JIM GOMEZ  </P></p>

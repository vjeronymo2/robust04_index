			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The projected increase in the HCFA PPS market basket index, currently estimated at 3.7 percent; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An adjustment of zero percentage points for the difference between the projected ProPAC and HCFA market baskets; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A negative adjustment of 1.1 percentage points for substantial error in the fiscal year 1993 market basket forecast; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A positive adjustment of 0.3 percentage points to reflect the cost-increasing effects of scientific and technological advances; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A negative adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to encourage hospital productivity improvements; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A net adjustment of zero percentage points for case-mix change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a positive adjustment of 3.1 percentage points should be made for hospitals in rural areas to complete the phase-out of the differential in standardized amounts between rural and other urban hospitals. ProPAC's recommendation would result in an estimated average update factor of 2.7 percent for fiscal year 1995: an increase of 2.2 percent for urban hospitals and of 5.3 percent for rural hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This recommendation reflects the Commission's judgment about the appropriate increase in the level of PPS payment rates. Since it is based on current projections of the fiscal year 1995 increase in the market basket index, the effective value of ProPAC's update factor recommendation may be modified as more recent forecasts become available. The components of ProPAC's update factor recommendation are summarized in Table 2&hyph;1, and a discussion of each follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that the increase in average per case payments in each year exceeds the PPS update. This is because increases in the Medicare case-mix index (CMI) result in proportionally higher hospital payments. Future changes in case mix are difficult to predict; however, on the basis of currently available data, ProPAC estimates that the CMI will rise by 0.9 percent in fiscal year 1995. Based on the Commission's recommendation of a 2.7 percent average update, the average increase in per case payments would be about 3.6 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> PPS Market Basket Forecast and Forecast Error Correction <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The forecasted increase in the market basket index is the expected change in the prices of the resources used during a typical hospital stay. This forecast is the reference point used in updating the PPS payment rates. The current forecast is for a 3.7 percent increase in HCFA's PPS market basket index during fiscal year 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its March 1990  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report and Recommendations to the Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC proposed modifications to the market basket used by HCFA. Although HCFA adopted most of these modifications, it did not incorporate the key provision that increased the weight of internal hospital wages in the computation of the market basket index. The Commission believes HCFA's market basket as currently constructed does not adequately recognize the unique characteristics of the hospital labor market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the PPS update for fiscal year 1995 is legislated relative to HCFA's market basket, that market basket is used as the basis for ProPAC's update framework. The Commission takes this into account by making an adjustment to allow for the estimated effect of the modifications it has proposed. However, the current fiscal year 1995 forecast is that the increase in ProPAC's and HCFA's market baskets will be the same. The corresponding adjustment, therefore, is zero percentage points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A forecasted market basket increase of 4.1 percent was used to set payments in fiscal year 1993. The actual market basket increase, however, was only 3.0 percent. The update for fiscal year 1993 thus was set 1.1 percentage points higher than if the actual market basket increase had been known at the time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes a correction for substantial error in market basket forecasts in an important part of its update framework. This correction protects both hospitals and the Federal government by adjusting the base payment rates so that the effects of past forecast errors (both positive and negative) are removed. Therefore, ProPAC's update recommendation also includes a ^1.1 percentage point adjustment for fiscal year 1993 market basket forecast error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

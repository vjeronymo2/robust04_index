			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Emilio Lomas] </F>   [Text] Cuernavaca, Mor. [Morelos], 10 Apr -- After  vindicating the struggle of Emiliano Zapata, "which is still  alive," President Carlos Salinas de Gortari warned there will  not be setbacks in the constitutional reforms drawn up in favor  of the Mexican countryside. Salinas also stressed that large  landholdings will not reappear in the country, particularly at a  time when farmers are facing an unfavorable international  situation.    During the ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the  death  of General Emiliano Zapata, which was held at the Teopanzolco  Municipal Auditorium, the president emphasized that the ejido [a  form of land tenure] is not going to disappear, adding that the  laws have been adapted to the new times the country is  experiencing. Salinas remarked that the struggle of the  southern leader [Zapata] is still legitimate, and in Mexico we  must reverse the circumstances of misery and poverty still  prevailing in the countryside.    Accompanied by Morelos State Governor Antonio Riva Palacio  Lopez, the secretaries of agriculture and agrarian reform,  Carlos Hank Gonzalez and Victor Cervera Pacheco, respectively,  Agrarian Ombudsman Arturo Warman, and the leaders of the largest  peasants organizations of the country, President Salinas said  significant progress has been made in the countryside, but the  work is not over yet.    "We still have a lot to do, but we are not going to ease up;  on the contrary, we are going to redouble our effort and  increase benefits for peasants. From the government of the  republic, we will work harder and with greater dedication and  determination," Salinas underscored. He said he had come to  this area to commemorate an anniversary of sadness and hope:  "The 75th anniversary of the injust and unacceptable death of  Emiliano Zapata and also 75 years of commitments and work in  favor of Mexican peasants."    Salinas said many of the aspirations of Emiliano Zapata have  come true and evidence of this is the exceptional agrarian  reform. Nevertheless, he explained, Mexico has changed and new  problems and opportunities appeared along with this change, so  it was also necessary to promote changes in the law,  institutions, and practices.    Salinas asserted these changes were proposed by the very  peasants, "because the previous instruments were inadequate for  the country we had." He mentioned his government has continued  to support the banners of transformation in favor of peasants.  The president added that is why greater legal assurance has  been given to land ownership and freedom to decide and, above  all, to reaffirm the patrimony of their children."    The president recalled the modifications to Article 27 of  the  Constitution and said to this end that intense talks were held  with peasant organizations and the very men and women of the  countryside. This, he said, allowed the ejido and communal  property to become part of the Constitution, while it permitted  ejidatarios [land holders] and communal property owners to  decide on what fit their needs best. Salinas said the assembly,  which is a democratic organ where ejidatarios and communal  owners issue their views, was strengthened. This reaffirmed the  ejido is not going to disappear, but on the contrary will be  strengthened as a fundamental expression of social property in  our fatherland, the president explained.    He then spoke about large landholdings and said that since  that time it was banned from the Constitution; "large  landholdings are not going to reappear; they have disappeared  from the history of our fatherland."    Later Salinas recalled that in January of this year, 200,000  land titles of Procede [expansion unknown] were delivered and  200,000 more were delivered today here in Morelos, where now two  out of every three ejidatarios own titles to their land. Also  today the executive delivered new contributions to the  countryside because he said his government has decided to  definitely modify the way in which peasants are supported.  Thus, during the Autumn-Winter cycle, Salinas asserted that  approximately 700,000 peasants will receive in their hands a  direct support check, such as the ones he presented today to  Morelia peasants.    Salinas said that 3.5 million peasants will receive direct  support for the Spring-Summer cycle, while "in the past 2  million received nothing. Today, they will have this addition  to their family income guaranteed.    He also recalled that in all this process to reactivate the  Mexican countryside, the problem of overdue credits was resolved  and accepting their word, more than 1 million peasants received  support from the country. He added that we have also modified  commercialization mechanisms and are now working on productive  infrastructures, "but we have not finished yet. We will  continue moving forward with firmness and determination."    He then noted that the international situation is not  favorable for farmers and that Mexico must reverse the  conditions of neglect and poverty that still prevail in many  rural areas. He stressed that the government will not slow its  pace and will redouble its efforts and will achieve more  benefits for the Mexican countryside. He said that the  government "will work harder, with more dedication and  enthusiasm. We will not stop."    In his speech, Governor Riva Palacio said that today we  remember the sacrifice of the hero of Anenecuilco, who struggled  to give land to the Mexican peasants, "but for us his immolation  means that he won a place in history and glory that the  fatherland reserves for its children who give everything seeking  justice for others."    Riva Palacio added that we are happy because this  celebration  takes place within the framework of the delivery of 15,831  agrarian titles. He added that this makes a reality of the  modernization of the Mexican Constitution, in order to align  with the current world, based on programs derived from the Ayala  Plan, which reflects the thoughts and ideals that inspired  Zapata's struggle to achieve justice for peasants, reforms,  liberty, justice, and law. He said that those thoghts and  ideals are present in the adjustments that serve as a basis for  the new agrarian reform.    He stressed that those ideals were also made a reality  through Procampo with the delivery to rural producers of 3,000  certificates of payment which, as direct encouragement, permit  the competitiveness in a different market without affecting the  income the Revolution gave them for working the land.    In that manner, Riva Palacio said, an act of agrarian  justice  has been made by granting titles and economic support that will  enable Mexican peasants to receive justice and to project  themselves into Mexico's future of democracy, and liberty.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (5): Debate over funds for industry - Concern over venture capital channels for promising companies INDUSTRIAL policy has become a hot topic in the Netherlands this year following the demise and rebirth of Daf, the Dutch truckmaker, and the sale of a majority stake in Fokker, the aeroplane builder, to Daimler-Benz of Germany. Closely related to worries about the overall competitiveness of Dutch industry is the more specific question of how venture capital can best be channeled to the Netherlands' most promising companies. It is clear that the availability of capital to young companies - as well as to better-established industrial groups - is at something of a cross-roads. First, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange's 'parallel market,' established 11 years ago as a place to groom smaller companies for a full listing on the main market, is to be closed down later this year and incorporated into the stock exchange itself. The market was too illiquid to attract institutional investors, and its image was sullied by a number of controversial company failures. The looming demise of the parallel market has raised concern about the future flow of smaller companies on to the stock exchange. Much will depend on whether new admission rules are eased sufficiently to encourage newcomers. The parallel market required companies to have market capitalisation of at least Fl 5m, compared with the main market's minimum requirement of Fl 50m. The bourse is being urged to lower this floor to around Fl 25m to make it easier for companies to make an initial flotation. In a second new development, the stock exchange and the Dutch venture capital association NVP (Nederlandse Vereniging van Participatiemaatschappijen) are preparing to hold their first 'participation exchange' in late November, an opportunity for institutional investors to buy substantial share packets in non-listed Dutch companies and a place where venture capital funds can arrange 'exits' from their most successful investments. And finally, the government is trying to put together a Fl 880m 'Industry Fund' to finance promising ventures and developments at eligible Dutch companies, up to a maximum of Fl 50m per company. The country's banks, insurers and pension funds will put up Fl 200 each, as will the ministry of economic affairs. The semi-government-owned Nationale Investeringsbank, which will manage the fund, is to contribute the remaining Fl 80m. The funds are designed to help medium to large Dutch companies rather than small or start-up firms. The aim is to give assistance to companies which are at the centre of a high-technology 'cluster.' The NVP has said that from the start that the fund is unnecessary, arguing that there is no lack of venture capital in the Netherlands. In 1992, the industry invested Fl 545m in promising companies, down from Fl 675m in 1991 but still at relatively high historical levels. Mr Evert Elbertse, the NVP's secretary-general, said: 'If the government believes there is too little money available, it could have done something to help existing players make larger investments,' citing a government matching scheme operated in the US. The NVP says that to avoid as much overlap as possible in the market, the new fund should concentrate on amounts above Fl 25m because the venture capital market for amounts between Fl 10m-20m is already reasonably developed. The industry fund was originally scheduled to be launched in the early summer but talks between the various participants have taken longer than expected - 'we think the fund can get under way in the autumn,' a ministry spokesman said. The proposed fund is a government-sponsored response to concern about the passing of Fokker into German hands and the collapse of Daf and its subsequent resurrection in slimmed-down form without its former UK operations. IN the case of Daf, the Dutch government was prepared to pump money into the new company, along with the Flemish regional government of Belgium and a number of other investors, including Dutch venture capitalist firms. But Fokker's sale to Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary was a consequence of the Dutch government's refusal to help the company (in which it held a 32 per cent stake after a cash crisis in the late 1980s) finance the development of a new generation of aircraft. As with Fokker, the government's financial involvement in Daf is designed to be temporary. There is little tradition of state ownership of industry in the Netherlands, nor do the country's banks tend to own large stakes in companies, making either bourse flotation or venture-capital participation essential. The 'participation exchange", or 'parex,' scheduled to take place on November 23, is designed specifically to help the Netherlands' rich institutional investors to find appropriate investments in unlisted companies. The exchange, which will operate under a tender system, will allow for the transfer of stakes equivalent to at least 5 per cent of a company's share capital and worth a minimum of Fl 1m. Companies whose shares are up for sale must have shown a profit for at least two years. The difference between parex trading and a flotation on the stock exchange is that companies whose shares are sold directly to institutional investors by subscription do not have to meet the same strict financial reporting criteria as those who go public in search of wider ownership. Mr Elbertse said the first participation exchange in November may see dealings in only one or two companies' shares because potential participants will probably take a cautious stance at first. But he added that this could act as a stimulus for future 'parex' days, which may then be organised every six months, depending on demand.</p>

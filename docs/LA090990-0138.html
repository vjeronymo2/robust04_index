			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OUTPATIENT CLINICS CRIPPLED BY CUTBACKS  </P> <P> When a young man hobbled into an examining room at Olive View Medical Center  recently, the diagnosis was simple.  </P> <P> The man's dislocated ankle might need surgery, said Dr. Pramod Gan, as he  peered at the swollen, discolored leg that had been set and put in a cast a few  days earlier. "He really needs to see an orthopedic surgeon."  </P> <P> Yet he was told that nobody at Olive View could help him. Instead, he was  handed a yellow referral sheet and a map to help him find County-USC Medical  Center 24 miles away. He was dumbfounded.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I can make it," pleaded the man who said he had no one to  drive him to County-USC.  </P> <P> But he had no choice. He had arrived at Olive View on Aug. 23, the day the  county-run medical center shut its orthopedic clinics. The orthopedic surgeons  had been told not to show up. No one had told the patients, however, and they  waited in vain with bandaged feet and aching limbs for someone to unlock the  blue clinic door.  </P> <P> The walking wounded were the victims of Los Angeles County's latest health  crisis. Faced with a $7.6-million deficit, the county's Department of Health  Services decided to reduce services at the outpatient clinics at Olive View and  its four other major hospitals. At the other medical centers, hours at  specialty clinics, such as urology, ophthalmology and oral surgery, have been  shortened. Waiting times in some cases will double, and at County-USC, some new  patients will be turned away.  </P> <P> The cuts were a setback for Olive View, which was already treating tens of  thousands of patients more than they were receiving funding for.  </P> <P> Even before the belt-tightening, it was taking 144 days for a child diagnosed  with an orthopedic problem to see a doctor. A new gynecology patient was  waiting 94 days. A person with a skin rash was waiting 118 days for a first  visit. The initial appointment for a person with hypertension took more than  four months to schedule. A newly diagnosed AIDS patient had to wait five weeks  to be seen.  </P> <P> An immediate consequence of the new cuts will be that patients will wait even  longer.  </P> <P> "It becomes an administrative nightmare. Who decides who's going to get help  and who's going to wait?" said Maple Gray, Olive View's assistant  administrator.  </P> <P> "We've just got to make clinical judgments and see the sickest ones," said  Administrator Douglas Bagley. "Then on a relative scale decide who are less  acute and try to defer them or see them less frequently."  </P> <P> In the cramped clinics, physicians typically treat people who are not sick  enough to be hospitalized. The doctors try to keep these patients out of  hospital beds, where the costs of treatment are exorbitant.  </P> <P> Last year, 203,500 people passed through the emergency room and the clinics,  which are scattered along a confusing maze of corridors on the hospital's  second floor. The clinics' popularity has soared since three years ago, when  145,000 visits were logged at the newly reopened hospital in Sylmar.  </P> <P> To save nearly $1 million, Olive View physicians are supposed to eliminate  7,600 patient visits in the next 10 months.  </P> <P> The dental and orthopedic clinics were shut down immediately, though  administrators later decided to restore 40% of orthopedic services. Still, 161  patient visits a month will be eliminated. Many other clinics, including those  specializing in pediatrics, skin disorders, spinal deformities, kidney  ailments, podiatry and neurology, will be open fewer hours.  </P> <P> When possible, physicians are being asked to spend less time with patients and  to delay booking new appointments. A patient who normally would return in three  months, for instance, might be given enough medicine for six months instead.  </P> <P> Those with medical problems needing immediate treatment will always be squeezed  in, physicians emphasized. But some less-urgent problems will go untended  longer.  </P> <P> Those who will suffer most will be the elderly, children and the working poor  who use Olive View and its noisy, crowded waiting rooms. Most have no private  insurance or they are covered by Medi-Cal, the state's medical insurance for  the indigent. But many private physicians shun Medi-Cal because they say the  program's reimbursements are laughably low.  </P> <P> Dr. Gino Iovine, Olive View's associate medical director and director of  outpatient services, said he has instructed physicians to see more patients by  speeding up exams without sacrificing quality. But he acknowledged that the  task will be difficult.  </P> <P> "If you reduce a 20-minute examination down to 10 minutes, it becomes very  difficult to decide what to do," Iovine said. "If a patient has a headache,  it's easy to check and say there is nothing wrong with them. But, on the other  hand, you don't want to miss a brain tumor."  </P> <P> Physicians lament that they long ago cut out bantering with patients. In the  cancer clinic, where most of the patients are dying and terrified, Dr. Harry  Griffith said he feels more like a "technocrat." He only has time to ask people  how they feel, tell them their blood count and ask about their chemotherapy.  </P> <P> "I would prefer to sit and discuss some of their concerns and beliefs and  thoughts about how they want to die, but we don't have time," Griffith said.  </P> <P> Doctors predict that trying to slow the stream of people into Olive View will  backfire.  </P> <P> "You can't play the shell game with patients," insisted Dr. Robert Galli, an  emergency room physician who, like many of the hospital's physicians, is  affiliated with UCLA. "If they aren't seen in one area, they will go to another  area of the hospital to be seen."  </P> <P> That's what happened after the orthopedic clinics closed. Dr. Susan Tully, head  of the pediatric clinic, one day found five infants with possibly dislocated  hips in her waiting room. She spent hours on the phone trying unsuccessfully to  persuade orthopedic surgeons at County-USC to see the infants. Ultimately,  physicians at the private Orthopaedic Hospital near USC agreed to take them.  </P> <P> "This ortho business has caused a tremendous mess," grumbled Tully, who added  that cutting back patients in her clinic is probably impossible because worried  parents will continue to bring in children who just need chicken soup. "You  spend so much time trying to send them away, you might as well see them," she  said.  </P> <P> At least initially, the adult orthopedic patients bound for County-USC weren't  as lucky as the babies. The day that physicians tried to persuade the man with  a dislocated ankle to go to County-USC, another of the patients they referred  was sent back to Sylmar. Hospital administrators said that is no longer  happening.  </P> <P> "There were a tremendous amount of people out there who were sent adrift," said  Dr. Martin Morris, a private Mission Hills physician who ran one of Olive  View's closed orthopedic clinics.  </P> <P> Some physicians worry that delaying care will only aggravate health problems  for patients who usually postpone getting help anyway. In fact, it's already  happening, Galli said. Once or twice a week, someone suffering from diabetes,  angina or hypertension ends up in the emergency room because they ran out of  medicine before their next clinic appointment.  </P> <P> Administrators acknowledge that the emergency room will become more congested  as access to the clinics tightens. The emergency room, where gurneys are  separated by pin-striped curtains, is expected to have an influx of 3,700 more  people this year than last year, said Tony Rodgers, associate hospital  administrator.  </P> <P> With no money to hire extra emergency room staff, the wait to see a doctor,  which can now last several hours, will be even more unbearable.  </P> <P> That prospect frightens the nurses in the hospital's busiest waiting area. They  decide in what order people will see doctors in the emergency room or the  walk-in clinic, where less seriously ill people are seen without appointments.  </P> <P> One or two "triage" nurses sit behind a counter with a plastic barrier erected  to protect them from spitting patients, flying soda cans and medical  clipboards. While most patients are appreciative of any help at all, the long  waits sometimes cause tempers to boil.  </P> <P> "You are being cussed out constantly, attacked and spit at," complained Yvonne  Estrada-Heinrich, a registered nurse in the emergency room.  </P> <P> Like the emergency room, not all clinics can postpone treating patients. In the  cancer clinic, for instance, patients with malignant tumors must be seen  quickly and often. Consequently, 60 cancer patients are often scheduled to see  physicians on clinic days -- a 100% increase in recent years, said Dr. Nancy  Feldman, who oversees the oncology clinic.  </P> <P> With so many patients, the chemotherapy area is jammed. To create more space,  the two chemo nurses have sometimes resorted to laying a board across a trash  can to make a support while inserting a needle into a patient's arm. There is  only room for two reclining chairs for chemo patients, who are often medicated  to prevent nausea when the drugs are administered. The unlucky ones must sit in  straight-back chairs in the hallway. On a recent day a man with colon cancer,  who was feeling well enough to read the National Enquirer, was asked to give up  the recliner for a frail, partially bald Korean woman.  </P> <P> The high-risk prenatal clinics could also pose problems for administrators  trying to lower patient counts. Most of the poor pregnant women with diabetes,  high blood pressure and other complicated problems in the San Fernando Valley  end up receiving prenatal care at Olive View. Considering it a high priority,  the county has provided the obstetricians with extra staff and money.  </P> <P> But the opportunity to receive quality care has each year attracted a record  number of mothers. This year, physicians will see 10% to 20% more women than  last year's record number, said Dr. George Mikhail, head of the obstetrics and  gynecology department.  </P> <P> Some physicians privately worry that the pregnant women will drain more and  more money away from the other clinics.  </P> <P> "We are overburdened, but no more than anybody else," Mikhail said. "I wouldn't  trade places with other departments. I get a lot of responsive ears."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WAITING TO SEE A DOCTOR  </P> <P> Waiting times for first appointments for certain illnesses:  </P> <P> Gynecology: 94 days  </P> <P> Gynecological cancer: 34 days  </P> <P> Skin problems: 118 days  </P> <P> Cleft palate: 47 days  </P> <P> Cancer: 5 days  </P> <P> Children's blood disorders: 61 days  </P> <P> Children's orthopedic problems: 144 days  </P> <P> Hypertension and other ailments not requiring a specialist: 127 days  </P> <P> AIDS: 35 days  </P></p>

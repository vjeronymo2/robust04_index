			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL MAVERICK BECOMES A TEAM LEADER;  </P> <P> CITY GOVERNMENT: ROBERT A. CURTIS WAS ONCE A LONE DISSENTER AND FOE OF MISSION  VIEJO CO. AS A POTENTIAL MAYOR, HE'S TALKING CHANGE.  </P> <P> The biggest victor in the recent Mission Viejo City Council elections was not  even on the ballot.  </P> <P> In fact, only a few months ago, Councilman Robert A. Curtis was battling for  his political life when he faced a recall effort backed by nearly $500,000 in  contributions from the Mission Viejo Co. and other real estate interests.  </P> <P> Curtis survived the February recall effort -- it was defeated by more than a  2-to-1 margin -- and two of his supporters, Sharon Cody and Robert Breton, went  on to capture seats on the council. On Monday, when the new council takes  office, Curtis will likely be elected mayor.  </P> <P> For Curtis, who has become accustomed to being on the losing end of council  votes, the turnaround is equivalent to moving from court jester to king.  </P> <P> "It's a triumphant transition," Curtis said in an interview last week. "It's  going to be much nicer to be known as the Honorable Bob Curtis than the  recallable Bob Curtis."  </P> <P> But the prospect of a Curtis majority has raised numerous questions about the  direction of the new council and the future of the city.  </P> <P> Already, Curtis has indicated that he will ask the new council to reconsider  and possibly reverse several major decisions taken by the previous council. He  also has made it known that it will "not be business as usual" for the Mission  Viejo Co., which planned and built the community of 75,000. The events have  left political observers wondering whether Curtis will use his position to make  life difficult for the company, which openly used its personnel and money to  try to oust him from the council.  </P> <P> "The situation in Mission Viejo is very much like a sumo wrestling match," said  political consultant Harvey Englander of Newport Beach. "The two giant  wrestlers -- Mission Viejo Co. and Curtis -- are circling and waiting for each  other to make the first move."  </P> <P> Ironically, Curtis and his supporters owe part of their most recent success to  the company. Not only was Curtis' anti-recall victory a stinging rejection of  the company's role in the campaign, but it also bolstered his political  standing and created a grass-roots political organization that was credited  with the election of Cody and Breton.  </P> <P> After the recall effort was defeated, Curtis' supporters targeted three council  members -- Christian W. Keena, Victoria C. Jaffe and Norman P. Murray -- in  November. Keena and Jaffe did not file for reelection. Murray, the city's first  mayor and considered Mission Viejo's elder statesman, finished eighth in a  field of 14 candidates. The other new council member is Susan Withrow, who  Curtis said has promised "to work together for the benefit of the city."  </P> <P> Cody, who led Curtis' counter-petition drive during the recall campaign, said  the anti-recall organization helped generate the victories.  </P> <P> "Some of those same people who came forward to help against recall also helped  us campaign and walk precincts during the election," Cody said. "The  anti-recall sentiment sort of spilled over and continued on. The people feel  that the developer should not take control of our government and they want  someone who would be a tough negotiator with the company."  </P> <P> While many people are aware of the constant scuffles between Curtis and the  company, few know about their recent rapprochement. Mere weeks after Curtis'  anti-recall victory, both parties sought to mend fences when they met to  discuss development on Naciente Ridge, a planned development of 700 houses on  the city's eastern boundary.  </P> <P> After several sessions, the company agreed to reduce future citywide density by  26% and donate 7.2 acres of land along Crown Valley Parkway -- valued at $5.5  million -- for a city hall. In return, Curtis pledged his individual support on  the council for the Naciente Ridge development.  </P> <P> "The Mission Viejo Co. is delighted that Bob Curtis' leadership is making it  possible to return to the spirit of cooperation and mutual support that has  been the history of our community relations," company President Jim Gilleran  said in a release.  </P> <P> Added company spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel: "The recall is over, and we hope we are  going to work together."  </P> <P> Earlier this year the council rejected the city hall deal, but Curtis said he  plans to ask the new council to amend the developer's agreement to accept "this  better growth-management approach which brings public benefits."  </P> <P> Curtis' critics charge that he has made an about-face in his dealings with the  company. "As far as I am concerned, he's in bed with them," said Helen Monroe,  who, as leader as the pro-recall Coalition to Recall Councilman Curtis,  accepted nearly $300,000 in contributions from the company. "He wants us to  accept their piece of ground. He and they are good buddies."  </P> <P> While Curtis declares that "the era of company rule is over," he is equally  quick to point out that the new council is constrained because its predecessors  forfeited the city's right to challenge the validity of the developer's  agreement signed between the county and the company. The agreement was signed  13 days before Mission Viejo became a city and, among other things, included  provisions on housing density and parkland.  </P> <P> Responding to criticisms by Monroe and others, Curtis said: "This is the time  for the city to disregard petty politics of personality and concentrate on  reducing residential density and obtaining other public benefits. . . . For  first time, the City Council will be equal partners in meaningful negotiations,  instead of being yes-men.  </P> <P> "We cannot harbor false expectations that this council is going to bring  changes overnight," he continued. "We have forfeited our right to sue. If we  want to change anything, we have to be tough negotiators."  </P> <P> Apart from asking the new council to amend the developer's agreement, Curtis  and the new council are expected to deal with the question of a permanent site  for a city hall. The city now rents office space on La Alameda for $400,000 a  year.  </P> <P> A few months ago, the city purchased a building on Chrisanta Drive for $3.1  million and is planning to spend $1 million more in renovations.  </P> <P> "We cannot undo the purchase," said Curtis, who voted against the deal, "but I  hope the new council will take a serious look for both interim and permanent  facilities. With the company's offer of free land, we have an opportunity to  build from the ground up to suit our own needs."  </P> <P> The city hall building is not the only decision of the previous council facing  reversal. Curtis said the new council may ask the city attorney whether it can  cancel a multimillion-dollar residential waste-hauling contract awarded without  a competitive bid.  </P> <P> For many citizens, Curtis' most pressing challenge is whether he can return a  sense of order and dignity to the council. The dogfights on the previous  council sometimes became comical, with council members badgering one another  during public sessions.  </P> <P> Curtis' potential opposition in the council was former Mayor William S.  Craycraft, who supported the anti-recall campaign but broke with Curtis shortly  after, apparently over their ambitions to run for a future state Assembly seat.  </P> <P> Curtis said he and Craycraft met Friday at a Mission Viejo restaurant and  agreed to bury the hatchet. At that meeting, Curtis said he agreed to support  Craycraft's offer to represent the council on the Foothill/Eastern Corridor  Transportation Agency.  </P> <P> "Bill wants to be a team player," Curtis said. "Having served on the short end  of a divided council for three years, I have pledged to protect minority views  and ensure that every member of the council has an opportunity to shape public  policy."  </P> <P> "We have no idea what's going to happen in 1992," he continued, referring to  reapportionment. "If we all pull together and start achieving meaningful  benefits for the city and people of Mission Viejo, we will have ample credit to  go around. The rancor and scorn are things of the past. This is a new era."  </P> <P> Times correspondent Frank Messina contributed to this report.  </P></p>

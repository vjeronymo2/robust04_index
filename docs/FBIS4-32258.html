			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 22 (ATA) -- Minister of Defence Safet  Zhulali described his visit to the United States as "successful  and fruitful in the relations between the United States and  Albania." Speaking before reporters at a press conference he  declared yesterday that his visit made at the invitation of the  National Guard of South Carolina "ended with the preparation of  a joint program which envisages assistance for the Albanian  Army, in legislation, technical-scientific assistance, and in  the engineering field. The program is expected to be approved  by the Pentagon now."    The second part of this visit to Washington was described by  Minister Zhulali as "a new possibility for the increase and  further development of cooperation between the Albanian and the  U.S. Armies. It envisages a further intensification of  contacts, the signing of new agreements, and their quick  application and the further elevation of the level of  cooperation."    In the meetings with senior Pentagon officials, Mr. Zhulali  said, they had discussed the tense situation in the region, the  conflict in Bosnia, the situation in Kosova and Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. They had  represented their options for the solution of the conflict in  the region, which consist of an open dialogue and an active role  in the peace process.    With regard to Kosova, the Albanian party had requested the  beginning of an open dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina with  the intermediation of a third party, which the Albanian Party  had proposed to be the United States. The secretary of defense,  William Perry, expressed his readiness for support towards  Albania and accepted the invitation to visit Albania soon.    Asked by a reporter whether the U.S. party will play the  role  of an intermediator between Pristina and Belgrade, Minister  Zhulali responded that "It is not the desire of the United  States and Albania, but other states that are for peace demand  this. It is important that this dialogue should begin as soon  as possible and we hold that the dialogue must be constructive,"  Mr. Zhulali said.</p>

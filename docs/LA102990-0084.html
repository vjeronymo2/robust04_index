			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER VAGRANT ORDINANCE  </P> <P> The City Council this week will consider an ordinance that would allow police  to cite transients sleeping on private property without first warning them to  move along.  </P> <P> Police Chief Neil Purcell said the law is needed to help officers handle  trespassing vagrants who have become "a big problem" in the community.  </P> <P> Police have on file about 250 letters from residents who want police action and  are willing to testify in court against trespassers.  </P> <P> "We find them in the doorways of businesses, we find them on balconies,  alcoves, you name it," said Police Capt. Bill Cavanaugh, who drafted the  ordinance. In one instance, a transient camped on Irvine Co. land next to the  city long enough to harvest three crops before he was caught, Cavanaugh said.  </P> <P> Police said they had previously cited transients without warning, but a recent  change in state law requires police to first give trespassers a chance to  leave.  </P> <P> Occasionally, when a homeowner is away, a transient will start a fire or light  a barbecue to keep warm, or even break into a home to sleep in a bed, Purcell  said. "They'll burrow underneath the home if they're right off the ocean  front," Purcell said. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

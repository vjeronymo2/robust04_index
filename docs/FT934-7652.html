			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A little luxury goes a longer way - A demand for durable products has replaced the throwaway ethos of the 1980s The industry is still under pressure as illustrated by the recent takeovers of Gucci, the Italian leather company, and Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house. But the situation is improving as the global economy edges towards recovery. The surviving companies must adapt their marketing strategies to meet the new demands of the luxury market after the recession. During the 1980s, the dominant theme in the luxury business was expansion, as new customers entered the traditional markets of Europe and North America and Japan emerged as a dynamic new market for expensive western goods. Whereas the industry's old customers had preferred to pay more for products which were distinctive - either because they were made in limited editions or designed to particular specifications - all that the nouveau consumers wanted were instantly recognisable status symbols. The most successful luxury products were the obvious ones: Chanel suits with tell-tale double Cs on the gilded buttons and Louis Vuitton luggage emblazoned with LV initials. The recession has weeded out some of the nouveau consumers and reshaped consumer taste after the ostentation of the 1980s. 'People show off less than they used to,' says Francoise Jollant-Kneebone, design director of Louis Vuitton, the French luggage house. 'They're still prepared to spend a lot of money on an expensive product, but only if they're certain that it is of really high quality and that it will last.' The most successful companies of the early 1990s are those that have recognised these changes. Hermes of France has prospered by sticking to its specialist niche at the top of the market with its 135 scarves and 1,970 hand-made bags: as has Asprey, the British concern, that has turned its Bond Street store into the gift shop for the world's super-rich. 'This business is all about scale,' says Peter Wallis, director of SRU, the London-based management consultancy. 'It's perfectly possible for people to operate successfully in luxury goods today, but they have to accept that there are limitations to the size of the market.' Hermes and Asprey have acknowledged the constraints. Hermes plans to continue to expand the international network of shops that fuelled its growth in the 1980s: but Jean-Louis Dumas, chairman, has said the pace of openings will be slower in the 1990s. Naim Attallah, group chief executive of Asprey, is adamant that he will not expand the original Asprey company. 'It's a very special business,' he says. 'If we opened Aspreys all over the world, we'd risk ruining it.' The luxury companies have had to adapt their product ranges to meet the new demands of the 1990s. The backlash against the 'throwaway' ethos of the 1980s means people are buying fewer expensive items, but are prepared to pay more for them if they are convinced they will last. Jollant-Kneebone says fewer of Louis Vuitton's customers 'come back to buy a new bag every six months', but there has been a sharp increase in sales of customised luggage, which is often more expensive than standard lines. In design terms this has triggered a shift towards classic styles which will not date. The focus of fashion has swung from the glitz of Chanel to the subtler looks of designers such as Jil Sander in Hamburg and Prada in Milan, which have both expanded despite the recession. The change in taste is already reflected in luxury advertising. The glossy advertisements in Vogue and Vanity Fair now tend to dwell on exclusivity, craftsmanship and the long history of their companies, rather than the materialistic imagery of the 1980s. Service is an increasingly important component of luxury marketing as consumers demand more reassurance about the quality and durability of the products they are buying. 'Our customers are more discerning,' says Attallah. 'We must make sure our staff are properly informed about everything in our range.' Repairs and renovation are also expanding. Customers of Cutler &amp; Gross, the London optician, can calm their ecological consciences by paying Pounds 35 to have their sunglasses reconditioned, rather than spending Pounds 70 on a new pair. The financial strains on the luxury business are now easing as the US and UK come out of recession and the growth of the emerging Asian economies - South Korea, Taiwan and, most recently, China - compensates for the weakness of Japan. But no one expects the industry to return to the heady growth of the 1980s and the themes of exclusivity, high quality and sophisticated service are likely to dominate luxury marketing into the 1990s. 'A lot of people in the 1980s thought that this business was all about marketing in the conventional fast-moving -consumer-goods sense,' says Wallis of SRU. 'It might have been at the time but it certainly isn't now. It's about developing a brand with a clearly-defined market position.'</p>

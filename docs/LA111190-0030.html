			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WAR COLLEGE STRATEGISTS PLAYING CATCH-UP IN YEAR OF POLITICAL UPHEAVALS  </P> <P> Behind a locked door posted "Top Secret" at the U.S. Naval War College, scores  of men and women in uniform and civilian clothes hover over banks of brightly  colored computer screens. They are playing military games in a make-believe  world that is on the brink of disaster.  </P> <P> As orders fly back and forth over radio-telephones, small images that represent  the terrible machines and weapons of war -- missiles, ships, planes and  submarines -- move about on the screens, stalking the enemy.  </P> <P> Near the end, young men in crisp white uniforms hurry about gathering computer  printouts, which they deposit in plastic baskets labeled "classified material."  The shadows of others scurry across the huge map of the world that covers a far  wall. A voice over a loudspeaker warns that the games are coming to a close. A  sign on an opposite wall reads: "Loose Lips Sink Ships, Even in War Games."  </P> <P> Now, for the first time since the 1950s, the adversary in these war games,  played for more than 100 years at this military war college on Narragansett  Bay, is not the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> With the end of the Cold War, the reunification of Germany and a friendship  developing between the two superpowers, the Naval War College has scrambled  this year to change its curriculum.  </P> <P> Rear Adm. Joseph C. Strasser, president of the college, which was founded in  1884, said that 90% of the curriculum for this year's class of senior officers  was updated over the summer. Although study here is focused mainly on naval  strategy and operations, the student warriors, all with rank equivalent to an  Army major or higher, are in the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps.  </P> <P> "An awful lot of what we did around here was geared to the Soviet threat and  how the Navy would operate in a potential global war," said Strasser, a  mast-straight, 50-year-old career officer with a doctoral degree in philosophy  of political science. "The Cold War is over now, and an extraordinary amount of  the curriculum had to be changed to reflect that."  </P> <P> Strasser and his staff said that many of the changes reflect current doubt that  a full-scale nuclear war will break out between the United States and the  Soviet Union. This year, the college is emphasizing conventional wars outside  the European Continent. Other new courses deal with military involvement in  civilian drug-law enforcement and with combating terrorism.  </P> <P> In the history of the college, the only comparable periods of sweeping  curriculum change occurred in the early part of this century, with the advent  of military aircraft, and in the early 1950s, with the emergence of two  superpowers with nuclear weapons enough to destroy the world.  </P> <P> Navy Capt. Raymond Alcorn, a recent graduate of the school who is now dean of  students, said he was shocked to see the sudden political upheavals in the  world last year -- particularly the destruction of the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> "When I went through the course last year it was frustrating," said the lean,  intense veteran aviator who was a prisoner of war in Hanoi for almost eight  years of the Vietnam War. "We were talking about things in class that no longer  even existed."  </P> <P> War games at the college are only a small part of its curriculum of strategy,  national security decision-making and operations, but the games play a major  role in the school's mission. In many respects, they are the final exam.  </P> <P> Strasser said that in last summer's global war game, top war planners from the  three military services and a host of federal agencies, including the CIA,  Department of Defense and U.S. Space Command, were confronted with three New  World scenarios. (Students do not participate in the three-week summer war  game, although they do play games of their own.)  </P> <P> "We called these three worlds 'the good,' 'the bad' and 'the ugly,' " said  Strasser, who assumed command of the war college last spring.  </P> <P> In the world called "ugly," the Soviet Union was breaking apart and  international relations were dominated by new and volatile ideological  alliances. Arabs rallied to make trouble in the Middle East; old feuds were  rekindled in Eastern Europe; China reverted to hard-line authoritarianism.  Violence erupted in Third World nations because of hunger and despair, and a  wave of terrorism was spawned by Latin American drug cartels.  </P> <P> In the "good" world, economics and trade dominated international politics. The  "bad" world was torn apart by violent winds of nationalism as peacekeeping  influences such as NATO and the United Nations lost their authority.  </P> <P> "The lessons we learned were incorporated into the curriculum as well as sent  to Washington," said Strasser. He added that the Pentagon has always considered  the college's war games important.  </P> <P> Strasser said that war in the Middle East was identified as a crisis in all  three of the model worlds, but, he added that "it would be inaccurate to say we  predicted the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It was just a possibility that was  discussed."  </P> <P> Navy Capt. John H. Heidt, director of the school's War Gaming Department, said  that the end of the Cold War era does not mean the games are less important.  </P> <P> "The world is even more dangerous now that the major balance of power is gone.  A new world order has emerged, and each nation now has very competing  interests," he said.  </P> <P> Heidt said that the major change in the war games is that now, more emphasis is  placed on political, economic and historical considerations -- not to mention  military budget cuts.  </P> <P> Although Operation Desert Shield, the name given to the U.S. troop deployment  in Saudi Arabia, comes up often in class discussions, Heidt said that it is not  an integral part of the curriculum.  </P> <P> "We are not involved in teaching current events," he said.  </P> <P> Begun in 1887, the Naval War College games are considered the most  sophisticated of the military's three major war colleges, which include the  U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., and the U.S. Air University in  Montgomery, Ala. The curricula at those schools also have been changed to  reflect recent events.  </P> <P> "We have the finest gaming facility in the world, primarily because we have the  tradition," said Robert Wood, dean of the Center for Naval Warfare Studies.  </P> <P> The Newport school is the oldest institution of its kind in the world and has  taught many of the men and women who became the highest-ranking officers in  U.S. naval history.  </P> <P> Wood and others point proudly to a letter from Adm. Chester W. Nimitz,  commander-in-chief of the Pacific forces in World War II and a 1923 Naval War  College graduate. It reads in part:  </P> <P> "The war with Japan had been re-enacted in the game rooms at the Naval War  College by so many people, and in so many ways, that nothing that happened  during the war was a surprise . . . absolutely nothing except the kamikaze  tactics toward the end of the war; we had not visualized these."  </P></p>

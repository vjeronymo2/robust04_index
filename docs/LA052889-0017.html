			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARSENIO HALL  </P> <P> Arsenio Hall is constantly being told that he is "too black" for mainstream  America. Does anyone ever consider the vast audience that is going untapped  because Johnny Carson and Pat Sajak are "too white" (and bland) for the youth  and minorities of America? I'm sorry that Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales  feels left out when watching "The Arsenio Hall Show." At least he has the  option of turning the dial to Carson, Sajak or Letterman. Isn't that why we  have more than one channel on the tube? Why not give Arsenio Hall a chance to  be his own man and see what America thinks?  </P> <P> CAROL DANCY BAPTISTE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

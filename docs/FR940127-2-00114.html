Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 11, 1990, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;90&hyph;11) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  to revise OCC's market-maker account structure. Notice of OCC's proposal was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 12, 1990. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  On July 10, 1991, and on March 13, 1992, OCC filed Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2, respectively. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Both amendments were technical in nature and did not require republication of notice of filing. No written comments were received. As discussed below, the Commission is approving OCC's proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28676 (December 4, 1990), 55 FR 51365. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 1 modified the filing by separately defining the term ``related person'' to simplify the definition of ``associated market-maker.'' Amendment No. 1 also added to the proposal and defined the term ``proprietary market professional.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment No. 2 modified the filing by amending the Associated Market-Maker Consent agreement, which an associated market-maker uses to elect to have its account treated as a proprietary market-maker's account. The agreement was amended in connection with the Commission's no-action letter from Michael A. Macchiaroli, Assistant Director, Division, Commission, to James R. McDaniel, Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite [Counsel to OCC] (March 27, 1992) in response to a letter from James R. McDaniel, Shiff Hardin &amp; Waite [Counsel to OCC], to Michael A. Macchiaroli, Assistant Director, Division, Commission (May 21, 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. In General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change authorizes OCC to exclude from a clearing member's combined market-makers' account the exchange transactions and positions of market-makers, specialists, or registered traders that are directly or indirectly related to or associated with the carrying clearing member (``associated market-makers''). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Positions excluded from the combined market-makers' account as a result of this proposal can be maintained by the clearing member either in a separate market-maker's account (that is specifically limited to the positions of the clearing member) or in a proprietary market-maker account under certain circumstances as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The term associated market-maker is defined as a person maintaining an account with a clearing member as a market-maker, specialist, stock market-maker, stock specialist, or registered trader that is a ``related person'' of the clearing member and includes any participant in an account of which 10% or more is owned by an associated market-maker or an aggregate of 10% or more is owned by one or more associated market-makers. OCC By-Laws, Article I, Section 1.A(10). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A person is a related person of the clearing member if such person (1) is a business affiliate that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the clearing member or any officer, director, or general or special partner of the clearing member, (2) is a spouse or minor living in the same household as the related person or any non-customer of the clearing member, or (3) is an employee who manages the business or funds of the clearing member. The term related person does not include a non-customer of the clearing member. Direct or indirect control of 10% or more of the equity of any entity is deemed to confer control of that entity. OCC By-Laws, Article I, Section 1.R(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

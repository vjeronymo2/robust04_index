			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / World Trade News: US claims of chip sale curbs anger Japanese groups - FT writers in Tokyo and San Francisco look at the opposing arguments in a fresh trade dispute over critical technologies JAPANESE electronics companies yesterday were angered by a leading US senator's claims that they were withholding advanced semiconductor technology from US chip makers under a strategy to dominate the world market. The Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) said the claims were ridiculous, while one of the seven companies cited, Hitachi, said it has never even received a US order for the equipment it is alleged to have withheld. Hitachi said: 'We cannot understand why this allegation has been made. If we did receive an order, we would provide the equipment'. It was claimed Hitachi had limited sales to US companies of technology used to process semiconductor wafers. Japanese company officials were annoyed that the statement was made during a visit to Sematech, the US government and industry semiconductor joint venture, and saw the claims, which Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Senate finance committee chairman, said arose from evidence gathered by a General Accounting Office investigation, as mere politicking. Government officials in Tokyo were irritated that the allegations should come as US and Japanese officials are in the final stages of negotiating a new agreement on foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market. The suggestion by Senator Bentsen that equipment sold to US companies is at prices 20-30 per cent higher than those paid by Japanese companies was denied by the EIAJ, which said the increasing number of US and Japanese joint development projects was evidence of Japanese companies' willingness to transfer technology. 'Companies like Hitachi have been eager to find foreign partners. These types of comments reflect an attitude of trying to find fault with others, and not being able to see your own faults,' an EIAJ official said. Canon, another of the companies cited, said 'the claims contain no facts' and insisted: 'We conduct business fairly throughout the world, including the US and Europe'.</p>

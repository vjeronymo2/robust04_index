			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY DEADLOCKS ON MAN'S COMPETENCE FOR  TRIAL  </P> <P> A jury this week was unable to reach a verdict on whether a murder defendant,  who said he had spoken with Jesus and described himself as a "fallen angel,"  was mentally competent to stand trial.  </P> <P> Jurors in the Van Nuys Superior Court hearing told Judge James M. Coleman after  deliberating for a day and a half that they had deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of  finding Christopher Michael Rowland, 22, incompetent to stand trial.  </P> <P> Now, a new jury will have to be selected to determine the matter, said  Rowland's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender William M. Thornbury. Jury selection  in the new hearing was set for Nov. 5. A separate jury will be chosen if  Rowland stands trial.  </P> <P> Rowland is accused of stabbing to death Roberta Rosentheim, 18, in a Van Nuys  motel on Feb. 12, eight days after they met. Rosentheim had been introduced to  Rowland, a drifter, by her brother and immediately fell in love with him,  family members said.  </P></p>

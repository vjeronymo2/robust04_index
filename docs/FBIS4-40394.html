			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb  has received an official governmental delegation from the  Republic of Cuba, led by Council of Ministers Vice President  Lionel Soto Prieto. In the course of talks, Myacheslaw Hryb  pointed out that Belarus is interested in consolidating and  expanding economic cooperation with Cuba, which, unfortunately,  is currently developing at quite a sluggish pace. The speaker  believes problems of mutual payments are among the causes for  that situation. According to him, however, this problem can  also be resolved, given that not only Belarus has great interest  in Cuban products but Cuba is also interested in Belarusian  goods. The two sides agreed that in the near future it will be  necessary to organize the work of experts who will draft  economic agreements for 1995. In the course of the visit, the  members of the Cuban delegation also held talks with  representatives of the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of  External Economic Relations.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Brazilians on the road with a long tale to tell THE BRAZILIAN government sent on its way this week a roadshow meant to explain, to creditors across three continents, the agreement in principle reached last July to restructure Dollars 44bn (Pounds 28.9bn) of Brazil's foreign bank debt. Such roadshows have become a convention over the decade since the onset of Latin America's debt crisis. But never before, at this stage of a large debt restructuring, has its final outcome been so much in doubt. The tour - headed by Mr Pedro Malan, the chief debt negotiator - began on Wednesday in New York before at least 200 bankers. The first presentation lasted more than four hours and was criticised by some bankers as being unnecessarily long and rather ramshackle. Presentation, however, may be the least of Mr Malan's problems. The Brazilian accord is the only such agreement to have reached this stage without the borrowing country having in place a current International Monetary Fund programme. Also, it comes during a transition for economic policy under President Itamar Franco's new government. Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, is to fly to Washington on February 6 to open negotiations with the IMF on a new accord, the last having lapsed after the first instalment because of Brazil's failure to meet targets. A technical mission of the fund is expected in Braslia next week. The government is hoping for a sympathetic hearing on the basis of the country's demonstration of institutional strength throughout the bringing to book last year of Mr Fernando Collor, then Brazil's president, who was accused of corruption. However, some bankers believe that the fund may have reached its limit of tolerance towards Brazil. In the absence of clear economic policy direction from the new government, legislation to increase taxes, now before Congress, may not be enough to obtain a new accord. It is unclear how Brazil, with no IMF accord in place, intends to pay the Dollars 3.2bn collateral to guarantee some of the bonds to be issued under the accord, at least half of which is supposed to be provided by multilateral agencies and the rest from reserves. European bankers had no success in attempts to convince the Brazilians to delay the debt tour at least until after the IMF negotiations. Some US banks keen to see the deal go ahead have been pushing Brazil to use its reserves, which are at historic levels - Dollars 19bn in cash at the end of last year - and thus move ahead without the IMF. One said: 'If Brazil wants to meet its foreign commitments, it will do so whether or not an IMF deal is in place. Brazilian letters of intent with the IMF are little more than junk mail anyway.' However, to put up all the money from reserves would be politically difficult for the Brazilian government and unlikely to obtain the necessary Senate approval. The most likely course is that many banks will indicate their choice of options - although the February 22 deadline seems unlikely to be met - hoping that Brazil will make progress with the IMF and its own fiscal situation. One European banker said: 'If, by February 22, they don't have an IMF deal, I don't think that would stop me from recommending that we tender our debt.' Bankers supporting the deal emphasise the new government has followed to the letter the agreement reached under the Collor government. The lack of an IMF accord is not the only difficulty, however. The six options open to creditors make it one of the most complex 'Brady' debt reduction deals to have emerged. Even with an IMF accord, Dollars 3.2bn is unlikely to be sufficient to provide the necessary guarantees for the new bonds immediately. So the remaining guarantees will have to be phased in over two years, or bonds issued in place of the guarantees. Furthermore, as in the Argentine agreement completed last year, some banks will not get the choice they want. Brazilian officials have indicated they want 'balance' in the deal. This is code for saying they do not want all the banks to choose the most attractive option which, at current low US interest rates, is the 'par' bond. These bonds would be the most expensive for Brazil and are likely to use the most collateral. The Brazilians have informally indicated they would like the final choice to be split - 40 per cent for 'par' bonds, 40 per cent for 'discount' bonds, and 20 per cent for the other options, including new loans. Some banks - including Citibank, the largest lender - are said to be considering new loans. Without the right balance, though, the deal may be jeopardised. It is no surprise, then, that even the deal's most optimistic supporters admit to considerable doubts that it can be closed before its final deadline of July 31.</p>

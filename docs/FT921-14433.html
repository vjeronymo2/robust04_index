			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Sterling has many defences Nothing that has yet happened since the UK joined the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in October 1990 casts any more light on whether it joined at the correct exchange rate or not. Those who argue that rate is too high are in effect saying that a lower average real wage is required to secure external and internal balance at a high level of employment, and that a nominal devaluation is more likely to bring this about than maintaining the pressure on pay settlements under the ERM. The recent debate has not, however, been about this fundamental issue. The clamour to escape from the constraints of the ERM comes mostly from people looking for a way of reducing British interest rates irrespective of what the Bundesbank does. Too many of them cherish the illusion that there is a compromise policy called a realignment (Eurospeak for devaluation), which would restore interest rate freedom to Britain while allowing it to remain in the system and thus avoid too much loss of face on Mr John Major's part. They forget that UK interest rates would have to remain competitive with German ones at the new parity - with a more unfavourable differential than the 1 percentage point or so now prevailing. The link with German interest rates would remain even in a multilateral realignment in which the D-Mark moved up against several leading currencies - in any case a pipe-dream, which the French government, which would have to be the main player, has ruled out. What is astonishing is how modest the pressure on sterling has been despite the unceasing clamour in The Times, Sunday Times, Evening Standard and related organs, for a large interest rate cut at all costs, irrespective of the ERM. So far there has been little difficulty in maintaining sterling within the prescribed band. If sterling did come under serious pressure, the first obvious line of defence would be to take advantage of the full 6 per cent band, and allow sterling to fall nearer its D-Mark floor. Such a move would increase the losses risked by speculators against the pound. Second, if that is not enough, there remains a huge potential for central bank intervention even before the D-Mark margin is reached. The combined British and German foreign exchange reserves are committed to the defence of sterling to prevent a breach of the margins. Base rates would be increased, however reluctantly, if the reserve drain became too large. But this is only the third line of defence. However politically distasteful, it would not be as catastrophic politically for the government as a humiliating departure from the ERM which like other 'dashes for freedom' would end in yet higher interest rates as Messrs Kinnock and Smith coped with the ensuing sterling plunge.</p>

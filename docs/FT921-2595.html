			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bank merger dominates share trading THE LONDON equity market was dominated by the surprise news that Midland Bank is to merge with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Shrugging off poor UK economic and industrial statistics yesterday and resisting pressure from the derivative markets, shares put on their first strong performance for more than a week. The FT-SE 100 Index opened firmly, bouncing back from the slide prompted by disappointment over the governing Conservative party's Budget. It reached its day's high within the first half-hour of official business. Budget proposals by the opposition Labour party on Monday had tended to allay the fears of traditionally conservative City observers. Political optimism was boosted in the City by an opinion poll favourable to the Conservatives and this helped the index to maintain its early strength. However, the level of genuine business remained low throughout the day, with only the banking sector sparking real excitement. Volume was principally generated by dealing between marketmakers, with the institutions staying on the sidelines ahead of the April 9 general election. In fact, the day belonged to Midland. The bank's shares rose sharply following the merger announcement and held their strength as traders hoped that a contested bid might develop. The stock was the most heavily traded on the Stock Exchange yesterday, as well as on the floor of the London Traded Options Market. The news also prompted heavy activity in a number of bank stocks as the merger announcement was perceived as a sign that the Bank of England might allow other takeovers within the sector. In addition, the news revived interest in likely bid targets across the range of the market. There were suggestions that beleaguered Lonrho might attract a suitor, and other possible targets such as Smith &amp; Nephew, BAT Industries and BTR received a fillip. This positive attitude helped to counterbalance the announcements that industrial output in the UK had fallen by 1.3 per cent and that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement was worse than previously forecast. It was also enough to help the cash market resist pressure from traders at the Financial Futures exchange who, taking a more downbeat view, were dealing the FT-SE 100 contract for March delivery at a discount to its estimated fair value, the premium that takes into account dividends and carrying costs. Any tendency for shares to drift back during the afternoon was offset by a healthy opening on Wall Street, which rose following the announcement of encouraging US economic statistics. There was also a positive input from a firm pound. Nevertheless, there were some short-term losers, particularly Glaxo, which suffered as a result of a French decision to investigate the marketing of the pharmaceutical company's migraine drug Imigran. By the market's close, the FT-SE Index was 20.5 better at 2,491.2, with the rise in Midland Bank accounting for almost four points of that gain. The Seaq ticker showed a turnover of 450m shares, above the previous day's 363.5m shares, which represented retail business worth only Pounds 676m. However, yesterday's volume was extremely disappointing considering the bid activity.</p>

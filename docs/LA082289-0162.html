			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JULY DROP IN ORDERS FOR 'BIG TICKET' DURABLE GOODS IS 4TH THIS YEAR  </P> <P> Orders for "big ticket" durable goods fell 1.9% in July, the fourth decline  this year, the government said today in a report that showed manufacturing  continuing to struggle despite recent interest rate declines.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items expected to last  three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $122.9 billion last month,  the lowest level since October, 1988.  </P> <P> Military orders plunged 14.7% in July after a 17.4% rise in June. The other  major decline came in non-electrical machinery, which plummeted 9.7% last month  after a 4.8% rise in June.  </P> <P> Durable goods, one of the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy  because consumers often borrow to buy them, also had declined in January,  February and May.  </P> <P> The latest drop came despite moves by the Federal Reserve Board since early  June to nudge interest rates lower. Earlier, the central bank had been raising  rates to dampen economic vigor and inflationary pressure.  </P></p>

Saburov, who had  accepted Meshkov's offer to lead the Crimean government, made  this statement in an interview with Interfax upon his return to  Moscow from the Crimea, where he had stayed from February 22  through March 5.    In his words, astounded by Meshkov's election to the  presidency, Crimea's ex-premier and his deputies "have  deliberately wrapped up all their affairs despite the need to  organize the spring sowing campaign, prepare for the summer  holiday season and resolve many urgent problems."    "Thus, displeased with the popular vote in Meshkov's favour,  the former Crimean leadership was ready to doom the Crimeans to  hunger and cold which is nothing but political wickedness,"  Saburov declared.    At the same time, he pointed to Meshkov's growing popularity  among Crimean industrialists, "whose initial reaction to his  election was cautious."    Saburov underscored the danger of trying to make the Crimea  submit to Ukraine by force. In his words, demands to resume  ties with Russia are not nationalist by nature, yet they are  essential since "Crimea's economy is oriented towards Russia  rather than Ukraine," and the rupture of ties with Russia would  be a disaster for Crimea.    In Saburov's opinion, "with all the contradiction" in the  law  on the delimitation of powers between Ukraine and Crimea, "it is  lucrative to Kiev, Simferopol, and Moscow alike." "If Kiev  refrains from mounting barriers deliberately, he remarked, the  Crimea could play the role of a bridge between Ukraine, Russia,  and other former USSR republics."    He gave assurance that in forming a Crimean cabinet he would  rely on knowledgeable economists and responsible executives.  "The selection process will be tough," he declared.    Saburov noted that "a good understanding and interaction"  had  emerged between him and Meshkov. Speaking about the current  situation in the Crimea, he said that the democrats there were  trying to build a smooth democratic market economy."    "Inside the Crimea, there are tough problems, but the  problem  of the Crimea is nonexistent," Saburov declared. In his view,  the Crimea is a trump card for outside politicians. "I least of  all mean Kiev," he added.    According to the Crimean Constitution, the president is  simultaneously the head of the republic's cabinet, and his  deputy and other cabinet members are appointed by parliament,    So far there has been no official decree on the appointment  of Saburov to the post of deputy premier.</p>

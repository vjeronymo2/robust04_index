			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TENTATIVE AGREEMENT FOR NURSES COMES UNDER  FIRE  </P> <P> A tentative agreement that averted a nurses' strike at Los Angeles County-run  clinics and hospitals was assailed by some members of the rank and file  Thursday, leaving final approval of the proposed pact far from certain.  </P> <P> "It should be voted down, but I don't know if it will be," said Beverly  Footman, a nurse practitioner for the county.  </P> <P> A vote on the proposed 17.25% pay raise over two years, originally set for  today, was rescheduled until Monday to give union officials more time to  disseminate details of the proposal to nurses.  </P> <P> Footman complained that the proposed salary increase still leaves county nurses  earning less than private nurses, making it difficult for the county to fill  1,000 nursing vacancies. County nurses currently earn between $2,600 and $3,000  a month.  </P> <P> A tentative agreement on a new contract for 5,126 nurses was announced late  Wednesday, averting a strike that had been due to begin at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> But the head of the nurses' bargaining team later indicated that final  agreement is far less certain. The proposed two-year contract is being  presented to the nurses for a vote without a recommendation.  </P> <P> Pandora McDaniel, a nurse at a downtown clinic, said: "I don't feel it's a fair  settlement. We're asking for 22% (over two years), and that's what we should  get."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Chris Esqueda, a nurse at County-USC Medical Center, called  the proposed agreement "pretty good" and said his fellow nurses were also  pleased.  </P></p>

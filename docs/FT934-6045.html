			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn flat at Pounds 10.3m after exceptional Shares in Powell Duffryn rose by 15p to 614p after the distribution, storage and engineering group reported a strong increase in underlying profitability. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 were flat at Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 10.4m). There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 3.9m, a loss of Pounds 5.7m on the disposal of the Hamworthy hydraulics and transmissions business was partly offset by a property disposal gain. However operating profits rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 12m) on sales of Pounds 355m (Pounds 330.8m), including Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 21.6p) from discontinued activities. Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said the strong trading start to the year was in part due to the recent restructuring and it belied continuing weaknesses in some of its main markets. However, improved trading conditions seen in some parts of the group's oil distribution activities this summer should, given reasonable winter weather conditions, augur well for the remainder of the year in fuel distribution. Mr Hubbard said growth in the company's shares of the automotive and industrial oil markets was underpinned both by improved terms of trade and by reduced failures among road haulage customers. However, the weak summer coal market was exacerbated by technical start-up problems in a coal contract, which held back overall progress. Steady trading performances in the port activities against a background of patchy demand were boosted by the contribution from the minority interest in Stephenson Clarke Shipping. Storage interests made further progress. Although results from the UK dry goods warehouses and US packaging plants were affected by lower demand, this was more than offset by improved results from the liquid storage operations in the UK and overseas, particularly Australia. Earnings per share were 8p (9.8p). The interim dividend is maintained at 6.6p. COMMENT The positive reception given to these impressive figures confirms the re-rating enjoyed by Powell Duffryn, which has seen its shares more than double in the last 19 months. After apparently slumbering in the eighties, the group revitalised itself through buying shrewdly into the ports business and shedding less profitable activities. Gearing of about 20 per cent gives plenty of muscle to buy another large UK port and the group will continue to invest in its quality Hamworthy engineering businesses. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 37m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 17. That is a 13 per cent premium to the market, which seems modest for a well-run group which has yet to see strong recovery in its main markets. Even a maintained dividend would still offer a premium yield and more bullish analysts think a cold winter would enable the group to lift the final payment.</p>

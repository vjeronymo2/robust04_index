Edward, a production assistant for a Lloyd Webber company, popped into the  Performing Arts Center via the loading dock, where he was met by center chiefs  Henry Segerstrom and Thomas Kendrick. . . . The crowd didn't even seem to  notice when his royal highness, seventh in line for the British throne, slipped  into a prime seat. He later dined with Starlight cast members at Gustaf Anders  restaurant in Santa Ana. Lanie Jones and Eric Bailey  </P></p>

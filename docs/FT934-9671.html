			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Slide in markets on hold as dealers await US figures THE SLIDE in financial markets last week was put on hold yesterday, as dealers awaited the next set of important US economic data today, but however the underlying tone remained nervous. US Treasury bonds again appeared weak yesterday, but most other bond and stock market prices were little changed, prompting speculation that US market domination over economic fundamentals in other markets may be weakening. Dealers remained concerned, however, that today's US producer prices data for October could trigger a further sell-off. Last week, signs of an acceleration of economic growth in the US prompted a bout of profit-taking in the US and European bond markets, as the end of a record year for many investors approaches. The bond market weakness also fed through into the world's stock markets. The US long bond lost further ground yesterday morning but the US stock market shrugged off the downward trend in bond prices, as cyclical stocks helped push indices modestly higher. By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/8 at 100 1/16 , yielding 6.23 per cent. The short end of the market, however, was moving ahead, with the two-year note up  1/32 at 99 15/16 , to 4.14 per cent. At 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 8.66 higher at 3,652.09. Attention was largely directed at today's report on wholesale prices and tomorrow's data on retail prices. Both sets of data are expected to reinforce fears that inflationary pressures in the US economy are building. European bond markets were mostly little changed, though the UK gilts market managed a  1/4 point rally, on the back of encouraging inflation data. The FT-SE 100 index ended 8 points down at 3,077.6, while Germany's Dax index fell 1.75 points to 2,010.8 and France's CAC-40 index rose 3.78 points to 2,084.79. Stock market analysts fear that a reassessment of investment strategies by US fund managers could cause a reversal of the heavy flow of funds into the European stock market this year. Trading was light, as many investors and traders chose to stay on the sidelines until a clear direction has been established. World stocks, Page 38 London stocks, Page 31</p>

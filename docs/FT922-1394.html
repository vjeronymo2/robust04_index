			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse chief turns his attention on Mothercare MR DAVID DWORKIN, the chief executive designate at Storehouse, is already going through the retailing conglomerate like a dose of salts. Yesterday, the company announced that Mr Derek Lovelock was resigning as chief executive of Mothercare to be replaced by Ms Ann Iverson, who was appointed last month to the number two slot at the childrenswear chain. Further management changes at Mothercare are expected shortly. Storehouse also announced that Ms Sheila Forbes's job as group personnel director had been made redundant following a head office reorganisation. This slimming-down exercise will see the 40-man head office cut by half and symbolically relocated within the BhS building, where Mr Dworkin has ruled the roost for the past three years. The company stressed that the moves were no reflection on Mothercare's current trading position. Sales increases are said to be running in the 'double-digits'. The changes at Mothercare follow a similar restruc-turing exercise at Habitat last month which led to the departure of Mr Michael Harvey as chairman and chief executive. Mr Dworkin has already announced that he wants Mothercare's management team to work more closely with that of BhS to share sourcing expertise and increase buying muscle. The appointment of Ms Iverson looks an ideal means of achieving the goal. She was formerly stores director at BhS and previously worked with Mr Dworkin at Bonwit Teller, the US fashion chain. Mr Dworkin officially succeeds Mr Michael Julien as chief executive after the company's annual meeting next month.</p>

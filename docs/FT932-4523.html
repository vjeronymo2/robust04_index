			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / NZ bank governor promises firm line THE New Zealand Reserve Bank is to maintain its monetary policy despite some inflationary risks, Mr Don Brash, the central bank's governor, said yesterday. Mr Brash, whose task is to control the country's monetary policy in the interests of maintaining low inflation, was reporting for the first time under his 'targets agreement' with the minister of finance, set when he renegotiated his five-year contract last December. The Bank is otherwise independent of the government. Releasing the Bank's six-monthly policy statement, he said the 'balance of risks suggests the possibility of rather higher inflation is a real one'. He said the Bank would not hesitate to tighten monetary policy if it became clear the inflation target was being threatened.' He said the country was on a higher inflation track than previously, although rises were still comfortably with the Bank's target of nil to 2 per cent. The Bank's forecasts show that adjusting for one-off factors, such as changes in government charges and in interest rates, underlying inflation was estimated to have been unchanged at 1.8 per cent for the year to March. Underlying inflation is expected to fall to 1.6 per cent in the year to the end of this month. The Bank said its actions to tighten monetary policy last December, which led to a rise in the New Zealand dollar, had had the intended result of keeping inflation below 2 per cent. As a result the currency as measured against the trade weighted index was now considerably higher than in late December and early January, and both short and long term interest and bond rates had fallen back to the levels of last November. The bank said its forecasts assumed economic growth of 3 per cent. Underlying inflation was expected to ease to around 1.2 per cent for the year to December 1994. The forecast included an assumption that rising timber prices would lead to an 0.6 point rise in inflation. Mr Brash said the rising domestic prices of timber represented the 'first significant shock' for the bank's regulatory powers.</p>

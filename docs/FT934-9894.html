			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Clinton tries to heal union row on Nafta THE WHITE HOUSE yesterday chose to characterise as 'merely a difference of opinion' President Bill Clinton's criticism of strong-arm trade union tactics to persuade members of Congress to vote against the North American Free Trade Agreement. Towards the end of his Sunday television interview, the president himself had qualified his attack. Advised during a commercial break of the initial news agency headlines of his earlier comments, Mr Clinton said: 'These guys are my friends. I just don't agree with them on Nafta.' Mr Mack McLarty, the White House chief of staff, went on television yesterday to deliver the same message. The president and the unions 'shared a lot of common ground,' he said, although Nafta was an exception. Nevertheless, Mr Thomas Donahue, general secretary of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation, had on Sunday evening accused Mr Clinton of 'a cheap shot', one which was 'part of a desperate effort to capture votes'. Only a tiny fraction of organised labour has come out in favour of Nafta, though opposition to it from some white-collar and federal employee unions has been muted. More typical was a comment to the Washington Post yesterday by Mr William Bywater, head of the electrical workers union: 'I tell any Democrat (preparing to vote for Nafta) I am not going to support any of them, period. I will try to get a candidate to run against them in the primary,' even if it meant a seat falling to the Republican party. Meanwhile, one employer with a heavily unionised workforce did come off the fence yesterday in Nafta's favour. United Parcel Service, the country's largest employer of members of the Teamsters union (165,000 out of the company's payroll of 240,000), said that 'the trade boom from Nafta will result in hundreds of new UPS jobs', most of them for union members. Mr Clinton was critical on Sunday of US corporations for not lobbying hard enough in favour of the agreement, though the shift in the UPS position had been decided on Friday. Some substantial business political contributors have also privately threatened to withhold funds from those who vote against. The president himself was fully engaged in the lobbying effort yesterday, with three White House meetings and a dinner for 15-20 undecided members of Congress on his schedule. But most attention was focused on tonight's televised debate between Vice-President Al Gore and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and last year's independent presidential candidate. The Justice Department yesterday confirmed that the FBI had passed on to Mr Perot a death threat which, he said, came from a 'Mafia-like' group working for Nafta approval.</p>

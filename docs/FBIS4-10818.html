			<p>BFN     [Text] The Brazilian Labor Party [PTB] has joined a group  of political parties that is seeking to form a front to back the  presidential candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso. Following the withdrawal of Senator Jose  Andrade Vieira's candidacy, the PTB is joining the coalition  sponsored by the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which  aims to promote Cardoso's election. In addition to the PTB,  with which an agreement was concluded yesterday, the PSDB is  already counting in practice on the support of the PFL [Liberal  Front Party] and the PP [Popular Party].    The consolidation of this big front will require, however,  further political negotiations. Andrade Vieira was offered the  Labor Ministry, but he has not yet accepted. PP President  Alvaro Dias said that the PP "will support Cardoso only if the  alliance does not collide with the interests of PP candidates  for state governors."    The PSDB is facing a growing internal opposition to an  alliance with the PFL. Senator Mario Covas, PSDB candidate for  governor of Sao Paulo State, has again criticized the proposal  to nominate a PFL member as Cardoso's running mate. Some PSDB  mayors -- such as Lidice da Mata of Salvador and Paulo Hartung  of Vitoria, among others -- have conveyed their heightened  opposition to the PSDB leaders themselves by bringing into focus  some regional political problems they characterize as  insurmountable.</p>

JoBeth Williams plays Woods' wife.  </P> <P> Lindsay Wagner, the former star of "The Bionic Woman," plays a woman who could  use some bionic powers in "From the Dead of Night," a four-hour movie that NBC  plans to broadcast Feb. 27-28. It's about a fashion designer who is being  pursued by six "beings" from "the other side." Also in the cast are Bruce  Boxleitner, Diahann Carroll, Robin Thomas and Robert Prosky.  </P> <P> ABC has set Feb. 19 and 21 as the telecast dates for "Passion and Paradise," a  new TV drama about murder in the Bahamas.

Also on hand are Elizabeth Pena, Eddie Velez, Jenny Lewis and  Miguel Ferrer.  </P> <P> Debbie Reynolds will play what NBC describes as a fading movie star in "Perry  Mason: The Case of the Final Curtain."

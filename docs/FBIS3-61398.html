Participants of the meeting in addition to  Brazauskas were Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius; Seimas  Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas; Jurgis Jurgelis, general director of  the Security Service; Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius;  Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys; Jonas Andriskevicius, chief of  the armed forces; Gintaras Tamulaitis, deputy to the armed  forces chief of staff; Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the  Seimas national security committee; Algimantas Norvilas, the  president's advisor on national security affairs. Two topics  were deliberated at the meeting: Petkevicius presented the  defense doctrine, and Linkevicius presented a plan for the  reorganization of the structure of the national defense system.    Following the meeting, Andriskevicius, chief of the armed  forces, indicated that a decision had been made to present to  the Seimas the defense doctrine deliberated at the meeting. In  his opinion, there had been no fundamental disagreements during  the discussions, and there was ready agreement regarding  difficult technical issues. With respect to a reorganization of  the structure of the national defense system, a decision was  made to separate the functions of the armed forces and the  ministry. Asked whether there had already been a division of the  functions, Andriskevicius replied, "The commission is working  and the president expressed the hope that this issue be resolved  as quickly as possible. So this is what we will do."    Andriskevicius indicated that those at the meeting were  happy  that good bilateral relations were continuing between Russia and  Lithuania in the wake of the meeting between the countries'  prime ministers. It is thought that certain technical military  issues will receive a certain amount of accelerated attention.    Assessing the Defense Council meeting, Foreign Minister  Gylys  said that there had been discussion of how to establish public  control of funds earmarked for national defense. This, he  asserted, is one of the requirements for integration into  international security systems.    To the knowledge of Norvilas, the president's advisor on  national security affairs, the reorganization in the national  defense system has already begun. The group working on the  reorganization of the defense ministry has been entrusted with  selection of one of four available draft proposals, and,  following deliberation of it, with submitting it to the Defense  Council.</p>

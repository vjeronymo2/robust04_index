			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, today  continues consultations on his administration's political  program with the meeting with leaders of thought in the country.  From Abuja, State House correspondent Ojie Ogbonaya Ojie  reports:    [Begin recording] [Ojie] Declaring the meeting open, Gen.  Abacha said it was part of his administration's consultation  with various interest groups and certain segments of society on  the state of the nation.    [Abacha] As you are aware of, many thought that the events  of  the past two weeks were going to impact so adversely on our  peaceful progress towards the democratic transition. In any way  they were right, in that some attempts were indeed made to  derail progress in the process, and bring the nation back to the  [words indistinct] from which we pulled it on 13th November last  year. The (?vigilance) and firm measures taken by security and  law enforcement agencies, and the refusal of our citizenry to be  made the cannon fodder for the fulfillment of the individual  personal ambitions, have combined to foil the plans of those who  wish to disrupt our national peace and harmony.    [Ojie] Gen. Abacha said it was ironical for all and sundry  to  hold the military responsible for everything in the society. He  said as much, as it was not his intention to respond to the  charges and counter accusations being leveled against the  military and the process of governance in the country. It was  on record, he added, that some of the critics were those who  invited his administration to power.    [Abacha] The truth of the matter is that some of you here  present today, and many who are now pretending otherwise,  appealed to us to intervene and arrest the drifting of the  (?dark day). Even the representatives of some foreign  governments made [words indistinct] appeals to us to save the  nation from imminent collapse and disintegration. We have  responded patriotically and in consonance with our professional  calling. We believe that we have achieved the first major  objective of our intervention, that of maintaining the corporate  existence of our country as one and indivisible nation, and  creating the atmosphere of peace and security in which our  people can pursue their legitimate businesses without fear of  what tomorrow may bring.    [Ojie] Gen. Abacha emphasized the importance of (?private)  participation in the constitutional conference, and reaffirmed  the commitment and determination of his administration to the  restoration of democracy in the country within the shortest  possible time.    [Abacha] We are now concentrating on (?certain) major  objectives of our intervention -- the restoration of democracy  in our beloved country. Let none confuse issues or mislead our  foreign friends and well-wishers by bringing the (?impression)  of the nation in disharmony as far as commitment to democracy is  concerned. Civilians or military, politicians or other  professionals, we are all as a people yearning for democracy.  We are all yearning for the rule of law, a free press, and  fundamental human rights. The (?labor) for democracy is  nobody's monopoly. It is the wealth of the nation.    [Ojie] On the economy, the head of state said that the  government was prepared to monitor and review the economic  policies and adopt corrective measures where necessary. He  blamed the problems facing the implementation of economic  policies on greed and exploitation by some businessmen. Gen.  Abacha then gave the assurance that the welfare of the people  will henceforth remain the main focus of the economic policies  of his administration. Top prominent leaders were drawn from  each state of the Federation. Some of them include the former  vice president, Dr. Alex Ekwueme. [end recording]</p>

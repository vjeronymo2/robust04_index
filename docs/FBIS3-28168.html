However, there will be an  adverse consequence in the agricultural area, as Vietnam will  become a formidable competitor of Thailand in the future.  Churin said:    [Begin Churin recording, in progress] ...our agricultural  products such as rubber and coffee. Vietnam also produces these  crops and the United States is a big coffee-consuming country.  The negative side is that Vietnam will become our competitor in  the U.S. market. The United States is the third biggest market  for our coffee. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Chokchai Aksoranan, chairman of the Chamber of  Industries of Thailand, said foreign investment in Vietnam will  increase. American investors can join hands with their Thai  counterparts in that country. Hence, Vietnam's demand for  commodities will rise and this will benefit the marketing of  Thai products. However, in the long run, Thai entrepreneurs  must readjust and reduce their production costs to compete with  Vietnam.</p>

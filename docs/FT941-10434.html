			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: AlliedSignal posts 29% rise in income AlliedSignal, the US high technology group, yesterday underscored its sharply improved performance with a 29 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income, a stock split and a 16 per cent dividend increase. Its share price and profits have soared since Mr Lawrence Bossidy, formerly at General Electric, took over as chairman in 1991 and began a wholesale restructuring. AlliedSignal reported earnings of Dollars 178m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, up from Dollars 138m, or 98 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales rose from Dollars 3.05bn to Dollars 3.06bn and the operating margin rose from 6.1 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Since its shares have risen 193 per cent since the start of 1991 it is making a 2-for-1 stock split, and making shares available for this by redeeming a stock purchase scheme, or poison pill, set up to guard against a hostile takeover. Shareholders will get a special 5 cents a share payment in addition to the first-quarter dividend of 29 cents. The company also plans to increase the dividend to 33 1/2 cents a pre-split share from the second quarter. For the full year, the group reported net income of Dollars 411m, or Dollars 2.90, against a loss of Dollars 712m, or Dollars 5.05, after accounting changes.</p>

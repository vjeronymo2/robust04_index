			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Times price cut to 20p in war with Telegraph Mr Rupert Murdoch last night stepped up Britain's newspaper wars, cutting the price of The Times by 10p to 20p, one day after The Daily Telegraph dropped its price to 30p. Earlier in the day, the London Stock Exchange launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Telegraph's action, amid fierce City criticism of the recent share sale by proprietor Mr Conrad Black. The Stock Exchange visited the Telegraph's offices where it was provided with documents showing the sequence of events leading up to the price cut. It is also investigating share sales by two Telegraph employees on Wednesday. Telegraph shares plunged by 191p to 349p yesterday, 40 per cent below the price at which Hollinger, the Canadian publishing group controlled by Mr Black, sold Pounds 73m of shares on May 19. The shares were bought by Cazenove, the Telegraph's stockbrokers, and Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, which sold them on to institutional investors, including fund manager Henderson Administration. The purchasers, nursing total losses of almost Pounds 30m, expressed anger at the timing of the Hollinger sale. One institution said: 'This is a serious matter which we will be taking up with the non-executive directors.' Mr Black said the documents provided to the Stock Exchange showed that the price cut decision was made after June 10, when the Telegraph management saw figures showing the surge in the Times sales in May. 'At the time of the share sale, which we discussed with the Telegraph management, we could see nothing other than business as usual through the summer,' he said. Mr Black said he was not told of the Telegraph management's recommendation to cut the price until June 14. The Telegraph had intended to make the price cut next week but was rushed into it. 'I agreed with the decision and although I knew it would be embarrassing for me I could not say 'you can't do that for the sake of your chairman's public relations convenience',' Mr Black said. Lord Swaythling, the Telegraph's senior non-executive director, said: 'I am absolutely convinced that the executive management had not contemplated the price cut until very recently.' Shares in Hollinger fell CDollars 1 3/4 in Toronto to close at CDollars 14 3/8 . Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, said he was determined to maintain the momentum in making The Times 'a permanently profitable paper'. Now selling 515,000, it would probably need sales of between 800,000-900,000 to be profitable at 20p. Price-cut turmoil, Page 13 Lex, Page 20 London stocks, Page 38</p>

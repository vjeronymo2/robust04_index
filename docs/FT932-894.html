			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Major tries to restore calm in Tory ranks MR John Major sought yesterday to calm the political storm over the Conservative party's links with Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, by insisting that the resignation of Mr Michael Mates had drawn a line under the affair. The prime minister's comments came as senior ministers rallied to support his authority. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, dismissed the prospect of any challenge to Mr Major's leadership as a 'dead duck'. Mr Hurd admitted yesterday the government had had a rough year, with 'a run of misfortunes and certainly mistakes', but said that Mr Major's authority was not in doubt. He believed the government was at a turning point, where the underlying realities of economic recovery and increasing party unity would come through. There was foreboding, however, among Tory MPs that the furore over the fugitive businessman might be revived in a resignation statement by Mr Mates, who is expected to attack the handling of Mr Nadir's case. The government was also confronted by the threat of a backlash from Tory MPs over taxation. Several MPs on the right of the party reacted angrily to the suggestion from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that he might raise taxes in the November Budget. The MPs called instead for much deeper cuts in public spending to reduce the borrowing requirement. Mr Major appeared shaken by the barrage of media criticism of his handling of Mr Mates' resignation on Thursday, with aides describing him as 'furious' at the coverage. His frustration at the persistent questioning of his authority was also apparent in his own comments yesterday. 'Prime ministers are there to be criticised. Whatever had happened, I think I would have been criticised. That is the way of life for prime ministers,' he said in his Huntingdon constituency. Calling for an end to the concentration on the Mates affair, Mr Major said: 'It's over, it's finished,' and appealed for the former minister to be left alone for a while. Sir John Wheeler, a veteran backbencher, is to succeed Mr Mates as Northern Ireland security minister. Editorial Comment, Page 8 Baker sues Daily Mail on Nadir allegations, Page 6</p>

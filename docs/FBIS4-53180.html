			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Toshio Morikawa, chairman of the Federation </F> of Bankers' Association of Japan, by Jun Wada, editor in chief  of NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN; place and date not given]    [Text] On 26 April, Sumitomo Bank President Toshio  Morikawa became the first official of that bank to assume the  chairmanship of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan.  In reference to nonperforming loans of banks, Chairman Morikawa  said, "We have passed the peak for the occurrence of bad loans."  He suggested that Japan's financial systems are headed towards  stabilization. Relative to the public disclosure of bonds whose  interest payments have been reduced or forgiven, he assumed a  cautious stance, saying, "They are different from the bad loans  that are now being publicly disclosed." And, he stressed his  position that he intends to ask the Ministry of Finance [MOF] to  review in the spring of 1995 regulations applicable to the  operation of securities subsidiaries of banks.    [Wada] For the time being, huge sums of nonperforming loans  are the foremost problem of banks, but is there any possibility  that they will lead to instability in financial systems?    [Morikawa] In addition to assuming a flexible posture on the  use of write-off systems, the MOF's efforts to promote an  environment favorable to the disposition of bad loans, including  compilation of an "Administrative Guide for the Nonperforming  Loan Issue" should have a major beneficial impact. I hear that  prospects are good for the recognition of sole-bidder companies  to dispose of collateralized real estate. Sole-bidder companies  will be of major significance in the disposition of bad loans  and will have an effect on the liquidity of collateralized real  estate and on the prevention of further drops in collateralized  values.    [Wada] What do you think of the pending question on home  financing specialty companies?    [Morikawa] The issue will have to be handled in a manner  which calls for financial institutions to deal with each of the  home specialty situations. Home financing specialists will have  to dispose of bad loans and reexamine their future operations.    [Wada] What are your views on the disclosure of bad loans?    [Morikawa] Disclosures of bad loans by banks were initiated  in March 1993 based on the report issued by the Financial System  Research Council's subcommittee in 1992. I am aware of the  important role played by disclosures in that they enhance the  transparency of bank operations and that they lead to confidence  in banks and the stability of financial systems, but we must  provide sufficient consideration of their effect on the  maintenance of orderly credit systems. We should verify the  effects and the regularity of current disclosure actions and  effect an incremental expansion in the procedure in terms of  disclosure content and applicable financial institutions. Loans  on which interest payments have been exempted or reduced reflect  the premise that the principal will be recovered and fall in a  category which differs from bad loans which are the subject of  disclosures at this time.    [Wada] Securities subsidiaries of city banks are expected to  be established within the year, but how should we deal with  reform of the financial system in the future?    [Morikawa] The joint operation of banking and securities  businesses has just reached its threshold. Fundamentally, such  joint operations are subject to review in two to three years  relative to operational restrictions. At present, rigidly  enforced barriers require a review of many aspects and their  merits relative to international compatibility and fairness and  client convenience that were the original goals of joint  operations. In April 1995, it will be just two years since the  system reform went into effect. We plan to study and advocate  changes in the firewall that restricts personnel actions and  limits services offered by securities susidiaries.    [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which loan  operations which serve as a revenue source for banks have  declined and attention is being focused on derivatives as a new  source of revenues and profits?    [Morikawa] Growth in the issuance of loans has definitely  slowed, but this does not reflect a "reluctance by banks" to  issues loans as indicated by some sources. All banks are working  to expand loans, but the recession has prevented desirable  progress. The primary source of bank revenues and profits will  continue to rest with efforts to expand deposits and loans. On  the other hand, it is a fact that financial systems are being  decontrolled and that the management and procurement of  corporate capital is becoming sophisticated, but banks' foreign  operations have been expanding as well. Banks' role is to assist  overall corporate financing. If needs in the area of derivatives  expand, banks must have the capability to respond to those needs.    [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which  derivatives are traded without accountability on bank records,  expose banks to the risk of undisclosed losses and could serve  as a cause of market turbulence?    [Morikawa] The main purpose of derivatives is to provide a  system for managing risk and one's evaluation of derivatives  depends on his interpretation. However, although they involve  huge sums and are not cash transactions, there is the one  problem of being unable to measure the size of the risk. It is  important to maintain risk control in terms of credit risks  versus the other party to transactions.    [Wada] Can you give us your outlook for the economy?    [Morikawa] In addition to public works investments and  housing construction, signs of improvement can be seen in  certain segments of individual consumption. However, because we  have undergone last spring's experience where a rising economy  was frustrated, we cannot help but become cautious about  economic assessments. Corporations are negative on capital  investments and we cannot assume an optimistic outlook on  individual consumption. It is too early to confirm that the  recession has bottomed out, as long as the tempo of the recovery  does not gain momentum. However, we may see somewhat more  obvious signs of a recovery assuming tax reductions and  comprehensive economic measures take effect.    [Wada] What do you think of the changing interest situation  including rising long-term interest rates?    [Morikawa] Long-term interest rates can be affected by  supply  and demand factors for bonds, but in the present situation it is  hard to think of the economy as having started on the path of  recovery on a midterm basis. Prices are very stable. I believe  that there is hardly any reason for rising interest rates.    [Wada] Will banks continue to be able to earn margins on  interest rates?    [Morikawa] The reason why banks were able to expand their  margins until recently is that during the period of declining  interest, they increased the ratio of short-term funds procured  on the open market. However, when interest rates are stable, an  expansion of bank margins is not feasible.    [Wada] What do you think of the strong yen in the foreign  exchange markets?    [Morikawa] I am concerned about the effect of the strong yen  on the economy and trends in interest rates. I feel so because a  strong yen-weak dollar scenario can lead to a rise in U.S.  long-term interest rates, a drop in stock prices, and a ripple  effect on the world economy as a whole. Cooperative intervention  by Japan, Europe and the United States has resulted in the  temporary stabilization of the yen, but I hope that we see a  time when it reaches a point of genuine stability reflective of  sound economic fundamentals.    [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which the yen  is  expensive in terms of corporate performance and poses  difficulties for Japanese businesses?    [Morikawa] There will be a major impact not only on export  industries, but on industry as a whole. Businesses must shift  their production base to overseas locations and replace domestic  materials with foreign-produced materials. I am concerned about  the effects of such shifts on employment and incomes.    [Wada] What to you think of the agreement between the  Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications on the postal savings issue?    [Morikawa] I express my admiration over the fact that the  two  ministries reached an agreement on an issue plagued with a wide  variance in positions. However, the recently reached agreement  has problems. The agreement leaves much to be desired from the  standpoint of the banking industry in ways such as the 1.1  percent differential in interest rates between ordinary postal  savings accounts and regular bank savings accounts. We consider  it to be an interim agreement and believe that talks will be  reopened at the end of the year to discuss the interest rate  differential for postal savings.    Ordinary savings interest rates should conform to the  average  private industry rate and postal savings rates should not be  significantly higher. Even the Provisional Council for the  Promotion of Administrative Reform has produced a report stating  that "government businesses augment private industry  businesses," and I hope that early action will be taken on a  modification of the postal savings interest rate.    [Wada] Interest rates for floating deposit and savings  accounts will be decontrolled effective in October. How will  interest rates be established?    [Morikawa] They will be established on the basis of  individual decisions, but interest rates will be established  under a competitive climate on the basis of factors such as  interest levels prevailing in financial markets and the cost of  procuring funds. Even in this situation, the existence of  special treatment for postal savings poses a problem for  private-sector banks in determining appropriate interest rates.    [Wada] The Japanese economy is entering a slow growth phase.  What do you think of a movement to restructure the financial  industry, once the disposition of bad loans is completed?    [Morikawa] Future economic growth will definitely be slower  than in the past, and the operating environment will change  because of deregulation, calling for actions responsive to the  new age. Mergers are one option. Instead of limiting measures to  the pursuit of advantages derived from operations of a larger  scale and mergers to assist ailing operations, we'll probably  see mergers that seek industry and geographical diversification.  Actions will vary depending on bank territories and assets and  manager decisions. A multitude of options such as mergers, joint  ventures, and major reengineerings are possible.</p>

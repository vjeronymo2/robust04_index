			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 23 April that the banking  industry presented to the Ministry of Finance [MOF] a list of 57  deregulations, including its main demand to create deposits  linked to stock prices and a demand for simplification of  reports submitted to the MOF.    Wide-ranging demands are included in the list, such as:  relaxation of regulations on large lendings, lifting of the ban  on new financial services such as FRA's (forward rate  agreements), and relaxation of regulations on opening new branch  offices. The banks are asking for greater autonomous  decisionmaking power in bank management since they are facing  intensified competition with the liberalization of interest  rates. There has also been an upsurge of international demands  on Japan to relax regulations. Therefore, the MOF is taking a  positive attitude towards the banks' demands. This will  probably contribute to a transformation of bank management,  which has been strictly regulated.    The list of deregulation demands was compiled mainly by the  major city banks. It includes items in 13 areas, such as bank  deposits and regulations on branch offices and affiliated  companies, plus a demand for simplifying reports to the MOF.  Since the process of liberalizing interest rates for bank  accounts will be completed by October, the banks are asking for  liberalization of regulations concerning matters other than  interest rates. This is the first time the banking sector has  asked for such wide-ranging deregulation.    The main feature of the list is the creation of deposits  linked to stock prices, which offer to depositors gains  corresponding to stock price increases, and no interest at all  if stock prices go down.    Apart from deposits linked to stock prices, the banks are  also asking the MOF to lift the ban on new types of deposits  which allow interest earnings to be invested in market  commodities, such as deposits linked to the land price index.  The banking sector aims at expanding its range of financial  services.    The banks are also asking for the abolition of regulations  on  opening branch offices--not more than two regular branches, or  not more than seven small branches in two years--which has been  the mainstay of bank regulations. With regard to CD's (cash  dispensers) set up at client institutions, the abolition of the  regulation on the location of such cash dispensers is also being  demanded. A total of 11 demands have been presented on the  opening of branch offices alone.    In the area of hi-tech financial services which may become a  major source of income for banks, the list includes demands to  lift the ban on handling FRA's, which is a form of commodity  futures, and FXA's (foreign exchange agreements). The banks are  also asking for a lifting of the ban on the loan participation  method of loan liquidation, which does not require the consent  of the debtor in transferring credit rights, and the ban on the  method of transferring credit rights to a special-purpose  corporation which in turn issues CP (commerical paper).</p>

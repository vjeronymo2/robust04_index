			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Falls in technology stocks pull Nikkei lower SHARP falls in leading high-technology issues pulled the Nikkei average down, although volume rose on continued activity in bio-technology related issues, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-share average closed down 241.00 at 20,864.42, the day's low, falling below the 21,000 level for the first time in eight trading days. The day's high was 21,112.44. Volume rose to 300m shares from 230m, hitting the 300m mark for the first time since January 31. Traders attributed the increase in activity to large lot index-linked trading by foreigners and buying by individuals. Declines led advances by 699 to 255 with 150 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.49, and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.14 to 1160.30. Individual investors supported the chemical and foods sectors, which were the only gainers of the day. In the afternoon session, some investors took profits on stocks which had gained sharply during the past few trading days. Mochida Pharmaceutical fell Y20 to Y4,160 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical by Y60 to Y1,970. However, active trading spread to other bio-technology related issues, and renewed interest in Aids-related shares lifted Meiji Milk Products up Y92 to Y1,020 and Morinaga Milk by Y22 to Y721. 'Investors who are trading on the drug theme are not the middle to long-term holders, but they are acting as catalysts for the market,' said Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities. Some investors and dealers are now hoping that popularity in drug issues will shift to 'environmental protection stocks'. Daicel Chemical Industries, the organic chemical maker, rose Y14 to Y640 on hopes that its bio-degradable plastic will contribute to a rise in profits. Mitsubishi Kakoki Kaisha, a manufacturer of water treatment equipment, was the most active issue of the day, adding Y60 to Y960. Concerns over earnings for the current year depressed NEC, which lost Y35 to Y995, falling below Y1,000 for the first time since October 1985 and Mitsubishi Electric, down Y13 to Y498, suffering the first dip below Y500 since March 1987. Brokerage houses also declined on worries over current year profits. Nomura Securities fell Y60 to Y1,340 and Daiwa Securities lost Y15 to Y860. Minolta Camera fell Y24 to a 14-month low of Y421. The company agreed to pay Honeywell Y16.6bn over a patent dispute. Investors were discouraged as the final settlement amount was larger than previously expected. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 120.41 to 22,170.75 in volume of 141m shares. Crown, an audio equipment manufacturer, fell Y200 to Y1,010. Osaka Securities Finance, the securities financing company with close ties with financial regulators, and sole lender of stock for margin trading in Osaka, said that it would not finance or lend stocks for trading in Crown shares, due to their erratic price movements. Roundup HONG Kong, which closed at its second consecutive record high, stood out in a featureless Pacific Rim. HONG KONG finished off its intra-day high: the Hang Seng Index closed 9.79 higher at 4,964.29 in turnover of HKDollars 2.54bn against HKDollars 2.37bn. Investors were encouraged in early trade by the details of Wednesday's budget, although profit-taking later pushed the index lower. Hutchison Whampoa closed down 50 cents at HKDollars 15.40 on worries of a possible rights issue, while parent group Cheung Kong finished down 20 cents at HKDollars 21.40. SINGAPORE closed weaker as sentiment remained nervous on fears of worse than expected company results due to be published later this month. The Straits Times Industrial index ended down 3.08 at 1,456.84 in volume of 34.34m shares against 44.10m. Sembawang Shipyard fell 5 cents to SDollars 7.45 in spite of announcing a 30 per cent increase in 1991 net profit. SEOUL shed most of Wednesday's gains after the government denied that it planned measures to boost the financial services sector. The composite index lost 11.24 to 619.23 in turnover of Won343.3bn. MANILA's decline continued with worries of violence ahead of May's presidential elections. The composite index fell 2.37 to 1,1157.61 in turnover of 158.3m pesos against 74.3m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR continued to consolidate and the composite index fell 4.71 to 593.93 in volume of 29.2m against 35.8m. Analysts said that investors were now concentrating on the public issue of the power utility, Tenaga Nasional. BANGKOK was led higher by strong gains in the finance sector. The SET index closed up 7.69 at 800.85, in turnover of Bt5.65bn. BOMBAY remained closed for the second consecutive day amid rumours that some brokers were facing problems in honouring payments. On Tuesday, the BSE Index extended a three-day rally rising 139.53 or 4.19 per cent, to a record high of 3,472.78. AUSTRALIA closed lower for the third consecutive day. The All Ordinaries Index ended down 6.9 at 1,608.3 in turnover of ADollars 187.8m. CRA, which reported a 26 per cent fall in net profits on Wednesday, fell 18 cents to ADollars 13.92. NEW ZEALAND closed with the NZSE-40 index 3.53 lower at 1,465.18 in turnover of NZDollars 15m. Brierley Investments, which reported a 48 per cent decline in half-year profits, shed 1 cent to 98 cents.</p>

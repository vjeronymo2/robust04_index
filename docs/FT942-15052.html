			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Serbs excel in politics of brinkmanship Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, recently boasted that the 'west had played its last card,' Laura Silber writes from Belgrade. He has revelled in recent Serb successes, proclaiming that his people are on the verge of defeating not only their Moslem foes in Gorazde, but the entire western world. Serb leaders have excelled in the politics of brinkmanship, brazenly snubbing the west - and even their traditional friends in Russia - as they pursue their political and military goals. Last week Mr Karadzic proudly told Serbs troops besieging Gorazde: 'You are the best army in Europe.' Despite speculation of splits among the political and military chiefs, Serb leaders appear united in the face of western indecision. When Gen Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, last week requested close air support to protect UN personnel under fire in Gorazde, they added him to their list of international actors who had to be banished. 'General Rose has finished his mission in Bosnia', said Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb 'parliament'. While President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has held back from displaying open derision towards the west, the Serbian media have hailed the onslaught on Gorazde. Serbian television has broadcast pictures of a ruddy-faced Gen Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, surveying the advance of his troops from the high ground around Gorazde. Banner headlines rejoiced over the Serb forces' shooting down of a British Sea Harrier jet over Gorazde, an incident taken as proof of Nato's weakness in comparison with the Serbian army. The military moves in Bosnia in defiance of the outside world have been echoed on the political front in Serbia. The leadership in Belgrade has restricted the movement of UN personnel inside the Serbian republic, and introduced entrance visas.</p>

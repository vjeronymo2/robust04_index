			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad reveals potential bid approach OWNERS ABROAD, the UK's second largest tour operator, said yesterday it had received a tentative approach several weeks ago from a potential purchaser. The company would not discuss the identity of the potential bidder, but it is thought to be Airtours, the third largest tour operator. Airtours said it could not confirm or deny it had made the approach. Owners Abroad said discussions had not progressed beyond the tentative contact. 'That approach has not been turned into a proposal, but it's not to say that it won't' The announcement came after the close of market trading yesterday. Its shares had risen 6p to close at 77p, valuing the company at Pounds 113m. Airtours shares, which had fallen 13p on Monday on rumours that it was considering a bid for Owners Abroad, recovered 6p yesterday to close at 246p, for a market capitalisation of Pounds 231m. Talk of a merger of the UK's second and third largest tour operators, comes towards the end of a summer holiday season which has so far seen the collapse of 52 members of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). Although the industry reported that bookings had been healthy in recent weeks, travel companies had, earlier in the year, suffered from over-capacity and price-cutting. Airtours has shown signs of wanting to tighten its grip on the travel market. Last month it bought Pickfords Travel, the third largest chain of travel agents from NFC, the transport company, for Pounds 16m. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said owning Pickfords would enable his company to improve the distribution of its holidays, particularly in the south of England. He said that if each of Pickfords' 333 branches booked one additional Airtours holiday a week, it would add Pounds 2m to the enlarged group's pre-tax profits. Thomson, the biggest tour operator, has owned Lunn Poly, the biggest chain of travel agents, for 20 years.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Personal Financial Planning (11): A friend for life, and those days when you need a little extra - The tax-break offers a means to repay a mortgage or meet school fees, yet it is little used in such areas. Eric Short considers the possibilities Peps should form the core holding in the portfolios of investors who are interested in the UK equity market. Yet, while much is written about their tax-efficiency and flexibility, and though the Pep market is constantly monitored for performance and charges, less attention is given to the role that Peps should play in an individual's financial planning strategy. When someone has decided to invest in equities, whether directly into shares or indirectly through collective funds, the bedrock of that investment should be Peps. However, there are certain specific investment requirements where a Pep should also be considered. Many people who are in an employer's pension scheme want to boost their retirement income beyond that provided by the scheme. In these days of labour mobility, few will qualify for anything approaching the maximum pension. The traditional means of boosting a company pension is through additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). But, although AVCs are highly tax-efficient in accumulating cash, with tax relief on the contributions and investment in gross funds, the benefits must be taken at the time of retirement as taxable income. If the AVCs have been invested in equities and there is a bear market at the time of retirement, the individual could suffer through being forced to cash in the contract and buy a pension annuity. In contrast, although contributions to a Pep are paid out of taxed income, investment is tax-free (as with AVCs), and the benefits are both flexible and tax-efficient. The benefits can be taken at any time. The investor may take the dividend or distribution tax-free to boost income, leaving the underlying capital intact. Alternatively, he can use some or all of the accumulated capital to buy an ordinary annuity - only part of that annuity's payments being taxable, in contrast to a pension annuity where all the payment is taxable. If the equity market is low, the investor can wait until it recovers before cashing in. It is not easy to make direct comparisons of the benefits provided by AVCs and Peps. Ultimately it is a matter of personal preference. But the nearer the investor is to retirement when he decides to invest in order to boost his future income, the more advantageous is a Pep. He is free to make his own arrangements for saving through a Pep, in contrast to AVCs where the pension administrator would handle the arrangements for investment in the in-house AVC - though not in the case of a free-standing AVC from a life company. But, of course, the investor can save through both AVCs and Peps, if he can afford it. Most people in company pension schemes take the tax-free cash sum that is available to them at retirement, in return for a lower pension - an exercise known as 'commutation'. But most of these have only a hazy idea of what to do with the cash when they receive it. After paying for a Caribbean cruise, some of the remaining cash could be invested in a Pep, which can be used to boost income, or to build up a cash sum for use in later years or to be passed on to the next generation. Another important specific requirement of many individuals is repayment of a mortgage. When Peps were first launched, Pep mortgages were the vogue. Financial advisers and journalists were strong advocates of their use as a way to build up the sum necessary to repay a loan. The tax-free accumulation of funds and the tax-free cash-in at the end looked highly attractive, until the 1990 bear market reminded investors that equity prices could go down as well as up. Now, little is heard of Pep mortgages, which is a pity, because, properly used, they are more tax-efficient than endowment or repayment mortgages. Equities have, over the long-term, outperformed fixed-interest investments; and mortgages are long-term commitments. True, if the investor holds the Pep until the mortgage is due for repayment, he runs the risk of having to cash in during a bear market; but if he adopts the strategy of gradually switching out of the Pep and into deposits ahead of the repayment date, he will avoid that risk, though at the expense of tax efficiency. A third specific investment requirement, for couples who want their children educated in the private sector, is to save in advance saving towards payment of school fees, which rise at least as fast as, if not faster than, inflation. Savings towards these fees might be invested in assets, such as equities, where the returns match inflation over the long term. Peps should form part of such savings, though care is needed. The time until fees will be due is comparatively short - 10 years if the individual is planning well in advance, but often much less. However, since the fees are payable over a five-year period, there is room for flexibility in cashing in the Peps. Nevertheless, there should also be other savings, to cover parents against the consequences of being forced to cash in Peps in a bear market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Serbian commission in Kosova today threatened the  authorities of the Prishtina Albanological Institute to evacuate  the building or else they would violently intervene. Concerning  this event, here is a telephone report by Shaqir Funiqi:    [Funiqi] The legitimate leaders of the Albanian science and  research institute said that only physical violence -- the only  means of this regime in Kosova -- could make them leave their  building. After an hour and a half talk, the uninvited  emissaries went away, but they left behind the definitive threat  that they plan to execute this decision tomorrow.    Meanwhile, it is reported that, as a sign of protest against  this invidious and uncivilized act, Professor Dr. Zekeria Cana  is remaining in the institution.    The less culture you have, the less culture you need -- by  promoting this idea, the Serb violence in Kosova is arbitrarily  extinguishing the last oasis of Albanian thinking and scientific  activity -- the Albanological Institute. The wicked Serbian  campaign against Albanian culture, which is now being nailed  like the Prometheus and is being placed in a grip, is taking on  destructive dimensions with a clear postulation -- to also  conduct the Serbianization of Kosova in the field of culture.    The Albanological Institute, as a model institution of  science and knowledge, will certainly survive the violence and  will manage to promote the Albanian competent scientific  thinking.</p>

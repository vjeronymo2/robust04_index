			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) What additional research is needed to help the FHWA define its vision standard;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Upon conclusion of the Vision Waiver Program, what should be the driving status of waived drivers, assuming continued safe driving performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA is eager to gain a broader perspective of the public's viewpoint concerning other studies, data and experiences which will enhance the agency's knowledge on the subject. The FHWA is also interested in sharing its data with other researchers and modes which may undertake useful analysis and initiate studies leading to more enlightened approaches to establishing future physical qualification standards, standards that are both necessary and valid to increasing opportunities in the truck-driving profession while ensuring that society's high expectations of CMV safety are realized. Notice of the hearing will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and will contain further questions to which the agency seeks responses, as well as directions on how to obtain information about the data collected during the vision waiver study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA will publish, within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, its determination regarding the continuation of the vision waiver program through the proposed March 31, 1996 deadline. This determination will be based upon comments received in response to this notice, as well as all empirical evidence gathered to date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the FHWA determines, based upon comments and related information, not to extend the program to such date, the agency will publish its rationale for such determination and the date upon which waived drivers may no longer operate in interstate commerce. Additionally, waived drivers will be notified directly of the agency's decision to terminate the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the FHWA determines, based upon comments and related information, that the waiver program may continue until March 31, 1996, the agency will also publish that determination as well in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix_The Vision Waiver Standards and Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The vision waiver application procedure, standards and conditions are being reproduced here for informational purposes only. The agency  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> is not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  accepting applications for vision waivers at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants for a waiver from the vision qualification requirement were required to submit their applications on plain paper (there is no application form), include all supporting documents, and use the format set forth below. Each information item must have been completed by an appropriate answer or marked ``None'', or ``NA'' if not applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

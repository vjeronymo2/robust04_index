			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIP GLASS IN THE EYE OF THE STORM  </P> <P> Philip Glass is a one-time student heretic who repudiated hardline  compositional techniques in favor of the easy-access theater music he now  writes.  </P> <P> He is among the most sought-after composers of the day.  </P> <P> At 52, he can be credited for selling out opera houses where his "Einstein on  the Beach," "Satyagraha" and "Akhnaten" have been staged.  </P> <P> A pied piper of sorts, he appeals to -- and indeed helped define -- a crossover  generation looking for something more refined than Guns N' Roses but not quite  so formalist as Beethoven.  </P> <P> Asked to comment on the criticism he has received from his colleagues, Glass  says:  </P> <P> "I think it's sad, all this name-calling, and I don't want to be drawn into it.  But the genuine response from my audience offsets any criticism from the  academic quarter. I'm out there in the real world of performance, a vital  world. And maybe that's why, in spite of the nasty comments, my high opinion of  their music doesn't change. The bottom line is: I can afford to feel this way."  DONNA PERLMUTTER  </P></p>

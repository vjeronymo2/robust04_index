			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Fall in unsold empty homes THE NUMBER of unsold empty homes, inhibiting a revival of thehousing market, has fallen by a third since the beginning of last year, stockbrokers UBS said. A report published yesterday by Mr John Wriglesworth, the broker's housing market analyst, estimated that the number of empty properties had fallen from 225,000 to 150,000. He forecast that house sales would rise 20 per cent this year, reducing the number of empty properties to 120,000 by the end of the year - a normal stock level in a reasonable market. Mr Wriglesworth said the rise in sales would not, however, be accompanied by a significant rise in prices this year, due to the overhang of unsold properties on the market and continuing concern over rising unemployment and the state of the eco-nomy. He forecast that prices would rise 7 per cent next year as buyers became encouraged by more stable house prices, low mortgage rates and slower increases in unemployment. UBS estimated that there were 1.9m UK householders owning homes with values of less than the money borrowed to buy them. More than 1.5m of those suffering from negative equity lived in southern England, the broker said. Mr Wriglesworth said: 'The supply of properties for sale in the south, especially those suitable for first-time buyers, is likely to be more limited, resulting in more pressure for house prices to rise as demand grows. 'In Greater London we expect house prices to rise by 10 per cent next year, over double the national inflation rate for retail prices.'</p>

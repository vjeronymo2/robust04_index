			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Lenskiy report: "From Economic Union to Eurasian </F> Union. 15th CIS Heads of State Meeting Held at President Hotel  Yesterday"]    [Text] The main participant in the summit  was...Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who did not  attend it. His idea of setting up a Eurasian union -- which has  left a big fat question mark over the entire concept of the CIS  -- was at the center of attention of the heads of state.  But...behind the scenes and at the press conference. Dodging a  direct answer to my question, B. Yeltsin said: "Given that  Nursultan Abishevich was unwell, we were unable to obtain full  information from him and, therefore, we did not officially  discuss it."    E. Shevardnadze believes that the idea is interesting and  thought should be given to how to implement it. V. Chernomyrdin  said that it would be good to know what the Nazarbayev proposals  consist of. The idea of reintegration was enthusiastically  received by the leaders of Belorussia [Belarus] and Kirghizia  [Kyrgyzstan]. Conversely, there was a clearly negative attitude  from the Turkmen and Uzbek presidents. S. Niyazov, for  instance, agrees only to consultative Commonwealth status and  rules out any supranational superstructure. I. Karimov called  Nazarbayev's scheme incorrect and populist. Reflecting the  official view, KHALQ SOZI, Uzbekistan's main newspaper, noted on  the eve of the summit that, "politicians whose repertoire  consists of songs about the indestructible Union are reminiscent  of doctors who for some reason hold their meeting in a morgue."    Admittedly, there is no need to bury the Union -- which  lives  in our hearts and minds. One cannot fail to notice in  Nazarbayev's idea a basic thought which reflects the sad  experience of recent years -- any attempts to organize economic  ties within the CIS will be ineffective if the countries are not  voluntarily strengthened by political bonds. Without having  received a clear response to his idea, the Kazakhstani president  did not come to Moscow (which was to be expected from his  statements in Japan), clearly believing that further discussions  on an unprincipled basis would be pointless.    The course of the Moscow meeting confirmed Nazarbayev's  skepticism. There were no sensations. The only more or less  mature scheme to have emerged in two years of intra-CIS waffle  -- the economic union -- was confirmed. But let's take a look  at events through the eyes of the man in the street. Has life  become any easier? Is there more food in the stores? Have  prices fallen? Unfortunately, the confusion over the new  formation (which does not exist in "reality") is profoundly  abstract in nature. Now that the process has become at least  slightly systematic the Interstate Economic Committee (IEC) has  been set up. A Commonwealth flag has appeared -- a sun set  among many hands on a blue background.    The first step to unification may possibly be the creation  of  a free trade zone. Unless the agreement remains purely on  paper, customs duties, taxes, and levies will gradually  disappear. The Commonwealth countries will be seen as a single  international economic unit [subyekt]. But there is little  future for the approved concept for a payments union based on  diverse national currencies. You will be told that by any  Ukrainian peasant who sells his food cheaply at Moscow's Kiev  Station, but for rubles! From now on Ukraine is an associate  member of the economic union.    Among the documents signed we would highlight the concept of  safeguarding the rights of ethnic, linguistic, and religious  minorities. The initiative was taken by Kirghiz [Kyrgyz]  President Askar Akayev, who has sincerely and deeply felt the  collapse of the great power and has been making a great deal of  effort to protect ethnic Russians. Russia will not be found  wanting if it is a question of a united security system, the  settling of local conflicts within the CIS, or the rebuffing of  foreign enemies. Colonel-General Valeriy Patrikeyev has been  appointed the new commander of the collective peacekeeping  forces in Tajikistan. Colonel-General Boris Pyankov, who has  honorably done his duty, is returning to Moscow as deputy  commander of the CIS Joint Armed Forces.    Thus, the direction of progress has been chosen -- the  recreation of the Union, first as an economic union and later as  a Eurasian union. It will not be easy -- building is not as  easy as destroying. Many people are convinced that the goal  will be attained only by the next generation of politicians, who  have not been besmirched by the shame of the Belovezhskaya  Forest Agreement.</p>

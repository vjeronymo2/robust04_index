He replaces fellow party member  Louis Vanvelthoven, who resigned because of links to a case of  fraudulent examinations in the assembly.    In his first speech as president, Baldewijns pleaded that a  code of ethics be established for all elected representatives.  His opponent was Vlaams Blok Representative Marijke Dillen.  Baldewijns received 121 of the 142 votes. Although the Vlaams  Blok group has only 17 members, 19 members of parliament voted  for Dillen.</p>

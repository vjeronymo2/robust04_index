			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD URGED TO DELAY ANY MORE CUTS IN SCHOOL BUDGET  </P> <P> Los Angeles Unified School District finance chief Robert Booker has recommended  that the district delay any further cuts in its proposed $3.96-billion budget,  despite state funding reductions that could cost the district $77 million in  the coming year.  </P> <P> In presenting the budget to the school board on Monday, Booker expressed  confidence that the state Legislature will restore the 4.76% cost-of-living  increase that Gov. George Deukmejian slashed to 3% when he signed the state  budget earlier this month.  </P> <P> That reduction cost the school district more than $40 million that it had  anticipated spending this year.  </P> <P> Other Deukmejian budget vetoes -- including reductions or changes in the  funding of year-round schools, driver education training and school  construction programs -- will cost the district an additional $37 million in  the coming year if they are not modified, Booker said.  </P> <P> Those state budget cuts come in the wake of a recently completed series of  lengthy and painful program and personnel cuts that the Los Angeles board made  to trim $220 million from its 1990-91 budget. Consequently, Booker has  recommended that the board await the outcome of legislative action to overturn  Deukmejian's cuts before slicing further into instructional programs.  </P> <P> "It is important that the board and public understand, however, that . . .  deeper reductions and more personnel cuts will be necessary" in the coming  months if the cost-of-living allocation is not increased, Booker said.  </P></p>

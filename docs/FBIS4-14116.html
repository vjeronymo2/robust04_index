			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The proceedings of the 28th ordinary session of  the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] follow-up committee ended at  El-Djazair Hotel in Algiers this evening. This is the first  session to be held since Algeria took over the chairmanship of  the union for the current year. The participants discussed a  number of issues relating to the progress achieved in the  building of the Maghreb edifice.    The heads of the delegations representing the five Maghreban  states also discussed the union's relations with the other  regional blocs and with regional and international financial  institutions.    In his closing speech, Ahmed Attaf, the chairman of the  session and secretary of state in charge of cooperation and  Maghreban affairs in Algeria -- given that Algeria has been  chairing the AMU since March -- expressed his satisfaction with  the results achieved by the session which, he said, would  undoubtedly contribute to strengthening the Maghreban process  and increase its dynamism and activity. He added that the  committee would follow-up the realization of the programs drawn  up by the session, particularly the sectors that require serious  attention.    AMU Secretary-General Mohamed Amamou, for his part, read out  a thank-you message addressed to President Liamine Zeroual in  which he wished him total success in carrying out his mission as  current president of the Arab Maghreb Union.

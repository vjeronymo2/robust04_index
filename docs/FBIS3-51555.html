			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Five O'clock Sharp" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] The National Transportation Commission's threats  of a possible strike next Monday have generated fear among  Managua residents. Today we learned through a Transportation  and Communications Ministry communique that Presidency Minister  Antonio Lacayo has downplayed the National Transportation  Commission's threats. Lacayo clearly said that meetings would  be held on Monday afternoon. The community is afraid because  everyone knows the type of actions that are carried out in  conjunction with the Parales Vallejos cooperative. The people  are distressed and afraid that there will be bloodshed as a  result of the National Transportation Commission's threats.    We have here Francisco Silva, president of the Nicaraguan  Chamber of Transportation; Ivan Martinez, executive secretary;  and Ramon Huertas Herrera, secretary of local and international  relations. Huertas Herrera will tell us of the Nicaraguan  Chamber of Transportation's position in light of these threats.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Good afternoon,  Ramon Huertas Herrera.    [Huertas Herrera] We want to clear up some names that could  cause confusion. For example, what is the National  Transportation Commission? Some people could become confused  and think that the National Transportation Commission is an  organization that groups the whole sector, the entire Nicaraguan  transportation sector. That is not true. There is also the  National Transportation Chamber, which groups another  transportation sector; Fetracolnic [Nicaraguan Federation of  Collective Transportation], which is a federation of collective  transportation; and Fetracanic [Nicaraguan Federation of Cargo  Transportation], which groups everyone in local and  international freight transportation. There is also the  Nicaraguan Chamber of Transportation, which is the one we  represent. All of these organizations make up the transitory  National Council of Transportation.    The National Transportation Commission is promoting the  strike called for Monday. The entire transportation sector is  not calling for a strike on Monday. Some transportation  organizations are calling for a strike, such as the National  Transportation Commission. The Parales Vallejos Cooperative,  the 110 Route, and some taxi cooperatives are part of that  commission. Those cooperatives are promoting the strike on  Monday. If you recall, the recent past strike that was  initiated with a protest requesting the elimination of the IGV  [general sales tax] and the halt in the rise of fuel prices for  the remainder of 1993 degenerated into what was called a  rebellion. The rebellion resulted in two fatalities, a fact  still very much alive in the minds of Nicaraguans, particularly  capital residents.    As the Nicaraguan Chamber of Transportation, which groups  many organizations, cooperatives, private passenger  transportation companies, freight companies, and taxis, we do  not support the strike because we know what it will become. The  capital residents probably still vividly recall the disorder and  how all of that got started. It began with small barricades,  followed by burning tires, then the barricades became trenches  from where shots and mortars were fired. Private and public  property was destroyed, the windows of vehicles on the streets  were broken. There was a series of disturbances that projected  a very negative image of Nicaraguans.    Therefore, we think that the government's timing to increase  fuel prices was the worst possible. They [not further  identified] were not working, they were on vacation. That was  at the end of last year. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

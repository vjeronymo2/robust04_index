			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Observer: Ecus nuked Visionary Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is not limiting himself merely to the economic regeneration of eastern Europe. Besides solving the former Soviet Union's debt problems, his latest inspiration would simultaneously reduce the nuclear threat to the world. According to the first edition of EBRD Watch, a weekly newsletter devoted to monitoring Attali and his bank, he is mooting a debt-for-nuclear- warheads-swap. 'I believe my proposal represents a practical way of providing the republics' relief from their debt and providing the West with relief from the potential threat of existing warheads,' he says. Perhaps so. But wouldn't the impact of such debt forgiveness, involving Dollars 60bn-Dollars 70bn, rather overshadow the effect of the EBRD's own plans to commit 'Ecu 1bn or more' through loans and equity investments to eastern Europe this year?</p>

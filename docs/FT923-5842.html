			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Politics turns sour for the Greens: The latest division in the party's leadership THE DECISION by Ms Sara Parkin not to stand for re-election as chair of the Green party has exposed the party's position in no man's land between pressure group and full-blown political movement. Ms Parkin wrote to her fellow executive members: 'I have been forced to the conclusion that the Green party has become a liability to 'green' politics.' There are few in the party who would disagree. At the April general election the average Green share of the vote in the 254 seats where the party had candidates was 1.3 per cent - slightly lower than in 1987 and a far cry from the 15 per cent of the popular vote it won in the 1989 European elections. Explaining why she no longer felt able to continue in office, Ms Parkin yesterday cited the fact that a local party had invited Mr David Icke, formerly a leading party figure, to the party's conference in Wolverhampton in two weeks. This was in spite of an overwhelming vote by the party executive against his speaking at the conference. The executive felt, not unreasonably, that the appearance of Mr Icke, who shot to fame with his announcement that he was the 'son of God' on a mission to save the world, would not help the environmental message. But it was unable to block the invitation. The distinction between the Green party and 'green' politics, which Ms Parkin highlighted, comes partly from the organisation's success. Its showing in the Euro-elections shocked the mainstream political parties into raising the profile of their own, less radical, environmental policies. That sharpening of the mainstream political act, combined with the recession, took the Greens back to the political periphery. The Greens are still determined that they are a party rather than a single-issue organisation - the Wolverhampton conference will include debates on Europe and the recession. This approach may now, however, be part of the problem. Membership of the Green party is still incompatible with membership of any other UK political party, and thus the organisation is unable to exploit the numbers of Britons who are concerned about the environment. There are fewer than 10,000 members in England and Northern Ireland - there are separate Scottish and Welsh parties - yet Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, says 240,000 supporters regularly contribute to its work. Ms Parkin's impending departure may not be the end of the Greens' upheavals, there have been reports that more than half of the party's 12-strong executive may stand down when she resigns. An official said yesterday that Ms Parkin's decision was similar to the move made several years ago by Mr Jonathon Porritt, a leading environmental campaigner, to detach himself from Green party politics while continuing to be an effective 'green' politician. Perhaps this is an area where party and politics do not mix.</p>

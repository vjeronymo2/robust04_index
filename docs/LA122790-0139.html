			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OUR 'PARKING STRUCTURE' IS FULL  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, I had an experience trying to park in Santa Monica and it  helped clarify my thinking on the Jordan Ranch proposal. I needed to park at a  surgical center, but the parking structure was full. I asked the attendant if I  could park along the side of the driveway or on the landing between the levels  where I could see space was available. He very politely explained that the  structure was built to accommodate only a certain number of cars, that it  contained that many cars and that I would have to secure parking elsewhere.  </P> <P> When it comes to our air quality, water resources and traffic flow, our  "parking structure" is full. We are already experiencing several days a year of  brown air and high ozone levels. Water rationing may become a likely part of  our future. Anyone who drives a car can attest that our traffic levels already  cause agonizing and frustrating delays. According to the environmental impact  report of the Jordan Ranch, this development will make matters much, much  worse.  </P> <P> The report for Jordan Ranch states that if the development takes place, we will  need to widen several local roads. Kanan Road would be widened to eight lanes,  Las Virgenes Road to 10 lanes and the Ventura Freeway will need two more lanes  in each direction. I have not met anyone who welcomes this level of  development. Yet, according to the EIR, a vote for Jordan Ranch is a vote for  this level of development. You can't have one without the other.  </P> <P> I personally would love for there to be as many beautiful houses built in our  precious area as there is room. I would love to have a PGA-level golf course  just around the corner. I would love the prestige of the national broadcast of  a golf tournament announcing it is "live from Agoura." Unfortunately, as I  learned in Santa Monica, you can't have everything. I found an acceptable  alternative and so will the interested parties in the Jordan Ranch land. I urge  that the Jordan Ranch be developed only according to its present zoning. I am  not ready for an eight-lane Kanan Highway.  </P> <P> DR. MICHAEL ZAPF  </P> <P> Agoura  </P></p>

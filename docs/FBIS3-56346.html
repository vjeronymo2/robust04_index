Our observer Yuliy Semenov is now live  on the air from the president's country residence at  Novo-Ogarevo, where Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin are at  present.    [Semenov] [passage omitted] What is happening here now is an  unofficial dinner, well, it is official for a small number of  participants, the presidents of Russia and the United States and  the officials accompanying them.    The Russian president arrived here a bit earlier and we had  an opportunity to ask him a few questions about today's results.  He is satisfied with the course of the talks. He said they  discussed a very broad circle of questions, fundamental and  global questions. He expressed his attitude to the concept of  the Partnership for Peace and supported it. But in the main,  the work of the two delegations was devoted to economic  questions, questions of economic relations between Russia and  the United States. In response to a question from correspondent  about what sort of help Russia hopes to receive from the United  States, the Russian president answered briefly: no more than was  promised.    Tomorrow, he said, they will discuss mainly problems of  Ukraine's nuclear disarmament and international questions.    Then President Clinton arrived. The Russian president, as  the host, welcomed him, told him a little about local beauty  spots and the features of the locality, and invited him to the  table, noting that today Russia is marking the old-style New  Year.    On this pleasant detail I end my report.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> CONCERNS ON MISSILE SAFETY DISCUSSED  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met with nuclear weapons experts to discuss their  concerns about the safety of a nuclear-tipped, short-range missile deployed on  strategic bombers, but Cheney made no decision about withdrawing the weapons  from service, a spokesman said. Directors of three U.S. nuclear weapons  laboratories made presentations about risks associated with the continued  deployment of Short-Range Attack Missile-As, or SRAMs, on "alert" B-52, B-1,  and FB-111 bombers -- those ready for takeoff on short notice.  </P></p>

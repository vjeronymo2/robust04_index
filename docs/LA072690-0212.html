			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL / LEISURE: CINNAMON WORKS COOKS UP EXPANSION TO SWEETEN  PROFITS  </P> <P> It's a sticky business, but someone's got to do it.  </P> <P> In this case, it's the Cinnamon Works, a local cinnamon roll and cookie concern  that is about to expand.  </P> <P> Co-owner Colleen Perry said the 3-year-old company is negotiating leases for  new stores in Anaheim Hills and Irvine. She said the firm recently closed a  marginal store in Orange in order to concentrate its efforts on the new areas.  </P> <P> "We want to get these stores up and running and see what they will do," Perry  said.  </P> <P> The company has situated its stores in strip centers instead of shopping malls,  where other cinnamon roll purveyors, such as the Cinnabon Bakery stores in the  Mall of Orange and Westminster Mall, have already staked their turf. Cinnamon  Works has an established store in Yorba Linda and supplies its sugary  confections to Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, she said. Perry added that  she recently cut back on her advertising, but sales have increased, apparently  on the strength of word of mouth.  </P> <P> "The business has continually grown since we started up," she said.  </P></p>

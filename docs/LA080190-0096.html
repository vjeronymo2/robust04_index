			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFETY PANEL SPREADS BLAME IN EXXON SPILL  </P> <P> In its first official finding of fault in last year's Exxon Valdez oil spill in  Prince William Sound, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday  that all parties involved share the blame.  </P> <P> The tanker's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, and his crew should have been less  fatigued and more alert, Exxon Corp. should have monitored more closely the  alcohol treatment program in which Hazelwood was enrolled. And the Coast  Guard's Vessel Traffic Service was inadequate, the board said.  </P> <P> Had any one of these parties been more vigilant, "we could have avoided this  accident," said NTSB member John K. Lauber.  </P> <P> The findings were unveiled in Washington as NTSB staff members and senior  officials met to assess their research about the disaster, caused when the  tanker ruptured on March 24, 1989, after colliding with a reef in the sound.  The 11-million-gallon oil spill, which has cost $2 billion so far to clean up,  is the nation's largest and costliest.  </P> <P> The board recommended that all companies operating oil tankers in Prince  William Sound start alcohol treatment programs for employees, discourage crew  members from working excessively long hours and train and monitor employees who  are alcoholics and drug addicts to prevent relapses.  </P> <P> In a separate finding, the board said that Hazelwood's decision to leave his  third mate in charge of the tanker the night of the spill "was contrary to  federal regulations and Exxon policy and was improper, given the course of the  vessel." The board concluded that the mate was impaired by fatigue, which  contributed to the collision with the reef.  </P> <P> The committee also concluded that the judgment of the ship's skipper "was  impaired by alcohol" during the critical period when the vessel was stuck on  the reef and starting to lose oil.  </P> <P> "We had eyewitnesses" who saw the captain and smelled his breath the night of  the disaster, said NTSB Chairman James L. Kolstad.  </P> <P> The agency conducted its own tests and voice analyses to make sure that it did  not accuse Hazelwood without hard evidence, Kolstad said.  </P> <P> Thomas M. Russo, Hazelwood's attorney, said that the board's efforts to prove  his client was intoxicated were "feeble."  </P> <P> "Their conclusions are not founded in the evidence," Russo said.  </P> <P> Hazelwood was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of  oil. He was fined $50,000 and ordered to spend 1,000 hours cleaning Alaskan  beaches. He has appealed.  </P> <P> Last week, the Coast Guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and misconduct  against Hazelwood but suspended his license as a ship's master for nine months  after he pleaded no contest to breaking Coast Guard rules.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Kolstad said the board hopes its report, which included 36  safety recommendations, will help prevent future spills. Its analysis carries  no force of law and, by statute, cannot be used in court cases.  </P></p>

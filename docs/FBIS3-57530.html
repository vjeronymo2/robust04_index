Yermakov's News Conference"] </F>   [Text] Ivan Yermakov, dismissed from his post of Ukrainian  presidential representative in Sevastopol, stated at the news  conference that he was not going to leave the political arena  and that, in his opinion, "Leonid Kravchuk did not do the right  thing" when he signed the edict on his dismissal. "This should  not have been done with such a difficult situation prevailing in  the Crimea," said Yermakov. He pointed out that he will not run  for the Ukrainian Supreme Council, but will be a candidate for  deputy of the Crimean Supreme Council. He also promised that he  would return to his post, no matter what it is called (his dream  is to become mayor of Sevastopol). Yermakov stated that he was  going to create a Slavic Christian Party that will also be open  to Muslims, Judaists, and all other people irrespective of their  nationality. He focused on the fact that, over the period of  his work as Ukrainian presidential representative in Sevastopol,  he had to go through quite a number of unpleasant moments and  even hours. In particular, it was when he had to hoist the  Ukrainian state flag at the building of the city state  administration, since "the colors of that flag do not appeal to  me."</p>

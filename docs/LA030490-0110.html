			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUTTERFLY BANTER  </P> <P> Ree Strange Sheck's article on the Costa Rica rain forest ("Alone With Nature  in a Tropic Rain Forest," Feb. 11) has me bemused and confused. In discussing  plant mimicry, the writer described a passion flower that had leaves with  Velcro-like hairs "to catch marauding butterfly larvae." Pray, how does a larva  maraud? I thought they tended to be on the sedentary side.  </P> <P> SARA MERIC  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

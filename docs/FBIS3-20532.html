			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Fan (2799 1581): "On Reform of China's </F> Foreign Trade Pricing System." The author is from the Foreign  Economic and Trade University's International Trade Research  Institute]    [Text] Foreign trade pricing encompasses the domestic  procurement prices of export commodities, their foreign sale  prices, domestic sale prices of imported commodities, and their  foreign purchase prices. What affects the overall price level is  the exchange rate; what affects the pricing structure is  import-export tariffs, export tax rebates, and government  financial subsidies. Reform of the foreign trade pricing system  refers mainly to the reform of the domestic procurement prices  of export commodities and the domestic sale prices of imported  commodities.  <H5>  I. Foreign Trade Pricing Under the Planned System </H5>   Under a planned economic system, we have domestic and  foreign  price differential and currency differential. Domestic and  foreign price differential refers to the situation where the  prices of domestic agricultural products, energy,  communications, real estate, and services are lower, while the  prices of processed goods are higher, than those in the  international markets. If we apply the law of market value to  regulate import and export, the cheaper resources at home will  flow away from the domestic market, and large volumes of cheap  international processed goods will be imported. This not only  will result in negative balance of international payments but  will also undermine the domestic industries. Therefore, the  state must monopolize foreign trade and use mandatory planning  to control import and export, especially to guarantee the  completion of export plans to earn foreign exchange.    Given the state's backward economic conditions, the most  serious problem we face is the chronic shortage of foreign  exchange. Therefore, exporting becomes a compelling task. Export  planning makes up the most important part of economic planning.  To guarantee export, the whole economy must serve foreign trade.  So long as a product sells, we will find domestic sales yielding  to foreign sales. Planned measures are used to centralize all  domestic resources to guarantee export. Complementing this is a  fixed exchange rate system. The fixed exchange rate system in  fact forces us to pay the price of unstable domestic economy to  guarantee foreign trade stability. If we want to avoid  fluctuations in the domestic economy, in addition to the fixed  exchange rate, we must impose strict foreign exchange control  and over-evaluate the RMB exchange rate. This results in the  domestic and foreign exchange differential.    The foreign trade mechanism that truly plays a role in a  planned economic system is mandatory planning. The huge losses  generated by the domestic and foreign price differential is  remedied by government subsidies. The pricing mechanism has no  essential function. It is just a means of calculation. Foreign  trade companies cannot take responsibility of their own profits  or losses. They are responsible only for the plans.    This kind of planned foreign trade system naturally relies  on  planned and financial measures and completely alienates the  domestic and foreign pricing relations. The domestic procurement  prices of export commodities and domestic sale prices of  imported goods must comply with the principle of "using domestic  planned prices as the norm. Goods of the same quality are priced  the same; goods of better quality are priced higher." All losses  are subsidized by the Financial Ministry. Price fluctuations in  the international markets cannot affect the domestic economy,  and there can be no direct link between enterprises, so that  foreign trade is "cut off." At the developmental stage when  foreign trade volume is small and the economy is backward, such  mechanism can facilitate the centralization of domestic  resources for export to earn foreign exchange, facilitate the  concentrated use of our limited foreign exchange, and help  stabilize the domestic economy. Its drawback is the huge  government subsidies and slowly diminishing economic efficiency.  When the foreign trade volume expands and the domestic economy  undergoes reform, this system can no longer be sustained.  <H3>  II. The Agent System -- A Method of Linking the Domestic  Sale Prices of Imported Goods to Their International Levels </H3>   A basic way to link imported prices and international prices  is to implement the import agent system. This means using the  import CIF price as base and converting that to RMB according to  the exchange rate. This gives us the CIF price in RMB, and the  domestic sale price of the import is derived by adding to it the  import tariff and the value-added tax--to be imposed by customs  on behalf of the state--and other state taxes and fees. Import  agent price in fact sets the domestic price based on the  international price level. The import agent system is a way to  link domestic and foreign prices via importing.    In 1985, China began a large scale conversion to the import  agent system. Today only grains and chemical fertilizers are not  using that system. [blank space] By 1992, 90 percent of the  imported commodities have implemented the agent system. The most  direct consequence is reduced government subsidies, and it also  reduces some unnecessary imports. Its negative effect is that it  has raised the domestic price level. In recent years, higher  international prices of imported commodities, depreciation of  the RMB, elimination of import subsidies, and the imposition of  several taxes and fees by the state have led to a substantial  increase in the prices of imported commodities, and that in turn  has triggered a rise in the prices of related domestic products.  This is how international inflation finds its way into the  domestic economy. When implementing the import agent system, we  must fully utilize the tariffs lever to greatly reduce or exempt  taxes on imported means of production to minimize the impact on  domestic product prices.    The elimination of import subsidies raises the domestic sale  prices of imported commodities, which functions to reduce  imports. But China's import-mix is relatively backward. Eighty  percent of the imported goods are capital goods for which there  are few domestic substitutes, and their demand is fairly  inelastic, and despite the higher prices, we must still import  them, and the result is a general rise in the price level at  home.    The implementation of the import agent system basically  links  domestic and foreign prices by way of the imports. The pricing  mechanism thus becomes the basic mechanism for regulating  imports. In other words, reform of import prices is basically  complete. Today we still have a problem with high tariffs and  import quotas with respect to a handful of products, and they  are keeping us from giving full play to the pricing mechanism.  In the wake of the imminent resolution of our "return to GATT,"  and because of the many tariff reductions and exemptions in  recent years, we are collecting less than half of the tariffs we  are entitled to, and adding the rampant smuggling and the loss  of control over imports, the pricing mechanism is playing a  bigger regulatory role in reality than in theory. Henceforth, we  should primarily perfect pricing's role in regulating imports:  We should develop the production of import substitutes to  increase the price elasticity of imported commodities, lower  nominal tariffs and reduce various non-tariff barriers, develop  commodity futures and linking them to spot trade, strengthen  tariff's role in regulating imports, crack down on smuggling,  eliminate the mixed-bag of tax reductions and exemptions, and  standardize the import market to enable the pricing mechanism to  regulate imports even more fully and systematically. We want to  be able to export whenever domestic prices are lower, and import  when they are higher, than international prices.  <H3>  III. Accelerate the Pace of Conversion to the Agent System  in the Importing of Grains and Chemical Fertilizers </H3>   Currently, only the importing of grains and chemical  fertilizers are still being subsidized by the state to the tune  of around 12 billion yuan a year. The prices of chemical  fertilizers make up part of the cost of producing grain, and  therefore it is primarily the importing of grains and their  prices that affect the state's agricultural subsidies.    China's grain production has been increasing for the last  three years in a row. Importing has become less critical.  Primarily, it is the Beijing-Tianjin-Shanghai area and Liaoning  that are the major importers. They import around 15 million tons  of wheat each year. But in the long-run, China's grain supply  will still fall short of demand, and before the year 2000, our  normal demand will increase at a rate of 2.56 percent a year,  while extraordinary demand may increase at 4.3 percent a  year--topping 1.04 trillion and 1.30 trillion jin, respectively,  and meanwhile grain production will increase 2.1 percent at the  most, which will be fairly close to the normal demand but will  be 300 billion jin short of the extraordinary demand. We will  have to import at least 100 billion jin, which is equivalent to  approximately 10 percent of the domestic grain production.    Currently, domestic grain prices are below that in the  international markets. Cost of production for domestic grains  has increased at an average rate of 7-8 percent a year over the  last 12 years, while international cost has increased only 1-2  percent. At this rate, by the year 2000, domestic grain prices  will exceed that in the international markets. However, there  are two trends pulling in the opposite direction: First,  international agricultural products are heavily subsidized. Each  year, the United States spends $80 billion, Europe spends $80  billion, and Japan spends $10 billion on subsidies. But such  subsidies are gradually being cut back. Second, the yuan is  being devaluated. Based on the 1993 list price, as a result of  depreciation of the yuan, $1 which used to fetch 1.7 yuan is now  fetching 5.8 yuan. The yuan has depreciated 240 percent over the  last 15 years, at an average rate of 10 percent a year.  Meanwhile, using the regulation price, the value of the yuan has  dropped to 10.8 yuan, falling 540 percent, at a rate of 15  percent a year. It is estimated that in the next decade, the  yuan will continue to depreciate at a rate of 10-15 percent a  year, which is faster than the rate of increase in the cost of  grain production. Therefore, the domestic and foreign grain  price differential will only increase rather than decrease, and  import subsidies will have to double and redouble. We must  accelerate the pace of converting to the import agent system in  grain and chemical fertilizer importing. Our strategy should be  to proceed while domestic grain prices are being raised. The  domestic sale prices of grains have been decontrolled since  1993, but procurement prices are still being adjusted according  to plans and are raised annually. We must quicken the pace of  converting to the grain agent system to solve the problem of  rising government subsidies and losses incurred in chemical  fertilizer production. As for their causing a general rise in  the domestic price level, this is a price we have to pay. It is  the price we have to pay for reforming the entire import pricing  system. In essence, we are replacing government price subsidies  with price increases to free the pricing mechanism from the  bondage of economic planning, so that it can truly play a role  in regulating import.</p>

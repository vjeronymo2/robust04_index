			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Fourth-term setback seen at Chase Manhattan Chase Manhattan, the US bank, said it expected to report substantially lower trading revenues in the fourth quarter than in the third, but this would be partly offset by other revenue items, Reuter reports from New York. Chase also said that other business areas, excluding trading, would report fourth-quarter revenue trends that would be much the same as in the third quarter. Chase's trading revenues were Dollars 188m in the third quarter, Dollars 151m in the second, Dollars 179m in the first quarter, and Dollars 167m in the 1993 fourth quarter. Chase previously said it would take a Dollars 20m fourth-quarter restructuring charge from buying the American Residential mortgage company and that it would have Dollars 100m in pre-tax costs from a voluntary retirement programme. Chase said the Dollars 100m in fourth-quarter expenses would be offset by other revenue items, such as the previously announced sale of Chase Florida, resulting in a non-material impact on earnings. Analysts generally expect the fourth quarter to be a poor quarter for trading revenues at most banks because of difficult trading conditions, particularly in bond mar-kets. Last week, J. P. Morgan said it also expected 'substantially reduced' trading revenues in the fourth quarter from the third quarter's Dollars 282m. It also said that, mostly as a result of this, fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than third-quarter earnings.</p>

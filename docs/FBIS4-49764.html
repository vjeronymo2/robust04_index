			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Chinese Leader Says U.S. Revoking MFN Trading </F> Status Means Giving Up China's Vast Market"]    [Text] A Chinese leader recently pointed out that China  will definitely not accept the U.S. and Western views on human  rights. As far as the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status  issue is concerned, brandishing the human-rights "big stick"  will not lead to any good ending.    The Chinese leader said: China's views on human rights are  different from those of the United States. There are many  differences despite some similarities. The United States holds  that the U.S. view on human rights is universally accepted but,  in fact, only 1 billion people in this world endorse the U.S.  view on human rights while the remaining 4 billion people do  not. As far as the Chinese know, the U.S. human rights record  is not good. In the United States, there is racial  discrimination as well as discrimination and harassment against  women; the crime rate is much higher in the United States than  in China; and the United States did use firearms to quell the  Los Angeles riots but China made no comment on this because it  was an internal affair of the United States.    China places more stress on man's right to subsistence and  development but this seems difficult for the United States to  understand. As a Chinese saying goes: "The well fed do not know  how the starving suffer." The U.S. per capita GNP is about  $25,000, whereas China's GNP, even if quoted from U.S.  statistics, is no more than $1,000. China is still a developing  country with more than 80 million people still living in extreme  poverty. Therefore, for China, the very first problem that must  be dealt with is that of providing its 1.2 billion population  with food, clothing, housing, and transport facilities, that is,  the issues concerning the right to subsistence and development.  The United States has already basically solved this problem.  Therefore, what is being talked about in the United States  nowadays is another right, specifically, the issue regarding the  so-called principle of "one person, one vote" or the freedom to  criticize the government.    This leader stressed that China will definitely not accept  the U.S. and Western views on human rights. We would like to  discuss the human rights issue with the United States and other  Western countries on an equal footing but we will never tolerate  pressure on us, the Chinese leader said.    Referring to the MFN issue, the Chinese leader said: The  Americans have a well-known doctrine called the "carrot and  stick" policy. The United States is currently holding a  "carrot," that is, the MFN status and, on the other hand, a "big  stick," that is, human rights. The MFN status is the foundation  for normal economic and trade relations between the two  countries and is not only favorable to China but also to the  United States. The United States perhaps has an unrealistic  belief that China very much fears that the U.S. side will revoke  MFN status. Frankly speaking, China does not want to see the  United States revoking China's MFN status. However, this does  not mean that revoking MFN status will cause the sky to fall  down and the earth to revolve in the opposite direction and,  thus, the PRC will not be able to survive anymore and the  Chinese economy will stop developing. To be sure, there will be  some impact, but China is not so terribly afraid of the MFN  status being revoked as the United States imagines. I have good  grounds for saying that: First, China does not rely only on  foreign trade, and China has its major market at home; and  second, China has benefited from its trade with the United  States but it has not benefited as much as the United States  imagines. It is all right to compare Sino-U.S. trade to a  "carrot" but this "carrot" is not so big as described by the  United States. If the United States revoked China's MFN status  the biggest victim would not be the Chinese people nor the  Chinese economy. Of course, this does not mean that the Chinese  economy will be unaffected at all but, the direct impact upon  China will be much less than that on Hong Kong, Taiwan, and U.S.  investors in China. Furthermore, the United States itself will  also suffer very great losses.    This Chinese leader said: If the United States revokes  China's MFN status, China will react in similar fashion. China  is not only a big importer of U.S. wheat, chemical fertilizer,  and timber, but also the biggest foreign buyer of Boeing  airplanes. Just recently, the American Telephone and Telegraph  Company entered the China market. China's present annual import  volume is $100 billion. If China's import volume keeps growing  by 9 percent a year, by 2000 its total annual import volume will  reach $1,000 billion, which will present a huge market even  measured on a world scale. So, if the United States revokes  China's MFN status, this will imply that the United States will  give up this market.</p>

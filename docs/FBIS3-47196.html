There are many problems, including  financial system reforms, but Japanese companies on the scene  are generally optimistic.    Approximately 40 km from Shanghai City center, the  industrial  zone of Songjiang County, Shanghai City, is located. Since land  prices and personnel expenses are cheaper than in Shanghai City  center and laborers who do not dislike factory work are  plentiful, the interest of Japanese companies in the zone has  been increasing recently.    A neatly paved highway runs from Shanghai City to Songjiang  County. The scenery of Shanghai outskirts, observed when  traveling on this road to visit the industrial site, was very  impressive.    Waterways ran here and there in the extensive paddy fields.  Groups of several farm houses were standing. It was a rural  scene commonly found in Japan. Many apartment houses and deluxe  villas were under construction. There were even buildings to  which access roads could not be seen at all.    When I asked, "With all these apartments and villas being  built, are people really going to live in them," the local guide  replied, "Hong Kong and Taiwan investors are buying them for  speculative purposes."    Redevelopment projects have climbed to approximately 300 in  the center of Shanghai. Concerning this real estate development,  a knowledgeable source said: "From around last fall, the names  of influential figures began to appear. I had been thinking it  might be a recurrence of `government corruption' (illegal acts  by government officials), which became a problem during the  Tiananmen incident, when the big campaign to prevent corruption  started."    Though not related to real estate, an agent who personally  brokered currency exchanges without going through the foreign  exchange control center and collected commissions was said to  have been prosecuted recently. This action might be considered a  part of the campaign to prevent illegal and corrupt practices.    Since Deng Xiaoping's visit to the south in early 1992,  China  accelerated the speed of economic growth. As growth accelerated,  inflation spiraled and speculative property and stock  manipulations intensified throughout China.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji is the official who is fighting to  restrain the economic overheating that the Chinese call the  "bubble."    As soon as Vice Premier Zhu took over the Central Bank  presidency concurrently in July, control measures, such as  reraising of interest rates, early recovery of illegal or  speculative loans by financial institutions, 20-percent cut in  fiscal expenditures, etc., were presented one after another.  <H5>  Control Measures Begin To Show Results </H5>   "Prices of steel materials and cement have stopped rising  and  in fact, seem to be falling. For construction companies like  ours, that is a desirable trend."    So states Hachiro Yamano, acting chief of the China Office,  Fujita Corp. At present, the company is independently developing  an industrial site in Shanghai's Pudong New Area, a national  project.    Construction materials have spiraled in cost because of the  real estate boom. In Shanghai, during the one-year period  beginning April 1992, prices increased approximately 70 percent  for cement, 95 percent for steel rods, and 150 percent for  lumber.    "Land prices soared, too, because of the infrastructure  buildup in the Pudong New Area and redevelopment of the old  urban area. However, probably out of caution for monetary  tightening, real estate has not moved since summer" (Shinichiro  Sugano, manager of Shanghai branch, Industrial Bank of Japan).    As for stocks, too, the price index jumped from 393 in late  1992 to 1,532 in February 1993 in the Shanghai market, out of  speculation craze, but it plummeted after control measures took  effect and has fallen to the 800 level.    Also, at the Shanghai foreign exchange control center, the  exchange rate has stabilized from approximately 11 yuan to 8.8  yuan to the dollar after enforcement of the control measures.    Thus, as far as curbing excessive property and stock  investments are concerned, the effect of the restraining  measures has become evident. However, separate from the central  government's concern, the effect has begun to appear even in  sound corporate operations.    Liu Shunxin, deputy director, Shanghai City Commission of  Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, and head of its foreign  affairs office, denies the effect of the control measures on the  current Pudong development, saying "it is a priority national  project and there is no problem in fund procurement." On the  other hand, he says, "There is some effect on procurement of  renminbi yuan (RMB) in joint ventures.    Since banks are extremely tight on granting new loans, there  are cases where counterpart state enterprises cannot procure  people's yuan and joint venture plans tend to be delayed.    "State-owned enterprises, with which we are not familiar,  contact us unexpectedly or send letters asking for loans"  (Tsutomu Hiroe, deputy manager of Shanghai branch, Bank of  Tokyo).    There are cases where the opening of a letter of credit (LC)  is delayed because of the squeeze on the Chinese company's  funds. "There are even cases where the banks demand 100-percent  deposit in foreign currency" (Terumasa Iohara, head of Shanghai  office, Mitsubishi Corp.).    Also, Hiroshi Komata, general manager of Shanghai Isetan,  says, "Since September, sales of all Shanghai department stores  have been falling." A native of Shanghai pointed out that  Isetan's location on "Nanjing Road was a place where people from  the country and foreign tourists visit; fashion-conscious  Shanghai residents go to Huaihai Middle Road." A store was  opened in June 1993 on that Huaihai Middle Road.    The effects of these restraining measures are beginning to  appear gradually not only in Shanghai but in various places.  <H5>  Financial System Reform Is the Key </H5>   "Macroeconomic control"--that is the phrase that is  presently  being used like a catchword in China.    Zhang Yunfang, deputy director of the Development Research  Center, affiliated with the State Council of the central  government, states, "I think that the reform and liberalization  course has entered a new stage." He adds: "The reform was  carried out until now while maintaining the planned economy  setup, but hereafter, there must be a substantive change toward  market economy. To do that, a systematic reform must be promoted  to build the system that is suited to market economy.    Future economic management will be switched from the  "command-type," based on fiscal policies, to the  "coordinated-type," based on market economy. That is the real  meaning of "macroeconomic control."    Therefore, the central government is now pushing financial  system reform as the top-priority task. At the "Japan-China  International Monetary and Financial Symposium" (sponsored by  the State Council's Development Research Center and Japan-China  21st Century Economic Symposium) held on 13 September in Beijing  with deputy director Zhang Yunfang as the Chinese secretariat  chief, the basic steps of the financial system reform were  announced. The main points are:    1. Separation of governmental and commercial banks.  Long-term  development credit banks, export-import credit banks, and  agricultural banks will be newly established while governmental  banks will be converted to independently operated commercial  banks.    2. Nurture of financial markets. Short-term capital markets  and intra- enterprise short-term loan markets as well as short  exchange markets, securities markets, etc., will be organized  and developed.    3. Strengthen the functions of the People's Bank of China as  the central bank. Devise means to stablize the RMB rate and  control currency supply.    As the economic overheating worsened, the so-called "three  financial misdeeds," i.e., illegal procurement of funds by  financial institutions, illegal loans, and chaotic business  operations by the banks, began to occur frequently. These  practices aggravated the disorderly establishment of development  zones and speculation in real estate and stocks.    "Even the regional branches of the People's Bank of China,  which is the central bank, have stronger ties with local  entities than with the main bank. For that reason, although the  central bank tries to control currency supply, branches make  loans in response to requests of local governments and  influential local leaders" (Japanese corporation).    Reportedly, there are many cases where the banks themselves  engage in property and stock speculation through nonbanks.    With respect to loans by financial institutions, call-in  instructions were issued with the deadline of 15 August. "Loans  by banks that were illegitimate because of interest rates, time  limitations or usages were recovered" (Chinese bank official).  According to the media, 72.7 billion yuan, or one-third of the  targeted amount, were recovered nation-wide.    Unless these systematic defects are overcome, "macro  economic  control" through financial policies is still just a dream.    Under present conditions where policy tools are still far  from adequate, coercive tightening by the government is  inevitable. The fact that extreme restraints on bank loans are  presently affecting not only property and stock speculations but  even sound business operations may be said to be the negative  effect of such policies.    Because "triangular claims" (bad claims with debts being  passed along among companies) have reappeared, views are being  expressed that the policy might change again to monetary easing.  However, the problem is how the aforementioned financial reform  can be realized by relying on such short-term tightening and  easing measures. Whether it is possible to get on a stable  growth track, or not, also depends on that point.  <H5>  Views Toward China Change </H5>   "They should make a soft landing, somehow."    When Japanese companies in three locations--Dalian, Beijing  and Shanghai--were questioned as to whether the current  adjustment measures would be successful, the replies were  generally optimistic.    The reasons given are the early start with countermeasures  being planned from last fall, the lessons learned from the  Tiananmen incident, etc., but above all, the fact that Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji, "who understands economics," has taken  command is building up a strong confidence.    In fact, daily sundries and foodstuffs are abundantly  available. Personal income has risen more than increases in  commodity prices and conditions are different from those  existing immediateldy before the Tiananmen incident.    A factor behind this optimistic view of Japanese companies  is  the basic change in posture of the Japanese industrial circle  toward China: "Even the management of companies listed on the  stock exchange's first section foresee the growth and future  potentials of China and are beginning to think of long-term  investments" (trading company source).    Sun Hunchao, director of the China-Asia-Pacific Region  Economic Research Institute, expresses hope for steady  investments by Japanese corporations: "As compared with U.S. and  European enterprises, Japanese companies require time in making  decisions but most of the projects that are undertaken are  successful."    Jiao Sufen, director of the Foreign Investment  Administration  Office, Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Commission,  states: "A liaison conference of multinational companies,  including Japanese, was held for three days beginning 9  September. During the conference, demands and proposals of  multinational firms were brought up and there were many requests  to establish holding companies and investment firms in China."  He adds: "There are also companies that wanted to establish an  Asian headquarters in China and conduct foreign currency  exchanges at the headquarters."    When asked about concrete procedures for establishing  holding  companies, the reply came that "they are under scrutiny, at  present" (Director Jiao Sufen). For the present, the guideline  for approving holding companies seems to be that permission will  be granted to a company with more than three established local  corporations and over $10 million in new investments.    As large companies make inroads into China and start  production in various areas, the advantages of establishing  holding companies in China increase, such as consolidated  management of taxes and finances, bulk purchases of raw  materials, currency control among various bases, etc.    The emergence of these requests to establish holding  companies probably signifies that entry into China of foreign  capital enterprises has entered an important stage.</p>

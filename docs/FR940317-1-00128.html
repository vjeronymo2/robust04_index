Claimants who state they have no insurance will be asked to certify that fact and the written statement will be included in the claim file. The claimant will be required to submit proof of final action by the insurer. Claims personnel will examine each claim after an insurance settlement and determine if prior settlement by the insurer (including excess valuation coverage) is more advantageous to the claimant. A claims JA/attorney may decide to approve a claim for payment under this subpart without a claimant first settling with his or her insurance in exceptional cases where an insurance company improperly refuses to pay a claim or the JA determines the claimant has good cause (see &sect;536.181(a) (2) and (3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Advise a claimant to notify the JA of any offer of settlement or denial of liability by any third party, and to secure the JA's written consent before executing a release or acceptance of any such offer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Take an active and continuing role in publicizing claims information to soldiers and their families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other actions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The JA will ensure that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) DD Form 1840R is dispatched to the appropriate third party within 75 days of delivery of goods, that a copy of the DD Form 1840 and 1840R is dispatched to the destination transportation office, in appropriate cases, and that a signed and dated copy is maintained and incorporated into any claim filed.

(See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;27.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A claims office representative will periodically attend local transportation office outbound briefings to ensure that appropriate information is being disseminated to soldiers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Inspections by claims office personnel are conducted in appropriate cases (large claim, reconsideration, fraudulent claim) and incorporated into the file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Financial. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The JA will properly manage claims funds.

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Copenhagen sets out EC aims DENMARK yesterday presented the European Parliament with ambitious plans for its six-month presidency of the EC, which it said would be unaffected by the impending change of government in Copenhagen. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, outgoing Danish foreign minister, said there was a broad consensus among the principal Danish political parties on EC policy. 'There is no need to worry whether the Danish presidency will function,' he said. But Mr Leo Tindemans, a Belgian former prime minister and now president of the Christian Democratic group in the parliament, noted that a Danish government was not yet in place in Copenhagen. 'Never in my experience has a presidency started under worst auspices than today,' he told fellow MEPs. Denmark's goals for its presidency include opening negotiations on EC enlargement with Austria, Sweden, Finland, and - as soon as possible - Norway; greater openness in EC decision-making; devolving responsibilities to the lowest level in the Community according to the principle of subsidiarity; tougher EC environmental policy; and closer political and economic ties with eastern and central Europe. Mr Ellemann-Jensen, one of Europe's longest-serving foreign ministers, told reporters at a farewell news conference that his speech had been cleared by the main parties in the Danish parliament. In Denmark, Mr Poul Nyrop Rasmussen, the Social Democratic leader, is trying to form an SDP-led government after 10 years of Conservative-Liberal rule, but a new coalition may not be in place until the weekend. In his speech to the European Parliament, Mr Ellemann-Jensen said the conflict in Yugoslavia would demand the greatest efforts of the Danish presidency. He also called for closer co-operation with the incoming Clinton administration in the US to promote economic growth, reach a Gatt trade agreement, strengthen the UN's peace-keeping role and create an International Court of Criminal Justice. Denmark - which rejected the Maastricht treaty in a referendum last June - is to hold a second such poll in late-April or early-May.</p>

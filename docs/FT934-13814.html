			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Government awards contract to Royal Ordnance THE GOVERNMENT last night awarded a Pounds 200m contract for ammunition to Royal Ordnance, ending a period of uncertainty for the British Aerospace subsidiary, David Owen writes. The move, which was announced in the Commons debate on defence by Mr Jeremy Hanley, the armed forces minister, will help safeguard nearly 1,000 jobs over five years. Royal Ordnance said it was 'delighted' at the news. On a purely commercial basis, the contract represented 'a good deal for the government and the taxpayer'.</p>

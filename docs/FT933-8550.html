			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Afloat in an old pool I have a holding of shares in Redland plc, all of which are in a pre-April 1982 pool. I have now received the additional shares in respect of the enhanced scrip dividend and I am considering selling them. When these new shares are sold, do they constitute a new pool or are they to be added to the base cost of the pre-April 1982 pool and the CGT calculated accordingly? Like any other bonus (or rights) issue, scrip issue in lieu of a dividend falls into the same pool as the holding which produced it. In your case, therefore, the scrip falls into the old pool of Redland shares acquired before April 6 1982. The free Inland Revenue pamphlet CGT13 should clarify the rules for you. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

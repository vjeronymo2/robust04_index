			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] O our heroic Palestinian people, o brothers of the  martyrs of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, o their sons and beloved  ones, o their relatives, o brave men of the giant intifadah, o  brave Palestinians in all arenas of struggle, confrontation,  clash, and conflict: It was our blood that was shed  treacherously in the houses of God. It calls you, your unity  and cohesion, your national identity, your national affiliation,  your awareness and understanding and it urges you to rise up as  one man to achieve the great goal of expelling the hateful  Zionist occupation and its dark age from our country so our  people can enjoy freedom and independence.    Let us all chant our historic slogan: "All rifles should be  directed against the enemy, and all efforts and energies should  be mobilized to fight the enemy, which is seeking to destroy our  life and future."    Let each one act from his position to confront the army's  occupation and the hordes of its settlers. Let a new wave of  our brave intifadah move in one national voice and one combat  spirit. This time is no longer one for differing slogans and  speeches. Rather, it is one for a unified national action, which  allows only for different actions.    Yes, this is a time for a unified national action and this  is  a time for a national unity to protect the lives of our people  and bring double retaliation to the murderers, the hordes of the  Zionist settlers, and the occupation army and authorities that  protect these murderers. Let us work in the arenas of struggle,  conflict, and confrontation as one unified rank and let us all  chant in one voice: Either freedom and independence or fighting.  Long live Palestine free, Arab, and Palestinian.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Revenue reviews tax on derivatives THE INLAND Revenue yesterday published draft legislation which will rationalise the complex and unequal tax treatment of financial instruments used by UK companies for managing interest rate and currency risk. Ms Emma Lubbock, head of capital markets at accountants Price Waterhouse, said: 'These changes will help to bring our Victorian tax legislation into the twentieth century.' Because the market in derivative instruments such as swaps and options has developed rapidly, mainly in the last 10 years, legislation in a number of areas has not kept pace. Under the new system, based on an Inland Revenue consultative document published in August 1991, all profits and losses on a range of instruments used for managing risk would be taxed as income. Currently, some instruments are not eligible for tax relief, while others may be subject to income or capital gains tax. The Inland Revenue said in a statement: 'The proposals will replace the current complex rules with a simple and coherent regime for taxing the profits and losses associated with these instruments. 'This will provide companies with certainty and clarity in this difficult area of tax law.' The move was widely welcomed by UK company treasurers. While large companies can generally manoeuvre around the tax hurdles, the complexity of the system has discouraged some smaller companies from using derivative instruments to manage risk. Mr Arthur Burgess, treasurer of British Gas, said: 'In common with every major user we have used Dutch companies (as a vehicle) for capital markets instruments, not to avoid UK tax, but to gain certainty of tax treatment.' He said that corporate treasurers wanted 'symmetry of treatment' of gains and losses. The Inland Revenue is inviting representations on the draft legislation by October 31. The legislation will come into force at the same time as new foreign exchange rules, which are included in the 1993 Finance Act.</p>

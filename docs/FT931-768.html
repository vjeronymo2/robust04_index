			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / MoD 'unable to provide' Iraq papers A GOVERNMENT minister admitted last night that his department might have destroyed some of the documents requested by Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair. Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, acknowledged that the Ministry of Defence had been 'unable' to provide certain documents requested by Lord Justice Scott. In a parliamentary written answer, Mr Aitken said it was MoD policy 'routinely to review and, where appropriate, destroy documents, usually after five years. 'Following the announcement of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry, instructions were issued prohibiting the destruction of any relevant papers. I am advised there are very few documents requested by the inquiry which my department has been unable to provide,' he said. The admission comes six weeks after it emerged that Lord Justice Scott was increasing pressure on government departments he believed were obstructing his inquiry, threatening to name those that did not provide documents. The inquiry team said last night that in cases where the MoD had been unable to provide documents, it had 'generally been possible to obtain them from other departments to which the work was copied.' The team said: 'The work of the inquiry has continued without interruption.' The inquiry team plans to set out next week details of how public hearings, almost certainly involving current and former ministers, will be held. It hopes to complete the hearings before parliament rises for the summer recess in July or August. Responding to questions from Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, Mr Aitken also disclosed that the MoD had so far supplied more than 18,000 pages of papers to the inquiry.</p>

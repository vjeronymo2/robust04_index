			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional gain doubles Norcor Pre-tax profits at Norcor Holdings, the corrugated board manufacturer, more than doubled for the half year ended June 30, from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 4.01m. The rise was due to an exceptional gain of Pounds 3.1m, representing interest waived by venture capital loan note holders at the time of the company's flotation in May. The gain itself was partly offset by an exceptional interest charge of Pounds 500,000. Operating profits were down 41 per cent, from Pounds 2.53m to Pounds 1.51m, on reduced turnover of Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 20.3m). Earnings per share were 24.3p (10.6p). The maiden dividend will be recommended with the final results.</p>

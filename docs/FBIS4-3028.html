			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup: Developing Countries Have Mixed Feelings About </F> New World Trade Framework" -- XINHUA headline]    [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The  ministerial meeting of GATT ended here today with the adoption  of the world's biggest trade deal, labeled "the Marrakech  Declaration".    To judge by speeches and talks both in and out of the  meeting, many developing countries expected and supported such  an agreement, and the creation of a World Trade Organization  (WTO) designed to structure a better global economic order.    On the other hand, they also have reservations and even  worries about the conclusion of the Uruguay-Round trade talks.    An opening international economic environment and a complete  set of international trade regulations are necessary for a  developing country to improve its economy. As one  representative from a developing country said, "the future of  the global economy and the prosperity of developing countries  will depend on the opening-up of the international trade system."    This GATT agreement achieved a wide range of market-entry  promises, stressing the principle of freedom in international  trade and improving multilateral trade regulations. This  achievement has been welcomed and basically supported by  developing countries.    They believe that by this agreement, which has strengthened  multilateral trade regulations and will establish a mechanism to  solve possible trade disputes, developing countries will be less  discriminated against.    Representatives from developing countries also pointed out  that the implementation of the Uruguay-Round agreement and the  establishment of a world trade organization to replace GATT will  inaugurate a new phase in world trade, bringing greater  cooperation, more investment, more employment and faster  economic growth.    At the same time, some representatives from developing  countries hold the opinion that the final outcome of the talks  doesn't attach enough importance to profits of developing  countries, and that the clauses related to market-entry are  still insufficient.    They said that this final agreement does not match  concessions made by developing countries during the talks, and  could even be harmful to a few debtor countries.    They also expressed their worry about clauses on society in  general, especially those concerning the rights of workers.  "The rights of workers should be certainly protected, but it  shouldn't be used as an excuse to interfere in the internal  affairs of other countries," said one representative.    They also worry that clauses on society may be contained in  the guiding principles of a world trade organization.    Although there were many reservations and concerns about the  final outcome of the Uruguay-Round talks and the establishment  of a world trade organization, most developing countries still  place great hope in such an organization, which is expected to  emerge in the near future.    Many people from developing countries expected that a world  trade organization will bring them equal and ample opportunities  to participate, and will give substantial assistance to the  least developed countries on special and favorable principles.    They hope the organization will promote the establishment of  a fairer new international economic order and take efficient  measures to guarantee the competitive capacity of developing  countries and further improve their ability to enter  international markets.    Only because a large number of developing countries  supported  the Uruguay-Round agreement and the establishment of a world  trade organization was it possible for ministers from more than  120 countries to sign the world's largest trade deal.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / World Trade News: Marubeni in China computer tie-up Marubeni, the Japanese trading house, has agreed a wide-ranging tie-up with a Chinese computer company to sell personal computers and other electronic equipment in China and other parts of Asia. The deal calls for Marubeni and the Legend Computer Group, one of the three largest PC makers in China, jointly to develop, produce, market and service personal computers, communications equipment and medical analysis systems. Legend, based in Beijing, produces IBM-compatible PCs while Marubeni is the second largest dealer of Apple PCs and the first in Apple software in Japan. The Marubeni-Legend tie-up is a bold step by Marubeni to establish itself in the Chinese market at an early stage. The two will build up a sales network which will initially be based on Legend's distribution network in Beijing, but which they hope to increase to 200-300 offices throughout China in three years' time. The joint venture will begin by selling Apple's Macintosh desktop PCs, but gradually expand their range to other PCs as well. The accord also calls for the two to develop Chinese language software which could be marketed to the large Chinese community in other parts of Asia. In addition, Marubeni is also considering importing Legend's products into Japan once they become more competitive. Marubeni's move reflects growing Japanese interest in China's PC market, which is expected to take off in the near future. Japanese trading houses in particular are keen to play a role in this market by establishing distribution networks. US computer companies such as IBM, Compaq and Apple have moved quickly into the Chinese market. By contrast, Japanese computer manufacturers have been slow to take steps into China, despite the advantage they have of sharing a written language based on ideograms. NEC, Japan's largest computer maker, sells workstations in China on an individual contract basis and has joint ventures with Chinese companies in pagers, optic fibre cable, semiconductors and telecoms equipment, but does not sell PCs. Toshiba says that it believes China is a promising market but has no plans to set up an office there yet. 'Are we interested? Yes. But it's just now that the Chinese language systems are coming out,' says Mr Mike Beirne at Fujitsu. 'There hasn't been a market.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Supreme Council commission for issues of  economic reform and national economy management did not support  the government's draft state budget of Ukraine for 1994. This  has been reported by the commission chairman, people's deputy  Volodymyr Pylypchuk. According to him, the budget document,  although submitted as a balanced one, is unrealistic both in  practical and theoretical terms because it envisions that 73  percent of the gross product or 91 percent of the national  income should be distributed through the budget. Besides, the  draft budget envisions such a tax pressure which will reduce the  index of the producers' business activity, believes Volodymyr  Pylypchuk.</p>

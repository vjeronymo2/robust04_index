			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CITIES BREAK RULES ON HOUSING FOR POOR  </P> <P> Nearly one-fourth of all California communities are building no housing for the  poor, despite state-mandated plans that require each community to construct its  share of low-income housing, according to a survey by the California Coalition  for Rural Housing. The study found that plenty of homes are being built for the  wealthy, but only 16% of the housing needed for low-income people is being  constructed. The study found that only 97,424 low-income housing units were  built statewide through the end of 1989 -- at least 500,000 housing units less  than required under current plans.  </P></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold nears Dollars 390 mark - Market Report The GOLD price found it impossible to break through the Dollars 390 a troy ounce barrier on the London bullion market yesterday and the price ended at Dollars 389.70, up Dollars 2.05. Dealers said Swiss buying started the present rally and investment funds joined in yesterday on the New York Commodity Exchange. But producer selling capped the market at about Dollars 390. 'At this level the price looks very attractive to the producers, especially the Australians,' said one dealer. 'The New York guys seem to be interested in buying gold on dips to around Dollars 387.50, so it's pretty well supported,' he added. ALUMINIUM was lively in after-hours trading in London. Speculative buying helped run prices above stubborn technical resistance at Dollars 1,570 a tonne. Last business was at Dollars 1,576.50, up Dollars 15.50, and traders suggested a move towards Dollars 1,600 was likely. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> FarWest Financial -- A Nov. 24 story about FarWest Financial Corp. incorrectly  stated the company's relationship with Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham  Lambert Inc. FarWest and its subsidiary, FarWest Savings &amp; Loan, had only a  remote business relationship with Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond  division. Also, FarWest Savings purchased about $300 million of junk bonds from  Drexel, not $600 million as was incorrectly reported.  </P></p>

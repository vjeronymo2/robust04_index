			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Rabobank agreement RABOBANK Nederland, the Dutch bank, has signed a co-operation agreement with Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo), AP-DJ reports from Utrecht. Under the terms of the agreement, Rabobank customers will have access to business banking services offered at over 600 Cariplo branches in Italy while Cariplo customers can use Rabobank's Dutch network of over 2,000 offices. Rabobank said that the agreement with Cariplo follows recent arrangements made with Spain's Banco Popular Espanol, Credit Agricole of France, and Lloyds Bank of the UK. The latest agreement confirms Rabobank's policy of positioning itself in Europe ahead of 1993. The bank said it is seeking to expand its own office network in Europe, while forming alliances with foreign partners. Rabobank is already active in Italy through its Milan representative office, Rabofin Italia. ACEC-UNION Miniere, the Belgian non-ferrous metals company, is unlikely to see much of an improvement in its 1992 results after posting a loss in 1991, according to Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, the chief executive officer, Reuter reports from Brussels. Acec-UM, a subsidiary of Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique, earlier said it had a BFr5bn (Dollars 147m) group loss in 1991, reversing a BFr3.82bn profit in 1990. It also dropped its 1991 dividend. THE GERMAN insurer Aachener und Muenchener Versicherung, part of Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs, the financial holding group, said it had sharply reduced its 1991 underwriting losses to DM9m (Dollars 5.4m) from a previous DM40.2m, Reuter reports from Aachen. The company said that 1990 results had been held back by heavy claims linked to hurricanes. It also said 1991 earnings from financial investments had risen by about DM29m. HENKEL, the German chemicals group, will take over hair care maker Henara from Britain's European Brands Group on June 29 for an undisclosed sum, Reuter reports from Dusseldorf. Henkel said the acquisition would boost its annual cosmetics sales in Britain to about DM60m, including Henara sales of about DM15m. Henara produces shampoos, conditioners and home permanent kits.</p>

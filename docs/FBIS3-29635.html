Officials said the prime minister filed the request during a  three-way meeting with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan] (sDP) [SDPJ], the largest among the  seven ruling parties, and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), who is health and welfare  minister.    Murayama reaffirmed his opposition to an early cabinet  reshuffle, telling the prime minister, "an early reshaping  targeted at a specific cabinet member would cause turmoil."    Ouchi echoed the SDPJ leader and called for prudence on  Hosokawa's part, the officials said.    In the meeting, Hosokawa reiterated his hope to reshuffle  the  cabinet soon after the passage, expected this week, of the third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and of bills revising the  political reform package, they said.    Hosokawa told Murayama and Ouchi that he will make a  decision  after hearing the opinions of all the seven coalition party  leaders.    The seven parties are divided on the proposed cabinet  reshuffle, with the SDPJ, DSP and Takemura's Sakigake against it  and Shinseito and Komeito pushing strongly for it.    Hosokawa's own Japan New Party has a formal alliance with  Sakigake, making its stand on the reshuffle complicated, while  the attitude of the United Social Democratic Party is not clear.    Earlier on Monday, Hosokawa told a session of the House of  Representatives Budget Committee that he may think of the  reshuffle after the Diet finishes debate on amendments to the  political reform package and third supplementary budget  conclusion.    Takemura told reporters Monday he has not accepted  Hosokawa's  plan to remove him from the post of the chief cabinet secretary  and name him to another ministerial position.    Newspaper reports earlier Monday said Takemura is ready to  give up the key cabinet post.</p>

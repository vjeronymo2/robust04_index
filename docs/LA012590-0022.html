			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY ORDERS COST STUDY ON TRUCK DELIVERY  CURBS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors this week ordered a cost analysis  study on a traffic and smog reduction plan that would ban truck deliveries at  all 1,900 county government sites during peak traffic hours.  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman argued that the plan should not be implemented until  county departments determine whether the necessary changes in scheduling would  increase the county's payroll costs.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who authored the proposal, and Chief Administrative  Officer Richard Dixon maintained the plan would not lead to additional costs.  But Edelman, with the support of Supervisor Pete Schabarum, was successful in  delaying a vote on the plan for 30 days while a cost analysis is prepared.  </P> <P> Antonovich's proposal would also idle the county's fleet of 400 trucks during  rush hours.  </P></p>

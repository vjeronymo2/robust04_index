			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Airlines face 60% rise in insurance INTERNATIONAL airlines are facing increases of about 60 per cent in the cost of insurance cover. The rises follow several years of weak trading performance by aviation insurers, with claims from accidents and other losses regularly exceeding premiums - a trend highlighted by a possible claim for more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) after a China Airlines Boeing 747 plunged into Hong Kong harbour last week. The rises should signal improving prospects of profitability for underwriters at Lloyd's of London, a leading market for aviation insurance. 'Underwriters have lost money for a number of years,' said Mr Matthew Day, of Willis Corroon Aerospace, a leading buyer of airline insurance. Three out of four airlines renew covers in the last quarter of each year. Rates vary according to the claims record of each airline during the past 12 months. But according to figures published by Willis Corroon, many airlines that renewed their policies on October 1 paid steep increases. Increases ranged from 147 per cent for hull cover and 110 per cent for its liability risks paid by one Asian airline to 31 per cent for hull and 54 per cent for liabilities for a smaller European airline. Premiums for hulls range from 0.14 per cent to 0.6 per cent of value and liability premiums range from 0.2 per cent to 1 per cent of 'revenue passenger kilometres', a measure of the airline's passenger traffic used by insurers. After the increases, total premiums for 1993 are expected to be Dollars 898m, said Willis, against Dollars 579m in the same period of 1992. Large claims have so far cost insurers about Dollars 300m (a figure which is understood to exclude the recent Hong Kong crash) although the market has also been hit by a large number of partial and 'attritional' losses (when aircraft are damaged, not destroyed). As part of the trend towards a tighter market, insurers have also pressed airlines to accept higher deductibles (the amount paid by the insurance buyer). The ability of underwriters to impose increases reflects the withdrawal from the market of a number of insurers, including syndicates at Lloyd's, earlier this year.</p>

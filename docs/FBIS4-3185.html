			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin today confirmed his government's  determination to continue the economic reforms underway in the  country.    Speaking at the opening session of the annual meeting of the  board of directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD) in Russia's second-largest city of St.  Petersburg. Chernomyrdin stressed that the continuation of  reforms remains at the center of Russia's economic policy.    The EBRD meeting, which will discuss how it will further its  financial cooperation with Russia, is expected to play a big  role in the bank's further contacts with Russia.    After the first two months of this year, the inflation rate  fell below 10 percent in the country, the Russian government  head said in his speech. "As long as the planned budget  expenses are not exceeded, inflation will fall to seven or eight  percent a month by the end of the year," he added.    "We are now going through the crisis' very lowest point,"  Chernomyrdin stated. "Russians have stepped right up to the  line."    "However, such a change will occur only if investment  increases," he stressed.    The Russian premier appealed to the EBRD's management, the  official delegation members and businessmen from G7 nations who  hold shares in the bank to be active on the Russian market.    "I see today's forum as weighty evidence that our  international partners' worry over the fate of economic reforms  in Russia is being replaced by other moods and other  expectations," he said.    After Chernomyrdin's speech, the participants discussed the  results of the bank's activity in the past two years and of the  top priorities for the next two years.</p>

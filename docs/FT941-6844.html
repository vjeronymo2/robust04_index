			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Arts: Design fit for great scholars - Architecture The first library at St John's College, Cambridge was completed in 1628 and is a glorious room, 100ft long with a panelled timber roof and a traceried Gothic bay window overlooking the river. In old engravings you are lucky if you can spot the occasional scholar reading - it was clearly a place for almost solitary contemplation where the great works of the past seeped into the brain by osmosis. Ancient libraries have a rare and impressive quality of pure learning about them - like the Ark of the Covenant, they hold the truth. The presence of knowledge is almost palpable - which is the main reason why the great Reading Room of the British Museum should continue to be used for reading when the British Library has moved to its horrible new home in Camden. Today we live in a world dominated by information rather than thought. Every new computer opens up yet more ways of communicating, linking, faxing, photocopying, printing and word processing. Every library can be linked to every other library, every book and newspaper can be read on a screen, and every bar-coded book can be traced all over the world. With so much electronic data, what is the future of the college library? Clearly the University of Cambridge believes that individual college libraries will continue to have an important role. Several colleges have built new ones or added to or upgraded old ones. Downing College, Clare and now St John's are the most recent examples. Downing went along their chosen route of encouraging the Classical revival by appointing Mr Quinlan Terry as their architect. He has added two important buildings to William Wilkins's 19th-century neo-classical college buildings. Clare chose Arup Associates as their architects and made a disastrous decision when it came to siting - spoiling the central axis of a court with an intrusive block. St John's went down a different route and invited a number of architects to compete to produce a design and, after a lengthy process of attrition, Edward Cullinan Architects were chosen. The new library is a very clever and careful addition to the college's range of architecture, which has examples of good design from almost every century since the foundation of the college in 1511. It took courage to place a building in the lowering shadow of Sir George Gilbert Scott's immense chapel, a cross between Pershore Abbey and the Sainte Chapelle. Another near neighbour of the new library is Sir Edward Maufe's residential block, added to Chapel Court in 1939, in a style that Edward Cullinan describes as 'horizontal gothic'. Cullinan gutted the undistinguished, late-Victorian building by Penrose, housing lecture halls with sets of rooms above, that stands in Chapel Court next to the old library. He added a 'crossing' that runs through the centre of the old building giving it a new heart and making it very much larger. To demolish the rather dull 1880's building and to build anew would have been cheaper but Cullinan's solution is more contextual and appropriate. Facing the chapel the new block makes a porch and large gable - in the master's garden it rises into a gloriously curved tall brick apse that is almost Romanesque in its dignity. The decision to add and adapt does not weaken the quality of the new architecture. Michelangelo added to the Campidoglio in Rome and Brunelleschi added on his brilliant Pazzi Chapel in Florence - so the precedents are good. Cambridge is so full of architecture that it would be hard to imagine many opportunities for more free-standing new buildings. The scale and quality of the old helps to inform those qualities in the new architecture. The large lecture halls of the old Penrose wing have been well adapted to become the entrance and catalogue hall of the new library. You enter under the giant porch - pushing hard at a huge centrally pivoted timber door. This door is the only wilful and rather silly affectation about the new library. Once through the narrow security point you are in a double-height hall with a mezzanine gallery where students perch comfortably in curved carrels. The library is full of ingeniously designed and comfortable corners to work in. The seating up in the porch is highly favoured as a vantage point: it gives you a perfect view of college comings and goings as you pretend to work. The four floors of library - one has been successfully added in the roof - are all close to computer facilities and there are provisions for high-speed communications at every desk. The library is open 24 hours a day and has proved extremely popular with students. It is the envy of other colleges. I thought it was a brilliant piece of architecture - especially when seen from the master's garden. The curved apse of brick with stone banding that matches the old building is powerful and convincing. The esprit of the pointed roof lantern that also functions as a natural air conditioner is very enjoyable. Throughout the interior Cullinan has done what he always does - provided places to enjoy views, secret corners for assignations, and everywhere enjoyable chances to make friends with the building. This is architecture for today that is heart-warming.</p>

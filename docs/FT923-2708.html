			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Wharf invests in central China - One of Hong Kong's corporations is shaking off its sleepy image and going where few have gone before Sir Yue-Kong Pao, the Hong Kong businessman, spent more than 40 years rebuilding the corporate empire he lost when he fled from the Communist takeover of Shanghai. Under the helm of his son-in-law Mr Peter Woo, another Shanghai refugee, his empire is now returning to the city at the mouth of the river Yangtze with a pocket full of hard currency. The news that one of Hong Kong's leading corporations is pouring money into mainland China is no longer a surprise but the fact that it is Wharf (Holdings) that is doing so is remarkable. Wharf has for some time been the sleeper among the colony's four big 'hongs'. Its corporate image has been associated with assets such as the Star ferry, tramways and its ageing low-rise skyline properties in Kowloon, rather than Hong Kong island's gleaming skyscrapers and frenetic trading businesses. Even when Wharf made moves to shake off this drowsy image, such as its recent HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194.86m) push into cable television, it had little success. Its consortium crumbled in the face of Hutchison Whampoa's push into regional satellite television and a confused government broadcasting policy. Mr Woo took over the chairmanship of the group in 1986, when Sir YK divided his empire among his son-in-laws, but he was regarded inevitably as only a puppet for the great businessman. Colleagues say he has a hands-on approach to management, but the presence of the conservative patriarch looking over his shoulder was a compelling influence. Since Sir YK's death last September, there is no question of who is boss, and Wharf's corporate slogan, 'Quiet dedication is our philosophy', is beginning to look decidedly out of place. Mr Woo feels it is the responsibility of Hong Kong's leading corporations to stake out the colony's future after China becomes its sovereign power on July 1 1997. 'When I went to Beijing, my discussion with the leadership was that to go to the next level of development, the focus and emphasis must be on how to mobilise the resources of central China. To do that, you need transportation and energy,' said Mr Woo; his company is going to provide it. He admits that the reputation of his father-in-law helped get him access to the very top, in this case Premier Li Peng. Having gained approval for its plans for central China, Wharf is moving rapidly. The conglomerate is looking to Wuhan, the central Chinese city which lies at the intersection of the country's main east-west axis, the Yangtze river, and the main north-south axis of the Beijing-Guangzhou (Canton) railway. This location makes it a logical third point of a Hong Kong-Shanghai-Wuhan triangle, which will be the main focus for Wharf's resources. Wharf is already renovating a hotel on the waterfront in Wuhan and is working on a power project in the city. It also plans to set up a transport hub there, with a river port, airport and an upgraded railway station providing outlets for a container port which will process the resources of the surrounding provinces. A high-speed railway will link this hub with Hong Kong's container terminal, where Wharf is the leading shareholder of the colony's second largest terminal operator. Wharf has also signed letters of intent for big property and infrastructural projects in order to build a presence in Shanghai. It is an alluring vision. Hong Kong was the catalyst in the expansion of Guangdong province, arguably the fastest growing economy in the world over the past decade. Other property developers are cashing in on this by building cheap flats, but Wharf aims to spearhead the push further north. One group of individuals which has so far remained unimpressed by this vision is the Hong Kong brokerage community. 'Wharf is a solid property story which has been clouded by infrastructure,' was the reaction of one analyst. However, Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimates that between 1992 and 1995 property investment earnings will increase 68 per cent to HKDollars 2.5bn, representing 69 per cent of pre-tax profit. With that level of recurrent income, Wharf could be forgiven for looking for some higher-reward projects to spice up the longer-term outlook. Cable television has been one diversification, which has provided little return apart from uncertainty; projects in Wuhan and Shanghai should prove more attractive - if an equally long-term use of Wharf's resource base - since it is sticking to areas it already understands: property and infrastructure. Mr Woo said Wharf is looking at large-scale projects in which it will form consortia to limit its exposure and bring in outside expertise. 'The main role we would hope to play is as a useful and positive catalyst,' he said, suggesting that Hong Kong and other multinational companies would be offered participation. The group's Chinese exposure will be limited to between 10 and 20 per cent of assets, while Mr Woo said the company would not exceed HKDollars 1 of debt to every HKDollars 2 of equity. Wharf has an estimated net asset value of close to HKDollars 50bn. This is an asset base offering significant redevelopment potential, since the closure of Kai Tak airport in 1997 will allow increased height limits for buildings in Kowloon, where Wharf is the main landlord. The company can therefore afford to take big bets. Mr Woo has already experienced big risks, when he left Shanghai in the 1940s. 'When you look at the fundamental economic trend (in China), it is an attractive slope up. Along that slope there will be economic hiccups, but you just have to plan for that,' Mr Woo said.</p>

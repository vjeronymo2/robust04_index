			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  said Wednesday [23 February] he will continue his dual role as  governor of the People's Bank of China and reiterated that  China's economy will not become overheated.    "Since we started implementing macroeconomic adjustment and  controls last year it has become apparent that the position of  governor of China's central bank is not a popular post," Zhu  told reporters at Beijing Airport before leaving on a nine-day  visit to Japan.    "There are not many people who want the post of governor of  the Central Bank of China, so I have to continue to work in this  capacity," he said.    Zhu, who is seen as the main architect of China's  far-reaching economic reform, has been the center of rumors that  he would give up his banking post after next month's session of  the National People's Congress, or China's legislature.    "As a matter of fact the work of the central bank is now the  responsibility of vice governors like Zhou Zhengqing and Wu  Xiangwen... My function is only one of a shield and it seems  that I'll continue to play this role," he said.    Zhu also dismissed reports that recent macroeconomic  controls  were failing and the economy was in danger of overheating, while  reiterating that this year's growth rate would be around 9  percent and could rise in the future.    "At present the economic growth rate is rather high. That is  because judging from the economic realities in China, we do not  want to see big ups and downs," he said.    "Therefore what we want is to keep a speed that is  sustainable and healthy. If the speed is brought down quickly,  artificially, that will lead to social instability," he said.    Zhu also dismissed worries over the tightening and relaxing  of controls over the money supply, saying the intensification of  such controls would depend on the "realities of the national  economy."</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clark poised for decision on trio of bid proposals THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark, Britain's second largest shoe manufacturer, is expected to meet on Monday to decide which of the three bids for the company it will recommend to shareholders, writes Peggy Hollinger. It is likely that the debate will be heated, with several board members expected to object to a proposal to offer the chosen bidder exclusive rights to due diligence for a certain period. This could, in effect, deter a bid from an outside party. The company and its advisers, Schroders, are considering offers from shoe manufacturer FII, a consortium of existing shareholders backed by Electra Investment Trust, and an informal approach from Berisford, the foods and property group. It is believed that Berisford has set certain conditions for making a formal offer including exclusive rights to pursue due diligence and the board's approval. If it goes ahead, the offer would be an all-share deal with some members of the Clark board likely to be invited onto Berisford's executive. Berisford is believed to be interested in the brand opportunities offered by Clark's shoes. The consortium of existing institutional investors, backed by Electra Investment Trust, is believed to be offering about 200p a share, valuing Clark at Pounds 154m. The consortium hopes to buy out the family's 70 per cent holding, but would back the existing management. Meanwhile, FII is believed to have made an offer of shares or cash, valuing Clark at Pounds 140m.</p>

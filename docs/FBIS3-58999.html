Every week there is a new  slice or resolution, without it becoming clear what is really  wanted. These inverted salami policies are leading one general  after another to leave the UN forces.    That is the opinion of W.F. Van Eekelen, the secretary  general of the Western European Union (WEU). Looking to a  possible peace settlement in the former Yugoslavia, he called  for stronger policies yesterday. In a speech to the Belgian  Netherlands Association, Van Eekelen denied he was seeking a  military solution to the Yugoslav problem. But military  resources must be deployed better to achieve the objectives.  However, that presupposes that the objectives are formulated  clearly. And so far that has not been the case.    Originally the WEU was responsible for enforcing the embargo  against Serbia and Montenegro, and now it is also responsible  for enforcing the Danube embargo. The organization is prepared  to contribute to organizing the administration of Mostar by  taking over police duties and other tasks related to public  order.    The WEU was set up in 1948 and has 10 members: All the  member states of the European Union [EU] except Ireland and  Denmark, which are observers. Turkey, Norway, and Iceland are  associate members. The Maastricht Treaty makes the WEU  responsible for implementing the EU's decisions and measures in  the field of defense. However, Van Eekelen pointed out that  collective defense was no longer the priority of the WEU  countries. After all, the former East Bloc is no longer an  immediate threat. At present the military-operational aspect is  becoming particularly important: How can the soldiers be  deployed?  <H5>  European Leadership </H5>   Like NATO, the WEU presently is also unable to offer the  East  European countries full membership, Van Eekelen said. Countries  which have not joined the EU cannot become members of the WEU.  WEU members are obliged to offer each other military assistance  if one of them is attacked. Such a guarantee could be offered  only to countries which followed the same policies, according to  the WEU secretary general.    For Van Eekelen, the recent NATO summit was virtually a  revolution. He has long said that it must be possible for the  armies of the countries concerned to be able to operate in both  NATO and WEU contexts. The NATO summit decided, following a  U.S. proposal, that NATO resources could be made available to  the WEU. This brings an end to the competition between the  United States and Europe. The U.S. military presence in Europe  will be maintained, but that does not mean that the United  States will take part in all operations in Europe. U.S.  leadership therefore will no longer be the same as in the past.  It seems self-evident that this U.S. leadership will be  replaced in Europe by a European leadership. But that is easier  said than done, according to Van Eekelen. Because this European  leadership must not become French, German, or British  leadership. Therefore convergence is the watchword in this area.</p>

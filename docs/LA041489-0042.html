			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOTHESLINES: SCARLETT'S DRESS: SEWN WITH THE WIND  </P> <P> Question: Now that I've been invited to a golden anniversary party for "Gone  With the Wind," I'm interested in the pattern for the Scarlett O'Hara barbecue  dress you wrote about some time ago. Is it still available? Where? I would  really prefer the green velvet drapery dress, but if I remember correctly that  famous gown is not available. Can you help? -- W.M.  </P> <P> Answer: The green velvet dress Scarlett made from the portieres at Tara --  arguably one of the most famous movie dresses of all time and the only one to  figure in the plot -- is now available in pattern form.  </P> <P> This screen gem comes to you from the folks who brought you Scarlett's barbecue  dress, which is still available for $27. According to Janet Burgess of Amazon  Drygoods, 2218 E. 11th St., Davenport, Iowa 52803, the dress follows the  original Walter Plunkett design so faithfully it requires the same 31 yards of  green velvet. The multisize pattern (Sizes 10-20) is priced at $29.75 plus $2  for shipping, and it represents the 750th pattern in Burgess' "Patterns from  Historie" collection.  </P> <P> Ready-made hoops and hoop patterns also are available, and a kit for the hat is  in the works. Burgess says that the kit, which is not yet priced, includes a  buckram hat form and the same variety of feathers and fringe used in the  original. About the only things that will not be authentic, says Burgess, are  the chicken feet Plunkett used in the front and back of the original hat.  </P> <P> "Ours are made of rubber," she reports, adding that her next "Gone With the  Wind" pattern will be Rhett Butler's frock coat, which she hopes to have ready  next year.  </P> <P> Q: My daughter gave me a very expensive sequin dress with lots of pearls and  crystal beads. I want it to last for years as I can't afford to replace it  myself, and would like to know how to care for it. I put it on a hanger, and my  daughter said I should fold it and lay it in a plastic box. I followed her  instructions, but the box made it sweat so I took it out and put it back on the  hanger. What do I do now? -- I.P.  </P> <P> A: Take it off the hanger immediately! This can cause stretching and sagging  and will put undue stress on the fabric at the shoulders.  </P> <P> You were right to take your dress out of the plastic box, as the moisture would  eventually have promoted mildew and fabric deterioration. Fabrics must breathe.  </P> <P> If you would like to receive a free brochure telling exactly how to preserve  your gown, write to Jerry Goldstone, Museum Textile Cleaners Inc., 19343  Londelius St., Northridge, Calif. 91324. Goldstone does work for the costume  and textile curators at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. His brochure is  also valuable for brides-to-be interested in preserving their gowns after the  ceremony.  </P> <P> Here's one tip: "Never seal the box in which the gown is placed. It should be  checked after cleaning and then periodically inspected and refolded to prevent  the accumulation of fold marks."  </P> <P> Goldstone also recommends storage in acid-free boxes, using acid-free tissue  paper. He sells such boxes (40-by-18-by-6 inches) for $25.  </P></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Major to warn Bush over force MR John Major, the British prime minister, will this weekend warn outgoing US President George Bush that the use of force to enforce the UN 'no-fly zone' over Bosnia could put at risk British ground troops and aid workers in the former Yugoslav province. Senior Downing Street officials yesterday acknowledged the growing international pressure for a new UN resolution authorising military measures against Serbian aircraft violating the ban on flights. But they voiced concern that precipitate action could lead to heavy casualties for UK forces in Bosnia and an end to the humanitarian aid effort. Washington has expressed growing impatience with the Serbs, with president-elect Bill Clinton backing the tougher stance of the Bush administration. The deteriorating situation in Bosnia will be the focus of two days of talks between Mr Major and Mr Bush at Camp David. Mr Major, current president of the European Community council, will arrive in Washington on Friday for the EC/US summit. The officials said a new UN resolution authorising tougher action against Serbia to enforce the zone looked increasingly likely after public statements in favour of such action by France and the US. But while Britain was unlikely to block such a resolution, Mr Major would tell Mr Bush that early action to shoot down Serbian aircraft would almost certaintly provoke retaliation against the 2,000 British ground troops escorting aid convoys. They pointed out that the US faces no such risks as it has not deployed troops. Attacks on the escort troops might also effectively halt the transport of humanitarian aid.</p>

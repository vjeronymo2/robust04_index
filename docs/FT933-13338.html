			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / People: Sir Brian Corby joins board of Pan-Holding Sir Brian Corby, chairman of Prudential of the UK and former president of the CBI, has joined the board of Pan-Holding, a Luxembourg-listed closed-end investment company run out of Paris and New York by the Philippe family, grandchildren of co-founder Raymond Philippe. Director Alain Philippe points out that the company has long had a senior figure from the Pru on its board, which currently counts 12 part-time directors of a variety of nationalities. Geoffrey Haslam, 78, deputy chairman of the Pru between 1980-1984, retired from Pan last December; 'he told us he thought Sir Brian would be a good replacement,' says Philippe. Pan-Holding's longstanding chairman, Rowland George, has just died, aged 98. 'He wasn't able to travel in his last year, but the other board members would go to the US and visit him; he was still very helpful,' says Philippe. Other current board members include Lord Roll and Sir Siegmund Warburg, a friend of Alain Philippe's father Pierre, who was on the board from 1958 until his death in 1982. Pan was set up in 1931, making it one of the oldest continental European investment vehicles that spread its assets internationally. At the end of May this year funds under management, on behalf of institutional and retail investors who want to 'minimise risk in volatile times rather than to chase indices', according to Philippe, totalled Dollars 315m.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (8): A record flotation - Royal PTT Netherlands (KPN) THE AMSTERDAM Stock Exchange is to get a much-needed boost next year when the government floats a first tranche of shares in its 100 per cent-owned postal and telecommunications company, Royal PTT Netherlands (KPN). For the bourse, the launch will represent a vitally important injection of new blood following a steady thinning in the ranks of Amsterdam's listed companies as a result of recent mergers in the paper, foods and banking sectors. But for KPN itself, the flotation will be equally significant, marking a new stage in its determined efforts to become an internationally-recognised provider of postal and telecommunication services. 'If we remained a state-owned company, our world expansion plans would come to nothing,' says Mr Wim Dik, KPN's chairman. 'No state-owned company could pull it off.' KPN is well aware that it cannot hope to meet its international goals on its own, particularly in telecommunications where investments are heavy, change is rapid and companies like AT&amp;T are engaged in expensive acquisitions. Ultimately, the flotation is aimed at putting KPN in a position to find additional strategic partners to realise its international ambitions. The Amsterdam listing opens up the possibility of arranging cross-stakes in share capital, if necessary, to cement a strategic partnership. 'Our desire to be launched on the bourse is not based in the first instance on a need for capital,' says Mr Dik. So far in the 1990s KPN has concluded a number of far-reaching strategic alliances. The most significant is its participation in Unisource, a three-way partnership with Sweden's Telia and Swiss Telecom aimed at providing specialised telecommunications for multinational companies. On the postal side, KPN has also linked up with TNT of Australia and the postal authorities of Germany, France, Sweden and Canada to form a joint venture in international express mail. In eastern Europe, KPN is helping to improve the telecommunications networks of Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary and the Czech Republic. By becoming a listed company, KPN hopes to make it easier to conclude business partnerships, especially with US companies which previously found it difficult to understand the Dutch company's anomalous role as a fully commercial organisation whose shares happened to be owned by the state. IN Dutch terms, KPN's 'privatisation' took place in 1989, when the former government agency was transformed into a public limited company accountable to a supervisory board rather than to the ministry of public works. Although the state retained its 100 per cent share holding, KPN was free to act like a private-sector company. An immediate priority was to train its 102,000 staff - all former civil servants - to be customer and market-orientated. KPN's five-year transformation will be capped in the the first half of 1994 with the sale of 20-30 per cent of the state's shares. In later tranches, the government intends to reduce its stake below 50 per cent, though it will retain a 'golden share.' Estimates of KPN's total market value range up to Fl 22bn. However, the price of the shares will depend largely on the company's future dividend policy, as KPN will be seen primarily as a yield stock. KPN currently pays out 40 per cent of net profits to the state. The initial flotation will not only rank as the biggest in Dutch history, exceeding the launch of the chemicals group DSM in the late 1980s, but it will also mark the country's first privatisation of a household name. Although the holding company KPN may not be immediately recognisable to many Dutch people, the term 'PTT' (post, telephone and telegraph) certainly is. All phone users are customers of PTT Telecom, one of KPN's two main operating companies, while PTT Post is familiar to millions as the place to go to buy stamps or to access the services of the Postbank, which belongs to the ING Group. Mr Dik, a former senior executive at Unilever, recalls a consultant at KPN in the late 1980s who proposed that the name PTT be dropped. This suggestion was flatly rejected. It would have been crazy, he says, 'to discard a brand name when 99 per cent of our customers knows exactly what it stands for.' KPN's flotation - the first of a string of share launches by continental telecommunications companies such as Deutsche and France Telecom - is unusual because the Dutch postal services will be included. But KPN's postal operations are themselves unusual because they are profitable, unlike all other post offices in Europe with the exception of Britain's Royal Mail. 'PTT Post is very healthy and achieves a return on invested capital that is every bit comparable to that of PTT Telecom,' says Mr Dik. KPN's international ambitions extend to postal operations as well as to the more obvious area of telecommunications. Already, low Dutch postal rates have enticed foreign companies to ship their European post to the Netherlands for onward delivery elsewhere on the continent. Potential expansion opportunities for PTT Post include international consultancy as well as the setting up of postal services for other countries and lending management support. KPN as a whole intends to double its turnover by the year 2000. The company, which posted 1992 net profit of Fl 1.66bn on turnover of Fl 15.62bn, says growth will come from the expansion of existing businesses into new areas but also from acquisition.</p>

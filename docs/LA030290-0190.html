			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: FORBES' SERVICES OFFER A REFLECTION OF HIS LIFE  </P> <P> Malcolm Forbes' memorial services in New York at St. Bartholomew's Church on  Thursday included most of the things he had liked best -- the swirl of  bagpipes, the choral hunting horns and the men in red coats imported from  France to play them, the discipline and devotion of his four adult sons and his  daughter, each of whom spoke the only personal words in the epic-long (1 hour  and 45 minutes) Episcopal service. Malcolm would have been proud of these  children because not one of them broke down, though others watching did as they  said their farewells to the man they called "Pop."  </P> <P> A baby cried through some of the service -- one of Malcolm's progeny, I have no  doubt. He'd have liked that, too. His huge family filled seven rows in front on  the right, and behind them were hundreds of Forbes' employees. And Malcolm  would have, of course, liked the titans of industry who came to say goodby, men  such as John Kluge, Allen Neuharth and Lee Iacocca. And the presence of the  former mayor of New York, Ed Koch. Malcolm would have adored all the police  uniforms, as well as the claque of booted motorcycle bikers in the back of the  church. Then there was the soft, ongoing click and whir of cameras from an  overhanging balcony crammed with "social historians." Malcolm would have  insisted on it, in fact.  </P> <P> THE PUBLISHER, editor, writer would have enjoyed the Rev. Thomas Bowers'  reminder that we are all dust and that John Dunne's bell tolls not just for  Malcolm, but for you and me, too.  </P> <P> There were lots of famous women, and Malcolm liked famous women. There was  Katharine Graham of the Washington Post and Barbara Walters of television and  Brooke Astor of philanthropy and Joan Rivers of fun, games and comedy. Malcolm  would have embraced a service where we got to sing all six, full verses of "The  Battle Hymn of the Republic" (it's never done) with all the "Glory, Glory,  Hallelujahs" in between. He loved music.  </P> <P> Malcolm would have smiled over the waiting crowds, the police barricades, the  fanfare on Park Avenue and the snarl of Manhattan traffic.  </P> <P> AND I think, most of all, he'd have loved the fact that he had a President of  the United States and one of the greatest film legends who ever lived sitting  next to each other in the front row. Former President Richard Nixon came with  his daughter, Tricia Cox, and they were joined just before the service began by  a subdued Elizabeth Taylor, who appeared from a side door. She looked quite  beautiful and smiled sadly at the children's remembrances.  </P> <P> But as the service ended and Glenn Ellison's bagpipes, playing "Amazing Grace,"  faded away, I saw Nixon lean toward Taylor and heard him say, "I want to thank  you for the joy and beauty, the help and companionship, the enthusiasm and  wonderful times you brought to the latter part of Malcolm's life as a friend."  </P> <P> If this was eavesdropping -- and it was -- I couldn't help it. And I know  Malcolm would want every such scrap recorded for posterity. Oh, Malcolm, you  canny Scot, we'll never see your like again!  </P> <P> THE CBS rumor mill is agog over the newcomer co-host of "CBS This Morning" --  Paula Zahn -- and "her extraordinary contract," plus the fact that her start-up  has been so sensational. Plus the fact that she'll get to sub for Dan Rather  when he is anchors away. Plus the fact that she has two specials written into  her future.  </P></p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Gold price continues on its upward path - At a Glance Gold continued its push upwards but gains did not match those made last week. The rise has been driven by New York investment fund activity and started on June 30 after Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, announced he was to sell another big block of shares in Newmont Mining, North America's largest gold producer, and buy gold bullion instead. For a time, the price threatened Dollars 400 an ounce and closed on Thursday night in London at Dollars 395. But bullion prices fell back last night, closing at Dollars 392.75, and dealers were divided on whether the rally will continue.</p>

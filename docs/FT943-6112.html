			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Alusuisse doubles income to SFr95m Alusuisse-Lonza, the aluminium, chemicals and packaging group, almost doubled its net income in the first half to SFr95m (Dollars 72.5m) from SFr49m, and forecast a similar increase in the second half. Mr Theodor Tschopp, chief executive, said the group had already completed a restructuring programme begun in 1991. The aim of the restructure was to reduce Alusuisse's dependence on sales of aluminium and chemical commodities and develop higher value-added businesses over a five-year period. Sales in the first half were ahead 21 per cent to SFr3.8bn and operating income jumped 74 per cent to SFr265m. These increases were attributed to the SFr1.1bn acquisition of the Canadian Lawson-Mardon packaging group in January, improved productivity in core businesses and the elimination of loss-makers. The packaging division was the star performer, with operating income doubled to SFr118m on sales up 97 per cent to SFr1.39bn, mainly because of the inclusion of Lawson-Mardon figures. Sales of the aluminium division advanced 5.7 per cent to SFr1.45bn but its operating income surged 56 per cent to SFr72m, due to improved markets and productivity. The chemicals division's sales rose 2.8 per cent to SFr813m and operating profits advanced 3.4 per cent to SFr91m, in spite of adverse exchange rate trends. Mr Tschopp said the group still had to improve its profitability significantly to rank among international leaders. It anticipated only minor acquisitions in the packaging division to round out its position, while growth in the aluminium division would come through alliances. An important acquisition in the chemicals division in the medium term was likely, but first, the balance sheet would be gradually strengthened through retentions. The annual dividend, cut by nearly 30 per cent in 1990, would 'at least' be maintained this year, Mr Hans Jucker, chairman, said.</p>

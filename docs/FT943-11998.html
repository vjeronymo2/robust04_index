			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: JCI posts unexpected rise in gold revenues Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, the South African mining house due to be spun off to black investors, has reported an unexpectedly good increase of 4.9 per cent in its gold revenue for the June quarter to R539.1m (Dollars 146m) from R513.9m in the previous three months. Although overall production declined 3.8 per cent to 2.55m tonnes from 2.67m tonnes, due to extra election-related public holidays, a higher gold price received and an improved average yield to 4.89 grammes per tonne from 4.76 grammes per tonne helped boost results. At the group's Western Areas mine, the steel drum shaft failure that affected the previous quarter's production was repaired at a cost of R11.5m and net profit after tax improved to R43.16m from R23.48m. H. J. Joel also showed a significant improvement, converting an operating loss of R0.8m in the March quarter to a R1m operating profit due to higher gold production at 849kg, up from 828kg. Improved cost containment at Randfontein estates, however, was unable to offset lower throughput on the mine as gold production dropped 9.9 per cent to 7,562kg from 8,392kg. Operating profit decreased 3.6 per cent to R114.7m from R119m. Development at JCI's South Deep project also progressed, and exploration expenditure for the first six months of the year amounted to R29.5m, up from R12.2m last year. JCI said plans were well advanced to combine the mining interests at Western Areas with its South Deep mine, creating a giant new mine with large gold reserves. Under the plan, South Deep would provide funding to allow Western Areas to mine the ore and return to profit. This would allow South Deep to make use of Western Areas' skills and equipment while capital expenditure at the former could be used to write off some of the other's profit, improving its tax position.</p>

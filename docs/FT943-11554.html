			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mixed fortunes for market hopefuls Magnum Power, the Scottish electronics company, yesterday announced a successful placing of Pounds 4.5m of shares, valuing it at Pounds 14.6m ahead of its flotation on the USM. But, Aromascan, the other start-up business currently on its way to the stock market, has been forced to put back its plans by a week. One of the company's advisers blamed the rail strike, which had prevented it seeing some key institutions. NM Rothschild, which is sponsoring the Pounds 12m placing, has put back the impact day until next Tuesday. Magnum, which was formed in 1990, has designed a built-in uninterruptible power supply for personal computers, which is claimed to be half the price of existing external products. It claims that no other uninterruptible power supply can currently be built into standard personal computers while meeting the technical standards demanded by most original equipment manufacturers. It lost Pounds 1.23m on turnover of only Pounds 59,000 in the year to May, but in the prospectus the directors state that they believe the company will reach the break-even point of 6,000 units a month by December 1995. None of the existing shareholders have sold stock, and have undertaken not to sell their existing holdings for at least two years after flotation. The placing is sponsored by Henry Cooke. Start-up businesses can apply for a quotation on the USM if they can demonstrate that they will generate significant revenues with 12 months of admission. Aromascan, which has developed a new technology for detecting odours, is looking to raise Pounds 12m from a placing which would value the group at between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m. The money will be used for further development and the building of a manufacturing plant. The pathfinder prospectus projects first profits of Pounds 4m in 1997.</p>

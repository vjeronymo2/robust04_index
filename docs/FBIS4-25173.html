			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Ren Jianxin, a top  Chinese judge, pledged today that China would severely crack  down on embezzlers, bribe-taking officials, swindlers, smugglers  and other serious economic offenders.    Addressing a national telephonic conference, Ren, president  of the Supreme People's Court, said that spreading of corruption  had been brought under control as a result of the anti-graft  campaign nationwide.    During the first four months of 1994, procuratorates  throughout China investigated 19,000 economic offence cases,  including 12,000 cases of embezzlement and bribery, according to  participants in the conference, held by the Central Political  Science and Law Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.    During the first quarter of this year, courts at various  levels tried 9,836 economic offence cases, including 2,591 cases  involving at least 10,000 yuan each.    During that period, the courts sentenced 7,130 accused to  various prison terms for economic offences, and 102 of them were  sentenced either to death or life imprisonment.    The 7,130 accused included one vice-minister, nine at  prefectural commissioner's level and 35 at county magistrate's  level.    Ren Jianxin, who is also secretary of the Central Political  Science and Law Committee, said that in the second half of 1994,  law-enforcement departments must speed up investigations of  major economic offences, with emphasis on embezzlers,  bribe-taking officials, swindlers in the financial sector and  smuggling.    "Leading departments of the party and government, judicial  departments, law-enforcement administrative departments and  economic administrative departments are the main targets," he  told the conference.    He also said that when there were new major economic offence  cases, especially ones involving leading officials, they would  be made public.</p>

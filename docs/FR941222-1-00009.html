The Commission's rules currently provide for the application of streamlined procedures to certain categories of Postal Service requests, such as proposals to effect mail classification changes that are experimental in character. See 39 CFR 3001.67, 3001.67a through .67d. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In appropriate instances, the Commission has also implemented streamlined procedures in the form of Special Rules of Practice adopted for individual postal rate and mail classification dockets. The proposed rulemaking contemplated by the Commission would consider suggested additions to the permanent Rules of Practice and Procedure (39 CFR Part 3001) for the purpose of streamlining the procedures employed in additional categories of postal rate and mail classification proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has also adopted streamlined procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposals to adjust rates for Express Mail service in response to a change in the market for expedited delivery services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  39 CFR 3001.57 and 3001.57a through .57c. These sections have expired by virtue of the five-year sunset provision in 39 CFR 3001.57(b). On August 15, 1994, the United States Postal Service petitioned the Commission to institute a rulemaking for the purpose of re-enacting these rules. The Commission is initiating Docket No. RM95&hyph;1 to consider the Postal Service's request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments responding to this advance notice of proposed rulemaking must be submitted on or before February 21, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments and correspondence should be sent to Charles L.

Sharfman, Legal Advisor, Postal Rate Commission, 1333 H Street, NW., Suite 300, Washington, DC 20268&hyph;0001 (telephone: 202/789&hyph;6820).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Postal Reorganization Act requires the Commission to afford the opportunity for a formal, on-the-record hearing under sections 556 and 557 of title 5 in several categories of proceedings: those involving Postal Service requests for changes in postal rates and mail classifications (39 U.S.C. 3624(a)); those involving Postal Service proposals to make a change in the nature of postal services that will generally affect service on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis (39 U.S.C. 3661(c)); and complaint proceedings under 39 U.S.C. 3662 that concern postal rate or mail classification matters. In proceedings initiated by a Postal Service request to change rates pursuant to section 3622, the Commission is obliged to transmit its recommended decision ``no later than 10 months after receiving any such request[,]'' with a narrow exception for instances of Postal Service recalcitrance. 39 U.S.C. 3624 (c)(1) and (c)(2). In order to conduct proceedings with the utmost expedition consistent with procedural fairness to the parties, section 3624(b) authorizes the Commission to adopt rules for expediting its dockets to which the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the special-purpose procedural streamlining rules cited in the Summary, the Commission has pursued expedition in its formal, on-the-record proceedings through the adoption of Special Rules of Practice and expedited procedural schedules. For example, in the recently concluded omnibus rate proceeding, Docket No. R94&hyph;1, the Commission expedited the discovery process by shortening the permanent rule's 20-day deadline for responses to 14 days. The Commission also expedited the procedural schedule by reducing the interval between oral argument in the case and the Commission's rendition of an Opinion and Recommended Decision. By these and other means, the Commission completed the R94&hyph;1 proceeding less than nine months after receiving the Postal Service's request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It must be noted that Docket No. R94&hyph;1 was not a typical omnibus rate case, in that it involved considerably less than the usual spectrum of ratemaking and mail classification issues. Nonetheless, the expedition with which the Commission succeeded in hearing and deciding the R94&hyph;1 case suggests that appropriate forms of procedural streamlining, regularized in the Commission's rules of practice, may enable similar results in future proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some forms of procedural streamlining may involve alterations in the terms of existing rules of practice. For example, replacement of the current 20-day deadline for discovery responses (see 39 CFR 3001.25(b), .26(b), .27(b)) with the 14-day interval adopted in the Special Rules of Practice in Docket No. R94&hyph;1 could serve to shorten the discovery phase of most proceedings. Similarly, conversion of oral argument before the Commission (see 39 CFR 3001.37) into an extraordinary procedure not usually employed could expedite the decisional phase of Commission proceedings under section 3624.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other avenues of expedition may require more fundamental changes in the rules of practice, including the adoption of new requirements and procedures. One model of procedural streamlining for consideration of Postal Service rate requests is contained in draft legislation introduced in the 102nd Congress. S. 946, one of four postal reform bills jointly sponsored by Senators Stevens and Pryor, would have decreased the statutory period for the Commission's consideration of Postal Service rate requests to 265 days, while introducing several mandatory procedures to facilitate an expedited proceeding. These procedures included: (1) Requiring the Postal Service to announce its intent to file a rate case between 20 and 40 days in advance, and to enhance the information the Service files annually with the Commission, to better prepare the Commission and interested parties for the actual filing; (2) requiring the Service to provide information on its current financial condition, base year costs, revenues and volumes, and other detailed information bearing on its forthcoming rate request at least 30 days before a request is filed; and (3) directing the Commission to establish the most expeditious schedule possible for discovery in such proceedings. S. 946, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. (1991); see 137 Cong. Rec. S. 5154&hyph;57 (daily ed. April 25, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to address these and other potential means of streamlining the Commission's proceedings under section 3624, consistent with procedural fairness and the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Commission encourages interested parties to address the questions listed below, although other germane comments are also welcome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What category or categories of Commission proceedings subject to the requirements of 39 U.S.C. 3624(a) should be candidates for procedural streamlining?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. What additional undertakings or obligations on the part of the United States Postal Service would be reasonable and appropriate to the more expeditious completion of such proceedings?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Which procedures currently available to parties other than the Postal Service under the Commission's rules of practice and procedure (39 CFR part 3001) for such proceedings could be curtailed or foreshortened in the interest of expedition, consistent with due process and the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued by the Commission on December 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles L.

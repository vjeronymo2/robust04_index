			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (11): Regulators breathe a little easier - Derivatives / Tracy Corrigan on the threat of restrictions In the past 10 years, innovation in the field of derivatives trading has transformed the nature of the world's financial markets. But in recent years the potential dangers associated with derivatives have attracted the glare of regulatory attention and the threat of restrictive legislation. Worrying political news in Tokyo now affects instantly financial markets around the world, and traders and institutional investors adjust their portfolios accordingly in a matter of moments. Their ability to do so results at least in part from the creation of a range of complex and not-so-complex financial instruments known as derivatives (because they derive their value from the underlying markets on which they are based). A number of other developments have facilitated the financial revolution which has brought the derivatives markets to the fore. First, the impact of the derivatives markets was exaggerated by the wave of deregulation which characterised the 1980s. As the barriers between markets, which had effectively forced investors to focus largely on their limited domestic sectors, were removed, large institutions began to focus increasingly on the investment opportunities available in new, overseas markets. The result was the creation of a far more international market place. This was also facilitated by technological developments, which gave dealers access to powerful personal computers on which they could learn of the latest economic data, calculate exposure, execute trades, and so on. But international investors quickly became wary of the pitfalls of entering new markets, the most important of which was lack of liquidity. Investors found that while they might be able to buy stock easily enough, it could prove harder to sell it, if the market turned around. Futures markets had already existed for some time in the US, but it was the foundation of Liffe (the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange) in 1982 which marked the start of European futures trading. Liffe and other European exchanges now offer a broad array of financial futures and options contracts based on Europe's main short-term interest rates, bonds and stock indices. These allow traders and investors to switch their exposure from one market to another in a matter of moments. In most of the world's securities markets, the liquidity of the futures market now substantially exceeds the liquidity of the underlying market. For example, volume in FT-SE 100 index futures on Liffe is two and a half times the stock market's turnover. This, however, has led to concern among market supervisors that derivatives are destabilising financial markets - in other words, that the tail is wagging the dog. Although accusations flew in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash and also during the turmoil in the bond markets after the US authorities raised interest rates in February, there is little in the way of concrete evidence. In fact, most studies have shown the opposite. For example, a study in December by Gary Robinson of the Bank of England on the effect of derivatives on the London stock market concluded that 'futures trading has been associated with a significant reduction in volatility - around 17 per cent'. In addition to the futures and options contracts traded on the world's futures exchanges, an over-the-counter (OTC) market in derivative instruments such as swaps has grown up. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the notional amount of OTC swaps outstanding stood at Dollars 8,500bn, at the end of 1993. It is the OTC market which has been the forum for the greatest innovation, developing exotic products such as knock-out options, which reduce the cost to the end user. Such instruments are now widely used by companies to manage risk on their treasury side, but they are not without danger. There has been a list of casualties, such as Allied-Lyons, which lost around Pounds 150m several years ago, when currency options positions went awry, and Germany's Metallgesellschaft, which had to be rescued by its banks when a trading subsidiary incurred estimated losses of Dollars 1bn on oil derivatives. Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble recently threatened legal action against Bankers Trust, after it lost Dollars 100m on swaps sold by Bankers Trust. Although the threat has so far come to nothing, the notion that banks may be marketing swaps and other tools in an irresponsible manner could prove a damaging one. These blotches of red ink have attracted considerable scrutiny from regulators, many of whom have expressed concern about the potential knock-on effects of problems in derivatives on other markets, or on the integrity of the financial system as a whole. Although a number of recent reports by regulatory authorities such as the Bank of England have adopted a fairly conciliatory tone, there are still calls for regulators to tighten up on derivatives use, or to force greater disclosure. Moves towards a tougher legislative environment in the US, where derivatives have become something of a political issue, are causing some nervousness within the industry. The industry itself has made some effort to put its house in order, by tightening standards of internal control. A report by the Group of Thirty, a financial think-tank, on derivatives in 1993 set strict guidelines. Further, US banks such as Citibank have led the way in giving fuller details of their derivatives exposure. The latest signs, though, are that restrictive legislation or regulation is likely to be averted. First, regulators are developing a greater understanding of the techniques involved in derivatives, and appear to be adapting their approach accordingly. Although the playing field is far from even, efforts are being made to move towards more consistent regulatory treatment. 'People are coming to realise that (derivatives trading techniques) are very well founded in some very sensible theory,' said Charles Taylor, executive director of the Group of Thirty, whereas banking practice has grown up around certain assumptions and has often proved rather unsatisfactory.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / US threatens Serbs with tougher bombing action: Attacks on Bihac continue despite Nato raid on airfield A war of nerves intensified between the United Nations and the Serb forces in Croatia and Bosnia yesterday as Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, threatened to follow up this week's multinational bombing raid with much tougher action. Bosnian Serb leaders vowed to exact 'painful' retribution for Monday's Nato action, which disabled the airfield at Udbina in a Serb-held part of Croatia. The exchange of threats came amid reports of fresh Serb gains in the north Bosnian enclave of Bihac, where several villages were seized from Moslem-led government troops and set ablaze. Government forces said hand-to-hand fighting had broken out in a suburb of Bihac town, a UN-protected area which occupies a small part of the enclave. In a separate incident yesterday, two British Sea Harrier aircraft were fired on by missiles over Serb-held territory during a routine patrol. Neither was hit. Mr Perry said any future operations against the rebel Serbs in Croatia would include the destruction of aircraft as well as ground installations. 'If they go in tomorrow or the next day with another bombing attack, then we'll go back and blow up their airplanes,' he said. However, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said air raids against the Serbs should not be carried out too often. He said Moscow would withdraw its own peacekeepers from Bosnia if 'massive air strikes' were launched. Monday's raid, by more than 30 aircraft from the US, the UK, France and the Netherlands, disabled the Udbina airfield, targeted ground-to-air missile systems, but deliberately avoided destroying aircraft. Bosnian Serb leaders, in close alliance with the Serbs of Croatia, yesterday warned of retaliation against the UN and Nato. Mr Radovan Karadzic, president of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb state, said: 'We are considering the possibility of retaliating. We will determine the time and the targets, doing our best to make it very painful.' General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, told the head of the UN forces in former Yugoslavia that there was no further reason for peacekeepers to be deployed in Bosnia and he could not guarantee their safety. Relief workers warned of an impending humanitarian disaster in Bihac, where 180,000 civilians cannot get emergency supplies. UN officials said the Serbs seemed bent on preventing further convoys of food reaching the area as long as the Bosnian government army went on fighting. The Serbs, in alliance with the maverick Moslem leader Mr Fikret Abdic, have subjected Bihac to a devastating counter-attack since losing ground in a government offensive last month. The UN office in Zagreb, in an unusually specific warning to the Serbs, said there could be further punitive air raids if UN peacekeepers or the town of Bihac came under fire. Any further use of ground-to-air missiles against civilian targets could also incur punitive action, it said. Reuter adds from Copenhagen: A Danish court yesterday sentenced Refic Saric, a Bosnian Moslem, to eight years in jail for torturing prisoners of war to death in a Croat-run prison camp in Bosnia last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] says it would be tragic  and scandalous if the insistence by the ANC [African National  Congress] and the National Party [NP] on a single ballot paper  destroys any hope of a peaceful and inclusive election. The  DP's chairman, Mr. Ken Andrew, said in a statement that  regional-based parties were entitled to oppose a single ballot  paper because this could seriously harm their election  prospects. Mr. Andrew said that the ANC and the NP should  realize that South Africa's future was more important than  attempts to win a few extra votes.</p>

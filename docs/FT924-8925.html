			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Norway's ruling party votes for EC application NORWAY'S ruling Labour party voted yesterday to apply to join the European Community, although the electorate remains firmly opposed to membership. The party's conference in Oslo voted 183 to 106 in favour, a smaller majority than expected. Opposition came mainly from northern delegates who said their primary source of income - fishing and farming - would be threatened by closer ties to Brussels. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, plans to deliver a fresh application for membership this by the end of the month. This would enable Norway to negotiate membership alongside Sweden and Finland, which Mrs Brundtland argues is crucial to get the best deal possible from Brussels. Norway has applied three times before for EC membership. It was blocked by France in 1960 and 1962; its third application was accepted, but the electorate rejected membership in 1972 in a bitterly divisive referendum dominated by opposition from the fishing and farming communities. The electorate would vote even more heavily against membership if a referendum took place today, according to a poll published yesterday in Dagbladet newspaper. The poll put opposition to membership at a record 55 per cent, compared with 53 per cent in October and 53.5 per cent in 1972. Only 35 per cent were in favour of joining. A new referendum is likely in 1995. Yesterday's resolution was nearly overshadowed by the decision on Friday night of Mrs Brundtland to resign as Labour's leader after almost 12 years. The timing of the decision shocked the party's 300 conference delegates into putting aside internal tensions over Europe which had started to build ahead of yesterday's vote. The party voted unanimously to appoint Mr Thorbjoern Jagland, a pro-European, to succeed Mrs Brundtland. To help win support from the north, Mrs Hill-Marta Solberg, a mayor from north Norway, was elected joint deputy leader alongside Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the leader of the Oslo Labour party contingent and son of foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg. The party's endorsement of membership in the community has swung the parliamentary balance in favour of joining. At least 100 out of 165 MPs are expected soon to vote in support of the new membership application.</p>

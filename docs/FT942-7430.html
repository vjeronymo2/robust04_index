			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee stock sales agreed as surge continues As coffee futures surged to fresh seven-year peaks in London yesterday the president of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries admitted that prices had become 'a bit exaggerated'. Robusta prices at the London Commodity exchange staged another spectacular rise, putting them 100 per cent above their level at the start of the year. The July contract reached a high of Dollars 2,480 a tonne before closing Dollars 52 up at Dollars 2,348. The New York market was also buoyant early on, the July arabica price touching 141.8 cents a pound, but in late trading it was 4.15 down at 132.5 cents. The markets shrugged off news that the ACPC had agreed to release the remaining 50 per cent of stocks held back under last October's export retention scheme. These 2m bags will be released between July and September, although some may be freed in the current quarter to meet demand. 'We have an interest in doing this in the most orderly way so as not to create problems for the market,' said Mr Rubens Antonio Barbosa, president of the association and Brazil's ambassador to Britain. He added that the timing of the release was up to individual countries, although he expected the 900,000 bags held by central American countries to come on to the market first. Mr Barbosa thought the supply shortages that, with falling consumer stocks, are underpinning prices, would last 'quite some time'. So far there were no signs that plantings would be stepped up as a result of the price rise. He stressed the bullish fundamentals for the market but added that 'the problem' was that prices were now being driven by speculative buying from hedge and investment funds. Mr Barbosa declined to be drawn on what would constitute a sensible level for the market, but pointed out that prices were still below half the levels they reached in 1986 and 1987. On Monday Mr Guy Alain-Gauze, the Ivory Coast commodities minister, told the Reuter newes agency that 'an equilibrium price' for London would be around Dollars 2,000 a tonne. The president of the ACPC, which has about 30 members representing 90 per cent of world production, has approached other producing countries such as Vietnam and Swaziland to encourage them to join. By abiding by the provisions of the export retention scheme, the ACPC, created last September, had shown it 'means business', said Mr Barbosa. 'As time goes by, I think it will be taken increasingly into consideration as a factor that will affect the market.' The two-day meeting of the organisation in London agreed to set up three groups: to promote coffee consumption, to co-ordinate production policies, and to handle organisational matters. There were no plans to raise the trigger prices that dictate when export retention stops and when stocks are released in the light of the vertiginous rise in prices, Mr Barbosa said. 'If prices drop, we'll see. We'll convene another meeting.'</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Irish coalition prepares for a short honeymoon THE coalition government which takes office in Ireland today can hope to enjoy only the briefest of honeymoon periods. The first Fianna Fail-Labour party coalition in the history of the state, it has set itself the immediate task of reversing the upward trend in unemployment figures, which indicate that almost one in five of the workforce are now without a job. How it sets about that task, with interest rates at record high levels, the punt coming under daily pressure in the foreign exchange markets, and one of the toughest budgets in years having to be prepared over coming weeks, is likely to lead to some thorough soul-searching within both parties and tough negotiations at the cabinet table. When the cabinet is announced later today, the government purse strings are expected to remain in the hands of Mr Bertie Ahern, the current finance minister. His commitment to the budgetary discipline laid out in the Maastricht treaty, necessary to keep Ireland in the fast track to monetary union within the EC, is being supported by the Labour party, as is his commitment to a 'no-devaluation' policy and to keeping the punt within the narrow band of the ERM. This implies an exchequer borrowing requirement capped in the region of 3 per cent of GDP, and the government debt/GDP ratio being reduced gradually to 60 per cent by 1999, from its present level of 94 per cent. The question of agreeing on ministerial spending targets within the broader budget framework, however, has still to be resolved. The joint programme of government, painstakingly negotiated over the past six weeks, contains commitments to create 30,000 jobs a year, to take the low-paid out of the tax net, to maintain social welfare spending at current levels, to initiate a new public housing programme and to make new investments in health, education and public transport. The programme also aims to put new government equity into the state airline, Aer Lingus, and to provide subsidies to mortgage holders and employers who are suffering from high interest rates. But the tentative figures pencilled in during the recent negotiations may have to be drastically revised, if one of the consequences of continuing to hold the line against devaluation is that commercial interest rates undergo a sharp rise this week. Banks and building societies have recently been sounding warnings that they can no longer cushion retail customers from the present wholesale money market rates. One-week funds are at present incurring interest rates in the region of 100 per cent. The most likely response of the new government would be to put in place a series of temporary interest rate subsidies. At the same time it may mount a diplomatic offensive around the EC to secure a commitment by the stronger EC central banks to sustain the punt at its present parity within the ERM. Encouragement has been drawn from the strengthening of the dollar and sterling in recent weeks, and the Bundesbank's reduction of its repurchase rate last week, which is being viewed as an indication that German interest rates as a whole might start coming down in the weeks ahead, thereby easing pressure in the ERM as a whole. If that scenario does not come about, however, Ireland's first Fianna Fail-Labour coalition is going to face some very tough and politically unpopular decisions.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Cambodia 'pact on power sharing' CAMBODIA'S former battlefield rivals will jointly control the powerful army and police force, under a power-sharing deal agreed last Friday, a senior government official said on yesterday, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. The official said the former communist government party and the royalist Funcinpec opposition, which won the UN-organised election last month, would share the key defence and interior ministries. The ruling party would surrender control of foreign affairs and finance to the royalists, the official said. Incumbent Prime Minister Hun Sen and Funcinpec leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh  - enemies through 13 years of civil war  - agreed to serve as co-chairmen of an interim government meant to rule for up to three months while the new assembly writes a constitution. The finance ministry is expected to play an increasingly important role when hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid is pumped into the war-ravaged economy.</p>

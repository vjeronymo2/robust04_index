			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (AFP)--The Chinese government  said Thursday that the release of famed dissident Wang Juntao,  sent at the weekend to the United States for medical treatment,  has nothing to do with renewing most favored nation (MFN)  trading status.    The United States is due to rule on renewing China's MFN in  June.    "The MFN status is a reciprocal and mutual beneficial  arrangement between China and the USA and should not be linked  to any issue irrelevant to it," Chinese Foreign Ministry  spokesman Wu Jianmin said in response to a question about  sending Wang to the United States.    "Because of the sickness of prisoner Wang Juntao, Chinese  judicial departments in accordance with Chinese law, permitted  him to receive medical treatment," he said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton had asked for significant  progress on human rights issues in China before renewing MFN,  which allows Chinese products easier access to US markets. The  dissident, one of the primary leaders of the crushed democracy  movement of 1989, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1991.  During detention, he contracted hepatitis and his health in  general deteriorated in recent years.    Wu refused to say whether Wang would be allowed to return to  China after recovering, saying it was up to judicial  authorities. He also said a recent visit to the United States by  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi was a  "success and will help enhance the mutual understanding between  the two countries and promote the bilateral trade and economic  ties."</p>

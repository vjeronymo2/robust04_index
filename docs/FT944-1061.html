			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Arts: Chekhov from the grass roots - Cinema VANYA ON 42ND STREET (U) Louis Malle THE SPECIALIST (15) Luis Llosa D2: THE MIGHTY DUCKS (U) Sam Weisman Just what I always wanted] people cry - or are imagined to - when they open their presents. But can we ever know what we want until we have it? Does not a truly joyous surprise consist of something that we would have wanted, if only we had known before we got it that it existed. Deep questions. So here is a deep answer and your Christmas present for 1994: Louis Malle's Vanya On 42nd Street. We never thought we wanted Chekhov like this: six or seven sub-famous actors dressed in their day clothes and shuffling around a rehearsal space in a peeling, derelict New York theatre under the gently deranged eye of avant-garde director Andre Gregory (playing himself), as he watches the run-through with a bunch of friends. Yet this workshop production ran, on and off, for four years. Only New York, with such a miracle in its midst, could have been so philistine as not to fund a full-dress commercial staging. But then that might have dissipated the magic. Witnessed by Louis Malle's casual, handheld camera, the approach of Andre Gregory - he was the title gourmet, you recall, in Malle's My Dinner With Andre - is to let Chekhov grow right up from the floorboards. After a gathering-of-the-company prelude, we watch actor Wallace Shawn (My Dinner's co-gourmet) stretch out and go to sleep in the baroquely gutted auditorium. Near him a conversation strikes up between two people: they seem to be an old nanny and a medium-young doctor. Shawn wakes up. He is Vanya. The doctor is Astrov (Larry Pyne); nanny is Nanny (Phoebe Brand); and the rest of the cast soon flower forth, with no change of costume or mimetic emphasis, from this dishevelled landfill of haphazard props, half-bits of scenery (a cloth tree, a hint of sky) and yards of unstuck auditorium stucco. Starting from the unexpected, Gregory and Malle progress to the messianically perverse. As the play unfolds in David Mamet's pithy, pitch-perfect translation, we realise that every moment is being reinvented. The prime tactic is to play against the surface message of the dialogue. 'Are you happy?' Sonya the ugly duckling stepdaughter (Brooke Smith) asks the beautiful Yelena. 'No,' says Yelena, and her face splits wide with silent, sharing laughter. This is the hilarity of an excessive familiarity with despair: it infects everyone in this household. Shawn's Vanya is a jester with the face of a capuchin monkey and the mood swings of an emotional chimpanzee. From vine to vine he leaps: purple with anger when we least expect, antic with self-mockery when the lines seem to plead for high grief. Watch him explode at that selfish sage Serebryakov (George Gaines), Yelena's grizzled bridegroom. Then watch Vanya ridicule his own ruined passion on catching Astrov clinch-deep in Yelena's arms. That languorous beauty - in many stagings a piece of interior decor with no interior - is played with dazzling intelligence by Julianne Moore (of Altman's Short Cuts). She starts with the scarified look of a beauty whose face has been stretched over an inner rack of misery. Then she adds insight to injury. This Yelena is no self-absorbed society odalisque: but a woman whose wit and awareness sculpt our own awareness of why life in this house is hell on earth. (Mainly because it could have been, and so nearly was, heaven on earth). The production is mesmeric in small scenes, apocalyptic in large. In Chekhov's plays, human beings are woven into a tapestry of intimacy designed to thwart, madden and disappoint. In Gregory's vision, this grief is made keener by constant hilarity. We realise why Chekhov called his plays 'comedies'. The big scene of the family conference - Serebryakov blithely preparing to sign away the estate, Vanya tearing his own head in two at the impudence of it - comes over like King Lear crossed with Fawlty Towers. Absurd, momentous, giddy, agonising, all-encompassing. Louis Malle films this sequence, like the whole production, the only way he could. Without vainglory, without self-imposings; instead with a subtle devotion to eight actors turning a modest, ill-equipped space into an entire world of human emotion and experience, vitalised by a stage director's creative contrariness. Utterly magical, utterly memorable. Elsewhere, Britain's Christmas lives down to its usual standard. The Specialist is two hours of Miami-set mayhem staring Sylvester Stallone. Directed by Luis Llosa, a Latin American ex-critic on secondment to Lotusland, the movie makes a simple plot seem like a Jorge Luis Borges story. Not through sophisticated overlays of metaphor or metaphysics but through sheer narrative incompetence. Just who is chasing whom? Explosives expert Stallone is enmeshed with mysterious beauty Sharon Stone who is somehow entangled with Sly's now alienated ex-crony James Woods. Meanwhile all three make life difficult for Cuban mafioso Rod Steiger. Surely unfair, this: is not Steiger's life difficult enough already? He is struggling with a Spanish accent that he seems to have won somewhere as a booby prize. 'Joo go out and joo find diss explosives ekthpert]' he hisses, or hithes, at a henchman. Later his last words over a fatal exploding locket are a choked but deafening 'Joo bastardo]]' Ah, the waterfronts and pawnbrokers of long ago. The film itself seems so foolproof on paper. Leading muscleman actor meets leading sexbomb actress with top character actors in support. But Stallone and Stone make music only with their surnames. He is a drawl, a dazed look and 200 pounds of oil-glazed muscle. She is Miss Basic Acting Talent 1990s. Watching them try to strike amorous sparks in an all-nude love scene under the shower  - clearly meant to be the erotic set-piece of the season - is like watching two porpoises try to get it on in a rainstorm. The only 'specialist' worthy of his name is Woods. He snaps, snarls, twitches: but all with such controlled wit that he seems to know the movie is a joke even while he plays it, honourably, for real. The Specialist does not open until Boxing Day. So where to send your children when they misbehave over Christmas? You have long given up sending them to their bedrooms: the places are kitted out with enough computer technology to amuse them till the year 2000. Why not send them instead to D2: The Mighty Ducks? Here they will find ordeal by ice hockey and torture by triumphalist schmaltz. For the second time around Emilio Estevez leads his little-league skaters to all-American victory. Crying, cheering, exulting: those are just some of the emotions you will experience on being allowed to leave the cinema. Sometimes it is better to read about films than to see them: for instance when you have David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary Of Film. The BDF is now out in a new updated edition and is the best of all personal-view reference books. To read Thomson's adventurist hymns to such unlikely pantheon-sharers as Bela Lugosi and Robert Bresson, Luis Bunuel and Victor Mature - or to read Thomson's no less witty demolition jobs on Madonna or Alec Baldwin - is to know that cinematic taste is not a simple matter; nor, written about like this, is it a dull one. Your perfect Christmas gift for your film-buff friend.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Shmu'el Schnitzer: "The Dream of Banishing </F> Jews from the City of Our Patriarchs"]    [Text] In the negotiations on the Oslo agreement, the  government firmly insisted that no Jewish settlement should be  uprooted during the interim period and, what is more, that the  Israeli Government will be responsible for the lives and safety  of the settlers in their homes and while driving on the roads.    It now transpires that the government firmly insisted on its  position in the negotiations, but it did not really support the  position on which it insisted. An increasing number of  ministers have been expressing themselves in favor of uprooting  settlements -- perhaps just Netzarim, but maybe the entire Qatif  Bloc. Or at least Qiryat Arba'. Or the heart of Hebron. The  name of any minister and deputy minister who respects himself is  being noted down these days on one of two fashionable lists:  wants to uproot some settlements and neighborhoods, or insists  (still) on his opposition to the uprooting of settlements.    With a society as transparent as ours, in which every view  is  immediately aired on one of many radio or television talk shows,  there can be no doubt that the PLO has been accurately taking  note of those ministers and politicians who likewise think that  the Oslo agreement was a mistake and that now is the time to  wrest better terms from Israel. It is now clear to all that the  entire PLO and half the cabinet want to uproot settlements. Can  anybody in Tunisia not seize this one-time opportunity to  squeeze concessions out of the hesitant Israeli Government?    Anyway, with our active assistance, the PLO scored a big  advantage in the negotiations. We are prepared to pursue the  talks under any condition or without any condition. The PLO, on  the other hand, must be seduced and rewarded every step of the  way. While the PLO names its price for returning to the  negotiations, we have no price. We will even go for free. And,  if the price quoted by the PLO is that we agree to do something  that quite a few in our midst are eager to do in any event, why  should we fight it and our instincts and not give it what it  wants?    Of course, we know how dangerous it is to reopen a signed  agreement and to agree to amend a key clause. After all, we  were the ones who complained that the PLO tends to renege on  promises and to define a final agreement as an Israeli draft  proposal.    In this case, however, the instinct is so strong and the  Israeli-PLO affinity is so absolute that we (or at least some of  us) believe that we really must heed the adversary's demands,  because those demands are merely the fulfillment of a dream that  we share.    I must confess that I do not quite understand the motives of  people for whom the uprooting of a Jewish settlement is not a  source of pain and anguish but rather of satisfaction. I find  the bizarre ideal of making a town in Eretz Yisra'el off-limits  to Jewish residents rather pathological. But I realize that it  is perceived as a kind of collective punishment of a large  group, as a sort of sanction against Gush Emunim and masses of  settlers who have for months been depicted as enemies of the  people and as an obstacle to the peace process.    They are an obstacle because the presence of Jews in the  Palestinian self-rule is perceived as a kind of provocation and  can in no way be compared with the presence of hundreds of  thousands of Arabs in the Jewish state.    I think one must admit that if the idea is collective  punishment, it will be very effective if it is expressed in the  uprooting of a settlement or a neighborhood. The pain will be  acute and genuine, because these people in Judaea, Samaria, and  Gaza are really attached to their land and truly believe in the  right of Jews to settle anywhere in any country in the world,  and all the more so in Eretz Yisra'el.    They will feel the hurt in their hearts and their faith, and  being banished from their homes will be an unbearable pain for  them. All this, however, does not make collective punishment  fair or just. It is an elementary rule that a person is  responsible for his own actions and cannot be held criminally  responsible for the actions of his fellow man within a group or  a nation. It is utterly inconceivable to banish people not  because of something they did but because of something done by  someone else who can no longer be reached by the arm of justice.    Collective punishment does not require incriminating  evidence  or mitigating circumstances. It convicts a person because he is  a Jew living in a city with a Muslim majority, a settler in the  midst of a community hungry for withdrawal, a simple man whose  neighbors are both evil and foolish. His indictment and his  sentence were both preordained in his identity card. Our  forefather Abraham rebelled against collective punishment when  he argued with the Lord about the fate of sinning Sodom, in  which a handful of righteous men still remained. "Wilt thou  indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?" he asked. Moses  and Aaron similarly implored the Lord not to punish Korah and  his congregation: "Shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry  with all the congregation?"    But all this belongs to the ethics of Hebrew law, and Hebrew  law is not all that popular in Israel of 1994. Now we are  concerned with calculations: 48 families in Hebron (or 28 in  Netzarim) and how many soldiers will be needed to protect them  (as if the Israeli Army had any other mission than to protect  Jews!)    In sum: Collective punishment is wrong and usually  ineffective. It is totally absurd when it does not come to serve  law and justice but rather political needs or even emotional  blackmail (I have a hard time finding a more accurate  description of what the Palestinians are hoping to gain from the  tragedy in Hebron).    It seems to me that even people who totally identify with  the  PLO's argument that the presence of Jews in a Palestinian city  is an obstacle to peace should, like me, hesitate somewhat  before deciding that a certain Jew and the members of his  household should be banished from Hebron not because of some sin  they committed but because they are Jews and, as such, are not  wanted there, or because they are settlers and, "as is known,"  every settler is a potential murderer. This sounds like a  complete repeal of all the principles of law and justice, like  an untenable injustice, and like trampling on every Jewish right  in Eretz Yisra'el. Nonetheless, that is exactly what those  ministers and Knesset members who openly side with the PLO's  demand to revise the Oslo agreement are demanding, and the first  step they envision is complementing the results of the 1929  pogrom in Hebron by expelling the Jews from homes that were  looted then and which have only recently come under Jewish  ownership again.    Jews were expelled from Spain, France, Germany, and England,  from countries, provinces, and cities, but never by a Jewish  regime and definitely not from the land of the Jews. It is a  monstrous, unconscionable, and ungodly thought.    The nightmare of a Jewish government banishing Jews from a  city in Eretz Yisra'el, of a Jewish army using such a punishment  against Jewish citizens, is seen by some people as something  desirable, as a goal that should be voiced out loud and promoted.    I ask myself: How did they get into such a blind alley of  obtuseness and self-hate? How did they become so blind that  they do not understand that one of the first victims of their  impetuous demand will be the very same peace agreement on which  they are pinning all their hopes for their future and ours?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Abu-Bakr al-Saqqaf, professor of </F> philosophy at Sanaa University and chairman of the Constituent  Assembly of the Human Rights Committee, in Yemen, by Salah  Qallab, in Amman; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Qallab] It has been claimed that the  situation will be settled militarily in the near future with the  northern forces taking control of the Aden axis. What is your  information, as you have been following the situation closely?    [Al-Saqqaf] I doubt that the situation can be settled  quickly because there is a relative balance of forces in  equipment and number of fighters. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] Sanaa says that what is taking place is an internal  affair and that is why it rejected the Arab League's initiative.  What, in your view, is the aim?    [Al-Saqqaf] Actually, the 'Imran incidents had been  escalated with the intention of liquidating and destroying the  southern 3d Brigade and preventing continuation of the  Egyptian-United Arab Emirates mediation which had reached  practical steps toward easing the military and political crisis  and paving the way for a gneral national reconciliation and a  peaceful solution for the entire crisis. It is not true at all  that the southern 3d Brigade which was in 'Imran, 60 km from  Sanaa and isolated from the southern areas, was preparing to  attack the capital, as the Presidential Council chairman  claimed. [passage omitted]    It has been proved that the attack on the Basuhayb Brigade  last Wednesday was a prelude to the bombing of Aden last  Thursday (two days later). It is clear from all these  developments that the war decision was made at the end of last  year, in December to be specific.    There are documents indicating that all this took place in  agreement with Saddam Husayn. The Yemenis noticed widespread  presence of Iraqis in the Yemeni capital Sanaa in recent months.  We have information that there is an Iraqi military advisory  center in al-Hasbah area in Sanaa, supervised by a high-ranking  Iraqi officer.    [Qallab] Do you mean that the Iraqis are participating  directly in the current battles?    [Al-Saqqaf] Yes, and we have documents proving that they  supervised the installation of missiles on the Munif mountain  (in al-Hajariyah mountain range). Furthermore, anyone who  closely examines the situation would see that the main feature  of the regime in Sanaa is modelled after the way President  Saddam Husayn Husayn structured his regime.

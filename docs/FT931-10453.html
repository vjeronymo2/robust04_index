			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Amoco narrows exploration focus  -The US oil group is ditching its 'shotgun approach' AMOCO, the Chicago-based oil company and North America's largest producer of natural gas, spent last year cutting both production and administration costs to adjust to lower world energy prices. Now the company is tackling the costs of its international exploration and development operations. .Amoco is narrowing its exploration focus. Where it once had operations in more than 100 countries, it has now reduced this number to 40. 'We had been taking something of a shotgun approach,' said Mr J. C. Burton, group vice-president in charge of international operations. 'Now we're going to focus more on bread and butter things. We've decided we can't be everywhere at once, even though we're a big company.' He said the new strategy was to prospect only in countries where the likelihood of finding reserves was high and where Amoco's competitive advantages could best be deployed. It also entailed managing the group's reserve portfolio more actively, retaining only those assets fitting in with core operations. Last month, for example, Amoco swapped its rights to offshore oil and gas holdings in the western portion of the North Sea with British Gas's offshore parcels in the southern North Sea, thereby consolidating its low-cost holdings there. Amoco is drawing back from risky frontier exploration and concentrating on proven basins where it has competitive advantage. In eastern Europe, Amoco hopes to apply the gasification techniques it developed in its New Mexico operations to Poland's well-explored coal fields. Meanwhile, political and technical expertise is being combined in talks with the Chinese on a Dollars 600m offshore production venture in the South China Sea. In addition, a long-term investment in Trinidad, where Amoco is developing two fields, paid off this year when the company gained tax concessions there, raising profits. Amoco entered the global exploration business later than most of its rivals. While it had longstanding operations in Egypt and Argentina, it did not begin its worldwide expansion programme until the mid-1980s. This meant it had to play an expensive game of catch-up. It found that many low-cost production areas had already been claimed by its competitors. It also moved into politically unstable countries, such as Somalia, and then had to abandon sites, so losing substantial investment. Mr James Murchie, oil industry analyst for Sanford Bernstein, the New York investment house, says Amoco's frantic frontier exploration boosted the cost of finding and developing reserves to more than Dollars 6 a barrel, well above the industry average of about Dollars 5. Frontier exploration is seen increasingly by the world's oil companies as an extremely risky business and Amoco's decision to pull back is in keeping with this trend. While narrowing its world reach, the bulk of Amoco's exploration and development expenditure will still be spent outside the US. The company's 1993 capital spending plan budgets Dollars 3.2bn for exploration and development, of which 70 per cent will be spent overseas. Amoco plans to drill about 50 exploration wells in 1993, 90 per cent of them at foreign sites. This contradicts the pattern of 1970, when 70 per cent of Amoco's Dollars 647m exploration expenditure was spent at home. Those mature domestic operations now generate the cash to finance Amoco's hunt for new reserves overseas. However, that hunt is behind schedule. Mr Burton admits the company has not been replacing production at industry rates over the past two years, but says the exploration cycle has to be averaged over the long term. 'We try not to get excited about a few bad years,' he says. Amoco produces the oil-equivalent of 500m barrels a year. Analysts say annual exploration and development investment of Dollars 2.5bn would be required to replace reserves, assuming the industry average cost of Dollars 5 a barrel. This year, Amoco has earmarked only about Dollars 2bn.</p>

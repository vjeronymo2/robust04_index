			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: NZ plans tougher disclosure rules THE Reserve Bank of New Zealand plans to introduce tough disclosure requirements on registered banks. Mr Don Brash, Reserve Bank governor, announcing proposed changes, said they were designed to strengthen disclosure requirements and shift the emphasis towards more market scrutiny of the banking sector through greater public disclosure. They were intended to move the central bank away from more direct supervision of the trading - or clearing - banks towards a monitoring role and enforcing the disclosure requirements. The Reserve Bank is proposing that the banks should disclose their financial positions every three months and they should provide full audited disclosures every six months. This would be to ensure that both the bank and the public were aware of any changes in their security ratios. Each bank would be required to display its credit rating in its retail branches. The minimum capital adequacy requirements under the Basle Agreement would be retained and possibly raised, though risk weightings of certain asset classes could be relaxed or abolished, Mr Brash said. The central bank wanted to avoid any suggestion that either it, or the government, was underwriting individual banks or their liabilities through the new regime. Mr Brash said he expected that the revised requirements would become law by the middle of next year after further consultations with the banks. The Reserve Bank had a responsibility to promote public confidence in the banking system by ensuring adequate financial disclosure, outlining audit requirements and enhancing the role of credit ratings. He added that the supervisory role of the central bank was limited because all but two of New Zealand's 21 banks were foreign-owned. 'Given high foreign ownership in New Zealand, no system of banking supervision in New Zealand will make a huge difference to the risk of bank failure,' Mr Brash said.</p>

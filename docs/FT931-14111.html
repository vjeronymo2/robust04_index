			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV rises and seeks Pounds 4m MR MICHAEL Buckley, chairman of SelecTV, the USM-quoted independent production company, yesterday unveiled a 61 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 287,000 for the six months to end-September. He also announced a 1-for-4 rights issue at 17p per share to raise Pounds 4.2m net. SelecTV's productions include Birds of a Feather and Lovejoy. Proceeds of the issue will be used to subscribe for Pounds 3.6m of loan notes in Meridian Broadcasting, in which SelecTV has a 15 per cent shareholding, and to assist in financing programme production. Meridian was awarded the ITV franchise for the south and south-east England in October 1991 and began transmission earlier this month. The advance in SelecTV's pre-tax profits, from Pounds 178,000 last time, was achieved on the back of a 17 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 6.38m. Administrative costs rose to Pounds 870,000 (Pounds 703,000) while other operating income declined to Pounds 110,000 (Pounds 210,000). Earnings per share emerged at 0.19p compared with 0.15p. The cash call, involving the issue of 26.99m ordinary shares, is being underwritten by Sheppards, which is also acting as broker to the issue. Mr Buckley and Mr Allan McKeown, managing director, who together own 14.8 per cent of SelecTV, do not intend to take up their rights. They and two other executive directors are to be offered options on 12m shares at 17p per share.</p>

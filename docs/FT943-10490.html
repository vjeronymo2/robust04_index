			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Posco trims year's target despite first-half advance Pohang Iron &amp; Steel (Posco), South Korea's largest steel-maker, reported an 8.2 per cent increase in net profits to Won145bn (Dollars 181m) for the first half of 1994. It lowered its profit forecast for the year to Won331bn from Won344bn in the expectation of further foreign exchange losses on yen-denominated debt, which curbed earnings during the first half. Posco, the world's second largest steel company, had a 5.6 per cent rise in sales to Won3,630bn. It expects sales of Won7,240bn for the full year. Increased demand from Korea's main industries helped maintain Posco's position as one of the world's most profitable steel companies. Profits rose due to higher steel prices and the declining cost of raw materials. But earnings fell slightly below market expectations due to the foreign exchange losses resulting from the strong yen.</p>

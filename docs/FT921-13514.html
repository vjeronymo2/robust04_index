			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Athens to freeze wages THE Greek government yesterday announced radical tax reforms, coupled with a wage freeze for public sector workers aimed at substantially reducing the public sector deficit this year, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The measures came as a shock to the public sector trade unions, which were preparing to negotiate a 6-8 per cent increase in 1992, well below the current inflation rate of 17.8 per cent. Private sector workers had already settled for a 10 per cent minimum rise under a two-year wage pact agreed in 1991. Mr Ioannis Paleocrassas, the finance minister, said the wage freeze would result in budgetary savings of Dr35bn (Pounds 106m). Greece wants to trim central government borrowing from 16 to 13 per cent of gross domestic product this year and cut inflation to 13 per cent. These targets are part of a medium-term stabilisation plan designed to ensure that Greece can enter the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system by the end of 1993.</p>

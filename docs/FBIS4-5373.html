			<p>BFN     [Text] A photograph of Kim Pyong-il, Kim Il-song's second  son (41), who assumed office as North Korean ambassador to  Finland on 18 March, was disclosed by a recent issue of the  Japanese weekly news magazine SHUKAN BUNSHUN (photograph).    The disclosure of the photograph of Kim Pyong-il, who has  been shielded from the Western press, is very unusual. The  photograph was taken as he was entering the Finnish president's  official residence to present him with his credentials.    Kim's tall 180 centimeter height, 80 kg weight, and not  excessively fat face remind one of his father, Kim Il-song, when  he was young.    In an article entitled "Kim Pyong-il, a Younger Sibling of  Successor Secretary Kim Chong-il Whom the Latter Fears Most,"  the SHUKAN BUNSHUN said: "Kim Pyong-il served as North Korean  Ambassador to Hungary in 1988, then as ambassador to Bulgaria  before being appointed as ambassador to Finland." The weekly  added: "Kim Pyong-il is treated by his brother like a person  living in exile.    The weekly noted: "He excels in his foreign language  ability, likes sports, and has an aspect of sincerity in his  characteristics. Handsome Kim Pyong-il is reported to be  enjoying far greater popularity than Kim Chong-il among the  North Korean people."    SHUKAN BUNSHUN also noted: "Kim Pyong-il graduated from Kim  Il-song University, served in the Army for ten plus several  years, and enjoys an extensively good reputation in the Army as  well." The weekly then observed: "If Kim Il-song dies, it is  quite possible that the anti-Kim Chong-il force will try to  replace Kim Chong-il with Kim Pyong-il."</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Late swing boosts Clinton's hopes of victory on Nafta AT LEAST a dozen more members of the US Congress came out in favour of the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday, leading to speculation that President Bill Clinton was within an ace of winning passage for the treaty tonight. Wall Street rose sharply to a new record on the news from Washington. Mr Clinton declared 'I feel good, we're getting there,' but some Nafta supporters tempered their enthusiasm by warning against over-confidence. The chief congressional strategist against the agreement conceded he had lost four votes but still predicted its defeat. The 434 sitting members of the House of Representatives (258 Democrats, 175 Republicans and one independent) will make the final decision tonight after eight scheduled hours of debate. A total of 218 votes will secure approval, one less defeat, because the House has no provision to break ties. The outcome is considered pivotal both for the authority of the president and for a successful conclusion of the wider Uruguay Round of trade talks by the appointed December 15 deadline. It is possible that neither side will be able to claim victory before the final tally begins. The administration, in particular, is counting on promises from Democrats still uncommitted or even leaning against approval but willing, in the crunch, to give a Democratic president his majority. An Associated Press news agency tally last night found 206 definitely in favour or so inclined and 199 likely to vote against, with 29 officially undecided. This is the first time the AP count has had the pro-Nafta forces ahead. Reflecting this apparent momentum, Mr Clinton summoned 15 pro-Nafta governors to a White House ceremony, while continuing to work the telephones nonstop. Mr David Gergen, his close adviser, went on television to speak of 'conservative estimates that we're within about a dozen votes . . . possibly closer than that'. On Capitol Hill, some Nafta supporters were less cautious. An aide to Congressman Esteban Torres , the California Democrat, said 208 votes were now certain, with 15 promises in reserve. 'We've won,' he declared. On the other side opponents claimed to have 223 sure votes. One anti-Nafta lobbyist said the margin of defeat would be kept deliberately narrow 'so as to save the president's face'. Mr Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation, accused Mr Clinton of 'abdicating party leadership' by offering support to Republicans who voted in favour of Nafta. He threatened that labour federations may withhold support in next year's elections from Democrats who vote in favour. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, complained about Mr Clinton 'wining and dining people at taxpayers' expense' on behalf of the treaty and objected to the plethora of special deals made with individual members to secure their support. 'Win it on the merits, not the pork,' she said. Most of the fresh support for Nafta yesterday came from members from wheat, vegetable, citrus and sugar producing states, all of whom have been actively courted by the White House with promises and separate agreements with Mexico. As the Washington debate raged, two opinion polls, in the Washington Post and the New York Times, found the public evenly divided on Nafta's merits, although with the suggestion that support for it has been growing.

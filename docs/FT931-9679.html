			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / MPs to probe legal-aid change THE Commons home affairs committee is to hold an urgent inquiry into the government's proposed cuts in the eligibility for legal aid. It will summon Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, to a meeting on February 23 to give evidence about the government's plans. The move follows last week's mass lobby by legal-aid lawyers, and a heated debate in the House of Lords in which Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, clashed with Lord Mackay.</p>

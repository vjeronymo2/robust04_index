			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Finmeccanica merger with Sifa approved THE merger of Finmeccanica, which controls the engineering and aerospace activities of Italy's state-owned IRI group, with Sifa, a stock market-listed holding company owned by IRI, was approved yesterday. The merged group, to be called Finmeccalica, has combined assets of L3,128bn (Dollars 2.77bn). The enlarged group hopes to obtain a bourse listing in November this year. The aim is to achieve through a subsequent share issue a nominal capitalisation of L1,638bn, of which 47 per cent of ordinary shares and 71 per cent of saving shares will be in third-party hands. The move was set in train well before the government decided 10 days ago to convert IRI, along with three other state entities, into joint stock companies in order to accelerate the privatisation process. The merger envisages a L511bn capital increase via the issue of 1,022bn shares on the basis of four ordinary Sifa shares for every nine Finmeccanica shares. Finmeccanica has net liabilities of L4,862bn. Last year, the group made a L525bn loss, in part due to the repayment of L615bn to IRI which the European Commission declared was an illegal subsidy.</p>

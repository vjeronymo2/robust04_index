According to the  Finance Ministry, profitability rose to a level clearly higher  than the long-term average. This year the profitability of  industrial enterprises will continue to improve.    Last year's improvement in profitability was fostered by the  rise in prices for export goods, and also by the drop in labor  unit costs and interest rates.    According to preliminary estimates by the ministry, the net  profits for industrial enterprises rose by 10 billion markkas  over 1992. Compared to sales, the proportion made up by net  profits rose by 2.5 percent units to a level of over 8 percent.    This year net profits will increase by 11 billion markkas,  and the share of sales consisting of net profits will increase  to 10.5 percent. The ministry estimates that the available  financial resources of industry will rise to 14 percent of sales.    Net profits are defined as that portion of money earned by a  business that can be applied in investments or for distribution  of income.    The financial condition of industry has been improved by the  fact that companies have been able to decrease their  indebtedness. The Finance Ministry predicts that the net  indebtedness of industry, in relation to sales, will decrease to  about 30 percent by the end of the year, which is on a par with  predepression levels.    The ministry expects that the improvement in financial  conditions and the lowering of interest rates will drive  industrial investments into an upswing this year. Conditions for  investments are now "better than they have been for a long  time," according to the ministry.    The price competitiveness of manufacturers improved about 60  percent in 1991-93. Two-thirds of this improvement was due to  the weakening of the markka. The remaining one-third was the  result of the rapid improvement in productivity, and the  "patient development" of a better labor cost situation.    Competitiveness will drop somewhat this year due to the  recent strengthening of the markka. Nevertheless, the  competitiveness of Finnish business will continue to be about 40  percent better than the long-term average level.  <H5>  Unemployment Will Continue To Worsen </H5>   The rapid improvement in conditions for industrial  enterprise  will not help decrease unemployment. Sixten Korkman, the head  director of the Finance Ministry's National Economy Department,  says that improvement in unemployment is dependent on the  recovery of the domestic market.    "Unemployment will continue to be at shockingly high levels  for several years because the starting level is so high," said  Korkman.    According to the ministry, the demand for labor will  continue  to decrease by more than 30,000 persons yet this year. Jobs will  be lost especially in service occupations in both the public and  private sectors.    According to the report, the proportion of those unemployed  who have been out of work for over a year will rise to one-third.    According to head director Korkman, employment might still  improve faster in this situation than in previous recessions,  because businesses have no employees in "unnecessary positions."    "Businesses have eliminated all of the positions that they  can eliminate. At the same time, productivity has risen  exceptionally fast during the recession," said Korkman.    Labor productivity, that is the ratio of production to the  work input, rose as much as 12 percent in industry last year,  which is also the same as during the previous year. The ministry  expects that industrial productivity will improve by 5.5 percent  this year.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Fastest Jaguar road car sets off DELIVERIES are beginning this week of the fastest and, at Pounds 350,000 each, the most expensive roadgoing Jaguar cars ever built. However, growing environmentalist sentiment and the difficulties some customers apparently face in paying for their cars make it almost certain that the 500-plus horsepower 212mph XJ220 is likely to be the first and last of its type to be offered under the Jaguar badge. 'We all recognise that a long-term shift is taking place in what will appeal to buyers. No one can afford to ignore the environmental issues,' according to Mr Bill Donnelly, sales and marketing director of JaguarSport, which is based at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, where the XJ220 is being built. JaguarSport, which has engineered and is producing the cars, is a 50-50 joint-venture company set up in 1988 between Jaguar - itself now owned by Ford - and Mr Tom Walkinshaw's racing organisation to develop high-performance versions of Jaguar's mainstream models as well as to undertake special projects. The XJ220, said Mr Donnelly, 'will probably turn out to be the ultimate roadgoing Jaguar. We'll take a different slant in the future; something smaller and lighter, with the emphasis very much on weight-saving.' The XJ220 plant is to be taken over by another Ford subsidiary, Aston Martin, to make a new Aston Martin model - expected to be priced below Pounds 100,000 - at a rate of 625 a year as soon as XJ220 production ends in early 1994. The car's debut could hardly be worse timed, coming when the UK and other once buoyant markets for expensive cars are still struggling to emerge from the recession, and when cars in general are being increasingly pilloried over environmental issues such as exhaust emissions, energy conservation, congestion and pedestrian safety. The XJ220 may meet all emissions standards envisaged until at least 1994, but its speed and inevitably high - but so far undisclosed - fuel consumption make it a likely focus for anti-car campaigners. JaguarSport is not alone. Several other 200mph-plus 'supercars' conceived on their creators' computer screens in the boom period of the late 1980s have also been announced in the past few weeks. They include the Pounds 530,000 McLaren F1, a car based on the Surrey racing group's grand prix technology; and the Yamaha OX99-11, a 200mph single-seater to be produced for the Japanese vehicle manufacturer at its Ypsilon Technology subsidiary at Milton Keynes. According to JaguarSport, 1,500 would-be owners applied to buy the cars, backing their orders with a Pounds 50,000, non-returnable deposit when the project was first announced in the autumn of 1989. But with the market for very expensive cars having suffered a spectacular collapse, there is growing speculation within the investment-car market about whether 'supercar' sales confidence may be misplaced. According to Mr Robert Brooks, principal of the international auction house which has sold many of the world's most valuable cars, the present investment value of virtually all 'supercars' is well below their new purchase price. 'The investment money is simply not there,' he says. 'How many cars like this can the market absorb, particularly at a time when the speculative investment buyer has gone out of the market?' Under the XJ220's order terms, options are tradable. Originally seen as offering the potential for a premium, the recession has meant some option sales have been made simply to recoup the Pounds 50,000 and escape payment of a second Pounds 50,000 instalment required before a car's construction starts. JaguarSport has yet to try and test the veracity of another speculation circulating among collectors of cars: that a few option owners looking to escape from purchase but finding difficulty in selling their options have 'sold' them to asset-less shell companies which it would be pointless for Jaguar to pursue for payment. If that is happening, said Mr Donnelly, the instalment payment system means that JaguarSport will get warning at least six months before construction of a particular car starts. 'If there are problems, it simply won't get built - at least not until another firm buyer is found,' he added. Technology, Page 12 German car industry, Page 18 BMW US sales, Page 21</p>

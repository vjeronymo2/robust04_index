			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alonso de Contreras] </F>   [Text] Santo Domingo, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The arrival of U.S.  military officers to the Dominican Republic to provide  assistance on the Haitian blockade and the alleged risk that the  crisis could be extended to the entire island has diluted the  interest over the result of the controversial elections held on  16 May, which is still pending.    Twelve U.S. military officers and civilians, all assigned to  the U.S. Army Atlantic Command [as received], arrived in the  Dominican Republic last night in response to a request made by  Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer for support in carrying out  the embargo on Haiti.    The arrival of the military officers, however, has been  criticized in numerous Dominican political and media circles.  It was described as an intervention and an attempt against  Dominican sovereignty. In addition, the principal Dominican  business and social leaders have written a letter to the UN  Security Council, the UN secretary general, the OAS secretary  general, the U.S. Congress, and the EU, in which they warn of  the danger that "poor handling" of the Haitian crisis could  destabilize both countries, which share the island of Hispaniola.    The signatories of the document, ranging from members of the  Catholic hierarchy to presidents of media and business  organizations, who did not send a copy of their letter to the  Dominican Government, ask themselves if the Haitian crisis "as  it is being handled now could destabilize the entire island of  Hispaniola, turning it into a volcano of 14 million people."    The letter, after noting the huge cultural differences  between Dominicans and Haitians, states that the 1991 military  coup in Port-au-Prince "and the subsequent embargo have  aggravated a chronic crisis, which because of poor handling  (...) threatens to break up the coexistence between the two  peoples."    The authors of the communique, after insisting that "a  deformed image of the links and relations between Dominicans and  Haitians has been presented," note that the Dominican Republic  in the last 25 years has been able to develop "a democratic  system that has allowed the holding (...) of free elections."    The document, which was distributed today to get the  signatures of Dominican citizens, says "the Haitian population  pressure, with its outgrowth of illiteracy, disease, ecological  devastation, and large scarcities, demands that the Haitian  problem be resolved with the assistance of the economically  powerful countries." The document, however, does not specify  the type of assistance required.    The Haitians "displace Dominicans from their jobs, reduce  wages, compete for land, and cause serious health problems," it  adds in obvious reference to the thousands of black laborers who  participate every year in the harvesting of sugarcane and who  receive wages lower than those given to Dominicans and even live  in "bateyes" (communities) established by government firms.    After repeating that the Haitian "tragedy" is worsening with  the UN and OAS embargo, the letter asserts that "no country,  with conditions similar to those in the Dominican Republic, is  willing to shelter the Haitians who flee from the intolerable  conditions in which they live. The massive Haitian immigration  has implications, not only of a social and economic character,  but also prompts a political situation of unforeseeable  consequences in the future of the Dominican Republic."    All observers consider the letter to be the most important  document presented by the Dominican Republic on the Haitian  issue. Diplomatically, the government has not defended this  position at the United Nations and has only done so timidly at  the OAS. The document ends with a defense of Haiti's and  Dominican Republic's sovereignty.    The letter, dated 8 June, was made public today, 24 days  after the Dominican Republic general elections concluded. The  final election results are still unknown -- although President  Balaguer leads his opponents in the provisional vote recount.  The post-electoral crisis is still visible due to the  opposition's charges of fraud. The letter also appears after  President Balaguer ordered a "blockade" of the border following  a meeting with U.S., UN, and OAS representatives on 25 May to  discuss compliance with the embargo on Haiti. According to  Washington and the international organizations, Santo Domingo  was not complying with the embargo.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Imasco sees turnround at Hardee's IMASCO, the tobacco, retailing and financial services group, is succeeding in turning round its Hardee's fast-food operation in the US after two years of poor results. Mr Purdy Crawford, chairman, said new management at Hardee's had costs under control and had caught up with the competition in key marketing areas. Hardee's is expected to record operating earnings of Dollars 100m in 1994, in line with the best years of the 1980s. Mr Crawford played down the potential impact of high loan-loss provisions by Canada Trust, Imasco's financial services subsidiary, as a result of the long recession. Overall, he said, Imasco was 'on course for a year of good earnings growth.' For the first half ending June 30, profit was equivalent to CDollars 1.21 a share, up 16 per cent from a year earlier.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To estimate the environmental benefits of the fleet program, emission inventories were generated for two cases. In the base case, the number of covered fleet LDVs and LDTs estimated to be operating in each year were all assumed to be conventional vehicles. The base case emission inventories were calculated by computing lifetime emission factors for conventional (Tier 1) vehicles using the MOBILE5a emission factor model (instead of the specialized analysis using vehicle standards developed for the proposal). Similarly, emission inventories for the covered fleet vehicles were calculated using lifetime emission factors for LEVs from MOBILE5a. The difference between the two inventories yields the emission benifit of the program in terms of NMOG and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions. The final analyis results in 1998 present value benefits of the light-duty NMOG and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions realized for the years 1998 through 2010 (using a discount rate of 7 percent) are approximately 11,720 tons and 12,119 tons, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in the proposal, since LEVs will not generally achieve CO emission reductions, potential CO inventories were determined using the number of light-duty ULEVs and ZEVs. The 1998 present value benefit of the annual CO reductions is projected to range between 93,694 tons and 120,885 tons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to combustion emission benefits, the fleet program will also realize benefits from vapor emission reductions resulting from use of CNG, LPG, and electric vehicles. Some of these benefits will be achieved by inherently low-emission vehicles (ILEVS); however, a calculation of the amount of vapor reduction attributable to ILEVs was not attempted because the purchase of these vehicles is voluntary and their numbers are very uncertain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in the proposal, vapor emission benefits of the fleet program were determined by multiplying the number of in-use CFVs projected to be operating on CNG, LPG, and electricity, by the average annual vehicle miles traveled for each class, and by the projected vapor emission reduction (grams/mile/vehicle) expected for each vehicle class. These vapor emission reductions were based on MOBILE5a evaporative emission factors in today's rule instead of MOBILE5.0 evaporative emission factors as were used in the proposal. Even though the new analysis results in lower annual emission reductions, the vapor emission benefits reported in today's rule are higher level than those in the proposal due to the use of the 7 percent discount rate. The 1998 present value benefits of the light-duty vapor emission reduction realized from the 1998 through 2000 are approximately 4,654 tons under Scenario I and 6,982 tons under Scenario II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, summing the benefits, the 1998 present value benefits of NMOG and CO emission reduction achieved by the light-duty portion of the fleet program for the years 1998 through 2010 are projected to range from 16,400 to 18,700 tons and 93,700 to 121,000 tons respectively. The NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reduction is estimated to be approximately 12,100 tons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Heavy-duty vehicles. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As in the proposal and similar to the analysis conducted for light-duty fleet vehicles, the emission benefits of heavy-duty clean-fuel fleet vehicles have been estimated by comparing total emissions from a base case to the emissions from a scenario using clean-fuel fleet vehicles. (Unlike LDVs and LDTs, EPA has not incorporated clean-fuel HDVs into MOBILE5a, and thus, HDVs were modelled in the same way as in the proposal.) The clean-fuel fleet vehicle scenario assumes that all covered fleet HDVs operate at the LEV emission level, and is used to generate emission inventories of NMHC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . CO benefits expected to be realized at the ULEV level are also summarized below (heavy-duty ZEVs are not likely to be a viable option to fleet owners at the time the fleet program begins and thus no CO benefits are expected from vehicles other than heavy-duty ULEVs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annual emission inventories of NMHC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  were generated by multiplying the number of in-use heavy-duty vehicles by the number of vehicle miles traveled and multiplying the result by the appropriate difference in emission factors. The 1998 present value benefits of the heavy-duty NMHC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reduction realized from the 1998 through 2010 are approximately 4,100 tons and 16,400 tons, respectively. The emission benefits are lower than the benefits reported in the proposal because the combined NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard was changed from the proposed 3.5 g/Bhp-hr to 3.8 g/Bhp-hr in today's final rule (See section (II)(A)(2) above). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining CO benefits, there is no reduction in the CO emission standard for heavy-duty vehicles meeting the minimum clean-fuel fleet vehicle (LEV) requirements, but gasoline ULEVs will achieve a benefit. Those vehicles operating at the ULEV level, will include a 50 percent reduction in CO emissions from their conventional or LEV counterparts. Diesel heavy-duty vehicles are not expected to generate incremental CO benefits since they currently emit below the heavy-duty ULEV standard for CO. The present value of the CO emission benefits are projected to range from 15,500 to 27,000 tons/year. Using a discount rate of 7 percent in today's rule instead of the proposed 10 percent rate, results in higher CO emission benefits than were projected in the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vapor emission benefits were projected for the replacement of gasoline-fueled HDVs by gaseous-fueled HDVs. For the years 1998 through 2010 the program yields 1998 present value vapor emission benefits of 2,700 to 4,500 tons. As with LDVs and LDTs, these vapor emission reductions were based on MOBILE5a evaporative emission factors in today's rule instead of MOBILE5.0 evaporative emission factors as were used in the proposal, and thus, the vapor emission reductions used in today's rule for HDVs are at a higher level than those emission reductions used in the proposal. (Also, using a discount rate of 7 percent instead of the proposed 10 percent rate contrubuted to the higher levels of vapor emission reductions.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, summing the benefits together, the 1998 present values of NMHC and CO emission reduction achieved by the heavy-duty portion of the fleet program for the years 1998 through 2010 are projected to range from 4,100 to 8,600 tons and to 15,500 to 27,000 tons respectively. The NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reduction is estimated to be approximately 16,400 tons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Cost Effectiveness <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described in the proposal, for both light-duty and heavy-duty portions of the fleet program, the overall cost effectiveness was determined by dividing the total 1998 present value costs of the first 12 years of the program by the associated discounted 12-year benefits. The overall cost effectiveness for LDVs is estimated to range between $4,400 and $5,800 per ton of all pollutants. The analysis suggests that the fleet program will provide a greater reduction in emissions per dollar spent if more light-duty vehicles operate on alternative fuels. The overall estimated heavy-duty cost effectiveness ranges from $580 per ton to $3,300 per ton. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

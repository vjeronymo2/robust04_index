			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Economic Viewpoint: How to live with business ethics The arrival of a new book on business ethics that has something valuable to say is such a rare event as to be worth celebrating even if it has its faults. The volume in question is Just Business by Elaine Sternberg, published today (Little, Brown, Pounds 20). The author was a lecturer in philosophy at the London School of Economics before spending 14 years as an investment banker and is now running her own con-sultancy. The reader should move quickly through the embarrassing introduction - which reads as if it were written at the behest of the publisher and tries to sell the book by promising an 'ethical decision model' that 'resolves business ethics questions whenever and wherever they arise'. The author's professed intellectual mentors are Aristotle and the late Michael Oakeshott, but her style in these early pages could not be more different from these weighty authors. She might have come clean, too, on the low value that Aristotle placed on business, instead of just a coy reference. Once into the book, the self-adulation fades and one begins to appreciate its clarity and directness. Sternberg has two theses. First, the sole task of business is to maximise the long-term value of the owners' stake by selling goods and services. It is not to exercise 'social responsibility' for crime prevention, urban decay, the education of the young or the provision of managerial advice to government. Thus she has no time for fashionable ideas such as 'stakeholder theory' in which workers, customers and suppliers count equally with shareholders. Indeed, she argues that Milton Friedman is too modest in characterising the use of a company's resources for non-profitable moral purposes as unauthorised taxation. She regards such activities as 'theft: an unjustified appropriation of the owners' property - as surely as if they had dipped their hands into the till'. Nevertheless her attitude is far removed from the 'devil take the hindmost, anything goes' attitude. For her second main thesis is to insist that everyone in business has a duty to behave ethically. The ethics show themselves in the means used to achieve business objectives, and not in deviating from them for supposedly worthwhile goals. Mercifully, she does not believe that there is a separate body of ethics applying to business and not to other spheres. For her business ethics is just the application of straightforward ethics to one complex sphere. Ethical methods involve 'ordinary decency', which she divides into honesty, fairness, refraining from coercion and physical violence, and respecting the law. By fairness she has in mind, for instance, not deliberately misleading people or building up false expectations. The ethical businessman also practises 'distributive justice'. The name could be misleading. For it does not imply taking from the rich to give to the poor, or any other of the socialist objectives. It means rewarding everyone according to the value of his or her service to the business and is very close to the economist's concept of the marginal value product. Just Business explains many business issues usually shrouded in mysticism and emotive language. For instance it made me feel at home with junk bonds for the first time. These are simply fixed-interest securities with less than investment-grade level rating. They are in themselves a borrowing instrument, which are neither good nor bad, but have acquired a bad name because of their use in certain criminal transactions. The main problems with the book are with the philosophical foundations on which human beings will always differ. Sternberg believes that ethics is an objective discipline, as knowable as physics, and the same for everyone, everywhere. She has no time for any degree of relativism or subjectivism. She also appears to believe in essentialism, namely that all activities and objects have essential natures revealed by careful definition. (This is not a word she uses, but is one coined by critics of the approach.) She has plenty of company here. For many politicians, businessmen and others believe that the height of wisdom is to 'define your terms'. All of these should take time off to read Chapter 11 of Sir Karl Popper's The Open Society and its Enemies, in which this distinguished philosopher of science refutes the idea that definition is a fundamental method of obtaining knowledge. A quarrel about whether a definition is correct or not can only lead to an empty controversy about words. Do these theoretical reservations matter for the business practitioner? Alas, they do. To take one example: Sternberg's objection to 'social responsibility' is that it misunderstands the nature of business. But suppose that law and practice are different? In Japan and parts of Europe corporate directors may be in part responsible to other 'stakeholders'; and there are non-profit making corporations in all countries. The author's response is that such corporations are not true businesses. The question at issue, however, is whether human needs are better served by maximising equity value or by the stakeholder approach. This is a matter of political economy, not definitions. The view of ethics as a body of known and invariable principles can also lead to trouble. An example is bribery. Sternberg is clear cut: it is wrong. It is so more often than many defence contractors and governments believe. But can one say on first principles that it is always wrong? The supposedly planned Soviet economy could only function through side-payments to obtain key supplies. These were second best to the more sweeping reform for which we are still waiting; but were such payments really wrong when Russian citizens were less badly fed and less badly clothed as a result? The author's biggest mistake is to say that sound ethics is nearly always good business. Honest dealing and respect for others will pay much more often than macho-practitioners suppose. Ethical conduct need not always be heroic. Nevertheless, some conflicts are unavoidable. It may be true that practices such as that of the Russian business mafia undermine the longer-term prospects for all business in that part of the world. But so long as they prevail there will be conflicts between ethical principles and the material well-being of an individual who would rather be straight. This is no different from other walks of life where right conduct may be personally costly. Finally, what is one to make of the idea of corporate ethics audits and external ethical auditors to which Sternberg gives her blessing? It is misconceived. Ethical conduct is not something like management accounting or computer systems, which experts can introduce. It involves personal choices and decisions. There is also the severely practical point that ethical consultants are unlikely to confine themselves to Sternberg's limited objectives. They are all too likely to develop into a form of thought police, promoting the fads of the hour. Busy executives who do not have time to study political economy or moral philosophy might instead take a short cut by studying as role models, as they used to in the 19th century, other businessmen whose methods and achievements they admire. Doubtless companies would be more profitable, the gross national product higher, and standards of behaviour better in a country where every manager read Just Business and took it to heart. But the book will not provide a painless tool kit for resolving moral dilemmas. Nothing will, whether in business or anywhere else. Ethics concerns personal choice: and there can be no experts in ethics in the way there can be experts in cost accountancy or mathematical logic.</p>

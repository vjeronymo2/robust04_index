			<p>BFN     [Text] About a year ago, a free trade agreement was signed  between Ukraine and Russia. However, in reality there is no  free trade. This was stated by Deputy Foreign Minister  Oleksandr Makarenko at a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry briefing.  He explained that there were 48 exceptions to the list of  Russian goods imported by Ukraine. These goods, such as energy  sources and timber, are vital to us.    The deputy minister believes that setting up a CIS economic  union, and Ukraine being an associate member of this union,  should end those discriminatory restrictions.</p>

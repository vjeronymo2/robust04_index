			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / AWD receivers to make 500 workers redundant MORE THAN 500 of the 650-strong workforce at AWD, the former Bedford trucks business put into administration last week, are being made redundant. The redundancies were announced to a mass meeting at the AWD factory at Dunstable, Bedfordshire, by joint receivers Mr Tony Thompson and Mr Roger Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. They said remaining employees would resume production tomorrow of orders in progress. Most of AWD's workers have been idle since the start of this year as a result of the prolonged recession in the UK truck market and the failure of some expected important foreign orders to materialise. Mr Thompson told the meeting: 'A review of orders and available resources has led us to conclude that the business can only afford a reduced workforce.' However, he repeated the receivers' intention of selling AWD as a going concern and said a number of 'substantial' companies had already made approaches. He said there would be a number of changes to improve AWD's financial performance. He described the moves as a 'positive step'. As recently as Novem-ber, AWD announced a Pounds 70m deal to supply 2,000 trucks to Iran which, after a Pounds 46m order from Zimbabwe, had been expected to secure its future. However, AWD made only 22 trucks in the first three months of this year, compared with 546 in the same period last year. AWD was bought from General Motors in 1987 for about Pounds 20m by Mr David Brown, a Yorkshire entrepreneur.</p>

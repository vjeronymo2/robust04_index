			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Claudio Abbado says his appointment this week as conductor of the Berlin  Philharmonic will not interfere with his post as musical director of the Vienna  State Opera. "I am profoundly honored. Naturally I accept the appointment but I  won't leave Vienna," the 56-year-old Abbado said in an interview with the Rome  newspaper Il Messaggero. Abbado, successor to the late Herbert von Karajan,  also said that he did not expect to become Berlin's chief conductor for life  like his predecessor. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adrian Hadland] </F>   [Text] Pretoria--The SA [South African] arms industry was  gearing itself for substantial gains in the export of military  and technical products to the international market, Denel  spokesman Paul Holtzhausen said yesterday. Huge overseas  interest, particularly in niche products such as the G5 and G6  cannon as well as the Roivalk [red falcon] helicopter, had seen  a steady stream of international visitors arriving in SA for  "courtesy calls", Holtzhausen said.    A delegation from France's senate commission on foreign  affairs, defence and armed forces arrived in Johannesburg  yesterday. Led by former French defence minister Yvon Bourges,  the delegation will meet Denel and Armscor [Armaments  Corporation of South Africa] representatives, as well as Defence  Minister Kobie Coetsee and other political leaders.    Also in the country is a delegation from the U.S. Department  of Defence, led by Assistant Secretary of Defence for Regional  Security Affairs Chas Freeman. A U.S. embassy spokesman said,  however, the U.S. delegation was not in SA to pursue arms  industry contacts but was more interested in ways in which the  U.S. defence department could help the development and  integration of SA's new defence force.    Until the final lifting of the UN arms embargo, possibly  soon  after the April election, contact between the SA arms industry  and the international market was limited to the strengthening of  existing ties and "making people aware of what SA has to offer,"  Holtzhausen said.    SA's representation at the Malaysian air show last December  marked the first time local arms manufactures had displayed  their wares in the lucrative Pacific Rim market. Other regions  with strong export potential included the Middle East and Europe.    Holtzhausen said Denel military-related exports represented  about 17 percent of its R[rand]2bn[billion] income for the  1993/94 financial year. Despite difficult times, the company  hoped to duplicate these figures if not surpass them in the  coming year, he said. While Denel had embarked upon an active  international marketing campaign, it also hoped to find buyers  for its commercial, mining and medical products as well as seek  out possible alliances and joint ventures.</p>

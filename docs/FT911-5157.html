			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pension fund surplus helps Rea Brothers to Pounds 1.6m REA BROTHERS, the small merchant banking group, reported pre-tax profits almost unchanged at Pounds 1.6m for 1990, after realising a pension fund surplus of Pounds 945,000. The result (compared to Pounds 1.55m for 1989) was struck after a Pounds 480,000 provision for property-related bad loans. Mr Roger Parsons, managing director, said the 1990 figures would be the last to be affected by the reorganisation which had affected the group in the past three years. The pension fund surplus was realised after the group's final salary scheme was wound up and replaced by individual money purchase schemes. The previous scheme had become uneconomical to run following the substantial slimming of staff, Mr Parsons said. The private banking and trust business in Guernsey generated all of the group's profits during the year, more than making up for a trading loss in London. Gross fee income, at Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.4m), again contributed some 40 per cent of total income, with net interest income making up the balance. Earnings per share came out at 3p (2.97p) and a recommended final dividend of 0.25p makes an unchanged total for the year of 0.5p. The group is still looking for a substantial increase in its funds under management, which currently stand at something over Pounds 100m.</p>

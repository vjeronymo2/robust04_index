			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: La Rinascente share price slide continues La Rinascente, the Italian stores group being sold indirectly by Fiat to the Ifil holding company, yesterday saw another sharp fall in its shares on the Milan stock market, accentuating Monday's 15 per cent drop. Ifil shares slipped by almost 2 per cent, to L7,385, as more investors reacted to the news that Ifil's public tender offer for Rinascente stock had been three times subscribed. Ifil, which is active in food production but has no retailing activities, announced in September it would bid for Rinascente, Italy's biggest stores group. The step came just as Fiat unveiled a big financial restructuring, including a rights issue and an offer to sell its 46.8 per cent stake in Rinascente to Fiat shareholders at L9,500 a share. Fiat's proposal received only a lukewarm response from shareholders, who bought only about 40 per cent of the stock on offer. The remainder of Fiat's stake in Rinascente's ordinary share capital went to the banks underwriting the transaction. By contrast, Ifil's subsequent offer to buy Rinascente shares at L12,500 each provoked a massive response. However, the terms were deliberately limited to 33 per cent of the retailer's ordinary shares to avoid triggering a full takeover bid under Italian stock market rules. As a result, surplus stock in Rinascente has been flooding the market, coming either from the banks which underwrote Fiat's sale or disgruntled private investors seeking to get the best price for their shares.</p>

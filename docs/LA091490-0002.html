			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDATORY STATE QUAKE INSURANCE  </P> <P> It is remarkable that the Legislature has made allowances for the provision of  over $25,000 insurance coverage for every California homeowner against  earthquake damage; all for $36 a year (Part A, Aug. 28).  </P> <P> Legislators are to be congratulated on the one hand and admonished on the  other.  </P> <P> In a state of more than 28 million, approximately 5 million are uninsured for  medical care. This includes a significant number of blue- and white-collar  workers who either choose not to or cannot find affordable medical insurance.  </P> <P> It must be clearly understood that a significant part of the high cost of  medical care for all Californians occurs as a result of the economic loss  suffered by hospitals and health-care providers in caring for those patients  who are uninsured.  </P> <P> This injustice to the health and well-being of our citizens, who predictably  will require medical care, is underscored by the compassion shown toward the  potential for damages from an earthquake that may never occur or cause serious  or significant personal and economic injuries.  </P> <P> MICHAEL H. SUKOFF, MD  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

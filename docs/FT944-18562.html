			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: BHF-Bank hit by bond market downturn BHF-Bank has announced flat operating profits for the first eight months of 1994 as a result of the downturn in world bond markets and higher risk provisions, but said recently announced restructuring plans should lead to a big rise in eventual profitability. Group operating profits totalled DM202m (Dollars 131m), a drop of 0.1 per cent on the first eight months of 1993. Compared with eight-twelfths of last year's total - the usual comparative basis at German banks - the decline was 6.4 per cent. Mr Wolfgang Strutz, the bank's senior partner, said profits on own account trading had fallen by 89 per cent using the eight-twelfths comparison, mainly as a result of write-downs in BHF's bond portfolio. Risk provisions had risen by 5.7 per cent, with the bank exposed to both the Schneider property and Procedo/Balsam factoring collapses. Growth in partial operating profits, which exclude own account trading, was 17.7 per cent; the bank gave no total. Interest rate business produced profits growth of 14 per cent, with commission income up by 2 per cent. Elaborating on the new structure, to be put in place over the next year, Mr Strutz said this should lead to 'a significant increase' in earnings per share. But the investment in new systems and people would affect the 1995 result and probably that of 1996. Compared with the 1993 return on capital of 13.4 per cent before tax, he said the bank was aiming at 20 per cent. The aim was to earn returns similar to those of other international banks. BHF is refocusing its activities to become one of Europe's leading advisory and trading banks in the next five years. BHF, in which the Allianz insurance group and DG Bank own large minority stakes, will concentrate on corporate banking, financial markets, and private banking and asset management.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Lamont soon to attack Major again Mr Norman Lamont has launched a fresh attack on Mr John Major. In an interview to be broadcast later this week the former chancellor accuses the prime minister of bowing to a media campaign to oust him from the Treasury and issues an ominous warning that he is determined to 'fight another day'. The interview, following Mr Lamont's reported description last week of the prime minister as 'weak and hopeless', was being seen at Westminster last night as a further attempt to undermine Mr Major. Mr Lamont is thought to be seeking a position of influence among Mr Major's opponents on the back benches which could be traded for a post in government after any leadership contest. In an interview on BBC Radio 4's On the Ropes programme to be broadcast on Thursday, Mr Lamont says that after the 1992 general election Mr Major offered him unequivocal backing to continue as chancellor. The prime minister also insisted that he should not resign after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. But Mr Lamont says that 'a lot of pressure' from the press prompted Mr Major to change his mind. Revealing his current feelings towards the prime minister, Mr Lamont adds: 'Tomorrow's friend is yesterday's enemy and vice versa.' He continues: 'I may have been knocked out, but I live to fight another day and I'm determined to fight another day.' 'I do want to be in the government again one day and I intend to be,' he says.</p>

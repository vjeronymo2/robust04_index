			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Changes in partnership legislation proposed PARTNERSHIPS comprising unlimited liability companies will be required to file publicly available accounts after January 1995, according to a consultative document issued by the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday. Legislation will be introduced after that date to include partnerships, limited partnerships and unlimited companies in which the members are limited companies. This will bring UK law into line with amendments to the EC's fourth and seventh company law directives. Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, who launched the consultative document, said that the changes would affect very few British partnerships because most were formed between people rather than limited companies. Most companies that form partnerships already include the partnership accounts with their own annual accounts. Those that do not will have to do so in future. If all the partner companies are abroad, the partnership may have to make its accounts available on demand at its main office. The document says there were 486,834 partnerships registered for value added tax this year, 3,193 limited partnerships and 4,000 unlimited companies. The DTI said it wanted to hear about the potential costs of compliance. Comments on the document should be received by January 22.</p>

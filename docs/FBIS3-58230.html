We continue  to believe that the conflict in Bosnia must be settled at the  negotiating table and not on the battlefield. Only the parties  can bring peace to the former Yugoslavia. Only they can agree  to lay down their arms and end the violence which for these many  months has only served to demonstrate that no side can prevail  in its pursuit of military victory.    -  ...We reaffirm our  determination to contribute to the implementation of a viable  settlement reached in good faith.    -  We denounce the violations by  the parties of the agreements they have already signed to  implement a cease-fire and to permit the unimpeded delivery of  humanitarian assistance to the victims of this terrible  conflict. This situation cannot be tolerated. We urge all the  parties to respect their agreements. We are determined to  eliminate obstacles to the accomplishment of the UNPROFOR (UN  Protection Force in former Yugoslavia) mandate. We will  continue operations to enforce the No-Fly Zone over Bosnia. We  call for the full implementation of the UN Security Council  resolutions regarding the reinforcement of UNPROFOR. We  reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of the UN Security  Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9  August 1993, to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the  strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened  areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

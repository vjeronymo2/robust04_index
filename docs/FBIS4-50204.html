			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beijing, May 17 (AFP)--Wang Dan, a leading  Chinese dissident, was arrested Tuesday by police at his  residence in the capital while being interviewed by journalists,  members of his family said.    Wang, 24, a prominent student leader during 1989  pro-democracy demonstrations, was taken from the residence by  about 10 police officers, they said, adding that no reason was  given for his arrest.    "The police told the journalists to leave the appartment  since they did not have official authorization to interview Wang  Dan," a family member told AFP by telephone.    The dissident was being interviewed by the United States'  NBC  television network, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

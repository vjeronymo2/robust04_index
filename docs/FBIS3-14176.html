Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih yesterday revealed  that  Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will  visit Sudan 31 March carrying a message from President Bill  Clinton to President 'Umar al-Bashir related to the war in  southern Sudan, human rights, the Sudanese peace negotiations,  and the issue of democracy. At a news conference held yesterday  Abu-Salih said that Albright's visit "will open the door to a  Sudanese-U.S. dialogue." He added that "the United States has  stressed to us that it is seeking to play a direct role in the  peace process in southern Sudan."    He added that his country "is now convinced that the United  States is not working to topple the government or obstruct the  peace steps." He pointed out that "there are differing views,  and the dialogue can bring the views closer." He expressed his  hope that the visit "will be positive and bring ideas for the  reorganization of Sudanese-U.S. relations with a view to  achieving peace."    AL-HAYAH has learned from Khartoum sources that Albright's  visit to Sudan will last two hours. Sudan welcomed the U.S.  State Department's statement in which the United States praised  the IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and  Development] initiative and welcomed IGADD states' commitment to  finding a peaceful settlement to the problem in southern Sudan,  urging the two conflicting parties "to seize this opportunity to  achieve a settlement."    Abu-Salih described the U.S. statement as "positive." He  said that his country "welcomes any support for peace." He  stressed that "a cease-fire should lead to peace and more  stability, not preparation for further wars and military  operations."    Asked by AL-HAYAH about the diplomatic measures his ministry  is going to take against the Ugandan Government after the  revelation that Uganda participated in the delivery of weapons  to the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, Abu-Salih declined  to specify these measures. He said his government "knows the  details of this operation, who purchased the weapons, and who  delivered them to the rebels." He added: "Despite what Uganda  did to Sudan, Sudan consents to Uganda's participation in the  IGADD negotiations being held in Nairobi."    On Sudan's refusal to include the Hala'ib issue on the  agenda  of the Arab foreign ministers meeting scheduled for Cairo 26  March, Abu-Salih said: "I hope that this will prompt the  achievement of a strategic relationship in the interests of the  Sudanese and Egyptian peoples and the Arab nation." He added  that his country "has decided not to fall into a dispute over  minor matters with the Egyptian Government." He pointed out,  however, that rising above "minor matters" does not mean "that  we abandon Hala'ib." He said that Khartoum will raise with the  Arab League the issue of the war in southern Sudan "in order to  take the right stand and secure an equation that enables the  people of Sudan to live in peace." He stressed that his  government "cannot negotiate on the issue of self-determination"  for the south, which he described as "a malicious attept to drag  the country into further infighting and fragmentation."

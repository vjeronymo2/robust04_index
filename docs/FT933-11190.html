			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Fairway Fairway Group, the USM-quoted stationery and educational supplies distributor, reported pre-tax profits ahead 63 per cent to Pounds 1.07m for the half year to June 30. The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 14m to Pounds 20.1m. However, the company said the results were not comparable with those of 1992, primarily because of the inclusion of Spectrum Marketing and Quickbond. Earnings came out at 2.38p (1.49p) per share. The interim dividend is raised to 1.1p (1p). The shares closed up 2p at 68p.</p>

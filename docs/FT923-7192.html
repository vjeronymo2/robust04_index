			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Italian volume rises as investors sell  -William Cochrane reviews trends in European equity turnover in July The summer lull notwithstanding, European stock market turnover registered at least two serious changes in trend in July, with Italy showing a gain of 39 per cent over June, and France a 25 per cent fall. Two things have to be said about swings like these: first that, especially in the case of Italy, they are happening when equity trading activity is at a very low level, by comparison with earlier years; and secondly, with a particular eye on France, that they may reflect less the establishment of a new trend than the return to an old one. Ms Marie-Christine Keith, an analyst with County NatWest, which produces the turnover figures, says the Italian figures reflect a market demoralised by the sickness of the domestic economy. Over the month the Comit index fell from 450 to 401, having plumbed a new low of 393 in the meantime. Italian banks, says Ms Keith, were sold quite heavily on their exposure to the Efim state holding company, which was declared insolvent in July; then interest rates went up, leaving an increasing awareness that the banks would be carrying heavy losses on their bond portfolios. Foreigners were selling as well as domestic investors and, as with banks, it was liquid stocks which were sold. Telecommunications companies, once the safe, or certainly the defensive, way for a foreigner to maintain representation in a vulnerable Milan equity market, were given a caning as foreign holders sold out. France, on the other hand, had seen its heaviest selling in the month before. It boasted the biggest climb in June volume as a consequence of the heavy liquidation of holdings following the Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty, and President Francois Mitter-rand's decision to call an autumn referendum for the French public to back or repudiate his EC policies. End-quarter options and window dressing at the end of the first half of the year also swelled the French figures. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Securities says the July downturn has been exaggerated by the French allegiance to the summer holiday break. 'The market,' he adds, 'is vacillating at subsistence level.' Germany, which looks as if it had a useful increase last month, has in fact been vac-illating itself in a clearly defined up and down turnover pattern since March. Switzerland, on the other hand, accelerated a decline which it began in June. Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Swiss Volksbank in Zurich says turnover is following share prices down, as well as reflecting the summer low season. This, he adds, could argue that there is less to be worried about in Switzerland than in other depressed markets  - that the Swiss inflation scenario is looking better than the German one, which the Bundesbank, clearly, is still worried about.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse              Apr       May       June       Jul          US                    1992      1992       1992      1992   dollarsbn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium           51.36     40.80      40.57     34.77        1.14 France           112.17    100.16     134.26    100.18       20.03 Germany          107.90    125.80     109.97    121.51       82.05 Italy          7,457.20  9,747.60   8,594.77  11,975.6       10.70 Netherlands       12.20     14.70      12.00     13.10        7.85 Spain            461.52    513.47     515.35    538.64        5.71 Switzerland       12.48     13.29      12.46     10.88        8.21 UK                41.17     35.35      34.05     34.32       65.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

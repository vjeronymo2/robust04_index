			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Philips delays launch of DCC PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, said yesterday it was postponing its launch of digital compact cassette, its latest audio product, from September until later in 1992, but that the equipment would be in the shops in important markets 'well before Christmas'. The company blamed the delay on minor problems during trial production of the DCC players. The delay closes the gap between the launch of DCC and Minidisc, a rival format being launched by Sony in November. Philips is counting on the new product to boost its flagging fortunes. The company said the European launch would be limited to four countries  - Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands - instead of simultaneously in all European countries. The company said the change reflected expected high demand for DCC and Philips's desire to ensure a sufficient supply of players. The changes to Philips' DCC launch were announced after the close of bourse trading in Amsterdam, where the company's shares ended the day down Fl 1 at Fl 24.50. The announcement is bound to raise speculation that DCC is in trouble. This is the second time Philips has postoned the launch of DCC. Initially consumers had expected an April launch. Philips shares fell recently after the company warned that second-quarter profits, due on August 6, would be lower because of sluggishness in the consumer electronic industry.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TRIBUTE TO OUTSTANDING ARCHITECTURE;  </P> <P> AWARDS: LOS ANGELES BUSINESS COUNCIL'S BEAUTIFICATION AWARDS HONOR NEW,  REMODELED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND LANDSCAPING.  </P> <P> A 60-year-old Wilshire Boulevard department store considered a prime example of  the Zigzag Moderne architectural style of the 1920s will receive the 1990  Landmark Award in the Los Angeles Business Council's beautification awards  program.  </P> <P> The Landmark award to the former Bullock's Wilshire building (recently renamed  I. Magnin Wilshire), at the corner of Westmoreland Avenue and Wilshire  Boulevard, honors buildings that have become a part of the historical  conservancy of the city.  </P> <P> The beautification program was begun 20 years ago by the business council. This  year's presentation luncheon will be held on April 2 at the Hotel Bel-Air.  </P> <P> Other awards pay tribute to developers, architects and contractors for  outstanding achievements in new and remodeled residential and commercial  development and landscaping.  </P> <P> Project winners in four Perpetual Awards categories are First Interstate World  Center, the Jeffrey Tamkin Award for outstanding new commercial high rise;  Venice Renaissance, the Alan Casden Award for outstanding new multifamily  residence; the Robert Bridges home, the Ray Watt Award for outstanding  single-family residence, and Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, the Kaufman &amp;  Broad Award for outstanding new public or civic project.  </P> <P> A new award given this year for Outstanding Public Interior singles out the  Home Savings of America Tower Sky Lobby in this category.  </P> <P> "Our awards program had 70 submissions this year, which represents a 25%  increase over last year," said Richard Magee of Richard Magee &amp; Associates,  chairman of the council's urban beautification committee.  </P> <P> "I believe this year's entries also reflected a higher percentage of quality  projects, which may indicate that developers are becoming more aware of the  need for quality design in a market that has become increasingly competitive."  </P> <P> Judges were Dan Dworsky, president, Dworsky Associates Architects; Lawrence R.  Moline, LRM Landscaping; Harshad Patel, president, Harshad Patel Design  Consortium, and Michael Rachlin, Rachlin &amp; Rachlin Inc. Magee served as  panel moderator.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Business Council  </P> <P> Urban Beautification Awards Program  </P> <P> Winners, 1990  </P> <P> New Commercial High Rise  </P> <P> (Jeffrey Tamkin Award)  </P> <P> First Interstate World Center  </P> <P> Owner: Maguire Thomas Partners  </P> <P> Architect: Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp; Partners  </P> <P> Contractor: Turner Construction Co.  </P> <P> New Commercial Mid Rise  </P> <P> Bamboo Plaza  </P> <P> Owner: FAMCO Investments  </P> <P> Architect: Associated Architects &amp; Planners  </P> <P> Contractor: Koll Construction Co.  </P> <P> New Commercial Low Rise  </P> <P> Columbia Savings &amp; Loan  </P> <P> Owner: Columbia Development Partners  </P> <P> Architect: Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill  </P> <P> Contractor: Koll Construction Co.  </P> <P> New Institutional Project  </P> <P> Cedars-Sinai Comprehensive Cancer Clinic  </P> <P> Owner: Salick Healthcare  </P> <P> Architect: Morphosis Architects  </P> <P> Contractor: Cal-Pac Construction  </P> <P> New Civic/Public Project  </P> <P> (Kaufman &amp; Broad Award)  </P> <P> Tillman Water Reclamation Center  </P> <P> Owner: City of Los Angeles  </P> <P> Architect: Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; Mendenhall  </P> <P> Contractor: Tutor-Saliba-Perini-Scott  </P> <P> New Multifamily Residence -- Condo  </P> <P> Cabrillo Condominiums  </P> <P> Owner: Harlan Lee &amp; Associates  </P> <P> Architect: Ted Tokio Tanaka  </P> <P> Contractor: Bernard Perloff &amp; Roger Webster  </P> <P> New Multifamily Residence-Apartment  </P> <P> (Alan Casden Award)  </P> <P> Venice Renaissance  </P> <P> Owner: Harlan Lee &amp; Associates  </P> <P> Architect: Johannes Van Tilburg &amp; Partners  </P> <P> Contractor: Harlan Lee &amp; Associates  </P> <P> New Single-Family Residence  </P> <P> (Ray Watt Award)  </P> <P> The Bridges Residence  </P> <P> Owner: Janelle and Robert Bridges  </P> <P> Architect: Robert Bridges  </P> <P> Contractor: Same  </P> <P> New Commercial Landscaping  </P> <P> Santa Monica Five Parking Structure  </P> <P> Owner: City of Beverly Hills  </P> <P> Architect: Gruen Associates  </P> <P> Landscape Architect: Peter Walker &amp; Partners  </P> <P> Contractor: Macco Constructors Inc.  </P> <P> New Public Interior  </P> <P> Home Savings of America Tower Sky Lobby  </P> <P> Owner: Ahmanson Commercial Development  </P> <P> Architect: Albert C.

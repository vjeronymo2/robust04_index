			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: MCIT calls for Pounds 70m The revival of leveraged buy-outs in the US has led Mezzanine Capital &amp; Income Trust 2001, the UK mezzanine finance trust, to seek up to Pounds 70m in new equity. The trust, to be renamed MCIT, had net assets of Pounds 66m at the end of the third quarter, and the new issue effectively doubles its size. MCIT proposes to raise up to Pounds 70m before expenses by way of a placing and open offer of up to 70m S income shares at 65p each and 70m S capital shares at 35p apiece. The shares may be subscribed for in the form of package units comprising one share of each class with an issue price per package unit of 100p. Of the issue, shares to the value of Pounds 62.5m are being placed and shares worth a further Pounds 7.5m are subject to an open offer to shareholders. Non-binding indications of interest in the placing have been received from institutions, including existing shareholders, for Pounds 62.5m. The issue is sponsored by Hambros Bank and distributed by SG Warburg. MCIT is raising money on the back of a record of returns to investors that put it up close to the top of league tables of investment trust performance. Net assets have grown from Pounds 29m to Pounds 66m since the company's launch in 1986, giving a total return on net assets of 19 per cent a year. MCIT has invested in small ventures ranging from the Great American Cookie Company to the Fannie May Candy Corporation. But MCI has found itself almost fully invested and unwilling to incur substantial debts. The trust has moved to expand its equity in response to an increase in proposals from Jordan/Zalaznick Advisers, its US investment adviser.</p>

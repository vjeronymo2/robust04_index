			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri: "Israelis and Sudanese Rebels Meet </F> Secretly on Borders with Ethiopia"]    [Text] AL-SHA'B has learned that a secret meeting was held  recently at a location close to the Sudanese-Ethiopian borders  between an Israeli delegation and a delegation of southern  Sudanese rebels.    Available information indicates that the Israeli delegation,  led by their foreign ministry's director general, discussed with  the rebels a general plan of action in European countries and  the United States designed to initiate exchanges between the  rebels and members of the Sudanese opposition abroad focusing on  ways of undermining the ruling regime in Sudan. You will recall  that the rebels recently suffered a succession of defeats at the  hands of the Sudanese Army.    During the meeting, the Israeli Foreign Ministry's secretary  general expressed Israel's willingness to give political and  military assistance to the rebels. The two parties made  arrangements for a delegation of the southern Sudanese rebels to  visit Israel.    The Israeli move comes against a backdrop of  Egyptian-Sudanese differences. According to available  information, Israel is enticing the southerners to take  advantage of these differences by declaring the secession of the  southern Sudan. Israel has promised to give major assistance to  the rebels in their struggle against the Sudanese Army.</p>

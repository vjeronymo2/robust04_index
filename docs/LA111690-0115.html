			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LET GOVERNMENT KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING  </P> <P> This is being written on Nov. 5, the day before the election. By the time this  is printed, we will know the names of our new elected officials, from water  boards to governor.  </P> <P> Regardless of the results, the promises made by the winners and the charges  made in the heat of battle, the needs of Ventura County are still present.  Gridlock, water shortages, improved educational opportunities for our children  and making government live within a budget are just some of the issues that  need to be addressed quickly.  </P> <P> While not all of the candidates I supported won, I realize that it is the  winners who will legislate. The time for hard feelings and recriminations is  over. I also hope that the winners understand they must represent all the  citizens, not just those they think supported them.  </P> <P> An officeholder has the responsibility of working on behalf of all citizens,  not just special-interest groups. The problems of Ventura County, and all of  California, are too large to leave out the needs and knowledge those who didn't  support the winners.  </P> <P> As citizens, I urge all of us to get involved. Go to public hearings, City  Council and Board of Education meetings. Meet your Assembly and state Senate  members, visit your congressman. Also, go to public forums and write letters to  the editor. If we want to clean up politics and government, if we want the  politicians to live up to their promises, they need to know we are watching.  </P> <P> STEPHEN R. FRANK  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

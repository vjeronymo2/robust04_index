			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Mortgage scheme for council tenants A SCHEME to give council tenants a new way to buy their homes was launched yesterday by Sir George Young, the housing minister. The rents-to-mortgages initiative is aimed at about 1.4m council tenants who pay full rent, as well as secure tenants of non-charitable housing associations. The scheme, previously tested in three pilot projects in 1991, allows tenants to buy their homes by making an initial payment which is less than the right-to-buy price. The rest of the cost does not have to be paid until later, with mortgage repayments based on present rent levels. Tenants paying Pounds 30 a week on a house valued at Pounds 50,000 for example, would pay two-thirds of the right-to-buy price of Pounds 30,000, based on their weekly rent. The tenant would then pay off the final third, less a further discount, when the property is sold. The campaign comes amid concerns about the position of council tenants who have bought their homes but now find it difficult to sell, or who have had problems in getting a mortgage. A report from the Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities said that local branches of banks and building societies were reluctant to lend against ex-council flats, which were not seen as generally desirable properties. Mr John Battle, Labour's housing spokesman, said the scheme would not help 'the thousands of council leaseholders who are effectively trapped in homes they cannot sell and cannot afford to renovate'. There is also anxiety about the impact of any rise in interest rates on those people targeted by the new initiative. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said that unless people were properly warned about possible increases in interest rates, then the 'rents-to-mortgages scheme could turn into a rents-to-repossessions scheme'. Shelter, the housing charity, said that with one-in-12 mortgages in arrears and 300,000 with arrears of six months or more, it was worried that low-income families could be persuaded to buy homes for which they could not maintain payments. Ms Sheila McKechnie, director, said: 'Too many people have already been encouraged to buy their council houses without realising the full costs of home ownership. 'Shelter does not want to see families exchanging a secure council tenancy for a home which later they could lose if they cannot afford a mortgage.' Sir George insisted that leaflets about the scheme gave enough warnings about the costs of home ownership, including service charges and interest rate changes. He also said that the Department of the Environment had written to banks and building societies and was confident that they would be prepared and willing to give advances. Sir George refused to set any target for judging the success of the initiative.</p>

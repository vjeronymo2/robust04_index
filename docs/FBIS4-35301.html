			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lamis al-Barghuthi] </F>   [Excerpts] Sanaa -- Yemeni Information Minister Hasan  al-Lawzi has praised Jordan's role in the Yemeni crisis. He  said that the stand adopted by Jordan --king, government and  people -- is a principled stand based on the nation's interest  in unity. [passage omitted]    On future prospects, the possibility of internationalizing  the crisis, and on Arab countries' recognition of the secession,  Dr. al-Lawzi said: I do not believe any Arab country will dare  to publicly recognize the secession. [passage omitted]    Al-Lawzi said: If some try to create problems abroad for  Yemeni unity and legitimacy then the situation will have to be  expeditiously settled in a military manner no matter the cost.  However, I have to say that there are signs of a political  solution through reaching an understanding with the unionist  elements within the Yemeni Socialist Party. This factor, in  addition to the Yemeni command's desire to avoid large numbers  of civilian casualties, postpones the military option. [passage  omitted]</p>

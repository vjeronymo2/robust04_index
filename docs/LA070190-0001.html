			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC  </P> <P> Obviously, Reichl has been to Hillhurst Avenue. How could she have left out  Duplex? The restaurant is beautiful and pleasant, the atmosphere warm and  friendly, the service excellent and, most important, the food is exquisite  (innovative but not crazy) and, surprisingly, moderately priced.  </P> <P> ANNELISE SPIRA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

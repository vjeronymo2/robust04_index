			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Vocational schooling urged for 14-year-olds: Dearing report to recommend mix of technical and academic study Schoolchildren of 14 should be able to begin vocational courses designed to keep them in full-time education until the age of 19, Sir Ron Dearing will recommend next week in his report on the national curriculum in England and Wales. Sir Ron, who was commissioned in April to review the curriculum, wants 14-year-olds to be allowed to opt for a programme of vocational education, although they would continue to study a 'core' of academic subjects, such as English, mathematics and science. Mr John Patten, education secretary, is not obliged to accept the report, but within Whitehall it was confirmed that 'this concept will not be difficult for ministers', who are already examining possibilities for implementation within a few years. A move to allow vocational courses at an earlier age than now would bring British education closer to the standard practice in continental Europe. Concern at Britain's weakness in non-academic education was heightened last week by Mr John Major, prime minister, who said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph that 'the top 15 per cent of the youngsters who come out of our schools are the equal of anything you will find anywhere in the world. The other 85 per cent frankly are not'. Officials of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, which Sir Ron chairs, stressed that the recommended reforms are aimed at the pupils 'who are deemed failures on the academic side', those about whom Mr Major is most worried. The officials say the reforms will be intended 'to deal with a major national failing which is the lack of the technical education in which Japan and Germany and our other competitors specialise'. Sir Ron's aims are 'medium-term'. The proposals are not intended to be introduced for several years. Schools would be required to build closer links with further education colleges in another development that the government would encourage. Officials said the move would raise the status of vocational education. Ministers have noticed that in some further education colleges, up to 80 per cent of candidates for the new general national vocational qualifications, aimed at pupils aged between 16 and 18, are also taking A-levels.

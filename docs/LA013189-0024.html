			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN SOUGHT IN STAGED DEATH HELD IN TEXAS  </P> <P> A man who allegedly faked his death in a Glendale doctor's office as part of a  $1.5-million insurance scam was arrested Monday in Texas, authorities said.  </P> <P> Melvin Hanson, who had been the subject of a nationwide hunt, was picked up by  U.S. Customs Service officials at the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport on suspicion of  having a forged passport, said Columbus, Ohio, Police Detective James Lanfear.  </P> <P> Hanson was jailed in Ft. Worth awaiting arraignment on a federal fugitive  warrant. He faces state charges in Ohio. Hanson is a co-founder of the  Columbus-based athletic clothing stores Just Sweats.  </P> <P> Lanfear said police believe that Hanson was returning from Acapulco, where he  went to see a plastic surgeon.  </P> <P> Hanson, 47, and his business partner, John B. Hawkins, 25, both of Ohio, have  been wanted by Ohio and California authorities since mid-1988, when it was  discovered that Hanson was alive and that Hawkins had disappeared. Hawkins also  faces a federal fugitive warrant.  </P> <P> Glendale and Los Angeles authorities launched a homicide investigation after  learning that a man who died in the Glendale office of Dr. Richard P. Boggs on  April 16 was not Hanson, but Ellis H. Greene, 32, of North Hollywood.  </P> <P> The coroner's office released the body to Hawkins after he and Boggs identified  the man as Hanson and after two of Hanson's credit cards and a photocopy of his  birth certificate were found on the body.  </P> <P> Hawkins ordered the body cremated the next day and as Hanson's beneficiary, he  collected $1 million in death benefits.  </P> <P> Boggs told police that he had known the dead man as Hanson and that the man had  been his patient for six years. He said the patient had a history of heart  problems. The coroner's office had said the cause of death was inflammation of  the heart but has since reopened its investigation.  </P> <P> Police later discovered the corpse's identity by a fingerprint comparison.  Greene, who had moved to California from Ohio, was last seen leaving a North  Hollywood bar April 15, authorities said.  </P> <P> After officials began questioning the body's identity, Hawkins fled in July  without collecting $500,000 from two other insurance companies, authorities  said. He has not been seen since.  </P> <P> Hanson and Hawkins also are accused of stealing about $2 million from Just  Sweats, which they founded in 1985. Just Sweats has filed for protection from  creditors under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws.  </P></p>

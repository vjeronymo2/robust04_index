			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, 23 May (TURAN) -- "Russian troops will not be  brought into the conflict zone since this matter will be  discussed within the framework of the CSCE. Azerbaijan did not  sign Moscow's agreement providing for the introduction of the  troops from only one country to the conflict zone," said  President Aliyev on 21 May.    As a result, the agreement, "On measures to implement the 18  Febraury protocol," proposed by Pavel Grachev and providing for  Russia's mediation in the separation of the warring parties  without the CSCE, failed.    It is now clear that Baku took advantage of the  contradictions between Russia and the CSCE in this matter.  While the U.S. State Department head for the division on the  Newly Independents States (NIS), James Collins, persuaded Andrey  Kozirev to give the troops status of an international force,  Azerbaijan's Defense Minisiter Mamedov delayed the signing of  the Russian agreement during the Moscow talks. At the same  time, the Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group, Jan Eliasson,  shuttled between Baku and Yerevan trying to convince  Ter-Petrosyan not to hurry to accept Grachev's plan.    After that it was obvious that the CSCE intends to push for  the agreement "On measures to regulate a cease-fire schedule"  and when military observers of this organization arrived in the  region, Baku said that it prefers mediation by international  forces and not only by Russia.    Such tactics on the part of Baku are of the ultimate risk  since an infuriated Pavel Grachev can teach a lesson to  President Aliyev for such "boldness."    Earlier, Azerbaijan has been punished with defeats on the  front for ignoring Moscow's interests. Presently the situation  can repeat itself. According to Azeri miltary intelligence,  recently Russian tank battalion, artillery and special  battalions have been transported from Armenia to Karabakh. At  the same time, two motor-infantry regiments of Armenia's  National Army were transported to the conflict zone as well.  The same source reports that Armenian troops have been  concentrated along the Terterskiy region direction.    Judging by all, further development of the events will  depend  upon whether the West will permit Russian troops to be  introduced into Azerbaijan.</p>

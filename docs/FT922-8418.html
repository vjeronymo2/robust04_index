			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Environment: Di Meana attacks UN over CO emissions timetable A STINGING new attack on the United Nations' dilution of the climate change convention, due to be signed at next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, was launched by Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, yesterday. Mr di Meana was speaking on the eve of today's European Commission debate on its controversial energy tax as a means of combating global warming. The EC commissioner said he was bitterly disappointed that, in order to persuade the US to sign the convention, UN drafters had put aside any binding timetable to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The EC is committed to stabilising CO emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000, and Mr Ripa di Meana believes a mixed energy and carbon tax is an essential tool to meet this target. The tax would begin as Dollars 3 on the equivalent of a barrel of oil in 1993, rising to Dollars 10 by 2000. The US, which emits nearly twice as much CO as the EC, has until recently refused to accept any emissions target and at federal level has ruled out a carbon tax. Now that Washington appears to accept an emissions target, it is holding out against a timetable to achieve it. Wide-ranging exemptions from the carbon tax are proposed in today's Commission debate, adds David Lascelles. A draft which was being circulated yesterday would empower the Commission to exempt industrial sectors which voluntarily undertook to cut their carbon dioxide emissions, as well as companies which agreed to invest an equivalent amount to the tax in measures to cut emissions or conserve energy. Individual member states could also reduce the tax or seek temporary exemption if their economies were hard pressed or if they had made substantial progress in reducing carbon dioxide. This would require unanimous approval of the Council of Ministers.</p>

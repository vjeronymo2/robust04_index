			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the NRC Staff Draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overview of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were 1685 comments from the 89 docketed letters received on the NRC staff draft. These comments were similar to those from the workshops with respect to the wide range of expressed views. Two subjects on which the commenters were in general agreement were (1) the appropriateness of the rulemaking process, and (2) the significance of not having the GEIS and the guidance documents available for review. The commenters strongly favor the enhanced participatory rulemaking process but said that the GEIS and the guidance documents are needed in order to understand the basis for the rule and how it would be implemented. The NRC staff considered these comments in the development of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary and Discussion of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Need for and Scope of Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters supported the NRC's efforts to develop radiological decommissioning standards. However, some questioned whether the NRC should defer to the EPA and suggested that the NRC await the EPA's efforts to develop these standards. Several commenters urged that the NRC reconsider and delete the exclusion of previously approved decommissioning plans from the new requirements. Others recommended retention of this exclusion and its expansion to cover decommissioning plans already in the final stages of NRC review and approval. A comment reported often was that the NRC should issue its proposed radiological criteria for final public review and comment only after the NRC has completed and issued the companion GEIS and other guidance documents needed to facilitate understanding of the proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the question of whether the NRC should let the EPA take the lead in developing radiological decommissioning standards, the NRC will have to proceed with rulemaking in any case. If EPA develops standards, the NRC will have to promulgate a regulation to implement the EPA standard. Therefore, it was jointly decided that parallel NRC/EPA efforts would be the best approach. The NRC has worked closely with the EPA and will continue to do so. As a result of this interactive cooperation, progress has been made that would have been unlikely otherwise. It is believed important that both agencies continue to work on this effort (see discussion under Item 4, Consistency and Compatibility). With respect to previously approved decommissioning plans, the Commission believes it is important to encourage licensees to take timely decommissioning actions. Accordingly, the Commission is retaining the exclusion of previously approved decommissioning plans in the new requirements and is expanding the provisions to include plans under final stages of NRC review. Regarding the need for public review of the GEIS and other guidance documents, the Commission fully agrees. The GEIS, a regulatory analysis (RA), and an NRC staff working draft regulatory guide will be issued concurrently with publication of the proposed rulemaking. The formal comment period for the rulemaking will commence with this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice. Further opportunity for enhanced public participation and comment will be provided in a workshop to be held during the latter part of the formal comment period for the proposed rule and the NRC staff draft regulatory guide. Notification of the workshop will be placed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and posted on the electronic board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Radiological Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were divided concerning whether NRC decommissioning standards should be based on the recommendations of recognized national and international bodies such as the ICRP and NCRP. Many citizen/environmental organizations continued to recommend that the NRC should require decontaminating to a level indistinguishable from background. They opposed setting any acceptable risk level or radiation dose for decommissioning because they believe that any incremental increase over background dose is unacceptable. Most industry and other commenters recommended that the decommissioning standard be based on technically supportable risk/dose criteria. Some commenters urged that the proposed level be decided only after analyzing the costs and benefits of alternative proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters objected to inclusion of a quantitative goal in the rulemaking because it could be interpreted by some as the standard that should be achieved in most cases. Other commenters agreed on inclusion of both a quantitative goal and a quantitative limit. Some want these to be lower than the levels specified_TEDEs of 3 mrem and 15 mrem per year. Many citizen/environmental organization commenters stated that, instead of specifying a numerical goal and a limit, the regulatory objective should be to reduce contamination to a level that is not distinguishable from background. Other commenters stated that doses in the range of 3 mrem to 15 mrem per year are indistinguishable from background. Most of these commenters recommended that the dose limit should be increased to a level between 25 and 100 mrem per year, or possibly higher. Reasons for recommending a higher dose limit included (1) the criteria should conform to recommendations of national and international scientific consensus organizations; (2) a cost-benefit analysis would support a higher limit; (3) the criteria should be based on scientific analyses and not based on intuitive feelings; (4) there are no practical means to demonstrate compliance with TEDEs of 3 and 15 mrem per year; and (5) efforts to comply with such levels would waste large resources in remediating small risks with no real gain in benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters recommended that the goal be dropped from the rule. Some of these commenters suggested the goal instead be incorporated into the guidance that would accompany the rule. A principal concern was that the goal would become a de facto limit. In particular, the EPA, in presenting their comments on the goal, indicated concern over the perception that the specification of any value, such as 3 mrem/yr, would be construed as the actual requirement for the decommissioning. The EPA has verbally continued to express concerns regarding the NRC staff proposal of presenting acceptable staff positions for ALARA documentation in the Regulatory Guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters requested that, because of possible failure of institutional controls, the NRC should not place a dose restriction of 100 mrem per year on sites subject to restricted release. Commenters were divided on the requirement that licensees base their estimates of greatest TEDE dose on the first 1000 years. Some stated that this time is unrealistically long while others stated that it is unrealistically short.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters compared the proposed limits of 15 mrem/y and 3 mrem/y to risk limits/goals attributed to the EPA and suggested that these comparisons are complicated by differences in scenarios for exposure used by the EPA and the NRC, and by a basic difference between a limit and a goal. A limit must always be reached. A goal is not always reached.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters requested that the NRC include alternative radiological criteria for licensees who possess radioactive materials of a kind and form not requiring extensive decontamination at the time of decommissioning. They suggested that demonstration of compliance should be possible through direct radiation measurements and not require the use of modeling and consultants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following responses are provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Appropriateness of 15 mrem/y TEDE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has considered the comments in light of information presented in the Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) and the Regulatory Analysis (RA). These studies show that residual radioactivity can be reduced to levels which will result in an annual TEDE of 15 mrem without unreasonable effort or expense for most radionuclides and most facilities. A summary of this analysis can be found in Sections 5 through 7 of the GEIS and Sections 4 and 6 of the RA. In those few cases where reducing the residual radioactivity to the levels required to comply with the 15 mrem/y TEDE limit for unrestricted use are either not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would result in net public or environmental harm, &sect;20.1405 of the proposed rule provides the licensee with the option of requesting release of the site with restrictions placed on its use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters have argued that a 15 mrem/y limit for unrestricted release is not consistent with the recommendations of the ICRP and NCRP and that the limit should be raised to as high as 100 mrem/y. The Commission believes that an additional margin of safety below 100 mrem/yr is necessary because the 100 mrem/y limit is intended to apply to doses to the public resulting from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> radiation sources (NCRP Report No. 116, Section 15; ICRP Publication 60, Section 5.5). Therefore, allocation of the entire 100 mrem/y dose to residual radioactivity from the decommissioning of a single facility would be inappropriate. Using a safety margin to limit the dose from a single source to avoid a summation of exposures approaching the dose limit is consistent with the recommendations of both the ICRP and the NCRP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Removal of Goal from the NRC staff Draft Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As formulated in the NRC staff draft rule, the goal was designed to serve two principal objectives. First, and foremost, it would clearly articulate the NRC's objective for decommissioned sites. Second, it would establish a dose level well below the limit at which licensees who have little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short lived radioisotopes) would be relieved of much of the burden of analysis associated with the ALARA requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reexamined the goal concept based on the comments received, and has concluded that having both a limit and a goal in the rule can lead to confusion concerning the Commission's intent. Therefore, in order to clarify the Commission's intent and to make it clear that 15 mrem/y TEDE is the only limit, the Commission has dropped the term ``goal'' from the rule. Instead the Commission has substituted the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, in order to clearly articulate the Commission's continued commitment to the objective for decommissioned sites, the following statement of objective has been included in &sect;20.1402 of the proposed rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The objective of decommissioning is to reduce the residual radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater, and other media at the site so that the concentration of each radionuclide that could contribute to residual radioactivity is indistinguishable from the background radiation concentration for that radionuclide. The Commission realizes that, as a practical matter, it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate that such an objective has been met. Therefore, the Commission has established a site release limit and is requiring that licensees demonstrate that the residual radioactivity at a site is as far below this limit as reasonably achievable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, in order to provide administrative relief to licensees who have little or no site contamination, the Commission has revised &sect;20.1404 of the rule to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A site will be considered acceptable for unrestricted use if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) the residual radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation results in a TEDE to the average member of the critical group that does not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) per year; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) the residual radioactivity has been reduced to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

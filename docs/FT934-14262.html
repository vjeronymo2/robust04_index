			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Arts: Machinal - Theatre Scenes of violence have been breaking out in the London theatre. There was a gratuitous act of cannibalism in Mike Leigh's It's a Great Big Shame at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, last week. More understandable, because it is an integral part of the story, is the sustained brutality in the RSC's production of Tamburlaine the Great at the Barbican. The most intriguing example, however, is Sophie Treadwell's Machinal which opened on the Royal National Theatre's Lyttelton's stage on Friday. On the face of it, this is a bold choice. Not everyone, including myself, had heard of Ms Treadwell before. She was an American journalist, part-time revolutionary who also wrote plays. Her dates are 1885-1970. The Mexican revolution, in particular, had an influence on her. Machinal, written in 1928, was her one undoubted stage success. It had a good run in New York and was shown in capitals around the world, including London and Moscow. If the title sounds almost as obscure as the author, it is because it is French, meaning 'mechanical' or 'machine-like'. And that must be one of the reasons why the National Theatre has chosen to stage it. Rarely can the RNT's mechanical resources have been deployed so extensively. The director is Stephen Daldry, who used to display his technical skills at London's tiny Gate Theatre in Notting Hill and recently showed his ability to expand with his direction of An Inspector Calls at the National. Here he cuts loose. From the flies to the orchestra pit, no part of the Lyttelton stage, which turns out to be more mobile than we had previously realised, is neglected. Whether it's tenements, offices, hospital or court, this is New York from the top to the bottom. The mechanical climax is the electric chair. For Machinal is based on a murder trial which Ms Treadwell covered as a journalist. After six years of marriage to a man she never much liked, a woman of 29, played by Fiona Shaw, kills her husband, is convicted and sentenced to death. Previously there has been some restraint, both in the staging and the writing. We do not see the murder. There is a moving scene when Ms Shaw is liberated by finding a lover (Ciaran Hinds), though it is the lover - for reasons unexplained - who turns in the decisive evidence against her. The trial scene, with all the workings of American law, is undeniably effective. Yet it is to the electrocution that the production, played without an interval, has been deliberately moving. Ms Shaw strips to put on the death-robe with some dignity. Only when it comes to the shaving of her hair does she protest. There is a final, not very illuminating, exchange with her mother, then it's the chair, flashing of lights, and that's it: end of play. Apart from showing off the RNT's technical resources and Daldry's skills as a director, with Ian MacNeil doing the work on the settings, there is another perfectly good reason for the revival: namely, curiosity value. You will not often see a piece like it. One should be more sceptical, however, about the claims in the programme notes that it is all very relevant to the present day when, it is said, women are still unfairly sentenced for killing their husbands or lovers without account being taken of how far they were provoked. As a matter of fact, the husband in Machinal (John Woodvine) may be pretty boorish, but he's not that bad. There's no excuse for doing him in. Take this modern apologia in the programme with a large pinch of salt. I also wonder whether you do counter violence by showing so much of it on stage. Some of the directing looks obsessional. As for Machinal, it's a play without hope. In repertory, Lyttelton Theatre, (071 928 2252)</p>

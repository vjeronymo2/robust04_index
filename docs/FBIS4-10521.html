			<p>BFN     [Text] The cuts in the electric power supply currently  occurring in Cuba are caused, basically, by difficulties in the  nation's thermoelectric plants' generating capacity. Over half  of the nation's 3,132 megawatts of generating capacity is  produced by thermoelectric plants of Soviet or Czechoslovak  manufacture. The Santa Cruz del Norte and Mariel plants, as well  as the Rente plant in Santiago de Cuba, came from the Soviet  Union; the 10 de Octubre plant in Nuevitas, which has a  generating capacity of 330 megawatts, was made in  Czechoslovakia. This means that our country has not received  parts for that equipment since 1990, which has had an influence  on the difficulties being encountered with power plants.    Today, the electric system's generating availability  averages  50 percent, while under normal conditions it once reached over  70 percent -- for, because of maintenance and breakdowns, no  plant operates at 100 percent of installed capacity. This year,  the power plant maintenance program has available resources that  allow it to perform maintenance aimed at gradually recovering  generating capacity. It is undoubtedly important to be able to  count on Cuban oil, which since last year has been guaranteeing  approximately 30 percent of the fuel earmarked for generating  electric power. Cuban crude is burned only in the Maximo Gomez  plant in Mariel, the Rente plant in Santiago de Cuba, the Santa  Cruz del Norte plant in Havana, and the Jose Marti plant in  Matanzas.    The problems of electric power service due to a lack of  generating capacity are going to diminish progressively through  the efforts of that sector's workers in maintenance tasks,  supported by the construction workers of certain provinces. By  carrying out the maintenance program planned for this year, and  completing two new generating units early next year, there will  also be a gradual recovery -- toward normal levels -- in the  availability of the (?fuel ration). One of these new units will  be the 200-megawatt Felton unit in Holguin Province; the other,  the 100-megawatt unit at the Santa Cruz del Norte power plant in  Havana. All this will benefit the national electric power grid,  as will the entering on line next May of two units currently  undergoing maintenance.</p>

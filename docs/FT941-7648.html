			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Plutonium plan may be suspended The Japanese government, currently re-evaluating its nuclear policy, is likely to suspend development of its controversial plutonium recycling programme. The decision is expected to be announced in June by the country's Atomic Energy Commission, which has been assessing Japan's long-term nuclear policy for the past 18 months. The review would include delaying construction of a prototype fast breeder reactor using plutonium as fuel and the launch of a plutonium processing plant. It is a drastic change in stance by the Japanese government, which has staunchly stood by its ambitious nuclear programme formulated in the 1950s. Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi, director in charge of Japan's nuclear policy at the Science and Technology Agency, cited technical difficulties for the delay, and said it had not abandoned its goal of becoming completely energy self-sufficient through recycling nuclear fuel. The shift comes amid mounting international criticism over its plutonium recycling policy, stemming from concerns of nuclear proliferation and the world's current excess supply of plutonium. It also poses questions for Thorp, the UK plutonium reprocessing plant owned by British Nuclear Fuels. Japanese electric utilities are Thorp's largest clients and have shipped 2,300 tonnes of used nuclear fuel to Sellafield to be processed.</p>

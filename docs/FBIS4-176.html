			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>   Natal State of Emergency -- As troops are "settling into  their new postings in Natal and kwaZulu," one man stands "at the  center of the drama:" kwaZulu Chief Minister Buthelezi, an  editorial in the Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 2-3  April on page 8 notes. Believing his "continued brinksmanship"  would eventaully gain what he wanted, Buthelezi ignord a  "lifeline from President de Klerk," allowing late registration  for the election. With the "crumbling of the Freedom Alliance  Buthelezi became increasingly isolated and desperate" and "with  the apparent complicity of his king" he opened an "ethnic  Pandora's box," attempting to "terrify Zulus in his kraal with  talk of `ethnic cleansing' and `obliteration.'" As a result, the  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters on the ground "reacted  with predictable militancy" and "just as predictably blood  flowed." "It is an indication of the severity of the crisis"  that de Klerk declared a state of emergency as "he must have  been aware such a step would mean loss of conservative votes."  Buthelezi is "left with a stark chioce -- to order a futile last  stand, or finally face reality and order his administration to  co-operate with the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission.]"  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Natal State of Emergency -- An editorial in Johannesburg  SUNDAY TIMES in English on 3 April on page 20 states the  "declaration of a full state of emergency in kwaZula-Natal  smacks of expedience, perhaps panic. It is in any case an  unseemly way for the new South Africa to be born." While the  "slaughter between Inkatha supporters and the ANC is of course a  matter of desperate concern," "South Africa's problems are not  caused in the first instance by the lack of law: this country  has been bowed through decades by a surfeit of laws." The state  of emergency is "open-ended, not subject to review," "it invites  perpetuation." "The one truly remarkable thing about the  adoption of this state of emergency is the alacrity with which  the ANC has joined the National Party in defending these  undemocratic measures on the basis that they protect democracy."  There is "one small gesture which would go some way to  ameliorating suspicion. Amend the emergency regulations to build  in an immediate review facility which would allow an  authoritative body -- why not the Independent Electoral  Commission -- to scrap the emergency when a visible and  pre-determined level of peace is established."  <H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>   Natal State of Emergency -- "At long last, the Transitional  Executive Council (TEC) has heard the cries of the people of  Natal, and has responded," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY  NATION in English on 3 April on page 6 notes. "We are convinced"  that this state of emergency is "directed at those who have been  causing deaths and sufferings -- and are keen to continue doing  so -- in the Natal/KwaZulu province." "It will give the security  forces the powers they needed all along to act against  para-military training which has been boastingly shown in our  television screens. We mean the training of Inkatha's  Self-Protection Units, the Boer Command's and also the ANC's  Self-Defence Units. We also hope that Inkatha and rightwing  leaders' war talk amd threats of civil war will come under  serious scrunity from this state of emergency." "Surely, if it  is a state of emergency that is needed to end all these things,  then the principle that a state of emergency is necessarily a  wrong thing does not apply in this case. We, however, need to  caution the security forces against over-stepping their mark and  make this state of emergency yet another licence to curtail  civil liberties. We hope that the TEC, in particular, will place  its sharp eye on the men and women that will enforce the state  of emergency so as to prevent abuses from taking place."</p>

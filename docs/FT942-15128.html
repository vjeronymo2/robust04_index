			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors eye Ghana's gold - Ashanti's float Ashanti, one of the world's largest and richest gold mines, comes to market next week. It is a top operation in terms of production, mine life and cost structure and, at the expected price of Dollars 20 a share, Ashanti Goldfields Company is valued at Dollars 1.67bn. This figure was reached by comparing Ashanti, Ghana's biggest gold group, with major producers in Australia, North America and South Africa. The important measurement was how much gold in the ground, in the form of reserves, you get for your money. Ashanti's prospective market capitalisation puts a price of Dollars 92 an ounce on its 18m ounces of reserves, so it is being ranked below the Australians and North Americans but above the South Africans (which it resembles most closely). You pay an average of Dollars 160 an ounce for North American gold in the ground and Dollars 140 for Australian - but only Dollars 50 for a South African ounce. Is Ghana really that much better a political risk than South Africa? The Ghanaian government's sale of 25 per cent of Ashanti, one of the central planks of its privatisation programme, is by no means popular with everyone locally and has already been challenged - unsuccessfully, so far - in the courts. There are other risks. Any investment in a gold producer is a bet on the price. And while Ashanti is one of the lowest-cost producers, a falling price would inhibit its ability to fund capital investment and to pay dividends. Ashanti also will rely heavily for future gold production on a process called bacterial oxidation: in crude terms, bugs eat into the ore to release the metal. This process is relatively new to the gold industry and has never before been used on such a big scale. Some potential investors could baulk at putting money into a company in which Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate now undergoing a management shake-up, is a major shareholder and manager. Lonrho's 45 per cent stake will be cut to 43.1 per cent. Trevor Steel of the Mercury Gold and General fund, the top performer in its sector last year, pointed out recently that the Ashanti float had put the spotlight on Ghanaian gold and resulted in a re-rating of smaller companies there. Even so, it was still possible to buy Australia's Golden Shamrock for Dollars 53 an ounce of gold in the ground, and Pioneer Group for Dollars 35. Nevertheless, there remains great enthusiasm for Ashanti. Lindsey Falconer, at Ord Minnett, says: 'Emerging market funds will be interested in the shares and Ashanti will be eligible for immediate inclusion in the new Financial Times gold index. Assuming a price of Dollars 20 a share or less, we expect good performance from the shares after listing.' The mechanics of the issue are complex and only 5 per cent has been allocated for private investors. The two intermediaries involved closed their books yesterday.</p>

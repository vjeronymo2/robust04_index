			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Interim solution for Treuhand Sir, Your article 'So much to do, so little time' (April 9) mirrors precisely the fundamental problem of managing change. David Goodhart's report on the Treuhand's fear that lack of appropriate management resource could lead to wastage of money on a massive scale echoes the gap being experienced by many more developed commercial and industrial organisations. Their recourse has been to interim management. For a long time the concept of short-term executives has been one of a stop-gap solution. That this is no longer the case is a tribute to the high-level experienced people from all over Europe who are prepared to roll up their sleeves, tackle a specific assignment, achieve significant results and move on to the next project, adding value through their business skills, motivation, and lack of emotional excess baggage. If the Treuhand wishes to attract the type of manager who will enjoy the challenge of participation in the resurrection of a market economy, the interim management route is an obvious solution.

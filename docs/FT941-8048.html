			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Secrets act trial resumes The trial of five men charged with breaking Singapore's official secrets act by disclosing a government economic growth figure before it was officially released resumed yesterday, with the defence presenting its case. The five, two financial journalists and three local economists, are accused of colluding in the disclosure of the 4.6 per cent second-quarter growth figure for 1992 which was published in the Singapore Business Times newspaper. Among the accused are Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of the Business Times, and Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank. The trial, which ran for 26 days last year before being adjourned, has greatly interested Singapore's financial community. The judge has given the defence five weeks to present its case. If found guilty, the five accused face a maximum two years' jail or a SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 860) fine or both. They are on bail of SDollars 5,000 each.</p>

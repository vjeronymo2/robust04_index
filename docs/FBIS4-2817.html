			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry said here today he expected Serbs and  Muslims in Bosnia to return to the negotiating table.    "That is our objective, that's the U.N. objective to see  that  cessation negotiated," Perry told ABC's program "Good Morning  America."    U.S. F-16 fighter planes carried out air strikes against  Serbian positions near the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde on  Sunday [10 April] and Monday.    "We have to wait for a day or two to see what the Serbs'  next  action is," he noted, "if they start the shelling again, it is  very likely that the United Nations will call for more air  strikes and NATO will deliver those air strikes."    The United Nations has proclaimed that Gorazde is a safe  haven and has put U.N. forces in there.    If the Serbs begin shelling at Gorazde again, Perry  stressed,  "the U.N. can invoke close air support to protect the U.N.  forces."    Russia has denounced NATO air attacks against Bosnian Serbs  and threatened to delay joining the NATO's partnership for peace.    Perry said that "I think the timing of their joining is not  so important as the fact of joining."    He also said it is not necessary to consult with Russia on  whether the U.N. should call for this strike because Russia  agreed the U.N. resolution which allowed for the U.N. to call  the strikes.    "So the United Nations' responsibility at that point was  simply to invoke the action when it happened," he said, "you  cannot have consultation in the middle of a close air support  operation."    Asked what is the biggest national security problem for the  United States, Perry said that "over the long term, the greatest  problem, potential problem, is with Russia."    "If the reform movement should fail in Russia," the  secretary  claimed, "this would be a great catastrophe not only for Russia  but for the whole world and for the United States security."</p>

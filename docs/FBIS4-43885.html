			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  (Free Democratic Party of Germany) has also welcomed the Russian  decision to join the Partnership for Peace. The agreement to  build partnership relations with Russia, which has now been  made, is an important building block in the efforts to establish  cooperative security structures for all of Europe, Kinkel said  in Bonn. The goal is to interlace closely the existing  institutions and structures. In a network of relations, all  institutions -- NATO just as the CSCE, Western European Union,  and European Union -- can contribute their respective, very own  advantages, the minister said.</p>

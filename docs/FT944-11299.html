			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Deutsche Bank braced for battle Deutsche Bank will mount a legal challenge to any move by the German government to force it to reduce its equity holdings in companies without tax relief, according to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche's managing board. Mr Kopper said that Deutsche would take its case to the Federal Constitutional Court if political objections to the level of its holdings - which surfaced in Germany's recent election campaign - resulted in legal curbs. He said in an interview with the Financial Times that such a move would constitute expropriation of assets. 'Why should a citizen of this country be forced to divest some of his assets and share the proceeds with the government?' he said. Its holdings, including 24.4 per cent of Daimler-Benz, the vehicle and aerospace group, have a market value of DM25bn (Pounds 10.2bn). The proceeds from sales would be subject to taxes of around 60 per cent on realised capital gains. 'If we were forced to sell off, and that would mean paying taxes on unrealised gains, we would think that was definitely unconstitutional,' said Mr Kopper. He said he believed this point was so clear that no such law would be passed. Before October's election, the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) proposed a law requiring banks to cut industrial holdings. It is likely to be reintroduced in the next session, but with little chance of success. However, some members of the Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior party in the Bonn coalition, also support a reduction and political debate about banks' influence on industry continues. Among other companies in which Deutsche Bank has significant stakes are Allianz, Europe's largest insurance group (10 per cent), Continental, tyres (10.5 per cent) and Philipp Holzmann, construction (25.9 per cent). Deutsche has a policy of trying to reduce its larger equity stakes - many of which were acquired in debt-for-equity swaps when the companies concerned were in trouble - in order to diversify its industrial portfolio. Mr Kopper said that the bank wanted to keep its portfolio at the same size, but would be interested in buying holdings outside Germany, particularly in other European countries. Although bank shareholdings account for less than 1 per cent of all quoted German companies' market capitalisation, the high visibility of some stakes has led to adverse publicity. As the holdings were mostly acquired many years ago, their valuation in the balance sheet is well below market levels. 'Their book value is low, and the yield that they generate is very good as a stabilising factor in our profit and loss account,' Mr Kopper said. Rebuilding a reputation, Page 19</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Izetbegovic calls for rejection of peace plan BOSNIAN President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday told his war-time assembly that the Geneva peace plan should be rejected in its current form but left the door open for a settlement by adding that the proposal could serve as a basis for further negotiations. The announcement came as Bosnian Serb leaders sought to persuade their own assembly to accept the peace plan, ahead of a resumption of the peace talks, scheduled to start in Geneva on Monday. As members of the Moslem-led Bosnian parliament, army and community gathered in Sarajevo's shell-scarred Holiday Inn, Mr Izetbegovic said he wished to continue the Geneva talks, but he reiterated opposition to the plan's failure to reverse 'ethnic cleansing'. Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, insisted that his land-locked republic must receive access to Neum, a fishing village on the Adriatic coast currently under Croat control, adding that his government would also need strong guarantees of international support before fully endorsing the plan. The map, put forward last week by international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, gives the Serbs much of eastern Bosnia, which was mostly Moslem before the war, leaving the government control over three enclaves proclaimed UN 'safe areas'. The Bosnian assembly announced it would postpone its vote until today, apparently waiting for the results of the Serb 'parliament' meeting just 10 miles away in Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold. In an aim to push the plan through their assembly, Bosnian Serb leaders held their second day of closed meetings. They were expected to respond with a provisional 'yes'. Bosnian Croat deputies are due to cast their vote today after meetings in Grude, western Hercegovina, which borders Croatia. A United Nations aid convoy to the besieged southern Bosnian town of Mostar remained trapped for a second day yesterday, after Moslem demonstrators refused to let the convoy leave the city. The Moslems, who had been trapped in the eastern sections of the city for more than two months by fierce fighting between the Moslem-led Bosnian army and Croat forces, said they feared that if the UN left the Croats would launch a new assault on the town. Meanwhile, in a bid to keep pace with astronomical inflation, the National Bank of Yugoslavia yesterday issued a Dinar 1bn banknote - worth a mere USDollars 3 at the current exchange rate of 330m dinars to the dollar. Mr Sali Berisha, the president of Albania, yesterday condemned recent killings along the border of Albania and Macedonia and called on Macedonia to protect the rights of the ethnic Albanian minorities living there.</p>

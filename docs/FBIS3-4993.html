			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Our conclusion is that North Korea's Kim Chong-il  places his utmost trust in the combatant troops of the Korean  Workers Party (WPK) Operations Department, above all, among his  political power support groups in order to solidify his own  power base.    Based on the overall analysis of testimonies given by  defectors from the north, we conclude that various North Korean  military and government agencies perceive that Kim Chong-il  places his utmost trust in the Party Operations Department as he  recently issued his guideline to WPK Operations Department  stating, "The soldiers who would defend the Party even to the  very end and prevent any rebellion are the combatant troops of  the WPK Liaison Offices," and instructed massive reinforcement  of treatment and training of the combatant troops.    Specically, Kim Chong-il, at every possible opportunity,  takes an inspection tour of the Party Operations Department,  gives the combatants his highest praise, and expresses his trust  in them saying, "The fighting spirit and the training of the  Party Operations Department combatants are superior to those of  any other units and the operational capability of them, though  small in number, exceeds that of a People's Army Corps strength."    The reason for Kim Chong-il's trust in the concern for the  Party Operations Department combatants is because the unit's  mission, which ordinarily is to guide and guard North Korean  espionage agents to and from South Korea, would instantly become  a special mission to crush any such element in case of an  internal coup d'etat within the power structure or an appearance  of threat to the regime's life.    In other words, Kim Chong-il, fearing plots of coup d'etat  within the Ministry of People's Armed Forces and the General  Gerard Bureau, is nurturing the Party Operations Department  combatants to be his most trustworthy power center to be his  personal guards and to check against those other agencies.  Facts supporting this analysis are that O Kuk-yol (a general)  who was discharged from the position of Chief of the Armed  Forces General Staff in February of 1988 became Director of WPK  Operations Department and commands the troops of the department  and that the emphasis of training for the department combatants  has shifted, after Kim Chong-il's instructions on "maintaining  the capability of riot control," to maintenance of the system  and the capability for execution of conventional warfare, from  the past unconventional type training designed for operations  against the south.    O Kuk-yol is the son of O Chung-hap, a partisan associate of  Kim Il-song's, who acted as the top military assistant with Kim  Chong-il's total trust having successfully led the effort to  eliminate Yi Yong-mu, chief of the Armed Forces General  Political Bureau, who resisted Kim Chong-il's being selected as  the successor in the mid-70's, but was discharged from the  position of chief of the Armed Forces General Staff because of  his conflict with O Chin-u, minister of the People's Armed  Forces.    During the period of semi-state of war declared by North  Korea in March to counter the "U.S.-South Korea combined  excerise: Team Spirit `93," combatants of the Party Operations  Department took, for their conventional warfare skills, a 6000  li (2400 kilometer) round trip march along the provinces of  Pyongan, Hwang-hae, and Kangwon, during which they conducted  such conventional warfare training exercises as seizure and  demolition aimed at military organizations and other  agency/installation, snowed cave bivouac, assault, and ambush,  that have little bearing on the performance of their originally  designated mission.    In the meantime, the North Korean Government, in order to  comply with Kim Chong-il's directive of total trust and special  treatment, made an enormous improvement in salary and rations  for the combatants. A combatant senior lieutenant receives a  salary of 155 wons per month, exceedingly higher than all other  senior lieutenants' 100 wons per month salary, and daily  allowances of 800 grams of rice, two eggs, 200 grams of meat,  150 grams of fish, and three or more varieties of fresh  vegetables, and a weekly allowance of 200 grams of glutinous  rice or flour.    This special treatment of combatants of the Party Operations  Department makes their allowance of rice three times higher and  their other food allowances twice as much as those of other  military officers, rank by rank, and they nearly equal the  levels accorded to members of the 2nd Security Guard Division of  the General Guard Bureau which is in charge of Kim Chong-il's  personal protection.</p>

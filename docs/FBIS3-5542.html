The results show that 62 percent of respondents said tax  increases were "inevitable" to ensure adequate public services  for the aging population.    Asked if consumption tax should be raised to secure revenue  for welfare programs, 45 percent approved and 42 percent  disapproved. After the controversy surrounding the prime  minister's proposal for a public welfare tax, the public is  beginning to understand that taxes must rise in preparation for  the aging of society; however, they also showed a high degree of  frustration with unfair taxation practices.    On consumption tax, the largest number of complaints were  about the "tax profits" of retail stores -- not all tax money  paid by consumers goes into the public purse. Changes in the  public attitude to taxes were observed in people's moderate  responses to the 3-percent consumption tax proposal, and the  drop in the number of those who believe taxes are too heavy.    In previous surveys in March 1988 and September 1989, those  who saw tax increases as "inevitable" if the country was to  ensure adequate services for its aging society accounted for 46  percent and 54 percent, respectively. However, this group rose  to 62 percent in the latest survey. The public is gradually  showing a positive attitude toward tax increases. Similarly, 30  percent opposed any tax increases this time, down 9  percentage-points from the September 1989 survey.    Public opinion is still divided on the issue of increasing  consumption tax to boost revenue resources for welfare programs.  Yet, in a September 1993 survey, 70 percent disapproved of the  idea of a consumption tax hike in exchange for a cut in income  tax. As the public becomes aware of the problems of an aging  society, it is beginning to take a more positive attitude toward  the idea of a consumption tax increase to fund welfare programs.    Among supporters of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  Komeito,  and the Japan New Party, more than 50 percent supported a  consumption tax rise, while 30 percent were against the idea.  By contrast, more than 50 percent disapproved of the tax  increase and about 30 percent supported the idea among  supporters of the Social Democratic Party of Japan and the Japan  Communist Party. Opinions among supporters of Sakigake  [Harbinger] and the Liberal Democratic Party were split.    Asked to indicate, from five possible answers, the worst  aspect of a rise in consumption tax, the largest group,  amounting to 39 percent, chose "tax profits" because, they said,  "it is hard to see if tax money is really going into the public  purse." The figure of 73 percent said the current taxation  system is "unfair." Settling public frustration with the  current tax system is probably a prerequisite before any tax  increases are imposed in preparing for the aging of society.    On the current 3 percent consumption tax, which is about  five  years old, 35 percent said the tax burden was "too heavy," but  57 percent said it was "not important." In the April 1989  survey held immediately after the introduction of the  consumption tax, 71 percent said the tax rate was "too heavy."  It appears the public's ill feelings toward the tax have eased  over the last five years.    Asked for the general feelings about taxes, 48 percent said  "taxes are too heavy," and 44 percent said they are at "an  acceptable level." The percentage of those who think taxes are  too heavy has dropped drastically from the 60 percent figure in  the March 1988 survey, and is the lowest since the survey  started in September 1970.    Compared with results of the previous survey, those who said  taxes were too heavy dropped from 70 to 53 percent among  industrial workers, and from 68 to 52 percent among  administrative workers. In general, the decline in complaints  about the tax burden was more obvious among white-collar workers.    As far as their thoughts about taxation in the future are  concerned, 39 percent supported a further increase in indirect  taxation, while 48 percent were opposed.</p>

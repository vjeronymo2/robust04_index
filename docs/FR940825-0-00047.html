			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of these commenters went further to suggest that the authority of the superintendent under 36 CFR 1.6(a) to issue permits applies only when necessary to allow an otherwise prohibited or restricted activity. The commenter stated that once the use of U.S. Highway 191 by commercial vehicles transporting commodities other than hazardous materials is authorized by Section 7.13(a)(1), then the Superintendent would not have the authority to issue permits related to that use. 36 CFR 1.6(a) states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> When authorized by regulations set forth in this chapter, the Superintendent may issue a permit to authorize an otherwise prohibited or restricted activity  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (italics added for emphasis) impose a public use limit. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> There is clear legal precedence that the superintendent may issue permits to impose a public use limit on an activity that is not otherwise prohibited or restricted. Therefore, the NPS believes there is no ambiguity raised by the wording of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter expressed that should the NPS choose to require a permit in the future for general commercial vehicle use of U.S. Highway 191, then all commercial traffic, interstate and intrastate, would have to be permitted according to the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Art. 1, Section 8, Clause 3. The NPS disagrees with this contention. The NPS promulgates regulations governing activities in the National Park System pursuant to the delegation of authority from Congress in 16 U.S.C. 3. That delegation by Congress was made under the Property Clause, Art. 4, Section 3, Clause 2, of the Constitution. While this regulation imposes limits on commerce, it does so incidentally to the necessary and appropriate exercise of Property Clause powers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter expressed concern that the ``permit fee'' may be misconstrued as a ``fee for use'', which in the commenter's opinion would be inappropriate. National Park Service Guideline NPS&hyph;53, Special Park Uses, provides for charging a permit fee based, in part, on the administrative costs of issuing a permit and monitoring and enforcing permit conditions, which is the intent of the proposed rule as described in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7.13(a)(5) prohibits violating a term or condition of the permit and provides for the suspension or revocation of a permit should a violation occur. This section received one comment expressing concern about what sorts of ``violation'' may constitute grounds to suspend or revoke the permit to transport a hazardous material. It was pointed out that a minor, technical violation, such as the inadvertent loss of one of the four required hazardous material placards, may constitute a technical violation of a permit condition. The commenter questioned whether such a violation was significant enough to warrant loss of the permit and asked that NPS clarify what kind of violation will actually result in the revocation of a permit to haul hazardous materials on U.S. Highway 191 within Yellowstone National Park.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPS does not disagree with this concern. However, general wording such as this is standard in all sections of 36 CFR relating to permits including Sections 1.6 and 5.6. This issue is discussed below under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Required Permit Criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7.13(f) changes the name of the existing section from ``Commercial automobiles and buses'' to ``Commercial passenger carrying vehicles''. No comments were received related to the name change of this section. The intent is to make the title of this section parallel to that of general regulation Section 5.4, the section upon which Section 7.13(f) is based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of Final Regulations and Required Permit Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general, permit procedures for commercial vehicles and/or hazardous materials transports will be in accordance with 36 CFR 1.6 and NPS guidelines (as amended or supplemented). The special use permit form (10&hyph;114) will be used for commercial vehicle and hazardous materials permits. Park suppliers are permitted through a different process. Permits may be applied for during normal business hours by visiting, telephoning, or telefaxing the Visitor Services Office (VSO) in the administration building at Mammoth Hot Springs. The VSO telephone number is 307&hyph;344&hyph;2115; FAX number is 307&hyph;344&hyph;2104. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: Suffering of Olympic athletes - ancient and modern Sir, I wonder if the modern Olympics are in essence so very different from the ancient Olympics. Nicholas Woodsworth has twice suggested that they are, most recently in his piece 'Marathon a sell-out to commercialism' (August 8), where he suggests that the suffering of the marathon runners at Barcelona was alien to the ideals of Olympic competition. It is not immediately clear whose ideals, or what ideals, he is referring to, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest that ancient Greek athletes suffered just as much, perhaps more, than modern ones, and that the idea that the modern Olympics are a corrupt departure from some higher ancient standard is unfounded. Pausanias (2nd century AD) tells the following story about Arrachion, a competitor in the ancient Greek Olympics in the pankration (a brutal mixture of boxing, wrestling, and general fighting, in which gouging the eyes and biting were forbidden but anything else allowed): 'Arrachion's opponent caught him, held him in a scissors grip and at the same time throttled him with his hands; so Arrachion broke one of the man's toes. Arra chion died by strangling, but not before the strangler gave in from the pain in his toe.' Arrachion was the winner - but dead. The idea that ancient athletes did not have financial motives is also questionable. The Athenian statesman Solon (probably early 6th century) awarded Athenian victors in the Olympics 500 drachmas; it is difficult to evaluate this sum, but rape was punished by a fine of 100 drachmas and five drachmas were awarded to anyone who brought into the city a wolf.

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELDER CARE: CARING FOR CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION;  </P> <P> FROM THE HEART: THE JOYS AND TRIALS OF CARING FOR DAD  </P> <P> Fading sun from an overhead skylight lit the kitchen table where Linda sat with  a glass of wine.  </P> <P> She says the wine relaxes her. She had spent the day cleaning two houses, doing  laundry and yard work and wrestling with a pile of her father's medical bills.  </P> <P> There were tears in her eyes as she talked of how her father's health had  declined since her mother's death five years ago after a lengthy bout with  leukemia.  </P> <P> Her father, Edwin, 74, lives in a guest house less than 100 feet from the back  door of her San Fernando Valley home. He moved into the house last year,  reluctantly, after family prodding.  </P> <P> For Linda, 42, the work involved in caring for her father is like a third job  -- that of care giver -- in addition to work in a medical office as nurse and  manager and the job of mother and homemaker.  </P> <P> "Caring for a parent is something that comes from the heart out of love and  concern," she said. "There is a fullment and sense of inner peace that comes  from seeing my father smile or respond to a reassuring touch or hug. It makes  me feel good.  </P> <P> "Still, there are times I just have to cry it out when it all gets too much."  </P> <P> Edwin suffers from emphysema, depression and aging.  </P> <P> "I just can't get enough air," he'll say after taking only a few steps.  </P> <P> "It's hard to think, like being in a fog," he'll respond to a question he is  unable to answer.  </P> <P> Linda said that when her father retired in 1980, after 30 years with a  thermostat manufacturer, he busied himself with gardening.  </P> <P> "Now he will only sit on his porch or stand at his window and look at the  garden," she said.  </P> <P> Efforts to involve him in senior activities have been stubbornly refused. "I  have everything I need right here," he will say.  </P> <P> She said that concern over her father's failing health spurred visits to  several physicians, including an Alzheimer's specialist, but diagnoses are the  same: aging and depression compounded by emphysema.  </P> <P> "I'm lucky I'm in the medical field," Linda said. "I have come to understand  what it is like to deal with bill-spewing computers while trying to help  patients in the office.  </P> <P> "Still, there are times it feels as if I'm being pushed from this  responsibility to that. . . . "  </P> <P> Her thought was cut short. Joshua, her 13-year-old son, crashed upon the scene  with the announcement that Grandfather's television had just stopped working.  </P></p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Smith tells Major to apologise MR JOHN SMITH last night expressed astonishment that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had offered no apology for the government's handling of this week's sterling crisis during a series of TV interviews broadcast yesterday. Claiming that the fault for the week's events lay in the government's economic policies, the Labour leader said that a more convincing explanation for Mr Major's actions was needed 'and certainly an apology for the incompetence which we all observed this week'. Attacking the government for its failure to implement 'strong domestic policies' to back up membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, he said 13 years of Tory rule had 'caught up with Mr Major'. He added: 'It won't do to be blaming the nasty foreigners or blaming the system or seeking to put the responsibility on to others, because the plain fact is that Britain has been revealed as being in the second division of the European Community.' Earlier, in a letter to the prime minister, Mr Smith accused the government of taking 'the inflationary option'. Referring to Mr Major's statement last week that 'the devaluer's option' would be 'a betrayal of our future', he said: 'Since then you have allowed the pound to be devalued by 10 per cent.' He added: 'For two years you have been telling the British people that all of the pain they have suffered from the recession  - soaring unemployment, bankruptcies and high interest rates  - was solely designed to achieve the the 'great prize' of zero inflation.' The letter follows Labour claims that the government squandered Pounds 500m of public money as part of the failed attempt to prop up the pound. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that the money could have created 50,000 Youth Training places, as well as 10,000 more offers of Enterprise Allowance and set up a temporary programme creating 150,000 jobs. Leftwingers called on Labour to drop its policy of opposition to a referendum on the Maastricht treaty.</p>

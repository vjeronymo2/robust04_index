			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMOTIONS AND CO-DEPENDENCY  </P> <P> Oh what a breath of fresh air! (Elfriede H. Kristwald "Now They Call It  Co-Dependency," Op-Ed Page, Feb. 14.) Thank you! As a psychological therapist  and as a woman I am nauseated with this Pablum-coated psychobabble continually  churned out by the psychology profession eschewing love as "co-dependency."  </P> <P> I certainly hope so! Love is our mightiest moment. In my view, we are supposed  to be with, in, around and with those we love -- this is nature, not pathology.  </P> <P> I have a lover who has never been involved in the psychology world in any way.  He wants to be with me all the time. My goal is to make sure he never gets into  a therapy group and learns to be ashamed of his love and passion for me!  </P> <P> Perhaps we have another case of "Those who can, do, and, those who can't,  teach." That is, those who cannot love and give themselves call others who can,  pathological. I will add that loving another person to the point of your own  destruction is pathological.  </P> <P> Yes, this theory of co-dependency as pathology is absurd. Unfortunately, a lot  of people have been taught to be ashamed of their loving capacity. This is,  indeed, a loss to humanity. So shame on my profession for that!  </P> <P> B.

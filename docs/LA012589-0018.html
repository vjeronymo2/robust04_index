			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PARK IN THE BALANCE  </P> <P> On a recent sunny afternoon a young woman sat sketching from a rocky perch in  the Santa Monica Mountains that overlooked the Pacific Ocean in one direction  and acres of unspoiled land in another. Like thousands of people in Los Angeles  who hike or ride or learn about nature in the park every year, she was  benefiting from the vision and energy of leaders in the fight to create the  Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. They are still fighting to get  the park finished, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has a key  role to play in the latest round.  </P> <P> The supervisors will have before them on Feb. 2 a land-use decision that will  determine the price of the former site of the Renaissance Faire. The Santa  Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency that has often been able to buy  available parkland faster than the federal government can, wants to buy the  land, known as the Arthur H. Whizin property. The current owner, a developer  who says that he doesn't want to sell the land, seeks to build 159 homes on the  property instead of 103 as originally proposed. If the supervisors approve the  larger number, their decision could make the land far more valuable and  therefore too expensive for possible park acquisition even if the conservancy  were able to persuade the owner to change his mind about selling.  </P> <P> Rejecting the plan to build more homes, however, would show congressional  critics that Los Angeles County cares about the park and is willing to do its  part to ensure its completion.  </P> <P> The timing is important. Last year, for the first time in several years,  Congress approved $11 million in land acquisition. With that money the federal  government is paying back the conservancy for purchasing 779 acres in Zuma  Canyon and 1,655 acres in the Circle X property that contains the highest point  in the mountains -- Sandstone Peak, elevation 3,111 feet. In turn, the park  service has asked the conservancy to pursue the purchase of the Whizin  property.  </P> <P> Zuma Canyon and Circle X, where the young artist was at work, are invaluable  additions tothe park. Next on the list is the Whizin property near an area that  is already being developed.The park needs this land as open space and to  connect existing parkland to the major north-south trail through the mountains.  By holding the line on zoning so that the price won't soar, the county can  demonstrate its commitment to the park both to Washington and to its own  constituents.  </P></p>

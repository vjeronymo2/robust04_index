			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`Impudent Act"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a  commentary today raps the document distributed by the South  Korean puppet vice foreign minister at a preparatory meeting of  the Asian regional forum held in Bankok some time ago which  contended that the socalled "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is a  "most serious matter" threatening the security of Northeast  Asia, urging the need to create "a forum of dialogue for the  security of Northeast Asia" for the purpose of "strengthening  international and regional cooperation" to resolve the matter.    The news analyst says:    It was Japan that responded to the South Korean puppets'  call  most nimbly. The South Korean puppets and the Japanese  reactionaries seek a sinister political purpose in crying for  the creation of the "forum".    Through the "forum" and "dialogue" they intend to create the  impression that the DPRK is isolated internationally and impair  the image of our dignified republic.    The very ones posing a grave threat to the peace and  security  of Northeast Asia are the United States, and Japan and South  Korea. Beefing up aggression forces in and around South Korea,  the United States is screwing up tensions and threatening a  military attack on the DPRK. And it is well known a fact that  the South Korean puppets are zealously joining the United States  in this racket.    The Japanese reactionaries are speeding up the conversion of  Japan into a military power and its nuclear armament and  employing every conceivable means to stage a comeback to Korea.    The ASEAN members and Asian and Pacific nations are  expressing concern over this situation.    Through "forum" and "dialogue", the South Korean puppets and  the Japanese reactionaries intend to cover up their criminal  acts in threatening the peace and security of Northeast Asia and  inveigle other Asian and Pacific nations into the anti-DPRK  campaign.    What is needed for the peace and security of northeast Asia  is to check the U.S. moves of aggression and war in the region  as well as the Japanese reactionaries' drive for the conversion  of Japan into a military power and its nuclear armament and its  reinvasion moves, and the South Korean puppets' anti-DPRK  campaign.</p>

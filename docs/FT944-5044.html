			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Eggar pledges to disclose coal bids Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday he would make as public as possible the bid figures relating to British Coal's privatisation as he indirectly criticised one of the companies which failed to have its tender accepted. He said the publication of the figures meant some people 'would have been better advised to be a little cautious before jumping to conclusions'. This was considered by members of the Coal Industry Society, which Mr Eggar was addressing, to be a reference to Mr Malcolm Edwards, chairman of Coal Investments. Last week Mr Edwards and his advisers were highly critical of the bidding process which allowed RJB Mining, the government's preferred bidder for the English regions, to pay Pounds 116m of the Pounds 815m final price in instalments. They said Coal Investments had been refused permission to make such arrangements, although this was denied by the government. Mr Eggar said there had been misinformation and 'less than pleasant innuendo' throughout the bid. He said the sale was likely to be considered by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, and the Commons public accounts committee. Coal Investments offer, Page 22</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> TITAN INVITATIONAL MEET RUNS AGAINST ARCADIA  </P> <P> The Titan Invitational Track Meet Saturday falls on the same day as the Arcadia  Invitational, a much more prestigious meet. But according to Poway Coach Dan  Schaitel, the Arcadia meet won't draw the top talent away from Poway.  </P> <P> "From what we've seen, there doesn't seem to be that problem," Schaitel said.  "Some teams will be going to both meets. We won't be. I don't want to push it  too far."  </P> <P> Over 3,000 athletes will compete in the meet, which is scheduled to begin at 9  a.m. with the last race at 3:30 p.m.. Among the top teams competing are Mission  Viejo and Esperanza and from San Diego, Poway, Mira Mesa and Mt. Carmel.  </P> <P> Poway senior Kim Dill, who placed fourth in the 100-meter hurdles in last  year's state meet, is ranked second in the state in that event. Dill also will  compete in the 300-meter hurdles where she will meet San Pasqual's Erin Blunt,  who is ranked in the top five in the state in that event.  </P> <P> Poway's Steve Pomiak, who runs the 100-meters in 10.9 was a member of the 400  and mile relay teams which took second at the Pasadena Invitational a week ago.  </P> <P> At that meet, Poway placed in the top three in every race.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I'm very pleased with the boys performance," Schaitel said. "They  are a very strong and well balanced team. There are no weak areas and they are  continually getting better."  </P> <P> In the Poway girls meet against Mt. Carmel Thursday, it came down to the last  race, the mile relay. Mt. Carmel won the meet, 88-77.  </P> <P> Southwest pitcher Millie Esquivil had 21 strikeouts in only nine innings last  Thursday, despite Southwest's 1-0 loss to Chula Vista.  </P> <P> That puts her in a three-way tie with Suzy Lawrence of Sweetwater and Darbie  Seegrist of Marian. However, it took both Lawrence and Seegrist 19 innings to  collect their 21 strikeouts, which they did in a game against each other in  1987.  </P> <P> Escondido pitcher Ruth Henry recorded her second no-hitter in the Cougars' 16-0  victory over Oceanside Friday. The day before Marquessa Penrod threw a  no-hitter in Escondido's 2-0 victory over Carlsbad.  </P> <P> Escondido is 7-2.  </P></p>

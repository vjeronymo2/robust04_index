			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY ALLY GOT POVERTY FUNDS FOR PRIVATE BUILDING  </P> <P> Bishop H. H. Brookins, a longtime Los Angeles church leader and political  mentor to Mayor Tom Bradley, obtained $336,000 in federal poverty funds through  a city agency to renovate a run-down office complex that he secretly owned in  Southwest Los Angeles, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> The government loans were awarded to a non-existent church corporation created  by Brookins, records show. City officials now say the funding would not have  been approved if they had known that the bishop owned the property.  </P> <P> When Brookins failed to make payments on the government loans three years ago,  a top Bradley aide asked two city administrators to use their positions to help  Brookins with his financial problems, the officials said.  </P> <P> The building housed a program, headed by Brookins, that offered job training  and education for poor residents of South Los Angeles. Through what city  officials thought was an official church corporation, Brookins received a  $336,000 interest-free loan to renovate the structure. The money came from  federal funds intended to assist neighborhood projects, including poverty  programs. But after a few years, the program moved from the renovated building  to a dilapidated office next door. Brookins then leased the renovated building  for $10,000 a month to a private trade school, and netted $250,000 when he  refinanced the improved structure.  </P> <P> Today, the bishop personally owns the office complex, which loan records  indicate is worth about $1 million.  </P> <P> Brookins, an influential black leader, served as the Los Angeles region bishop  for the 2.2-million-member African Methodist Episcopal Church from 1976 until  1984.  </P> <P> He was awarded the $336,000 through the Los Angeles City Council between 1982  and 1985, and the loans were administered by the city's Community Development  Department (CDD). He repaid the principal owed on the loans in 1988, and the  city forgave $50,000 in back interest.  </P> <P> Several of the jobs and education programs housed in Brookins' three-story  building in the Crenshaw area had problems, including fraud and mismanagement,  according to a state audit and city monitoring reports. The programs were  headed by Brookins and backed by an additional $2 million in government funds.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office conducted a criminal investigation of the  Brookins loan for almost two years before deciding last July to drop the case  because the statute of limitations for fraud and embezzlement had elapsed,  prosecutors said.  </P> <P> A 1988 search warrant for financial records on the property alleged that  "through fraudulent misrepresentations and transfers of property title,  Brookins has personally financially profited. . . . "  </P> <P> Last month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Los Angeles  referred the Brookins case to its regional Office of Inspector General for  possible investigation of misuse of government funds, said HUD spokesman Scott  Reed.  </P> <P> Following inquiries by The Times, officials of the city Community Development  Department said they will seek to recover tens of thousands of dollars in rent  paid to a Brookins company by city-funded programs that he operated out of his  own building.  </P> <P> "Somebody owes that money to the city," said Susan Cleere Flores, manager of  the city unit that oversees Brookins' programs.  </P> <P> On Friday, Bradley announced plans for a series of public hearings on problems  within city departments, starting with the CDD.  </P> <P> The mayor declined requests to be interviewed about Brookins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interview Canceled  </P> <P> Last week, Brookins abruptly canceled an interview with a Times reporter in  Washington, where he has served since 1988 as AME Church bishop for Maryland,  Virginia and the District of Columbia region. The bishop's spokesman referred  all questions to Los Angeles attorney J. Stanley Sanders, who said he did not  know enough about the loan or the property to comment.  </P> <P> "I have heard some of the same things you have heard" about the building,  Sanders told a reporter. "If (Brookins) has done something with public funds .  . . that is at the least an impropriety and at worst criminal fraud, then  obviously that's a story."  </P> <P> The Rev. Cecil Murray, a trustee of the Southern California AME Conference,  told The Times recently that he was unaware that Brookins personally owns the  property. Murray said that Brookins told church leaders in 1984 that ownership  would revert to the church after renovations.  </P> <P> After Brookins was reassigned from Los Angeles to Little Rock, Ark., in 1984,  he maintained a residence in Bel-Air and remained active in Los Angeles  political affairs.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, according to district attorney's investigative reports,  Brookins used government funds to improve his deteriorating office complex and  to pay off $30,000 in "personal obligations."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asked to Help  </P> <P> As questions about the renovation surfaced in 1986, a pair of Community  Development Department administrators were asked to help the bishop by William  Elkins, a longtime special assistant to Mayor Bradley and a friend of Brookins,  the two officials told The Times.  </P> <P> Elkins said in an interview Thursday that he had "no involvement whatsoever" in  trying to influence city officials to assist Brookins.  </P> <P> Bradley press spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor did not speak to anyone on  his staff about the Brookins loan and the matter "never came to his attention"  until after it was repaid in May, 1988.  </P> <P> But Douglas S. Ford, the former general manager of the city's Community  Development Department, said he personally told Bradley that Brookins was under  investigation before 1988. Moreover, Ford said he had "a heated discussion"  with Elkins in 1987 after the mayor's aide urged him to help Brookins while the  development department was conducting an investigation into possible fraud and  embezzlement.  </P> <P> "In my view, (Elkins) was trying to interfere with the investigation," Ford  said. "I told him to back off and not to do it."  </P> <P> Elkins said he could "not recall" ever speaking with Ford about Brookins.  </P> <P> As the investigation continued, Elkins arranged for other CDD officials to  waive $46,824 in back interest payments that Brookins owed the city and to  conceal the deal from the City Council, said Harreld S. Adams, who replaced  Ford on an interim basis in 1987.  </P> <P> Adams said Elkins told him: "The mayor would really appreciate it if you could  help (Brookins) out."  </P> <P> Elkins was not authorized to speak on Bradley's behalf, Chandler said Friday.  "The mayor did not speak with Bill Elkins or any other city employee regarding  settlement of the loan," Chandler said.  </P> <P> Brookins is one of several Bradley friends and supporters who have benefited  financially from their relationships with the mayor:  </P> <P> Far East National Bank chairman Henry Hwang received city deposits while  Bradley served as a paid adviser to his bank. Bradley helped Long Beach  businessman Allen Alevy acquire surplus city land at a time when Alevy was  organizing fund-raising carnivals for the mayor. And Bradley allowed Mary Anne  Singer to capitalize on her personal friendship with him to build a public  relations business.  </P> <P> Bradley remains under investigation by a federal grand jury for possible  violations of public corruption and securities laws.  </P> <P> The 72-year-old Bradley owes much of the credit for his record five terms as  mayor to the Rev. H. Hartford Brookins, a respected civil rights leader who  worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., served as the leading black  community spokesman after the Watts riot in 1965 and helped shape the careers  of many politicians, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson.  </P> <P> Brookins, 64, engineered Bradley's election to the City Council in 1963. Over  the next two decades, Brookins served as Bradley's spiritual leader and  chairman or co-chairman of every political campaign.  </P> <P> "I mean literally, if I may, I almost hand-carried Bradley up his whole  political career," Brookins told The Times in a 1985 interview.  </P> <P> The Bradley Administration has helped Brookins land three lucrative -- and  highly controversial -- government contracts.  </P> <P> Last year, amid protests of "cronyism" by some city officials, Brookins was  among six prominent minority group members with close ties to Bradley whose  lobbying and participation helped a team of developers win a $200-million  contract to expand the Los Angeles Civic Center.  </P> <P> Brookins has received approximately $300,000 as an ethnic minority business  partner in a Los Angeles International Airport concessions agreement that was  approved in 1985 by Bradley appointees on the Airport Commission. A recent city  audit found that Brookins, contrary to city regulations, had no involvement in  the management or operation of the concessions business.  </P> <P> The Bradley Administration supported the city's loan of $336,000 to improve the  Crenshaw property, records show.  </P> <P> The building and an adjacent parking lot, located in the 4600 block of Crenshaw  Boulevard, are the former site of Windsor University. Clark E. Parker, the  school's former chancellor, told district attorney's investigators that in 1977  he donated the property through Brookins to the AME Church in memory of  Parker's late parents, reports show.  </P> <P> Brookins said in a 1985 interview with The Times that Parker "needed a tax  write-off and psyched me into taking (the building) in the name of the church."  Parker recently said he had no comment on the transaction.  </P> <P> County real estate records indicate that Parker sold the property for $210,000  to the Southern California Conference African Methodist Episcopal Church Inc.  (SCCAMEC). Brookins is listed in the property records as the sole corporate  director of SCCAMEC Inc. even though the secretary of state's office says the  entity was never incorporated in California.  </P> <P> When questioned in 1988 about the non-existent church corporation, Brookins  told the district attorney's office that he believed it had been "properly  incorporated," investigation records show.  </P> <P> In 1978, Brookins put up the Crenshaw property as collateral to obtain a  $250,000 loan for SCCAMEC Inc. through the Bank of Finance, a minority-owned  financial institution whose board of directors at the time included Brookins  and Councilman Gilbert Lindsay.  </P> <P> Brookins told district attorney's investigators that he spent the $250,000 on  building improvements and an unspecified financial obligation but was unable to  account for the expenditures, according to district attorney's reports obtained  by The Times. He personally paid off the loan in 1988.  </P> <P> Brookins then lobbied the City Council to pay for renovation of his building,  which housed federal- and state-funded programs. The council instructed the  Community Development Department in 1982 to provide a $238,000 loan to SCCAMEC  Inc. with the first payment due in five years.  </P> <P> The council vote was "political," and the council acted without considering any  competing projects, said Ford, the CDD general manager at the time. "That money  isn't there to fund friends."  </P> <P> Once the contract was awarded, city administrators failed to take action when  Brookins repeatedly refused to provide required financial information and abide  by city regulations:  </P> <P> * City officials, violating their own contracting rules, neither confirmed that  SCCAMEC Inc. was a legitimate corporation nor required Brookins to furnish a  list of corporate directors before issuing the loan. Thus, the city did not  learn that Brookins personally owned the building until four years later --  after the statute of limitations for fraud had run out.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen S. Licker said the city should have investigated the  true ownership of the property back in 1982. "That's when they had knowledge or  should have had knowledge" that a crime may have taken place, Licker said.  </P> <P> "We made a serious mistake," said Roy Revelles, a CDD manager who monitored the  contract. "I don't know where it fell through the cracks because everybody  looked at that project."  </P> <P> * When it was discovered in 1984 that Brookins had taken $30,000 from the  government loan to pay a personal debt, CDD officials did not report the  finding to their own investigators or the district attorney. Instead, they  merely instructed Brookins to put the money back.  </P> <P> "I told (Brookins) this was not legal and I did not want to know about it," CDD  analyst Bob Frechman wrote in a May, 1984, memo. "I cannot in good conscience  condone or agree with this type of expenditure of federal funds." Frechman  later advised that Brookins not reimburse the city through his personal  checking account because "it would look unusual in eyes of an audit," according  to the same memo. Brookins then reimbursed the city by submitting a check drawn  on an AME Church account.  </P> <P> Licker said that Brookins had "technically" embezzled the $30,000, but the  statute of limitations had expired a few months before the city presented its  case to prosecutors.  </P> <P> * CDD staffers said they were ordered by superiors to let renovation work  proceed on the Crenshaw building even though SCCAMEC Inc. had violated city  bidding procedures. CDD analyst Arnold C. Garcia said in an interview that he  repeatedly warned his immediate supervisors about compliance problems, but no  one was willing to halt the project.  </P> <P> "The reality was that (Brookins) was politically connected and the contract  came down through those channels, and we were in a position where we had to  implement it," Garcia said.  </P> <P> When the project ran out of money in 1985, Brookins successfully lobbied the  City Council to loan his organization an additional $90,500, bringing the total  to $336,000, records show.  </P> <P> City officials assigned the new contract to analyst Richard Gallegos, who soon  discovered that Brookins had failed to provide the city with numerous  documents, including loan papers, property deeds, articles of incorporation and  the agency's board of directors.  </P> <P> "I smelled a rotten egg," Gallegos said.  </P> <P> Gallegos said that when he threatened to hold up the additional $98,000 in  funds until Brookins conformed to the original contract, his supervisors  ordered him to issue the money anyway.  </P> <P> The CDD's current general manager, Parker Anderson, who met with Brookins to  arrange the loan, said he had "no idea" how the bishop obtained the money  through a non-existent corporation. "We need to go back and determine where in  the process things went awry," he said.  </P> <P> CDD administrators say they first learned in 1986 that SCCAMEC Inc. did not  exist.  </P> <P> In a call to Harreld Adams, Brookins asked the city to "soften" the terms of  the loan because "the church" could not afford the payments of nearly $10,000  per month due to start in February, 1987, Adams wrote in a memo. The bishop  also admitted that he had acquired the Crenshaw property on his own, not  through the AME church as city officials were led to believe.  </P> <P> Brookins' startling admission was followed by a series of phone calls to CDD  officials from Elkins, the mayor's special assistant, according to two  administrators who said they received the calls.  </P> <P> Adams said that Elkins contacted him at least three times between 1986 and  1988. In each conversation, Elkins said the mayor would "appreciate" any  assistance the department could offer in granting concessions to Brookins,  Adams said.  </P> <P> During the first call, in early 1986, Elkins encouraged Adams to "soften" the  loan terms, Adams said. Adams said he later notified Brookins that the city  would consider renegotiating the loan.  </P> <P> In 1987, Elkins pressured Adams and Ford to subordinate the city's position on  the loan so that Brookins could refinance the property, the two administrators  said. Ford said Elkins asked him to "lean in Brookins' favor" on the  refinancing issue.  </P> <P> But Ford rejected the request in a June, 1987 memo: "It has not been our policy  to subordinate public funds in a way . . . which would provide a substantial  profit to (Brookins) with no apparent public benefit."  </P> <P> After being turned down, Brookins failed to make monthly payments on the city  loan until May, 1988, when he arranged to refinance the property through a  private lender. But the lender informed city officials that Brookins had no  intention of repaying the $46,824 in back interest, Adams said.  </P> <P> That is when, according to Adams, he received another call from Elkins, this  time to get the development department to waive the $46,824 that Brookins owed  the city. Adams said he first had to get City Council approval -- which would  reveal the problems surrounding Brookins' building.  </P> <P> "The mayor did not want that," Elkins said, according to Adams.  </P> <P> CDD officials then changed the due date on the loan so Brookins would not owe  any back interest or penalty payments, records show.  </P> <P> Asked to explain the change, Adams said: "When the mayor's office asks us to do  something in its executive capacity, if we can do it in a way that is not  illegal, we will do it."  </P> <P> The interest waiver was authorized by Deputy City Atty. Frank Orozco, who also  decided that council approval was no longer needed.  </P> <P> Months earlier, Elkins had summoned Orozco to the mayor's office to discuss the  Brookins matter. But Orozco said the meeting had no bearing on his decision.  </P> <P> "Elkins was very concerned about the effect (the Brookins case) might have on  the mayor," Orozco recalled. "He was trying to nip it in the bud if it was a  problem."  </P> <P> Elkins denied that he ever met with anyone in the city attorney's office to  discuss Brookins.  </P> <P> Orozco said that he and CDD officials decided to refer the Brookins matter to  the district attorney's office for investigation.  </P> <P> In July of 1989, after almost two years of investigation, prosecutors concluded  that the statute of limitations had expired in 1985 for the alleged fraud and  in 1987 for the alleged embezzlement.  </P> <P> Allen Field, head deputy of the major fraud unit, said his office "would have  looked deeper" into the Brookins case without the statute of limitations  problem. "If it's a case where you can't prosecute it anyway, you don't spend  the time."  </P></p>

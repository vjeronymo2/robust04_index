			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE SHARP retreat of Wall Street yesterday afternoon led to a big sell-off in stock index futures in a session once again noted for its volatility, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened firmly at 2,522 on the back of the good overnight performance in New York. However, independent traders who had taken on long overnight positions led the selling of September, sending the contract into retreat. Bargain hunters curtailed further falls around lunchtime but the respite was short-lived; the release of worse than expected US employment data once again sent the contract falling. The contract picked up ahead of Wall Street's opening but then reacted to the US selling which followed the Federal Reserve's discount rate cut. The falls on Wall Street put paid to any hopes of a further rise and the contract closed at 2,489, down 29 from the previous session and around 10 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover reached 8,493 lots. The uncertainty in the markets saw turnover in traded options once again reach high levels. A total of 46,520 contracts were traded, with the FT-SE option having 18,164 lots dealt. Marks and Spencer was the busiest stock option on 2,173 contracts.</p>

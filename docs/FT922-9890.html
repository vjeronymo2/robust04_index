			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Los Angeles: a political test . . . WHAT HAPPENED in Los Angeles, now a metaphor as well as a city, shocked America's political leaders, and so it should have. Two political questions arise from it. Is the jolt sufficient to induce the sort of collective effort necessary to stop it recurring and will it have an impact on the outcome of the presidential election? It is true that election years are normally more distinctive for their promises than for their action. Yet, apart from one egregious impugning of the likely Democratic candidate by the White House spokesman, the tenor of the immediate political response has not been wanting. Both President Bush and Governor Bill Clinton have addressed the unfolding tragedy mostly with care and thoughtfulness. President Bush has in effect agreed that the acquittal of the four policemen charged with beating Rodney King was a miscarriage of justice. For a Republican president harried by his right wing on domestic issues, such an admission is itself extraordinary. His promise to pursue federal prosecution to redress the wrong is wholly appropriate. But, the president properly emphasised, public order must be maintained, by whatever necessary means. Mr Clinton's answers were embodied in his campaign's finest address, in New Orleans on Saturday. He stated that both parties had failed the country by refusing to admit that race was at the root of the problem. Among the Democratic faults, he pointed to the unwillingness to change a rigid and self-perpetuating welfare system. Special programmes for the inner cities might help, as would better political leadership. But the key was for Americans to think about what kind of citizens they wanted to be and what kind of country they wanted to live in. These respective responses were delivered without notable political side, welcome but probably not to be repeated when the campaign reheats. In effect, Mr Bush was saying that the system was neither perfect nor broken, so long as redress under existing law was applied. Mr Clinton, no revolutionary, was saying that the flaws in the system were such that it had become irrelevant to a substantial minority of the population, a fact which imperilled social order. It is hard to judge the political fall-out. Mr Bush must have been tempted to take a harder line and play on the fears of white Americans, as in the Willie Horton commercials of 1988, which helped to destroy Mr Michael Dukakis. It may be too much to hope that Los Angeles can avoid becoming a political football. But it is devoutly to be desired, and the appointment of Mr Peter Ueberroth to head reconstruction efforts points the way towards the sort of political and business partnership that is required. The quality of political response to the riots has hardened the impression that Americans are this year being offered, with or without Mr Ross Perot, a serious choice, not one between empty vessels. Only serious politicians and serious policies can extract good from bad and ensure that the complex but not intractable racial and economic problems of cities like Los Angeles are addressed.</p>

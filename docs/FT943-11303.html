			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Cookery: Feasts from the deli The lure of the stove fades fast in hot weather. Good eating still appeals - providing the dishes are light and fresh, not stodgy or creamy - but the less cooking involved the better. This is a time when good shopping comes to the fore and classy offerings from the delicatessen seem worth their weight in gold. As good fortune would have it, the hot spell in southern England has coincided with the arrival in the UK of some fine foods from Italy. Masseria is a small estate in Apulia, the heel of Italy. Its artisanal products are strictly seasonal and quantities are limited. Own-grown vegetables ripened in the southern sun are a speciality. Harvested in small batches when at their peak, they are cooked and preserved within hours, and this freshness is evident in the eating. Unusual offerings include a vibrant green pasta sauce, made from the cooked and pureed tips of a sort of wild broccoli, cime di rapa. Even more noteworthy is a range of antipasti vegetables preserved in olive oil. Of these the grilled wedges of artichoke are truly outstanding: the firm sweet texture of the fresh vegetable is retained and the delicate artichoke flavour shines through. They are quite unlike most other preserved artichokes, which tend to be soft verging on soggy and mildly sozzled with an overdose of vinegar. These Masseria artichokes are in their prime now, having been picked, grilled and bottled just recently. As the months go by they will soften a little. But supplies of this year's crop will be snapped up and eaten long before that happens. Any day now Masseria grilled baby onions will come on stream. By September sun-dried red peppers will be harvested, bottled and ready for sale, as will lampasconi (delicately flavoured hyacinth-like wild bulbs). Treats to look forward to. September will also see the arrival in Britain of the new season's peperoni farciti, an exquisite offering from Roi of Liguria. These stuffed peppers, which I sampled at last year's harvest, are tiny round medium-hot peppers, each carefully stuffed with whole anchovy fillets and capers, packed in Roi's delicate extra virgin olive oil. Like Masseria's grilled artichokes, Roi's stuffed peppers are a star product to which I could easily become addicted. Try either or both of them with a few slices of good ham, a hard-boiled egg or two and a smattering of fresh chopped herbs. Perfect for lunch in the garden. Sardinia is uncharted gastronomic territory so far as most Britons are concerned. But not for long, as some of the best of the island's produce is just beginning to trickle into the British marketplace. San Giuliano, near Alghero, northern Sardinia, produces a commendable selection of vegetable antipasti preserved in olive oil, that includes wild cardoons, antunna mushrooms (a member of the oyster mushroom family indigenous to Sardinia), and sun-dried tomatoes stuffed with anchovies, herbs and spices. There is also a San Giuliano extra virgin olive oil which, at less than Pounds 6 per litre, strikes me as a very agreeable, very affordable everyday olive oil; while from Sartos and San Raimondo in middle and southern Sardinia respectively come prize-winning fruttato olive oils. Casar's canned vegetables, from the Cagliari region in the south, include excellent pulses: canned lentils, borlotti and, best of all, large mealy white beans known as fagioli di spagna. The canned plum tomato products are the best I have come across. The Sardinians, like the British, are notably sweet-toothed. Some of their biscuits and sweetmeats are Arab influenced. High fruit content jams include a fine bilberry. Intensely flavoured hazels, almonds, walnuts and sultanas stored in honey are especially delicious. This is an ancient preservation method almost forgotten elsewhere. Long-keeping foods are a hallmark of Sardinian cuisine. Traditional island breads include pane carasau, colloquially known as carta di musica, or music paper. Crackling, parchment-thin, it will keep for up to a year after baking. Even longer lasting is botarga, the salted and dried roe of mullet or blue fin tuna. This fishy treat is Sardinia's greatest delicacy and is so intensely savoury that only minute quantities are needed to kick-start the appetite. Just as well, for it is a luxury item in the caviar and truffle price bracket, food for high days and holidays. One classic (and effortless) way to serve botarga is shaved wafer thin or grated to a powder, sprinkled over a generous handful of rocket or broken pieces of carta di musica drizzled with olive oil. (The poor man's version substitutes sea salt for botarga.) This is a splendid dish for reviving jaded appetites on summer days, when I might preface it with a thirst-quenching soup, well chilled and agreeably thin - made perhaps with Sardinian canned tomatoes, sieved to a puree, generously diluted with light stock or iced water, enriched with a splash of olive oil and aromatised with crushed fennel seeds and a sliver of garlic.

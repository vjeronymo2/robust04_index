			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> CITY SAYS DEVELOPER TARGET OF MANY SUITS  </P> <P> Ventura City Atty. Peter D. Bulens has told the City Council that he found a  significant number of lawsuits against KNM Development Co., which has proposed  building a 147-unit development in Ventura.  </P> <P> But Bulens said it is not unusual to find litigation against developers.  </P> <P> "The fact that there are complaints on file in and of itself is not surprising,  since development, the construction industry and the business of architecture  almost always engenders litigation," Bulens wrote in his memo to council  members.  </P> <P> He said he was unable to find any significant cases involving KNM or its major  stockholder, Ernest T. Mansi of Oxnard, that have resulted in a verdict by  either a jury or a judge.  </P> <P> Bulens said some of the cases have not yet been decided, while others "seem to  have been dismissed through the settlement process without ever reaching a  neutral decision maker."  </P> <P> Mansi could not be reached for comment Friday. But earlier he had submitted a  letter to the city explaining his role in 11 lawsuits and denying any financial  irresponsibility or negligence in past construction projects.  </P> <P> The council had asked Bulens to look into litigation against KNM after Mayor  Richard Francis said he planned to drop his support for the affordable housing  project because of the lawsuits.  </P> <P> But Bulens said in his memo that he could not give an opinion regarding the  lawsuits' merit.  </P> <P> The issue is expected to be discussed tonight at the City Council meeting.

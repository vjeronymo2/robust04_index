			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> has the meaning given such terms in section 8(a)(5) and (6) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637 (a)(5) and (6)). Public Law 101&hyph;507 designated that for purposes of NASA's 8% goal, economically and socially disadvantaged individuals shall be deemed to include women. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1819.7003  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Congress has indicated its desire to increase the participation of designated entities in the aerospace industry, particularly as NASA contractors and subcontractors. The agency's goal is to award to such entities at least 8% of the funding provided for prime contracts and subcontracts in support of authorized programs by the end of fiscal year 1994. The participation of NASA prime contractors, through their subcontracting practices, is essential to meeting this goal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The 8% goal applies to the annual dollar obligations of the agency. It is not an absolute goal for each center or program or an absolute percentage to be placed in each contract containing a subcontracting plan. While some procurement requirements (contracts) offer subcontracting opportunities for designated entities equal to 8% of the contract value, others will offer greater, and some less, subcontracting opportunities. The aggregate comprises the agency's total accomplishment in response to the legislative mandate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1819.7004 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Prime contracting policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Contracting officers must seek out designated entities as sources and give full consideration to these entities to satisfy requirements in all NASA procurements. Since contracts with eligible 8(a) firms under the Small Business Administration section 8(a) program count toward the attainment of NASA's goal, contracting officers must make maximum use of this program in awarding prime contracts (see procedures set forth in (FAR) 48 CFR Subpart 19.8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Existing contracts or options will normally not be reduced in scope or otherwise restructured to increase opportunities for designated entities at the prime contract level. In rare instances, taking such action may be accomplished with approval of the Associate Administrator for Procurement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consolidated Contracts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Prior to effecting a contracting consolidation valued at $5 million or more, including options, which will not be exclusively reserved for small or 8(a) firms, an impact assessment on the effects of consolidation on present and future contracting and subcontracting opportunities of designated entities shall be prepared by the center, submitted to Headquarters Code HS, concurred in by Code K and the cognizant Associate Administrator, and approved by the Associate Deputy Administrator (Technical). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Protests involving size status and those involving designated entity status for other than women-owned businesses shall be referred to the U.S. Small Business Administration for handling. Protests to NASA regarding women-owned businesses claiming designated entity status shall be resolved by the agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Public Laws 101&hyph;144, 101&hyph;507, and 102&hyph;389 state that the status of a small business concern or other organization as a designated entity is determined by whether the entity is owned or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including women. To provide consistency with section 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)), NASA applies a restrictive interpretation of this legislation by requiring ownership and control by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1819.7005 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Subcontracting policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All contracts which are required to include a subcontracting plan (see (FAR) 48 CFR 19.702) must contain a separate percentage goal for using designated entities as subcontractors. This separate goal will not be entered on the subcontracting plan but will be specified in the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76, NASA Subcontracting Goal. The total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small disadvantaged business concerns stated in the subcontracting plan will be included in determining the designated entity subcontracting goal. The designated entity subcontracting goal also includes planned subcontracts with small business concerns owned and controlled by women, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and other minority educational institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) After a careful assessment of the statement of work associated with each procurement, contracting officers would insert in solicitations that have subcontracting opportunities an appropriate subcontracting goal for designated entities. The contracting officer shall confer with the small business specialist during the assessment stage since the specialist has knowledge and information regarding the pool of designated entities available to fulfill the subcontracting opportunities. The goals should be set at a level that can be reasonably achieved by the contractor expending good faith efforts to use designated entities as subcontractors to the maximum practicable extent. The designated entity subcontracting goals will be stated as mandatory goals in solicitations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- The United States is wrong  in seeking bilateral trade targets with Japan, but that does not  mean Japan can keep its markets to itself, Canada's trade  minister said Thursday [7 April].    Roy MacLaren, Canadian minister for international trade,  said  in Tokyo that Canada "regrets" the revival of "Super 301" trade  legislation by U.S. President Bill Clinton as well as the U.S.  insistence on setting numerical trade targets in bilateral trade  with Japan. But he quickly added, "there is broad recognition,  including by the Japanese Government, that meaningful action to  address Japan's chronic current account surpluses is essential."    Canada, MacLaren said, favors a more open, international  Japan and suggested that the country must bring forth  "meaningful regulatory and administrative reform," particularly  in distribution, transportation, communications and financial  services.    Speaking to Japanese and Canadian executives, MacLaren  emphasized that while he does not support the U.S. approach to  negotiations with Japan, "Japan remains limited by regulations,  many of which appear to us as quite unnecessary."    Meeting reporters after his address, MacLaren said both  Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  outlined Japan's commitment to deregulation in meetings with  him. Detailed plans were not presented, but an outline for  changes over the next five years were shown him, he said.    At later meetings with International Trade and Industry  Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Construction Minister Kozo  Igarashi, MacLaren said he would press for significant action in  reducing regulatory barriers to the expansion of Canadian  exports of building products, other materials, and value-added  goods to Japan.    Touching on the market access measures Japan released last  week, the minister said Canada "welcomes them." But, he added,  "they hardly meet what we regard as a desirable goal -- they  don't go very far -- but are a step."    He also stressed that Canada supports decentralization in  Japan and pointed to his visit to the southernmost main island  of Kyushu earlier this week as underlining the benefits small  and medium Canadian companies can obtain if they don't have to  do business "through Tokyo's great trading companies." At the  regional level, he suggested, business-to-business ventures and  agreements "come quickly."    MacLaren will host a roundtable on Japan-Canada business and  economic relations Friday and meet with several business leaders  before departing Saturday for Morocco where he will represent  Canada at the signing of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade  agreement.</p>

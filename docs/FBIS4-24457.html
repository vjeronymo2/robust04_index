			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Minister of Power </F> Industry Shi Dazhen: "Power Industry To Accelerate Reform"]    [Text] China's power industry is responsible for meeting  the ever-increasing demand for electricity as the country builds  up its socialist market economy. Without the necessary supply  of power, the entire economy will be bottlenecked.    The country's power industry has been improving steadily  since 1975 when Deng Xiaoping was in charge of the work of the  State Council. But the most rapid progress has been recorded in  the last six years, as 12 to 14 million kilowatts of generating  capacity has been installed annually.    Nevertheless the industry still faces a shortfall.    This so-called electricity bottleneck has, in fact, lasted  for 24 consecutive years. Today, electricity production falls  short of demand by 20 per cent and some 120 million rural  Chinese still live in the dark.    Rapid expansion of the power industry is necessary.    During their industrialization, some countries in the world  have invested more than 2 per cent of their gross national  product (GNP) annually to expand their power industries.  However, between 1980 and 1992, only 1.24 percent of China's  GNP per annum was invested in the power sector.    Construction of power grids has also lagged behind demand.    Moreover, investment in applied science and technology for  power generation has been declining.    The fund-raising mechanism for enterprises in the power  industry should be implemented and a scientific and rational  pricing system for the use of electricity should be set up.    That electricity is a commodity was ignored as recently as a  few years ago, and so fund-raising for construction projects of  the power industry from both the domestic and international  financial markets was severely hindered.    Plants, equipment and the technology used in many power  stations and transmission grids are outdated. This results in a  waste of generated energy.    As to the future, the Ministry of Power Industry (MPI) is  considering increasing China's generating capacity by about 15  million kilowatts per year between 1995 and 1997.    Beyond that to the year 2000, 20 million kilowatts are to be  added annually. Assuming China carry out this plan [as  published], its total installed electricity capacity will be  about 300 million kilowatts by the turn of the century.    If China's GNP grows 8 to 9 per cent annually, the estimated  generating capacity of 300 million kilowatts should by and large  ease the power shortage nationwide, making it possible for each  county in the country and 95 per cent of the country's rural  households to have access to electricity.    It is hoped that the State, with the backing of relevant  departments, will increase its annual investment so that the  input constitutes at least 2 per cent of GNP, the minimum  required to ensure the industry's steady development.    In line with the central government's policy of allocating  funds for building key State projects the MPI will compete for  preferential policies. Particularly, low-interest loans for  rural regions in the country's minority, poor and remote areas  will be sought to develop the power industry.    The MPI will also encourage the development of new power  sources. the transmission of power via grids from energy-rich  provinces to those suffering from shortages, and investment from  developed coastal regions to the relatively poorly developed  power supply industries of the hinterlands.    Economically advanced regions will be encouraged to be  self-reliant in terms of electricity by collecting funds  themselves for investment in their own power sectors.    The MPI urges enterprises to create new channels of  fund-raising and will permit them to apply to banks directly for  loans and to other financial institutions for the issue of bonds  and shares after seeking the approval from relevant government  organs.    State Council officials said that China needs more foreign  investment in the power industry to compensate for the shortfall.    The MPI will experiment with issuing bonds of enterprises  abroad, and use the money collected to develop the power  industry.    It will also permit some power sector enterprises, which  have  good economic returns, to issue shares overseas. And it will  set up fund-raising companies abroad to help enterprises in the  power industry to raise funds from international sources.    Because power supply is of great importance to the national  economy, foreign investment in it will proceed under the State's  macro-control.    Domestic investment should provide about 80 per cent of  funding and the remainder will be sought from foreign investors.    To provide the public with reliable and quality service at  reasonable prices, the MPI will continue to develop thermal  power, hydro-electric power and limited amounts of nuclear power.    The MPI aims to harness the country's rivers to generate  between 70 and 80 million kilowatts of hydropower by the turn of  the century.    To achieve the goal, hydro-electric sites in the mainstream  and tributaries of the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze  River, the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the  Lancangjiang and Honghe river valleys will be targeted.    The power industry will monitor experience in the  construction and operational performance of the Qinshan and Daya  Bay nuclear power stations. The two successful nuclear power  stations in China will lay a good foundation for the development  of nuclear power in China in the next century.    In terms of the operational mechanism of State-owned  enterprises. modern corporate systems will be introduced.    State-owned enterprises will gradually be converted into  limited companies and shareholding companies.    The standard shareholding system will ensure independence  from government interference and create more channels for  fund-raising.    To pave the way for the management reform of the industry  the  MPI has drafted the Electric Power Law.    Within three to five years, a comprehensive legal provision  for the power industry, with the Electric Power Law as its  centre, is expected to be established in China.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Realism in retreat: The shaky prospects for a Middle East peace Talking of peace while watching the seeds of conflict grow is a Middle East trait that seems to survive even the worst conflicts. A year ago next week, when small, rich Kuwait was liberated, the Middle East looked less militarily threatening than it had for decades and Mr George Bush seemed guaranteed a second presidential term. Twelve months on, there are still peace talks on the agenda. But with the latest round scheduled to start on Monday, the guns are firing again and the achievements of the Gulf war have become much less obvious for the Middle East in general and Mr Bush in particular. The defeat of Iraqi forces in Kuwait had offered the region much more than just the chance to rid itself of a tyrant, while Mr Bush had the opportunity to capitalise on the triumph of becoming the US leader who presided over the joint burial of communism and the bitter memory of Vietnam. Logic alone suggested that after such a huge international effort, the Middle East would not to be allowed to fester and erupt in the same way again. There were positive changes. For the first time in its post-colonial history, the Middle East was demonstrably free from superpower rivalry, Israel had been persuaded to exercise wholly uncharacteristic military restraint and there was talk in western capitals of moving towards a resolution of some of the Middle East's worst political injustices and economic disparities. If there was to be a new Middle East order, Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, were uniquely placed to be both architects and guarantors. Those hopes have dissipated with alarming speed. After the events of the past week, not least in New Hampshire, the defeated President Saddam Hussein is crowing about being more secure in Baghdad than the victorious Mr Bush is in Washington. Israel's assassination of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Shia leader in southern Lebanon, and his family has inflamed not just his local community but sent a message to Moslem communities throughout the Middle East. Israeli tanks have subsequently brushed aside UN peacekeeping forces and punched deeper into southern Lebanon in what is certain to be another doomed attempt to impose political compliance through military punishment. The US is meanwhile still trumpeting its pursuit of Saddam Hussein, is threatening tougher action against Libya and has supported the cancellation of elections in Algeria. Taken individually, each event has its particular motivation. Taken severally, it is small wonder that the region's radicals think they are poised to claw back much of the ground conceded to the US and the more moderate Arab regimes at the time of the Gulf war. They argued then that the US viewed the Gulf conflict primarily as an opportunity to crush Iraq and to ensure that a pliant Saudi Arabia would ensure cheap long-term oil supplies. They insisted that beyond the borders of Israel, Mr Bush cared little for the people of the region, would make scant efforts to assist domestic victims of Saddam Hussein's aggression and never intended to offer more than a token effort to resolve the Palestinian issue. The extremist propaganda image of Israel and the US jointly beating their Arab opponents into submission retains more potency among some populations than anything which can be advanced by America's friends in support of their relationship. Against this background, Palestinians, Syrians, Jordanians, Lebanese and Israelis gather in Washington on Monday for a third round of bilateral negotiations which, as the participants are all too well aware, look increasingly at odds with the political mood of the Middle East. The peace process, launched in Madrid at the end of last October, reflected primarily the changed strategic circumstances of the participating nations. The collapse of the Soviet Union had left the Palestinians and Israel's Arab opponents without a sponsor or protector. President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, hitherto Israel's most durable enemy, saw a compensating degree of protection by acceding to US requests and agreed to negotiate, pulling Lebanon with him. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, came with even greater reluctance, stressing that Israel would not concede an inch more of the land it had occupied since 1967 and could offer nothing other than peace in return for peace. To reinforce that assertion, Israel accelerated its house building programme in the occupied territories and saw nothing contradictory in simultaneously asking the US to guarantee loans of Dollars 10bn needed to settle immigrants from the former Soviet Union. After all this, Israel still suffers a credibility gap. Its problem is that the US and other western governments prefer to interpret Mr Shamir's most hardline statements as negotiating positions rather than simple statements of conviction. When Mr Shamir says that Jews must forever have the right to settle in the biblical lands of Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) it should be supposed he believes that as fervently as he does in a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty. There is nothing contradictory for Mr Shamir in sending tanks into southern Lebanon while protesting a determination to secure peace. Mr Menahem Begin, the former Likud prime minister, ordered a far larger invasion of Lebanon in 1978, only a few months after President Anwar Sadat of Egypt opened prospects for peace by becoming the first Arab leader to visit Israel. These attitudes do, however, pose problems for the Bush Administration. Mr Shamir was on Thursday night re-elected as leader of his Likud party and will go into the June general election as the favourite to win. If he is successful there is no justification for Arab governments to expect anything more than the most modest flexibility in Likud policy. A victory for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, newly returned to lead the opposition Labour party, would, on the other hand, open the way to the offer of some form of autonomy for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, although Mr Rabin's chances of winning depend on him appearing to the electorate to be almost as tough as Mr Shamir. If the election result is indecisive, as it often has been in the past, the two men would probably work together in a national unity government. A politically astute Mr Shamir does, however, have the opportunity this week to rob Mr Rabin of some of his electoral appeal. He can put on the table in Washington the framework of an autonomy agreement for the Palestinians along the lines of the Camp David accords reached during the negotiations with President Sadat in 1978. This will simultaneously improve relations with the US. It will not answer Palestinian aspirations for self-determination, but it would assist the negotiating teams by indicating there was some longer-term purpose to the peace process. But if Mr Shamir wishes to contribute additionally to the pressures which will eventually provoke the collapse of the peace process, then he will instruct the Israeli team in Washington next week to avoid any proposals on substantive issues. He knows the Arab delegations must be getting near the brink. Syria and Lebanon boycotted the multilateral phase of the process in Moscow earlier this month in protest at Israel's refusal to concede the principle of exchanging territory for peace. With the alarm bells ringing again in Damascus over Israel's latest incursion into Lebanon, President Assad must be finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile participating in the peace talks. There are similar tensions in the Palestinian camp. They would, of course, rather stay within the process. To pull out serves not just Israel's hawks but extremists throughout the Arab world. But there comes a point when the domestic dangers may be judged to be greater than the international blame that would attach to withdrawal. Mr Assad, King Hussein of Jordan, Yassir Arafat of the PLO and those other Arab leaders and regimes that came to power in the late 1960s and early 1970s have not clung to the tops of their greasy poles for so long without accurately sensing political movements in the region. Historically, it has been easier in the Arab world to whip up and sustain popular support through anti-Israeli and anti-American rhetoric than through any other form of political agitation. The Gulf war added to the personal, political and economic misery of tens of millions of people in the region. That misery continues and is growing. At grass roots, the political ground is being more surely prepared for extremism than it is for the more pragmatic realism that seemed possible a year ago.</p>

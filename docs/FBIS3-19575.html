			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The whole of OK Petroleum will be sold to a  businessman from Saudi Arabia, Shaykh Muhammad al-Amudi, who is  paying 5.9 billion crowns for the biggest refinery company in  the Nordic countries. Anders Munkesjoe reports:    [Munkesjoe] It has been known for quite some time that OK  Petroleum is for sale. The previous owners, KF [Cooperative  Association] with 52 percent, the Swedish state, and Neste of  Finland with 24 percent each, have all for different reasons  wanted to dispose of the company. The buyer now is a Saudi  shaykh by the name of Muhammad al-Amudi. [passage omitted]    From the past, Shaykh al-Amudi has well developed contacts  with Swedish industry. He has cooperated with AGEVE of Sweden  for several decades. Under its new owner, OK Petroleum will now  focus its sights on northern Europe, above all. There is an  intention to buy retail networks for oil products in Poland and  East Germany, markets which are judged to be very expansive.    OK Petroleum is the biggest refinery enterprise in the  Nordic  countries. With subsidiaries, the company has a staff of about  2,000. Sixty percent of production is exported; the rest is  mainly delivered to OK's gas stations which are not affected by  this deal. Shaykh al-Amudi's voiced intent is to develop OK  Petroleum in line with the strategy already existing in the  company. No immediate changes in employment and production are  therefore to be expected, the head of the concern, Sven-Erik  Zachrisson promises. [passage omitted]</p>

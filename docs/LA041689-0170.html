			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DON'T SAY HANDICAPPED;  </P> <P> DAN SIEGLER AND JIM ABBOTT EACH HAS SOMETHING TO PROVE IN BASEBALL  </P> <P> There were 46,846 curious people at Anaheim Stadium for the Angels' first  Saturday night home game. Their curiousity was understandable because pitcher  Jim Abbott was about to make his major league debut.  </P> <P> One fan was not particularly curious, though maybe that was not quite so  understandable.  </P> <P> His name was Dan Siegler. He just wanted to watch a ballgame, so much so that  he turned down three dates to a Sadie Hawkins dance.  </P> <P> Abbott, as nearly everybody knows by now, has one hand. Siegler, a senior first  baseman on the Fallbrook High School baseball team, also was born with one  hand.  </P> <P> Minutes before the first pitch in Anaheim Stadium, Siegler watched  photographers cluster around Abbott as he emerged from the dugout. And Siegler  wondered aloud why people are always so curious. About Abbott. About him.  </P> <P> "I guess it's hard to understand," he said, watching Abbott warm up. "To me,  it's like, 'What the hell. It's the way I am.' "  </P> <P> Until this season, Siegler was just another high school kid playing ball. He  was a starter for three seasons at Tustin High School in Orange County before  he transferred to Fallbrook last fall.  </P> <P> Siegler obviously gets considerably less recognition than Abbott, but he has  gotten some. After last season in Tustin, he received a call from a reporter in  Orange County who wanted to do a story. Then, in San Diego, another reporter  called. Then another.  </P> <P> Siegler finds the attention somewhat ironic. He has teammates going to Arizona  State to play baseball. Nobody has been in touch with them about doing a story.  Yet Siegler, who does not play a lot and whose competitive baseball career  probably will end after this season, is creating something of a stir.  </P> <P> So as Abbott pitched, Siegler said several times to the reporter sitting next  to him: "I think this is the last interview like this I'm going to do."  </P> <P> Siegler doesn't consider himself a good story. Or even a story at all. He's  just a guy who plays on a team. An average high school student who gets lazy  now and then, isn't afraid to put a cocky freshman in his place, likes teachers  who encourage students to form their own opinions, tells an occasional joke and  turns up the radio when a Guns and Roses song comes on.  </P> <P> The word handicap isn't mentioned when Siegler is talking. He just lives and  plays ball using the tools he was given. He has never spent time worrying about  what he can and can't do or what he might be able to do if things were  different.  </P> <P> "No one has ever picked on me," he says. "Probably because they don't notice.  Your friends aren't going to rag on you. They don't say, 'This is my friend.  He's got only two fingers.' "  </P> <P> Siegler plays about the same way the left-handed Abbott does, in his case  catching with his right hand and shifting his glove over when he throws.  Because he has one finger and a thumb on his left hand, he uses it for support  when he bats. And that's that. It's as natural for him as falling asleep.  </P> <P> "I've been asked the question if it's tough or not," he says. "I'd have to say,  'No.' It's normal for me. I guess that's why I don't understand why people ask  the questions they ask. I must be doing something different, but it's not  different for me."  </P> <P> Siegler, 18, would just as soon not get any extra attention. If he were as good  as Abbott, he would have to learn to cope with the constant clicking of  cameras, the endless interviews and the same questions over and over. When  Abbott trotted to the mound and photographers scrambled anywhere they could get  a picture, Siegler slid to the edge of his seat and said: "That would bug me."  </P> <P> Abbott is not Siegler's hero. Never was. Siegler hasn't followed Abbott's  career closely or tried to emulate his style of play. Siegler hadn't even heard  of Abbott until his father, Paul Siegler, told him there was a one-handed  pitcher on the U.S. Olympic team.  </P> <P> "I don't look up to Abbott," says Siegler, matter of factly. "He's just another  player."  </P> <P> Don't get the wrong impression. Siegler credits Abbott for his success. But not  for the same reason most people do. Siegler is impressed because Abbott is a  major league player, the same way he is impressed with Don Mattingly or any  other professional player. That Abbott has one hand is seemingly of little  consequence.  </P> <P> And his observations at the ballpark support that. He doesn't focus on Abbott.  A foul ball gets ripped into the stands. Siegler smiles and shakes his head.  "People are so crazy trying to catch that ball with their bare hands. Do they  know how fast that thing is going?" A player's batting average is flashed on  the screen. "This guy's batting 1.000. Probably one for one," Siegler says,  drawing a laugh from someone sitting behind him.  </P> <P> It's fairly obvious, though, that Siegler is pulling for Abbott, just like  everybody else. He'll point out Abbott's fastball has been clocked at 94 miles  per hour, which, he says, is "good enough for the show here." When Abbott  departed in the fifth inning of a rather inauspicious debut, Siegler said: "I  think he did pretty well for a first major league start. He did what a pitcher  is supposed to do."  </P> <P> The fans gave Abbott a standing ovation as he walked off the field. No one  clapped louder than Siegler.  </P> <P> After Abbott had disappeared into the dugout, Siegler said: "(The fans) are  wondering about how Abbott does. They have a right to be curious. Let them get  their curiosity out of the way and look at him as a regular ballplayer."  </P> <P> That's the way Siegler wants it. Treat him the same as everybody else. His  coach, Dan Heid, does. Siegler says he gets yelled at just like the rest of the  players on the team.  </P> <P> Clearly, Siegler's spot on the roster isn't charity. He's hitting .333,  including a bases-loaded triple against El Camino. Heid says there's no one  with a dirtier uniform after practice.  </P> <P> "He has definitely earned his way on the team by being one of the 16 best  players at Fallbrook High," Heid said.  </P> <P> Siegler accepts his role. Winning, he says, can be just as satisfying from the  bench. A win is a win. But there are trying times. The plays where it takes him  a little too long to get the ball out of his glove and into his hand.  </P> <P> "When he messes up, he gets really frustrated," said teammate John Clift, who  once served up a home run ball to Siegler in Pony League. "He takes it pretty  seriously."  </P> <P> He always has. For that reason, his father used to encourage him to play  soccer. He knew Dan would always drive himself to succeed and figured he  wouldn't be at a disadvantage on the soccer field.  </P> <P> "We tried to keep him away from (baseball)," Paul Siegler said. "We didn't want  to see him fail."  </P> <P> But baseball was Siegler's favorite. So he gave up soccer, stuck with baseball  and made a go of it. Deep down, Paul says, Dan has something he wants to prove.  </P> <P> "I'll do anything anybody else can do and I'll do it just as well . . . or at  least I'll try," says Dan, adding quickly, "I'm not trying to sound stuck on  myself."  </P> <P> He rarely does. Siegler doesn't appear overly impressed with himself. He talks  of being an average student and speaks highly of his younger brother Philip,  who is a good baseball player and a good student. Siegler is outgoing and  friendly, enjoys meeting people.  </P> <P> And he doesn't really consider himself an inspiration for others with  handicaps. That's not because he doesn't care. He once spent a week showing a  kid who also had only one hand how to catch and throw a baseball. But when he  plays, he just plays. Nothing more, nothing less.  </P> <P> "I don't go up to bat thinking, 'I have to do this to inspire somebody,' " he  says. "I don't want to sound like a bad person. I just want to play the game."  </P></p>

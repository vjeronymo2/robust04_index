Zdenko Vranjes reports from Sarajevo.    [Vranjes] According to last night's agreements between Croat  and Muslim representatives, the constituent assembly should  today simply proclaim the federal constitution, but not elect  the president and vice president of the Federation for a  transitional period.    According to the leadership of the Croatian representatives,  the election of the president and vice president of the  Federation has been postponed for one month at most, because the  Bosniak Muslim side has not agreed to the proposal put forward  by Croatian representatives, to the effect that the president of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation be a Croatian during the  transitional period.

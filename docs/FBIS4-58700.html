			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and  West Bank have responded cautiously to the signing of the  agreement on Palestinian self rule. [passage omitted]. Faysal  al-Husayni, the senior Palestinian leader in the West Bank and  Yasir 'Arafat's lieutenant there, said Jericho and other issues  such as Jewish settlements would create problems for the  agreement. He told Middle East correspondent Tony Hill that the  signing of the agreement in Cairo would now bring changes, but  it was still of concern to many Palestinians.    [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] Fortunately there will be a  change, but we are worried because we know that there are some  articles in this agreement which can create a real tendency to  (?so complicate it) and the Israelis are insisting that to keep  some articles there which we know very well that it will be  obstacle for any solution in the future.    [Hill] You said the day before that you believe Mr 'Arafat  should not sign this agreement under these present  circumstances. Should he have signed it in Cairo?    [Al-Husayni] I don't know what he writes on the map before  he  signed it but he put a long statement which means that he was  signing on it under very bad circumstances that he found himself  forced to write something before signing on it.    [Hill] Isn't this a matter of public confidence in this  agreement and won't that problem in Cairo over the signing only  undermine that public confidence in this agreement?    [Al-Husayni] A lot of problems will created, a lot of price  will be paid until the Israelis will convince that what they are  asking us now is unpractical and unrational [as heard].    [Hill] So you believe this agreement as it stands now may  not  succeed?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that this agreement as it is now and  if the Israelis will try to implement it literally, it will cost  a lot of us a high price, but in the end the Israelis will  discover that this is not the way.    [Hill] What can Yasir 'Arafat and Palestinian leaders like  you do then to make sure this agreement does succeed as it is  signed?    [Al-Husayni] First I was hoping that it will not be signed  today [4 May] before making these changes. As far as it was  signed today, so we will do everything to improve it in the  right way, and to show the Israelis from the beginning where is  the points which is not right points to be there and to convince  them to take it out [as heard].    [Hill] There has only been a very quiet response from  Palestinians in the occupied territories. Do you now feel an  urgency to try to get some real changes quickly on the ground to  improve confidence?    [Al-Husayni] Yes, the only thing that can bring back this  confidence is the implementations on the ground and that's what  we are insisting on now. [end recording]</p>

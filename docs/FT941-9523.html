			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Both sides have same priority - saving jobs There is one thing on which both sides agree, in the conflict brewing in Germany's once-mighty engineering industry: on the need to save jobs. They have been disappearing at more than 30,000 a month over the past year, or by around 600,000 since 1991, according to Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation. The trouble is they cannot agree on how to do it. Indeed, their alternative proposals, which led to a breakdown in negotiations in Darmstadt last Friday, seem to belong to different industrial worlds. The solution proposed by IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, has the attraction of simplicity. It is to cut working hours, at least as a temporary, emergency remedy for the next two years. In return, employers would guarantee not to cut any more jobs for the same period. Such an agreement was negotiated last November by Volkswagen, with the introduction of a four-day week for its entire workforce, as an alternative to sacking some 30,000 out of its 100,000-plus employees. In the first place, the union suggests bringing forward by 18 months the agreed 35-hour week, set to come into effect in October, 1995. And secondly, it wants to allow the national wage agreement to be made flexible, to allow individual plants to negotiate deals for shorter hours, down to 30 a week, as an alternative to outright redundancies. The problem, as far as the employers are concerned, is that the union is demanding at least partial compensation for the loss of earnings involved. Each hour cut from the working week costs an engineering worker about 2.8 per cent of his earnings: the union wants some of that  - say 1.4 per cent per hour - put back in his pay packet. As far as Gesamtmetall is concerned, such a solution can only suit a handful of employers who are facing a disastrous, but temporary, slump in demand for their products. It would reduce their absolute wage bill, but actually raise unit wage costs, already 40 per cent higher than comparable costs in France or the US. For a start, the employers say there should be no compensation at all for loss of earnings for those who agree to a shorter working week: any alternative would raise unit costs. It would make a full-time worker, on a 30-hour week, relatively more expensive to employ than a part-time worker. Moreover, if a plant agrees to put only certain departments on short-time, it would be invidious to pay those workers more per hour than their fellows still working full-time. Gesamtmetall's negotiators are certainly in favour of a flexible 'working time corridor' for individual plants to negotiate individual solutions. But they want that flexibility to include longer hours, as well as shorter, so that plants can go back, in certain circumstances, to a 40-hour week. The employers recognise that the 'VW solution' may suit some, if they are working far below their normal capacity, and would otherwise have to pay massive redundancy for thousands of workers. At VW, the deal was agreed as a cheaper alternative than redundancy payments for 30,000. 'The VW solution is a way of coping with scarcity (of demand), but it doesn't make any new products, and it does not open any new markets,' the federation says. Moreover, the employers point out that VW has still not been able to put its four-day week into effect in its two biggest plants because of the complexity of reconciling such a sweeping solution to industrial reality. IG Metall is not prepared to give a blanket 'opening' in the wage contract for plants to go back to a 40-hour week: that would amount to abandonment of its hard-fought 35-hour deal, the union leadership believes. And anyway, there is a clause in the current deal which allows 18 per cent of a factory workforce to work up to 40 hours - and barely any employers are using it. So, the union says work less and save jobs, and the employers say work more and save jobs. No wonder they are so far apart. And yet, in spite of the recriminations, the two sides have come a fair way towards each other. IG Metall is prepared to see more flexibility in the collective wage contract, which is already a big concession. It is prepared to forego most, if not quite all, compensation for shorter working hours. Gesamtmetall recognises that a shorter working week may be the right emergency solution for some of its members. It insists that it is not seeking a backdoor re-introduction of the 40-hour week - only for exceptional cases. And it is no longer insisting on the outright scrapping of holiday bonus pay, a red rag for the union negotiators. The employers still insist they must have a cut in real costs to save jobs. The union wants to guarantee jobs by working less all round. The difference appears to be not so much ideological as a difference in the perception of reality. That is a very fundamental gap to be bridged.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO BY VIDEO BY SONDHEIM  </P> <P> Few occasions in theater are more frustrating than going to a musical by  Stephen Sondheim, the most extraordinary composer to have ever written American  musical drama. His music is accessible upon first hearing, but his lyrics-the  most complicated and devilishly clever lyrics in musical theater-are impossible  to catch whole during one performance.  </P> <P> The ideal way to see a Sondheim musical is to study, in advance, the  intricacies and wizardry of the words. And the best way to do that is to listen  intently to the original Broadway cast recording and study the libretto.  </P> <P> When digital audio compact discs arrived five years ago, it appeared that  Sondheim and CDs were as perfect a marriage of art and technology as one could  imagine. And now comes the laser videodisc to show us how video, when combined  with digital audio, can, in many ways, make the Sondheim experience at home  even more exciting and rewarding than in the theater.  </P> <P> No other lyricist today writes such precise and complicated words. The clear CD  sound makes it possible to catch every syllable, every nuance. This adds to the  listener's comprehension of Sondheim's complicated score.  </P> <P> But when you add video's capacity to focus in on characters offering key  verses, to show you the staging in detail, to give you the ability to replay  complicated passages, you have an experience superior to watching a Sondheim  musical unfold on the stage.  </P> <P> No other composer uses silence as powerfully as Sondheim. The silent surfaces  of the CD enable his music to affect the ear the way the artist Georges  Seurat's dots of paint affect the eye.  </P> <P> It is Seurat's painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Grande Jatte,"  which inspired Sondheim's Pulitzer Prize-winning triumph, "Sunday in the Park  With George." A laser videodisc with digital sound presents an accurate sonic  and video picture of that musical (Image Entertainment laser videodisc, 147  minutes, under $35; a vastly inferior videotape is available from Media Home  Entertainment). CDs have given us a standard of sound thth video analog sound  simply cannot match. The laserdisc offers digital sound as crisp and clear as  the "CA Red Seal CD version of this same production.  </P> <P> Mandy Patinkin as Seurat, and in Act II as Seurat's great-grandson, and  Bernadette Peters as his model-mistress, Dot, and in Act II, the daughter,  Marie, do what Sondheim asks: They enunciate every syllable and sing with  passion and concern. Peters has become the perfect Sondheim heroine-she sings  with a clarity that makes it possible for an audience to unddrstand the word,  as well as the action. Patinkin is a marvel-his voice ranges all over (from  bass to falsetto), and he brings both Georges to life in an unforgettable  performance.  </P> <P> The sound is better than the video. The direction is mediocre-it does a prosaic  job of capturing the action but ignores the sweep of the drama and often goes  in for a close-up when the knowing viewer wants to see what else is happening  on the stage.  </P> <P> Sondheim's greatest work, "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street" is s  guably the finest musical written for the American stage. Unlike Andrew Lloyd  Webber's much-ballyhooed and vastly inferior "The Phantom of the Opera,"  "Sweeney Todd" is, in the truest sense, an opera in the worthy tradition of the  masters. Everything is brilliantly staged to music, and the arias are as  powerful and as moving as anything in opera history. "Sweeney Todd" is to  "Phantom" what Fred Astaire is to "Dirty Dancing."  </P> <P> Happily, the complete opera is available on "KO Home Video tape or Image  Entertainment laserdisc. Unhappily, it is not yet available on laser videodisc.  Although the original videotape on which the home edition is based has  excellent detail and sound, the home copies are poor replicas, with fuzzy  picture and low buzzing sound.  </P> <P> Still, nothing can dim the performances of George Hearn as the barber and  Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett. The sweep of the drama and the sharp wit of the  lyrics carry the day.  </P> <P> A prosaic documentary-type account of Broadway's tribute to "Follies," staged  in 1985 by Sondheim expert Thomas Z. Shepard, is also available (Fries  Entertainment videotape and Image Entertainment laserdisc).  </P> <P> "Follies in Concert," the video, seen on cable and public television, is a  truncated record that includes some of the great names of musical theater: Lee  Remick, Carol Burnett, Licia Albanese, Erie Mills, Liliane Montevecchi, Andre  Gregory, Barbara Cook, Phyllis Newman, Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Elaine  Stritch, Daisy Prince, Hearn, Howard McGillin, Patinkin and others.  </P> <P> The audio CD version includes full accounts of all 22 numbers, ones that stay  in the memory. This video, muddy with analog sound, doesn't compete well. Since  it is a concert version, the pictures don't add much to the performances, and  the documentary portions, while revealing, are more annoying than illuminating.  The video becomes more of a companion piece to the CD than a work in its own  right. Still, some of "Follies" is better than none.  </P></p>

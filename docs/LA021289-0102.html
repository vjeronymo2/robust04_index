			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE BYELORUSSIA LAND AFFECTED BY RADIATION FROM '86 DISASTER  </P> <P> Radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster is still spreading in Byelorussia  almost three years after the accident and has contaminated one-fifth of the  republic's arable soil, Pravda said Saturday.  </P> <P> "We harvest hundreds of thousands of tons of contaminated grain and do not know  what to do with it," the Communist Party newspaper quoted Mikhail V. Kovalev,  premier of the Byelorussian Soviet Republic, as saying.  </P> <P> Although the Chernobyl plant's No. 4 reactor, which exploded in April, 1986, in  the world's worst nuclear disaster, is in the Ukrainian Republic, the  radioactive pollution released by the accident spread north to neighboring  Byelorussia.  </P> <P> There has been little in the Soviet media about the consequences of the  accident in Byelorussia, however, with most reports instead focusing on damage  in the Ukraine.  </P> <P> "The influence of the Chernobyl accident and its consequences on the territory  of Byelorussia is not diminishing," Kovalev was quoted as saying. "The  territory is contaminated more than we supposed. More than one-fifth of the  republic's agricultural land is contaminated."  </P> <P> Kovalev said residents of the Byelorussian cities of Gomel, 100 miles north of  Chernobyl, and Mogilyov, 200 miles from the plant, had to be given additional  funds to defray the costs of finding uncontaminated food.  </P> <P> Shortly after the accident, authorities marked off a 19-mile forbidden zone  around the nuclear plant, 60 miles north of the Ukraine's capital of Kiev. They  evacuated about 100,000 people from the area and began efforts to decontaminate  the soil and buildings and halt radioactive fallout.  </P> <P> "(But) we did not manage to stop the spreading of the contamination in  Byelorussia," Kovalev said. "The roads have contaminated dust. The population  uses contaminated peat and firewood."  </P> <P> The cleanup in Byelorussia has cost about $1.4 billion so far, Kovalev said.  </P></p>

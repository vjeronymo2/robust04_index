			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "Dangerous to Society! Moscow </F> Mayor Forms 5,000-Strong Army. People's Militiamen or  Stormtroopers?"]    [Text] The report of the formation of people's militias in  the capital has provoked a contradictory reaction. Many people  are at a loss as to exactly how to view this step by Yu.  Luzhkov, the capital's mayor.    Judging by the Moscow government's decree of 19 April,  something akin to an army is being formed, but without combat  weapons. A blue uniform, bulletproof vests, helmets, handcuffs,  and batons [sentence as published].    Detachments are to be deployed in each of the city's 133  administrative districts (prefectures). A distinction is being  drawn between territorial and mobile forces (operational  detachments), which could be attached to a city detachment.    E. Bakirov, vice premier in Luzhkov's government, has been  made commander of the "blue army." The latter is also  appointing the leadership of a city staff for the people's  militiamen. The government is funding these forces through its  own finance department, and the transport department is  supplying them with automobiles and fuel.    Anyone who served in the USSR MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] Internal Troops will see parallels when glancing at the  statute on these formations. Personnel are paid for their  service. They can check documents, detain people, and  collaborate with Federal Counterintelligence Service forces, and  they will be trained by specialists from the city staff for  civil defense and emergency situations. They can be used in  operations to maintain order. And, let us observe, the decree  was even sent to the capital's military commandant for  compliance. The numerical strength of the people's militias is  being estimated at a minimum of 3,000 and a maximum of  5,000-6,000 men.    Of course, crime has to be combated and order maintained.  But this must be done only according to the law. And there is  no law on people's militias. Is the innovation by the capital's  top brass consequently illegal? It turns out that it is in fact  forming its own structure of repression which is subordinate to  Luzhkov. (This is in addition to the forces of the Internal  Affairs Main Administration and municipal militia, which are  already subordinate to him). But if there are normative acts  which regulate the activity of both militiamen and security  firms' employees and which allow someone who has suffered at  their hands to defend their rights in court, what is to be done  here? After all, it is impossible to take to court a force  which does not figure in the laws. This could lead to  large-scale tyranny.    Generally there is no understanding of what a "people's  militia" actually is. In the West there are people who  voluntarily assist the police. But their function is to report  disturbances by radio and telephone. Although they are paid,  this is still a form of amateur civilian activity. But a de  facto police body with the attributes of a standing army is  being set up from the top in Moscow under City Hall and the  prefectures. The Moscow government will maintain it and appoint  and remove its command personnel. It is not a people's but a  government militia!    Would it not be better if it were designed to protect the  security of citizens and strengthen legal militia structures  consisting of professionals, not amateurs?    Thus, the formation of the "blue army" in Moscow is  illegal, a burden on the treasury, and senseless from the  viewpoint of maintaining law and order. But it does strengthen  the personal power of Mr. Luzhkov, who, as mayor and head of the  city government, already manages the 9-million-strong city's  land, buildings, property, budget, and tax service practically  unchecked. He is just like the Prince of Moscow.  Notwithstanding the fact that Russian laws do not contain the  concepts of a "mayor," "prefect," or "head of the city  government." This also violates the treaty on social accord,  which prohibits the creation of militarized formations. The  mayor has successfully gotten around this by using Khrushchev's  old pretext of a "people's militia."    This is very reminiscent of the formation of Nazi  stormtrooper detachments. And Napoleon III, in order to  suppress the people, formed "garde mobile" detachments from  declasse elements. Of the kind, let us observe, of which  present-day Moscow is chock full, including people from the  so-called "near abroad" countries. Apart from them, various  political militants and criminal groupings currently  masquerading as security firms are sure to rush in closed ranks  into the power structure to which the city authority has given  its blessing.    In general, there are grounds for concern. Security firms'  employees have already been used in 1992 to evict residents of a  block on Taganka when it was handed over to the "Khoreks [as  transliterated] Center" joint enterprise, in which the city  government has a share of the profits. The same year a  federation of young law-enforcement clubs tried to seize the  Oktyabrskiy Rayon Soviet building by agreement with the Central  Administrative District prefect. Security firms have been used  many times as "forceful arguments" in disputes over premises.  What will the formation of "gardes mobiles" under the  prefectures bring? In October 1992 similar internal affairs  main administration forces cleared a block in Nagatino of the  large families which were occupying it.    So it would be better if Mr. Luzhkov did not break the law.  He has more than enough power as it is.</p>

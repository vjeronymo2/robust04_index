			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Nam Son-hyon from New York] </F>   [Text] The UN Security Council [UNSC] had planned to hold  an emergency countermeasure meeting to discuss North Korea's  nuclear issue early this morning [Korean time]. It is reported,  however, that because the individual countries had not  fined-tuned their position, they agreed to hold a meeting on  Tuesday, 31 May, after making informal contacts between member  countries.    The UNSC member countries had planned to convene an  emergency  countermeasure meeting today, Sunday, with a view to hastily  adopting a statement of warning or a resolution pointing out the  seriousness of the situation to North Korea which has been  making haste in replacing fuel rods more than necessary.    But, there is a prevailing opinion that it will take more  time to fine-tune the opinions of not only permanent members,  but of other members as well and that it is desirable to further  watch the attitude of the North Korean side. As a result,  well-informed sources have said that it was agreed among member  countries to hold a countermeasure meeting this upcoming 31 May.    In today's informal contacts between UNSC members, the U.S.  side asked China to exercise a strong influence on North Korea  to immediately stop replacing fuel rods. The Great Britain and  France advocated adopting a statement calling again for holding  negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and  North Korea while sending out a warning about the seriousness of  the present situation. But, it is reported that the Chinese  stressed the need to deal with this question with prudence as  well as to have dialogue with North Korea with patience.</p>

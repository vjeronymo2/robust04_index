			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 30 (XINHUA) -- A hundred thousand  callers per day dial 168 for Shanghai's telephone information  service -- and most of the callers want information about  banking or sex.    The round-the-clock service is about to celebrate its first  birthday -- and a survey has shown which section is most  consulted by the public.    The service was set up in June last year by the municipal  telecommunications bureau.    When a caller dials 168, he or she hear a recording listing  the numbers for the available subjects. A second call will  provide recorded information on that topic.    The list includes general knowledge on psychology, sex,  family, banking, foreign exchange, stocks and shares, mainland  entry and exit formalities, and a special service for foreigners.    "Most of the daily 100,000 calls were for banking  information  and general knowledge about sex," said Chen Qiang, deputy head  of the center said.    "This indicates the rise of Shanghai people's sense of  banking and investment. Nowadays, more and more people who are  embarrassed to ask for sex general knowledge face to face with  the experts like to make a phone call," he said.    Chen said that Shanghai was the third city after Nanhai  city,  Guangdong Province, and Haikou, capital of Hainan Province, to  open such a phone service, which has been praised by residents,  the municipal government and experts.</p>

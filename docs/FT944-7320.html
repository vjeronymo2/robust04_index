			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Record low for deaths at work Fatal accidents at work are at a record low level, the Health and Safety Commission said yesterday, Richard Donkin writes. Provisional figures in the commission's annual report for 1993-94 said that 379 people were killed at work during the year, compared with 452 in 1992-93. Recorded injuries which caused three or more days' absence from work fell by more than 8,000 to 134,000 - but the real figure, including unreported accidents, is believed to be three times greater. Welcoming the reduction in accidents, the Trades Union Congress said the commission's measures could have saved the economy more than Pounds 200m last year because of a reduction in the number of reportable injuries.</p>

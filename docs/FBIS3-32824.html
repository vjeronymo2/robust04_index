He will issue a brief message on the  topics he had discussed recently, when he had no contact with  you. Then we will have a question and answer segment. Kindly  identify yourselves and the media you represent, as is the  custom in this conference room, whenever you ask your questions.  Here is President Carlos Roberto Reina.    [Reina] Dear Juan Ramon Duran and dear friends of the press  and the different media. I fulfill my word of being in constant  contact with you. I have come to briefly tell you about the  latest events -- they are not momentous news but they reveal the  progress achieved by our thesis of the moral revolution. Today  I had the great satisfaction of talking with members of the  Armed Forces, at the highest level, about an issue that has  caused great interest in the Honduran nation: military service.    During our campaign we defined military service as a  voluntary and educational service, and there is a proposal from  the Armed Forces, at the highest level, for a constitutional and  educational military service. I have heard an excellent  exposition by Colonel [Jose Luis] Nunez Bennet and I think his  conclusions convey the great historical moment which currently  prevails in Honduras. In other words, this is part of what we  called a consultation, which begins with a great dialogue, an  open dialogue, a dialogue among equals, a fraternal dialogue,  and which leads to conclusions and recommendations from either  side on the way we will understand ourselves, meaning all the  Hondurans.    If Honduras wins prestige, all its institutions win  prestige.  If Honduras' image deteriorates, all its institutions are  harmed; it is that simple, and if we improve it, we all improve.  I think one of the conclusions that were reached is excellent:  that the forceful recruitment used by the Armed Forces until  April 1993 was negative and harmful for the image of the armed  institution. I think this is a classy act that reflects high  awareness.    What young men and their mothers, fathers, brothers, and  sisters thought about the way in which people were taken away,  in a somewhat unusual manner, to render military service was  detrimental to the Armed Forces' prestige. We said this during  our campaign and they fully recognize it.    I also recognize the fact there has been no political will  to  organize institutions in Honduras because their organization  entails starting a different period in the country's history.  That is why I believe this consultation is part of what we have  called the moral revolution, meaning a dialogue that will lead  us to a consensus and will allow us to advance on the road  toward the human development we have proposed. The new Armed  Forces' role in times of peace. We have to consult on that; we  have to discuss that; we have to review the theory of the  Honduran people's safety.    Regarding problems with the police, there will be no  discrepancy about creating a technical, scientific police that  guarantees rights and procedures to find the truth, instead of  the procedures that resulted in so much negative publicity about  Honduras. The Armed Forces say its members are aware that  mistakes were made in the past and this discouraged the citizens  from fulfilling their patriotic duty of rendering military  service. Those are beautiful words stated by the corps, which  should bring prestige to Honduras by fulfilling its  constitutional duties.    One of the recommendations is that the political will be  expressed. I have already expressed the political will in my  status as president of the Republic in order to establish an  Army for peace, development, and the well-being of our people.    I think it is an excellent recommendation that the Education  Ministry provide its full support to the Armed Forces to provide  education there too. I reiterate their recommendations, which I  have praised very much. That moral and civic education be  included in the study plans and programs for elementary and  secondary schools. These classes were eliminated as a result of  suggestions from abroad, but today all Hondurans without  exception realize that this hurts the solidarity of the national  identity. Furthermore, that discipline be instilled in citizens  at schools at all levels because discipline is a basic factor  for the development of the society.    With this, and proposing to them that we form a joint  commission of the Armed Forces and the government of the  Republic to discuss compulsory military service, I have received  their proposal and will appoint a commission to begin discussing  the compulsory military service, in a conscious manner and with  full competence. This is one of the points that I wanted to  mention to you.    There are other points that have been mentioned, which are  still being studied, in regard to the so-called Trifinio Project  which is located near Ocotepeque, the Armed Forces Budget, the  reorganization of the Armed Forces, and the police.    I am, thus, very satisfied with the dialogue we have held  and  I am convinced that we are on the right path to reaching a  concerted agreement that will produce national theses that we  will all defend.    I am at your disposal for any question or any concern.    If there is no air conditioning, it is the fault of KNEE  [National Enterprise for Electric Power] and not of the  presidency. [Laughter] But, we will try to provide you with all  the comforts, as I told you before.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] however, there is  something that currently concerns the Honduran people in the  economic field.    There is an IMF mission in Honduras and it logically causes  concern among the Honduran people. Could you tell us anything  about the topics that have been discussed with the mission?  And, is it true that the Honduran Government has already agreed  to increase the electricity rates, tolls, and other services?  Is there any truth in the rumors circulating this morning?    [Reina] The arrival of the IMF representatives must be taken  as it is, and not as a ghost that comes to threaten or impose on  us. We are a sovereign country, but 40 percent of our budget is  dedicated to paying the foreign debt -- immense amounts of money  that disappeared during very regrettable periods in our history.    I believe this is the first discussion, there is still no  letter of intent. But, what I do guarantee to the Honduran  people and to the majorities of this people, is that we will not  accept, under any circumstance, that sales taxes be increased  because those deeply hurt the poor majorities of Honduras.  Other things are being discussed, other possibilities, but I  have still not received the report from the economic cabinet.    I met with them this morning, but to discuss a topic that I  find to be passionate: solidarity -- this is a contribution from  Mexico. To implement what in that country has been called the  Solidarity [Program]. What does it consist of? That the people  cooperate for their own benefit, for their own well-being.    Honduran boards of trustees are organizations that have not  functioned too well. They become sectarian, fight each other,  neutralize each other. We have to have neighborhood residents  improve their own living conditions with government and  international aid. This approach has yielded good results in  Mexico. I studied it this morning with the Economic Cabinet and  feel very optimistic about it.    The fare issue has not yet been decided. The Honduran poor  majorities should not be taxed. The possibility of taxing  either the poor or other social sectors is what is being  debated. The final decision, however, will be made by the  Honduran Government. The IMF, as an international organization,  is not as tough as before. I can say this because I have talked  with them in Washington and Honduras. Their purpose is similar  to ours: to favor the majority of the people. Together, we will  be able to face the foreign debt without hurting the Honduran  people.    [Reporter] The people want to know whether taxes will be  increased and when a decision will be made regarding raising  electricity rates and those of other public services.    [Reina] The matter is under discussion, and there will soon  be a solution, and this government's philosophy is to avoid  hurting the poor majority of Honduras. I think this is a very  clear and truthful idea.    [Reporter] A list of three candidates for Social Security  Fund director has been presented to you. It has been reported  that you turned down this first list. What can you tell us  about this?    [Reina] I tell you frankly, Walter, such a list has not been  presented to me, although I have been told it would be brought  to me. When it is indeed sent to me, I will study it and  appoint someone who can understand the true nature of social  security. I will appoint the most capable person. For the time  being, we have designated Dr. Ogden Rodriguez in the position.  It was said a number of times that he had been discriminated  against, that he was unpopular, things like that. It is  impossible for all capable men to be appointed. Nevertheless,  we will gradually correct the situation. Early in March, I will  present a report to the Honduran people. It is necessary that I  sum up thoroughly the condition of the country when I receive  it. This will be done early in March. Many things will be  clarified, things that have been touched upon only slightly in  an effort to keep in touch with you journalists constantly.    [Reporter] Much was said about privatization during the  previous administration. This is my first question. Will you  privatize the National Enterprise for Electric Power and  Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]? My second  question is this: The National Party has already accused your  administration of nepotism. Does nepotism exist here? How will  you handle the pressure from liberal activists regarding job  applications?    [Reina] I will answer your questions with pleasure, Ms.  Diaz.  First of all, privatization as such is neither good nor bad. It  depends on what is privatized and how it is done. A  privatization process that is not clear, that is not absolutely  honest, ends up being a disaster, because it would turn out to  be a huge swindle against our people. The sale of assets worth  many millions [currency not specified] would be mishandled, and  the people would pay the consequences. If we were to privatize,  we would do so under local and foreign audits to ensure absolute  purity and to the defend the interest of the workers of the  companies involved. Two factors would have to be considered:  absolute honesty and respect for the rights of those who work in  the enterprises.    But those are issues that will be discussed in the future.  What are we going to do if half of the Honduran budget is  destined to pay a debt and the other half to pay employees? It  is a country that cannot continue to function that way. We must  defend our stability and identity with our assets. This is one  of the areas that must be tackled.    Nepotism is a vice of politics. But what can I do if I have  many distant relatives who worked hard during the campaign. Am  I going to stigmatize them or deprive them of some rights? The  fact that Jorge Arturo Reina, my brother, could become and  became Congress vice president has nothing to do with Carlos  Roberto Reina. He has his own image, his own leadership. That  cannot be considered nepotism. Nepotism is when one person  appoints his relatives to exclude those persons with merits.    Some people said a relative of mine -- a very distant  relative I should note -- would be education minister. However,  some people said he was a very close relative of mine. I am not  going to commit those mistakes. However, I am not going to  deprive someone who has worked and has merit and solvency to be  a soldier of the moral revolution of the right to a position  because they [words indistinct] I am not going to deprive that  person of that right.    Regarding influence peddling, I call on my fellow party  members.... [pauses] How long did I wait to get to this post?  Half a century. Can't they wait a few days? They said all  government appointments have been made. I have just appointed  the ministers. Other people are telling party members they have  been left out. They say: Do you see how they used you? They  just used you to get there. And that person becomes nervous. I  ask you for patience. I am asking for nothing I did not have.  I was very patient in putting up with injustices, humiliations,  [word indistinct] I ask you to wait for some time while we solve  the problems of giving some compensation to Liberal Party of  Honduras [PLH] members who were dismissed from the government by  the previous administration for their political party  affiliation. I think this is logical.    The government must not be sectarian. It must be for all  Hondurans who will choose the best persons for public office.    [Villanueva] Armando Villanueva of EL HERALDO. [Words  indistinct] not to approve new direct taxes against the people.  But what will happen with indirect taxes? For instance, it has  been said a new toll collection system will be implemented and  also [words indistinct]. In the end, industrialists and  businessmen pass these increases on to consumers and it is  ultimately the people who suffer the consequences.    On the other hand, I would like to know if your government  will reactivate this commission to oversee [words indistinct]  last administration, whatever it's called, to oversee public  officials?    [Reina] A highway toll system operates in many countries. It  is in place in San Pedro Sula and there is no problem. The  thing is that people must have alternatives. If you want to  travel on a paved road, then pay for it. If you don't want to  pay, then use the dirt road. This gives people an alternative  and is in place in many countries of the world. We all pay it  because no one [words indistinct] because he has to pay one  lempira.    Regarding the other issue, the customs value factor is  another topic currently being discussed. But if we permit taxes  to be passed on to the poor, we would not be doing anything. We  are working to prevent that from happening. This would permit  us to really protect the poor majorities of this country.    Regarding fares, this is a very broad issue. I ask you  [words indistinct] is it fair for a person who lives in Las  Lomas del Guifarro neighborhood to pay the same as someone who  lives in Alemania neighborhood? There was a time when both the  multimillionaire and worker paid 12 lempiras to the  municipality. Is this fair? This is what we are discussing.  The same holds true for water and electricity service. These  are issues that are still under discussion, which involve the  social justice we have always talked about.    The easier thing to do would be to increase prices of basic  market basket products and medicines for the defenseless. But  we are not going to do that.    [Words indistinct] this and many other intervention  commissions so that they find out what is happening or happened  in such state institutions as Cohdefor [Honduran Forest  Development Corporation], Conadi [National Investment  Corporation], and Banasupro [National Supply Agency for Basic  Products]. In an article for EL HERALDO, I called what happened  in the said companies the blank books. The people should know  what happened in each of these institutions.    [Boza] Mr. President, Ramuel [name indistinct] Boza of Radio  Tegucigalpa. I want to know if you [words indistinct]  governments have had a difficult situation regarding the  increase in urban transportation fares, which have been  maintained. Will you allow an increase in transportation fares  that will affect the Honduran people, especially in Tegucigalpa  and San Pedro Sula?    On the other hand, pharmacists have said they have no  alternative but to increase the price of medicine because each  day the price of the dollar continues to increase with regard to  the lempira. These are my two questions, Mr. President.    [Reina] Both questions concern the entire population. I will  never authorize an increase in the price of medicines or  transportation fares, because that can topple a government.  That is what made the Venezuelan people explode, when new taxes  were implemented. The challenge we have ahead of us is finding  ways to increase our revenues quickly without affecting the  majority; that is what we are doing. We are intensively seeking  those measures, which the economic cabinet will announce at a  news conference in due time.    [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Reina, public employees are  afraid of the possibility of mass dismissals. A few minutes  ago, you said that the activists of the PLH must be patient. In  this regard, how will your government fill some vacancies  without engaging in the famous mass dismissals, on one hand? On  the other hand, how far will your government go in the  investigation of some transactions made in the past, one of them  called the big car [el carrazo] scandal, so that those  responsible will be punished and do not escape the arm of the  law, as is customary?    [Reina] We are going to appoint you to the commission that  will investigate this affair. [laughter] We have already  appointed a commission that will investigate those cases so that  those who looted this country are punished. This is a firm  decision by our government.    The other thing is a problem. Can we continue to have  sinecures in many offices, where 50 percent of the employees  don't do anything because they got their jobs thanks to past  administrations? We must review this situation and pay them  compensation, but there is no money. We are seeking a solution  to this situation. We must get the money and keep the  employees. We will not fire anyone out of sectarianism.  Sectarianism is a vice, it is a disease. A good employee must  not be dismissed. How much did the state pay to train that  employee? But if he is a sinecure and this phenomenon is  widespread, how are we going to advance with such heavy  bureaucratic burdens.    To me, the most appropriate thing is to evaluate the  personnel, respect the abilities of public employees, and apply  justice at the bureaucratic level. If someone was dismissed as  a result of sectarianism by previous administrations, it is  necessary to reinstate that person, provided that he fulfills  the requirements of the post.    With respect to the big car incident, it is already being  investigated. You have already heard statements by the deputy  finance minister and he is very committed to solving this issue.    [Reporter] In reference to decisions involving the selective  military service which I believe will bring relief to our youth,  will there be a government commission? What are your intentions  in this respect? [Passage indistinct] Do you have any names?    [Reina] I still do not have any names. We first have to  consult with some of the candidates to see if they agree since  they might have to resign afterwards due to lack of time.  However, I believe that we must meet with them sometime between  today and tomorrow. We will announce the decision afterwards.  I thank you for being here today and I am at your disposal.</p>

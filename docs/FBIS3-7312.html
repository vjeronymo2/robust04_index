Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, one of the  seven coalition parties, told a press conference that common  defense and energy policies are particularly important.    Ichikawa's remark alluded to policy differences between the  Buddhist-backed Komeito and the largest party in the coalition,  the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which has long been opposed  to the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] and nuclear power plants.    Ichikawa, who along with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, is viewed as a key coalition  strategist, urged the SDP to break away from its longstanding  basic stance that the SDF is unconstitutional and that Japan  should promote development of safer energy sources as a  substitute for nuclear power stations.</p>

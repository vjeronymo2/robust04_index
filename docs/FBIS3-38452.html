Most recently the MiG-29 (tactical NATO name "Fulcrum") has  been flown in Malaysia and India, and by the German Bundeswehr  and the Hungarian Air Force. Only in the Austrian Army, where  successors for the Draken interceptors that date back to the  1950's, are currently being considered, is restraint being  exercised.    For John Gudenus, Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] deputy,  who  is himself an Army colonel, this is completely incomprehensible:  "There is not even an attempt to negotiate, even though this  would be the most elegant way to somehow get back the 54.7  billion schillings in debts that Russia has accrued in Austria."    The deal that Gudenus proposes -- weapons in return for a  remission of debts -- has been made by others: At the end of  last year Slovakia bought Russian weapons for 2.1 billion  schillings, including five single-seater and one two-seater MiG-  29's.    However, these Russian combat planes (equipped with six  missiles and a fixed cannon) have the disadvantage of requiring  more fuel and maintenance than modern aircraft of Western  standards. In order to counter the high maintenance costs,  Slovakia has established its own repair yard, 120 km from  Bratislava. Slovakia is reportedly interested in having this  yard work to capacity through maintenance cooperation with  others who use this kind of aircraft.    Gudenus: "Such a procurement would also have the advantage  of sending a political signal: It would make it easier for  Russia to regain its credit standing and, at the same time,  Russia would not constantly be pushed into the role of the evil  one."    The FPOe expert also advocates buying other weapons and  equipment from Russia -- from the S-300 antiaircraft missile to  the wheeled armored vehicle (BTR-70, BTR-80) to the Mi-24 combat  helicopter ("Hind"). The latter was not taken over by the  Bundeswehr from the stocks of the National People's Army (to the  displeasure of the German Audit Office), which was justified by  pointing to operating costs and a lack of compatibility with  NATO equipment.    Says Gudenus bitterly: "As long as our Army is not  compatible with the European level in terms of defense, we need  not be worried about compatibility with the West." In addition,  we are more acquainted with Russian components and instruments,  because they work with metric measures while U.S. suppliers  stick with the imperial scale.</p>

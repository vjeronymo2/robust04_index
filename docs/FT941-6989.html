			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Unit Trusts (4): Check how they've performed - Once you have made up your mind to invest, the most important factor is consistency. And there are several publications that monitor statistics Unit trusts have had good reason to be grateful to personal equity plans. Last year, a record Pounds 9.1bn was poured into the industry, with private investors accounting for Pounds 5bn of this net investment (gross investment less redemptions). They chose to channel nearly two-thirds of their money through a personal equity plan, attesting to the sustained popularity of Peps as a way of investing in equity markets. Both unit and investment trusts benefited from the decision by former chancellor Norman Lamont to lift the Pounds 3,000 limit on collective-fund Pep investment from the 1992 tax year. Some restrictions still remain. A unit trust must have more than 50 per cent of the fund invested in Europe to qualify for the full general Pep allowance of Pounds 6,000. The many unit trusts that do not meet this requirement are 'non-qualifying', and only Pounds 1,500 of the fund can be invested in the Pep. The remaining Pounds 4,500 of the allowance can be made up with qualifying trusts, investment trusts or shares. An investor contemplating a Pep will find that unit trusts have the advantage over investment trusts, at least in terms of charges, because many unit trust managers will put the investment into a Pep for no extra cost. This means that anyone who wants to make a unit trust investment may as well shelter some of it in a Pep (see article on charges, on page 4). If your chosen trust does not have a Pep attached to it, you will have to use a self-select Pep, but there will be additional charges, since most plan managers will levy an annual fee and are likely to charge for the collection of dividends. Moreover, some unit trust companies offer lower initial charges for direct investment, but the same reduction may not be on offer to private investors buying through the self-select route. On the other hand, some stockbrokers are able to obtain discounts on the initial charge of a large number of unit trusts. Once you have run through the arguments and decided to invest in a unit, rather than investment, trust, the main criteria for choosing the Pep will be the performance of the unit trust company. The most important characteristic to look out for is consistency of performance. The FT's sister publication, Money Management magazine, carries performance statistics every month, and the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance also publishes tables ranking the growth of the leading unit trusts over five years. These publications divide unit trusts into a large number of different sectors, categorised mainly by regions but also by income and growth. Chase de Vere Investments produces performance charts ranking only those unit trusts with a Pep attached to them. It divides these into those that are qualifying and non-qualifying. The performance charts are published every six months, and the most recent copy is available with Chase de Vere's annual Pep Guide*, which gives details of managers and their charging structures. Meanwhile, the tables on this page show the top-performing qualifying and non-qualifying unit trusts in the three years to January 1. It should be noted that these are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis, which means that the initial charges have not been taken into account - the actual returns to investors will have been lower. The figures also assume reinvestment of gross income. The top 10 qualifying trusts are spread across a number of different sectors, including the specialist smaller companies and those which are income-oriented. The top-performing non-qualifying trusts are more narrowly focused, and reflect the impressive growth over the past three years of emerging markets, particularly in the Far East. Apart from performance and charges, investors should choose according to their investment needs. An investor in his late twenties may be happy to use up part of his Pep allowance in emerging markets, but this may not appeal to someone in the prime of life who hopes that the Pep will supplement their pension. unit trust companies try to make the choice easier by packaging their products to appeal to specific groups of people, although this does not mean it is not worth the precaution of taking independent financial advice. Fidelity, for example, recently launched two new Peps, one for first-time investors and the other for those specifically saving for retirement. The Moneybuilder Pep is attached to the company's existing fund of funds unit trust. Technical changes have been made to the trust, to ensure that it remains fully-qualifying. Mary Blair, director of product development, says the product is particularly good for first-time investors, because it acts like a managed fund and gives exposure to global as well as UK and European markets. As a special offer, the 2 per cent initial charge on the Pep is halved until March 11. The UK Dividend Growth fund is a new Fidelity unit trust, investing in UK companies with the ability to grow dividends of between 8-10 per cent a year. Since the dividends will be reinvested, the idea is that this will help produce a large lump sum which can be taken tax-free on retirement, or after 10-15 years. The initial charge on the Retirement Income Builder (the name of the Pep attached to the fund) is 2 per cent and, in line with all Fidelity Peps, exit charges also apply. Minimum investment in both new Peps is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 regular monthly savings. Some unit trust companies will allow you to split your Pep between its funds, but it is harder to find any that will let another company's funds be included. A step was made in this direction earlier this year, when Skandia Life launched a type of umbrella Pep fund, allowing investors to split their Pep allowance between different unit trust management groups or to switch out of one company's fund and into another's, without having to pay a transfer fee or the full initial charge on the new unit trust. Instead, the initial charge is between 0.25-0.5 per cent. The choice is not limitless, but it includes some of the best names. The Multipep offers 30 funds from 12 providers - Fidelity, Gartmore, James Capel, Morgan Grenfell, Baring, Schroder, Perpetual, Framlington, Henderson, Abtrust, Credit Suisse and Jupiter Tyndall Merlin. Because of the low switching charges, Skandia says that an investor putting Pounds 6,000 a year into a Pep, and deciding after three years to transfer to another provider, would usually pay about Pounds 900 for doing so (assuming a 5 per cent initial charge on a total investment of Pounds 18,000). The cost within the Multipep would be Pounds 63, according to Skandia. However, there is a price to pay for this flexibility. The initial charge on the Multipep is 4.5-5 per cent, which is lower than the standard unit trust initial charge; but Skandia imposes its own annual fee of 0.5 per cent on top of the fee charged by the manager, so that the total annual fee will vary between 1.5 and 2 per cent. Over time, annual fees have much more of an effect on performance than initial charges. Moreover there is a dividend-collection charge of Pounds 5 for one payment a year down to Pounds 2 a dividend for 12 payments. * Pepguide, 12th edition, Chase de Vere Investments, 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3JX: Pounds 9.95 (incl postage &amp; packing).  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Top ten qualifying unit trusts over three years: Pounds 1,000 invested  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                  Trust                       3 years (pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hill Samuel              UK Emerging Companies       2,846.25 St James's Place         PEP Progressive             2,566.84 Perpetual                High Income                 2,384.46 Pembroke                 Pembroke                    2,294.53 Perpetual                PEP Growth                  2,285.54  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Providence Capitol       European                    2,265.42 N&amp;P                      Higher Income               2,248.04 Newton                   General                     2,239.43 Credit Suisse            High Income Portfolio       2,237.30 Baillie Gifford          UK Smaller Companies        2,226.54  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Offer-to-offer, gross income reinvested Source: Chase de Vere Investments (January 1 1994)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------    Top ten non-qualifying unit trusts over three years: Pounds 1,000                               invested  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company               Trust                           3 years (pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Providence Capitol    Hong Kong                       5,071.30 Providence Capitol    Thailand                        4,714.62 Perpetual             Asian Smaller Markets           4,354.26 Morgan Grenfell       Asian Trader                    4,157.07 Save &amp; Prosper        SE Asia Growth                  3,757.84  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Providence Capitol    Emerging Asia                   3,514.28 Abtrust               Far East Emerging Economies     3,408.69 Manulife              Far East                        3,383.70 Baring                Eastern                         3,261.00 Perpetual             Interntional Emerging Companies 3,188.79  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Offer-to-offer, gross income reinvested Source: Chase de Vere Investments (January 1 1994)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

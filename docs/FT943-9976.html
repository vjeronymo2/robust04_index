			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Charter urged to raise Esab offer price Charter, the UK industrial group, will this week face trade union opposition and widespread complaints about its offer price for Esab of Sweden, as it seeks a complete takeover of the world's leading producer of welding equipment. Esab announces its half-year results today, and an expected surge in profits is likely to heighten Swedish calls for Charter to raise its bid and increase doubts over whether the UK company can secure the acceptance of 90 per cent of shareholders for the takeover by Friday's deadline. Charter already holds 53 per cent of Esab following its Pounds 260m recommended bid in late June. It secured 49 per cent of the voting capital from Incentive, the industrial group run by the Wallenberg family that was previously Esab's controlling shareholder. Since then, Esab's share price has risen, wiping out the 20 per cent premium originally offered by Charter. Last week, Esab shares stood at around SKr350, above the bid price of SKr345. The blue- and white-collar trade unions at Esab have come out strongly against the Charter takeover, fearing the UK company will shift production and control away from Sweden. They will this week appeal to institutional shareholders not to accept the offer. Mr Henrik Wikman, senior portfolio manager at Wasa Life, which holds a 3 per cent voting stake in Esab, said he did not share the trade unions' objections. But he described the Charter bid as 'stingy'. 'It might be difficult to complete at the price they have set, but we have made no final decision yet.' Analysts in Stockholm expect Esab to report six-month pre-tax profits of around SKr175m (Pounds 14.7m), against SKr23m last year. Many anticipate profits growing faster than the company's forecast, issued before the Charter bid, of full-year profits of SKr300m. 'The feeling is Charter is buying too cheap,' said one senior analyst. Charter, however, insisted last week that it had no intention of changing its offer. 'People are trying to test our mettle, They would like more money,' said Mr Charles Parker, Charter commercial director. 'I think whatever price we had agreed this would have happened.'</p>

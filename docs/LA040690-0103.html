			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: KIVA GRILL FEATURES STYLE AND PLENTY OF LEGUME  </P> <P> The menu at Kiva Grill opens with black bean nachos and closes with a sabana of  pounded steak rolled around black beans.  </P> <P> The black bean appears with such frequency at this new Golden Triangle  restaurant, in fact, that to dine in ignorance of it would be to not know beans  about the culinary thrust of the place. There is black bean soup and black bean  relish, and a bowl or hillock of black beans attends most entrees as garnish.  </P> <P> The Spaniards who brought black beans to this hemisphere most likely did not  foresee that this legume one day would be a fashionable adjunct to a modish  style of cooking called Southwestern cuisine. But Southwestern is ever so  trendy these days, as is Kiva Grill and the handsome, brand-new Aventine  development in which it is situated.  </P> <P> Like the three other eateries in the Aventine's instantly popular restaurant  row, Kiva Grill pays immense attention to style and a good degree of attention  to the cooking. Plate decorating counts for much, and artistic squiggles of  sour cream and red and green sauces run across various preparations like the  bands of color applied to Hopi pottery.  </P> <P> The place is done up in the turquoise and coral shades that are virtual  trademarks of contemporary Southwest style, and, if the emphasis seems a touch  corny when it runs to such things as the steer skull mounted over the  fireplace, it is likable for the live cactus plantings and the open exhibition  kitchen. For the Indians of the New Mexico pueblos, the kiva was a special room  set aside for occasions of ceremony and circumstance, and the restaurant  presents itself as such a place.  </P> <P> Southwestern cuisine in modern parlance is one of those nouvelle things that  doesn't mind being labeled but is terribly difficult to pin down. Certainly, it  is based on traditional Southwestern cooking, an amalgam of American Indian,  Spanish and Mexican styles tempered a bit by the tastes of settlers from east  of the Mississippi.  </P> <P> As generally practiced today, it means any ingredients prepared in the  Southwestern style, with chilies, cilantro, cumin, pine nuts and other flavor  accents playing large roles. As defined by Kiva Grill, it involves not only  novel approaches to traditional foods, but a lot of updated Mexican cooking  that will be familiar to anyone who ever has bitten into a burrito or  enchilada.  </P> <P> The restaurant bills itself as a grill and takes the appellation seriously --  even the green salsa quemada that accompanies the frequently replenished fresh  tortillas is grilled, an unusual fate for a sauce, but one that gives the  cilantro-based relish a deep tang of mesquite smoke. There are also smoked  vegetable fajitas and a blackened swordfish, the latter of which sounds like an  unprecedented case of Southwestern cooking meeting ersatz New Orleans Cajun  cuisine.  </P> <P> The tortillas, which issue constantly from the kitchen's tortilla corner, are  themselves a good appetizer and can be dressed with the spicy red sauce or  orange-flavored honey butter offered as alternatives to the smoked green sauce.  There are many other choices, though, including dressy nachos -- the crisp  chips are made with both regular and blue corn -- garnished with a choice of  beans, smoked chicken, steak, carnitas or lobster and shrimp; a quesadilla  garnished with what the kitchen is pleased to call "green chile pesto" (how  Southwestern! how nouvelle!); a ceviche of sea bass, and small tamales filled  with chicken. The black bean soup, served as a thin and nicely textured puree,  has a good depth of flavor to it.  </P> <P> The two most notable starters are prepared at table, one of the small  pretensions of this restaurant that pays good results. The first of these, the  queso fundido, extends the usual melted cheese-chorizo sausage combination with  corn relish and chopped tomatoes, which the server folds into a happily gooey  mess and encloses in warm, soft tortillas; a little red sauce spooned over the  filling works wonders, although the filling also is good plain. Guacamole  likewise is prepared at table, with the server scooping the flesh out of ripe  avocados and mashing it with cilantro, serrano chilies, onion, garlic, salt,  tomato and lime. The taste is, of course, quite fresh, and the texture much  more pleasing than the ready-made stuff served elsewhere. An order will feed  several comfortably.  </P> <P> The salads are entree-size, imaginative and, at $5.95 to $7.50, reasonably  priced. The blue-corn tostada crowns a base of crisp chips with an attractive  jumble of avocado, tomato, greens, roasted peppers and a choice of grilled  chicken or steak strips, and the warm fajita salad extends the choice of meat  garnish to include duck while varying the salad ingredients with the addition  of jicama, toasted pumpkin seeds and cucumber. A vinaigrette flavored with a  bit of jalapeno gives this salad a rather suave flavor.  </P> <P> The specifically Mexican entrees run from burritos -- filled with chicken and  mushrooms, lobster and shrimp and other items -- to chicken and carnitas  burritos and mesquite-grilled chiles rellenos. The lobster-shrimp enchiladas  are presented rather elegantly (if the tasty filling is somewhat sparsely  apportioned), with bands of red and green sauce streaked across them and side  garnishes of black beans and good, Mexican-style rice. This plate garnish,  sometimes extended by a crisp corn cake, accompanies most entrees.  </P> <P> The so-called Southwestern specialties, many or which seem like basic Mexican  dishes, range from a selection of fajitas to a chili-heated pozole verde filled  out with corn kernels and seafood. The Santa Fe shrimp varies San Diego's  beloved "shrimp scampi" with the addition of pine nuts to the sauce of white  wine and garlic, and there are two styles of carnitas, including the excellent  "soft tacos" filled not only with meat but also with shredded romaine and  chopped tomato and onion.  </P> <P> The torte Azteca makes quite a presentation piece, and is a raised cake of corn  tortillas layered with chicken, chilies and cheese, the whole smothered in a  burnt umber-colored sauce of subtle flavor and heat. The sabana, at $17.50 the  most extravagant dish by a good margin, consists of a filet steak that has been  flattened into a sheet, grilled, spread with mildly tangy red chili adobo paste  and rolled at table around a filling of scallions and black beans. It is  handsome, and the beef gains a great tenderness from the process, but perhaps  it ought to be finished in the kitchen. By the time the server had done his  work at the table, the meat was cool.  </P> <P> The Southwestern theme continues to the end, with a mango "creme brulee" that  is a misbegotten and sadly textured mess, but also with a pine nut brownie of  wonderful flavor and richness. Like other restaurants of its ilk, Kiva offers  specialty margaritas, of which the "Kivarita" is the lead item. Composed of  premium liquors, it is served in a shaker; these are good, and one goes a long  way. The list of wines by the glass, on the other hand, is ridiculously brief  and in some instances quite overpriced.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KIVA GRILL  </P> <P> 8970 University Lane  </P> <P> 558-8600  </P> <P> Lunch and dinner daily.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $30 to $65.  </P></p>

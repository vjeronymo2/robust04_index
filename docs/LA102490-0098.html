			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE PREP PATH;  </P> <P> WOODBRIDGE WOULD LIKE TO RECLAIM ITS PRESTIGIOUS POST, CRITTERS AND ALL  </P> <P> Termites.  </P> <P> As defined by Webster's, these little critters are "pale-colored insects having  a soft body and living in colonies composed of winged forms (and) very  destructive to wooden structures."  </P> <P> Creepy? Crawly? Totally disgusting?  </P> <P> Quite so.  </P> <P> But in Irvine, termites are a integral part of the Fence Post Trophy, the  prestigious -- albeit cruddy -- piece of wood awarded each year to the city's  top high school football team.  </P> <P> Since the award was initiated 12 years ago, hungry termites have called it  home. Others just call it hideous.  </P> <P> "Basically," Woodbridge Coach Rick Gibson said, "it looks like an ugly old  piece of fencing that someone decided to pick up and varnish. There's a plaque  (on the base) that says which team has won it every year, but outside of that,  it's very, very ugly."  </P> <P> But it's coveted nonetheless.  </P> <P> Friday night at 7:30, Woodbridge will have a chance to reclaim the Fence Post,  which it held from 1985 through 1988. The Warriors play University at Irvine  High School.  </P> <P> Irvine, which beat University in the season opener, was upset by Woodbridge two  weeks ago. If University beats Woodbridge Friday, a three-way tie will result,  forcing the Fence Post to its neutral location -- a local movie theater.  </P> <P> But a Woodbridge victory would make the Warriors the city champions once again.  </P> <P> "This is an intracity game," Gibson said. "Records, rankings mean nothing.  Nothing else matters."  </P> <P> Not even the bugs.  </P> <P> The trophy was actually renamed the Dennis Toohey Fence Post Trophy this year  in honor of a longtime Irvine football coach. Toohey coached many of the  players on the Irvine, Woodbridge and University teams.  </P> <P> Best matchup for the Woodbridge-University game is on the line, where  Woodbridge's Dae Kim meets University's Brian Riggs.  </P> <P> Kim is 5-feet-5, 180. Riggs is 5-6, 160.  </P> <P> "We call it 'The Battle of the Smurfs,' " Gibson said.  </P> <P> During his recruiting visit to Duke last weekend, Marina's Cherokee Parks was  sitting next to 8-year-old Jamie Krzyzewski, daughter of Blue Devil Coach Mike  Krzyzewski, at a team scrimmage.  </P> <P> Jamie watched Parks, a 6-foot-11 center, try unsuccessfully to break a small,  pen-sized piece of plastic in half.  </P> <P> She grabbed the piece of plastic from Parks. "If I break it in half, will you  come to Duke?" she asked.  </P> <P> "OK, you have six minutes," Parks told her.  </P> <P> Jamie twisted, bent, ripped and pulled. No good.  </P> <P> "My dad's gonna be real proud of me when I get you to come here," she said.  </P> <P> But after six minutes, the plastic was still intact.  </P> <P> No matter. Parks made an oral commitment to Duke Monday.  </P> <P> Jamie, who spent two hours on the task, sent the broken pieces to Parks as a  souvenir.  </P> <P> Leigh Steinberg, sports attorney to the stars, will be the key speaker at  tonight's fall meeting of the Orange County Athletic Directors.  </P> <P> The meeting starts at 6 p.m. at the Stadium Club at Anaheim Stadium. For  information, call Katella Athletic Director Tom Danley at 999-3647.  </P> <P> As a fifth-year assistant to Newport Harbor water polo Coach Bill Barnett, Dean  Crow knows what it's like to coach in one of the county's powerhouse programs.  </P> <P> But he also knows the other side.  </P> <P> Crow, 24, also is athletic director and girls' volleyball coach at tiny Pacific  Shores High, a private school in Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> At Newport Harbor, there are 40 players in the water polo program.  </P> <P> At Pacific Shores, there are 36 students.  </P> <P> At Newport, each position is three or four players deep.  </P> <P> At Pacific Shores, four girls went out for volleyball last year. The school did  manage to draw enough to put together a team this season.  </P> <P> At Newport Harbor, the Sailors have at one time or another been among the  county's best in football, water polo, swimming, volleyball, tennis, soccer,  cross-country, track. . . .  </P> <P> At Pacific Shores, the only sports offered are girls' volleyball, boys'  basketball and co-ed baseball.  </P> <P> "Yeah, there are definitely differences," Crow said. "The biggest is probably  that Pacific Shores has never had to forfeit a game (because of an ineligible  athlete)."  </P> <P> Crow helps out with the morning workouts at Newport Harbor and attends games,  then coaches Pacific Shores volleyball four afternoons a week. If there's a  conflict, he goes with the girls' volleyball team.  </P></p>

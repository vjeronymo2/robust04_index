			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities hit by uncertainty SHORT-TERM uncertainty now motivates Brazilian equities, according to Mr Alvaro A. Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa). The last few days seem to confirm Mr Vidigal's observation, writes Bill Hinchberger. At noon yesterday, the Bovespa index was down 2.2 per cent at 20,097. On Tuesday, it closed just 12 points off following a 6.6 per cent drop on Monday. On Friday it had registered a 10.6 per cent rebound. Although he remains bullish on the long term road to economic reform, Mr Vidigal admitted that the short term is 'unpredictable', mostly because of the political crisis engendered by allegations of corruption involving close associates of President Collor de Mello.</p>

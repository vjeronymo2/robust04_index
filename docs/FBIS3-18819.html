The poll showed how Berlusconi won the support of 32 percent  of those interviewed, followed by Segni with 24.5 percent and  the People's Party [Italian Popular Party], the ex-Christian  Democrats, with 12.9 percent and liberals with 8 percent, while  the Northern League was favored by only 6 percent of those  quizzed and the rightists of National Alliance, headed by the  neo-fascist MSI, came in at 2.5 percent.    The poll also asked sector organizations to list the  priorities and coming in first was a rationalization of the  taxation system for businesses, a general reduction in labor  costs and greater flexibility for hiring and firing.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hanson spells out cost of US strike THE US coal miners strike affecting some of Hanson's US coal mines could cut the Anglo-American conglomerate's profits by between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m in the fourth quarter of its current financial year which ends this month. The cost would continue at a similar rate as long as the strike continues at its current intensity, it emerged yesterday. The forecast appeared in a letter to shareholders of Quantum Chemical Corporation, the US group which has agreed to a bid from Hanson worth Dollars 3.3bn (Pounds 2.22bn), including the assumption of Dollars 2.5m of debt. The letter calls for a special meeting of Quantum shareholders for September 30 (Hanson's year end) to vote on the merger. The vote requires a two thirds majority of shares in issue. In the letter Hanson said the strike, which had hit 20 of its Peabody subsidiary's 22 mines and facilities, had cut profits by Pounds 29m in the third quarter of its year. It said talks between the coal operators association and the union had recommenced on August 11, but there was no guarantee that these would lead to an agreement by any particular date. The letter also shows that if Quantum accepts a higher offer from another bidder it would have to pay Hanson a Dollars 50m fee. This could deter other potential buyers, the letter said. Further, it says that nine officers of Quantum would share a lump sum payment of Dollars 18.7m if the merger goes through. An option scheme would be worth Dollars 11.9m to Quantum's executive officers and Dollars 1.64m to its non-employee directors. In the letter Quantum, which makes polyethylene and other chemicals, gives a forecast of operating profits for 1993 to 1997, although warning that the numbers could vary materially. The profit projection shows operating profits of Dollars 105.3m in 1993 rising to Dollars 546m by 1997, with net income moving from a loss of Dollars 102m in 1993 to a profit of Dollars 186.1m in 1997. The projection is based on forecasts of polyethylene volumes and prices, annual cost savings rising to Dollars 66m in 1997, and other factors including the receipt of a Dollars 32.1m insurance claim by the end of 1993. Hanson's shares fell 2 1/4 p to 257 1/2 p yesterday, although it has risen from 222 1/2 p since June 30 when the merger with Quantum was announced.</p>

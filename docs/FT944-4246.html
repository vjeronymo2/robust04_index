			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein names its Stormont delegation Two leading republicans who were instrumental in persuading the IRA to commit itself politically to the peace process lead the Sinn Fein delegation attending today's talks with government officials at the former parliament buildings in Stormont Castle. Mr Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein, and Mr Gerry Kelly have both served terrorist-related prison sentences. Mr McGuinness, an IRA commander in Derry in the 1970s, was convicted in the Republic of Ireland for being a member of the IRA. Mr Kelly was imprisoned for his part in an IRA bombing campaign in Northern Ireland. Although officially leading members of Sinn Fein, both retain strong links with the IRA leadership. In the past 18 months they have been involved as members of Sinn Fein in secret contacts with both the Irish and British governments, preparing the ground for the declaration of the IRA ceasefire at the end of August this year. The role of Mr McGuinness in tomorrow's talks - in the eyes of civil servants - will be as a broker between the republican movement's politicians and its hardline men-at-arms. Mr Kelly, an active republican from the Belfast area, was involved in a mass break-out from the Maze prison in 1983, and arrested three years later in the Netherlands. He was extradited to the UK where he served the remainder of a prison sentence related to terrorist offences. The Sinn Fein delegation was selected after a period of intense discussions in the republican movement, and in consultation with the IRA, where there is some unease at the continuance of the ceasefire. The delegation aims to be broadly representative of republican opinion. Delegates have been drawn from a wide geographical area and there is a strong presence of women. Among the leading delegates is Ms Lucilita Breathnach, general secretary of Sinn Fein since 1989. A polyglot, she is thought to be closely involved with developing international contacts on behalf of the party. Another is Ms Siobhan O'Hanlon, a member of the party's northern executive, who works closely with Mr Gerry Adams, the party's president, and will report to him. Mr Adams and other leading republicans plan to become involved in direct talks with the British government early next year. The fifth member of the Sinn Fein delegation is Mr Sean McManus, a former chairman of Sinn Fein and a member of the party's national executive. He is a district councillor in County Sligo, in the Republic of Ireland. A sixth member of Sinn Fein is expected to attend to take notes.</p>

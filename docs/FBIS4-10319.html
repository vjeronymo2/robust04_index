			<p>BFN     [Text] The weekly newspaper TRABAJADORES today published a  commentary by reporter Nicanor Leon Cotayo in which he details  the chaos and ambition prevailing within the anti-Cuban Radio  Marti.    In his commentary, Cotayo says that nine years after its  creation, this radio station has become a sort of convention of  chirping crickets hatching political plots. He also mentions the  tight control exerted on this station by the most reactionary  Miami circles headed by Jorge Mas Canosa.    The article adds that the U.S. Congress this year agreed to  finance the station with $19 million of the U.S. taxpayers'  money. But at the same time, it decided to withhold part of  those funds until an advisory panel reviews Radio Marti  activities and issues recommendations on the matter.    The manipulated objective of this anti-Cuban station is no  secret to anyone. Moreover, Florida Representative Lincoln  Diaz-Balart has said this station plays an important role in  U.S. policy on Cuba.    In conclusion, Cotayo states that the validity or lack of  validity of the role played by the radio station will be  established by a working group of the U.S. Information Agency,  but headed by the ultraconservative satellite, Jorge Mas Canosa.</p>

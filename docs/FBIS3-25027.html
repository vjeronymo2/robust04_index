Five hours were enough for the  government forces to take over the city. Luanda is blaming  UNITA. In an interview to RDP moments ago, spokesman for the  Angolan President Aldomiro da Conceicao said he hoped this would  not happen again:    [Begin Conceicao recording] I expect fighting will continue  in Cuito, but you should not blame the resumption of fighting in  Cuito on the government forces. UNITA has been engaging in  offensive operations in several parts of the country and,  obviously, the government has to react. I hope the fighting  that resumed on the 2d in Cuito will end soon.

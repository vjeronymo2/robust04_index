			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Saddam seeks policy to partner brute force THE Iraqi government's decision to launch negotiations with Kurdish opposition leaders is the latest sign that President Saddam Hussein is attempting to remain in power by means of political flexibility as well as brute force. It might be going too far to suggest that President Saddam, who has just deployed his security forces to crush Kurdish and Shia Moslem rebellions in the north and south of the country, is in a conciliatory mood. But the Ba'athist leadership, weakened by the allies' crushing victory over the Iraqi army in Kuwait, is desperate to secure popular support by implementing - or appearing to implement - a programme of liberalisation. It is almost as if Mr Saddam has been studying recent events in the former communist dictatorships of eastern Europe; he is trying to tinker with the old system without allowing it to collapse. Even those Iraqis who supported the government are now aware that three decades of Ba'athist rule has suppressed rather than resolved the sectarian and ethnic problems of Iraq. The appointment of Mr Saadoun Hammadi, a Shia Moslem, to the post of prime minister (previously occupied by Mr Saddam) is one of the most visible signs of the new mood in Baghdad. For the first time someone other than the president has been allowed to assume a high profile, with Mr Hammadi addressing the people and announcing plans for political reform and economic liberalisation. Iraqis, however, believe this is partly to deflect domestic and international attention from the unprepossessing personality of Mr Saddam until the pressure eases. With the president portrayed for the time being as a symbolic figure, any policy disasters can be laid at the door of Mr Hammadi. Iraqi newspapers, closely controlled by the state, are even allowed to criticise Mr Hammadi and for the first time in recent memory cartoons of a senior official have appeared in the newspapers. Al-Qadisiya, the Defence Ministry newspaper, led the way with a half-page of satire in which cartoonists reminded Mr Hammadi of the shortcomings of the system. Ordinary Iraqis, even some Ba'athists, remain very sceptical about the ability of the regime to change. Post-defeat calls for radical reform have been replaced by a sense of helplessness and despair. From the Kurdish north to the predominantly Shia Moslem south people feel that they have no control over their own lives after the destruction of much of their infrastructure by the allies and the crushing of the internal uprisings across the country. Those Kurds trickling back to their homes in Kirkuk and Suleimaniya do not hide their sympathy for the opposition or their fear of the government. Journalists who went on government-organised trips to the holy Shia cities of Najaf and Kerbala in the south were confronted by the defiant stares of local men and women. Damage in the south is much more serious than in the Kurdish north. Even in Baghdad there are indications that the army's suppression of the rebellion has provoked militant feelings among Shia intellectuals. The prospect of anarchy in a fragmented Iraq and the unconvincing political performance of the multi-party Iraqi opposition has done something - in Baghdad at least - to persuade people to give the government's much-heralded reforms a chance to work. Kurdish leaders themselves are reluctantly talking to the government despite what they regard as previous betrayals, although they are insisting on international guarantees for any autonomy plan accepted by the regime. Many Iraqis, however, fear that President Saddam will backtrack as soon as he feels that his grip on the country is secure. He has pledged in a number of speeches that the process of reform is irreversible, but Iraqis say he has a long way to go before they will take him at his word.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Yen's strength against dollar brings flurry of deals The yen's strength against the dollar prompted a flurry of yen-denominated issuance in the eurobond market yesterday and syndicate managers said this trend was likely to continue as long as the outlook for the Japanese currency remained favourable. 'If there isn't a trade accord soon between the US and Japan, there will be even more investor demand for yen-denominated assets,' said an official at Merrill Lynch, which arranged two of the three euroyen deals that emerged yesterday. Other syndicate managers said the recent spate of publicly-underwritten issues did not reflect fully the strength of demand for euroyen bonds from Japan and Europe, noting that they only represented around one-quarter of the volume being raised through private placements. Yesterday's three euroyen deals were concentrated at the shorter end of the yield curve, which showed that investors were still nervous of longer-dated maturities. Both Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Safa, the South Australia state treasurer, are believed to have swapped the proceeds of their deals while Xerox Corp kept its funds in yen for its Fuji Xerox operations. Merrill Lynch made further inroads into the eurosterling sector yesterday when it won the mandate to lead-manage a Pounds 47m offering of 25-year eurobonds for the European Coal &amp; Steel Community. Last week, Merrill arranged a Pounds 200m offering of 10-year eurobonds for Austria, the bank's first eurosterling mandate since becoming a market-maker in UK gilts earlier in the year. The ECSC's bonds, which were priced to yield 38 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent UK gilt due 2017, were bought by UK and foreign investors who have been starved of long-dated sterling bonds. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was unchanged. An ECSC official said the deal represented the last instalment of its Pounds 200m loan to the Channel Tunnel. He added that the European Community was likely to tap the Ecu sector of the market next month. Elsewhere, Federal Home Loan Bank could steal Freddie Mac's thunder next month when the two US mortgage agencies launch their inaugural global bond offerings. FHL, which set up a Dollars 5bn global medium-term note programme via Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley last week, plans to raise at least Dollars 1bn by mid-July. Moody's has placed the double-A3 long-term foreign currency debt rating of Ireland under review for a possible upgrade. Last month, Standard &amp; Poor's revised its outlook on Ireland's double-A minus rating to positive from stable. Moody's also said it had downgraded the long-term rating of the Spanish autonomous region of Catalonia by two notches to A1 from double-A2. Around Dollars 730m of debt securities are affected.</p>

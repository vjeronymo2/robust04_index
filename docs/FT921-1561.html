			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Somalia money stays in court THE REPUBLIC OF SOMALIA v WOODHOUSE DRAKE &amp; CAREY (SUISSE) SA &amp; OTHERS Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: March 13 1992 MONEY PAID into court as representing cargo owned by a foreign republic whose government has been overthrown cannot be paid out to solicitors instructed by the republic's 'interim government' if on the evidence it is not a government, in that it does not exercise effective administrative control over the republic's territory. Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when refusing an application by the 'interim government' of the Republic of Somalia for payment out of court of funds belonging to the Republic. HIS LORDSHIP said that in January 1991 the Republic of Somalia bought and paid for a cargo of rice which was shipped on the Mary to be discharged at Mogadishu. When the Mary arrived off Mogadishu, the master refused to enter port because of the fighting there. Bills of lading covering the cargo were in the hands of a Madame Bihi, Somalia's ambassador to the UN. Disputes arose as to what should be done with the cargo. The shipowners issued an originating summons on March 12 1991 naming as defendants the charterers of the vessel. Mr Justice Hirst ordered that the cargo be sold and that the net proceeds of sale be paid into court, and be treated as if they were the cargo. He ordered Madame Bihi to place the bills of lading at the court's disposal to facilitate the carrying out of the order. In December 1990 and January 1991 there had been an uprising in Somalia in the course of which President Siad Barre had been overthrown. The central government ceased to exist. Various groups put themselves forward as entitled to control or govern parts or the whole of Somalia. The area around Mogadishu was controlled by the USC group but that split into two factions, one led by General Aidid and the other by Mr Ali Mahdi Mohammed. Further south, different areas were under the control of the SDM and SPM groups and the followers of Siad Barre. No one group had established control over the country. Madam Bihi had been appointed by President Barre's government. She remained deeply hostile to the USC (particularly Mr Mahdi), who were equally hostile to her. She contended that there was at present no government of the Republic of Somalia. In July 1991, after continuous fighting between the various groups, a conference was called at Djibouti attended by the Presidents of Kenya and Uganda and representatives of the governments of Germany, the US, France, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Oman, the USSR, China, the Arab League, the Organisation of African Unity and the EC. From within Somalia six of the groupings were represented. The SNM and General Aidid did not attend. The conference reached an agreement set out in a communique dated January 21 1991. Under the Djibouti agreement, Mr Mahdi became interim President of the Somali Republic for two years. He appointed Mr Qalib as prime minister. The 'interim government' had been unable to operate in Mogadishu. Mr Qalib was based in a hotel in Riyadh. Prior to the Djibouti agreement, on May 12 1991, Mr Qalib, describing himself as the 'prime minister of the Somali Republic' and writing from Riyadh, instructed solicitors, Crossman Block, to act on behalf of 'the interim government of the Somali Republic'. By a further letter of January 14 1992, Mr Qalib gave his written consent for 'the interim government of the Republic of Somalia' to be joined as plaintiff in the proceedings. Following sale of the cargo and payment of the Dollars 2.35m proceeds into court, on the application of Crossman Block as 'solicitors for the Republic of Somalia', Mr Justice Saville ordered joinder of the Republic of Somalia as plaintiff in substitution for the shipowners who together with the buyers of the cargo were joined as additional defendants. He further ordered that unless any party showed cause before February 19 1992 why Dollars 2m should not be paid out of the fund to the solicitors for the Republic of Somalia, it should be paid to Crossman Block. Madame Bihi took advantage of the liberty to apply. She sought to be joined as a party as a representative of the Democratic Republic of Somalia. She claimed no personal interest in the money. The only locus standi (right to be heard in court) she could have was as a person entitled to represent the Republic of Somalia in court. It was clear from the evidence that Madame Bihi had no such right. Her evidence was that there was currently no government of Somalia. She had no diplomatic status in the UK, nor government recognition as a representative of the Republic of Somalia. Her application to be joined as a party was refused. The question was whether the order for payment out to Crossman Block should be confirmed. Crossman Block's authority was contained in the letter of January 14 1992. If the 'interim government' was not the government of the Republic of Somalia, Crossman Block did not have authority to act on the Republic's behalf. The UK government's new policy not to confer recognition on governments as opposed to states, was stated in two Parliamentary Answers in April and May 1980. The Answers confirmed one applicable criterion of the locus standi of a foreign 'government' - whether the relevant regime was able to 'exercise effective control of the territory of the state concerned' and was 'likely to continue to do so'. A statement as to what was to be the evidence of the UK government's attitude provided another. It was to be inferred from 'the nature of the dealings' the UK government had with the foreign government, and whether they were on a normal government to government basis. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office responded by letter to solicitors' enquiries in relation to the litigation. It said the general situation in Somalia continued to be insecure and confused; that the interim government did not command nationwide acceptance; and that it was very difficult to judge who was the government. It said the UK maintained formal contact with all the factions involved, but there had been no dealings on a government to government basis. It was clear that the UK government did not consider that there was at present any effective government in Somalia. The statements in the letters from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were confirmed by other evidence concerning the actual situation in Somalia. The criteria of 'effective control' referred to in the Answers were not satisfied. In Arantzazu Mendi (1939) AC 256,264-5, Lord Atkin said 'exercising effective administrative control' meant 'exercising all the functions of a sovereign government, in maintaining law and order, instituting or maintaining courts of justice, adopting or imposing laws regulating the relations of the inhabitants'. The 'interim government' did not satisfy those criteria. The Republic had no government. The factors to be taken into account in deciding whether a government existed were: (a) whether it was the constitutional government; (b) the degree, nature and stability of administrative control it exercised over the territory; (c) whether the UK government had any dealings with it and if so what was the nature of those dealings; (d) (in marginal cases) the extent of international recognition. On the evidence the 'interim government' did not qualify. Accordingly, Crossman Block did not at present have the authority of the Republic of Somalia to receive and deal with its property. The instructions and authority from the 'interim government' were not from the government of the Republic. No part of the sum in court should be paid out to Crossman Block without a further order of the court. For the plaintiffs: Geraldine Andrews (Crossman Block). For Madame Bihi: Gavin Kealey (More, Fisher, Brown). Amicus curiae: Stephen Richards (Treasury solicitor).</p>

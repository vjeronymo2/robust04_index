			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Judge not, that ye be not judged: John Willman has a biblical text to dispense, freely, to Mark Santer, Bishop of Birmingham For some time, the Church of England has been a business in decline. Customers ebbing away, outlets closing, growing competition from foreign imports, disastrous investments on the stock markets leading to a serious shortfall in income. It's a familiar story. Given this record, however, it is a bit rich for a leading cleric to start dispensing advice to the government on how to run the health service. Yet that is exactly what the Right Reverend Mark Santer, Bishop of Birmingham, chose to do last Sunday. He told doctors' leaders that the government's health reforms were unchristian and morally wrong. In a sermon on the eve of the annual meeting of the British Medical Association, he attacked 'the culture of competition' bred by the business model applied to the health service. 'The patient is reduced to the status of a unit of consumption and exchange,' he said. 'That in the Christian view must be wrong. 'The culture of competition has set doctor against doctor, hospital against hospital, colleague against colleague. Priorities and policies come to be determined not on the basis of human need, but in accord with the accounting policies of the National Health Service.' Powerful criticisms, indeed. FT readers, no doubt, will experience an added frisson in the bishop's choice of 'business model' as a term of abuse. Yet in comparison with the church, the health service is a success story. It is treating more people every year and reducing the average waiting times for treatment. And while it is hard to be confident about the moral health of the nation, people are living longer, healthier lives than ever. Some of the credit for that improvement rightly belongs to medical science and advances in forms of treatment. But if the government's reforms are the disaster portrayed by the bishop, then surely this would have interrupted the record of progress in recent years. Without doubt, the health service prior to the reforms wasted scarce resources on a massive scale. This was partly because there were no serious incentives to treat more patients or to choose the most economical forms of treatment. Some hospitals treated far fewer patients than other hospitals of similar size, yet they would both receive similar funding. As a result, people had to wait longer for operations than they do now. Worse, tens of thousands waited more than two years for treatment which their doctors did not regard as urgent, an unChristian practice that has thankfully all but ceased. Another cause of waste was that no one in the health service had an idea of what anything cost. Doctors and nurses never had to stop and ask whether particular procedures were cost-effective - or even needed. The Audit Commission found that some consultants and family doctors ordered eight times as many pathology tests per patient as others, for example. Money thrown away on unnecessary tests was money not available to relieve suffering. The NHS reforms have simply tried to create a system within which those who use resources most effectively get more while those who waste them get less. The solutions are not perfect - too much power remains in the hands of bureaucrats who show a high-handed contempt for the customer, as this week's report from the ombudsman shows. But the reforms are pretty similar to what is going on in a lot of other advanced economies. That is hardly surprising: market incentives may have some unpleasant side effects, and these need to be guarded against. But they are the best mechanism devised by man for producing desired outcomes. The lesson of the 20th century is surely that alternatives to market arrangements are invariably worse. And, bishop please note, it is the individual who suffers the most from the consequences. Indeed, one predictable consequence of the sort of command economy that existed in the pre-reform health service was that it gave power to the professionals, rather than the customers. A hospital appointment used to mean taking at least half a day off work to join dozens of other patients in waiting to see a doctor. Now, five out of six outpatients are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment time. There was, of course, nothing to stop hospitals making such improvements in patient care under the old system. But in the absence of incentives to meet the customer's needs, consultants organised the hospitals to meet their needs. Another Audit Commission report found that patients were often kept in hospital over the weekend unnecessarily because the consultant was unwilling to come in on a Friday to discharge them. The bishop's accusation that patients have been turned into units of exchange might have more force if it were not for the fact that before the reforms, they were units of treatment at the whim of doctors. The health reforms have certainly shaken up the medical profession, and about time too. No professional group likes change (journalists are no exception either). So it is hardly surprising that the bishop has found that the reforms have been 'deeply distressing' to those who are forced to change their ways. Yet the health service continues to provide treatment according to need, largely free at the point of use - the blueprint of Aneurin Bevan, the Labour politician who launched it. If those basic principles were to be jettisoned, Santer would be justified in his philippic. Until then, that bible text about motes and beams seems more relevant.</p>

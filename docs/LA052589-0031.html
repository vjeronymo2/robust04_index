			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MADDUX ROLLING AGAIN AND SO ARE CUBS, 3-1  </P> <P> A year ago, Greg Maddux of the Chicago Cubs was the toast of the National  League. He was 8-3 on his way to an amazing 15-3 record at the All-Star break.  </P> <P> After making the All-Star team but not playing, the right-hander came  plummeting back to earth, finishing the season with a 18-8 record.  </P> <P> His start this season was no better than his finish last season. He was hit  hard in his first four outings and was 0-3.  </P> <P> As Maddux, 23, begins to prove he isn't a fluke, the Cubs are proving they  aren't either.  </P> <P> Maddux pitched the soaring Cubs to a 3-1 victory Wednesday night at Houston,  missing his third consecutive complete game by one out.  </P> <P> Shawon Dunston singled in two runs in the fourth to give Maddux the support he  needed. Maddux took a shutout into the ninth, but, after Gerald Young singled  home a run with two out, Mitch Williams came in to get the final out for his  12th save.  </P> <P> The victory kept the Cubs in first place in the NL East. The Cubs are without  their big gun, Andre Dawson, who underwent knee surgery.  </P> <P> The Cubs are also without outfielder Mitch Webster, but they are getting  outstanding pitching and timely hitting.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 5, St. Louis 1 -- The Reds continue to thrive on turmoil.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, after the Cardinals' Terry Pendleton singled in a run, relief  pitcher Ron Dibble became so incensed, he threw Pendleton's bat against the  screen. Dibble was ejected, and Manager Pete Rose decided to suspend the  youngster for two days.  </P> <P> It didn't affect the Reds on Wednesday night as Tom Browning, who hadn't won in  a month, somehow managed to escape jam after jam and went the distance to give  the Reds' bullpen a rest.  </P> <P> The Cardinals had eight hits, five of them doubles, and three walks but only  one run. The Reds' third consecutive victory kept them in first place in the  West.  </P> <P> Chris Sabo hit a home run and a double to lead the Reds.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Atlanta 1 -- A 1-1 tie at Atlanta lasted seven innings after R.J.  Reynolds' infield out scored Andy Van Slyke in the seventh inning.  </P> <P> But the Pirates exploded in the 14th. Glenn Wilson hit a two-run double to  break the tie and hand the Braves their fourth loss in a row and ninth in the  last 11 games. The Braves have scored only 10 runs in their last 85 innings.  </P> <P> Pirate Manager Jim Leyland was ejected in the ninth for arguing a checked-swing  strike call against Van Slyke.  </P> <P> Montreal 1, San Francisco 0 -- Kevin Gross pitched a five-hitter and Hubie  Brooks drove in the only run with a sacrifice fly as the Expos won at San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Gross (5-3) struck out 11 and walked four in his best performance since the  Expos obtained him in an off-season trade with Philadelphia. He outdueled San  Francisco starter Don Robinson (2-4), who gave up only three hits in seven  innings.  </P> <P> The Expos scored an unearned run in the first without a hit.  </P> <P> Tim Raines drew a leadoff walk, stole second and went to third when catcher  Terry Kennedy's throw skipped past shortstop Jose Uribe into center field.  After Dave Martinez walked, Raines came home on Brooks' one-out fly to right.  </P> <P> New York 3, San Diego 0 -- Kevin McReynolds and pinch-hitter Mark Carreon hit  home runs at San Diego to lift the Mets to victory.  </P> <P> The Mets held a 1-0 lead in the seventh inning when Carreon was sent in to bat  for Ron Darling, who had given up four hits in six innings. Darling and relief  pitcher Rick Aguilera had 13 strikeouts.  </P> <P> The loser was Bruce Hurst, who gave up two runs in seven innings and didn't  walk a batter. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / World News in Brief: Hain seeks probe into 'bail-out' for MPs at Lloyd's A Labour MP will today use parliamentary privilege to allege that Lloyd's and a government department may have been discussing moves to bail out MPs who have suffered heavy losses on the troubled insurance market. Peter Hain, MP for Neath, will use an early day motion to call for a public inquiry into 'moves to bail out External Names who are members of this House following recent talks between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Council of Lloyd's' The call follows speculation that a minister may have been helped some time ago. The DTI had no immediate comment.</p>

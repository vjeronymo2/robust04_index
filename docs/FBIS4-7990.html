			<p>BFN     [Text] General Janko Bobetko, Croatian Army chief of  general staff, held talks this evening with UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] Commander General Bertrand de Lapresle. They  discussed the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, the  Washington agreement and UN Security Council resolutions. Gen.  Bobetko stressed that he had informed his guest about the fact  that Croatia has fulfilled all its tasks, and that there can no  longer be any pretexts for the other side not to comply with the  agreement.    He mentioned that one such problem is the fact that the Serb  side had not withdrawn from one part of the battlefield north of  Zemunik, from where the airport in Zemunik can be targeted.  Another concrete problem is that a Jasenovac-bound road  remained closed today and therefore a Croatian delegation was  unable to lay a wreath at the monument there. Gen. Bobetko  stressed that Gen. de Lapresle had promised him that UNPROFOR  would insist with the Serb side that they resolve these problems.    Gen. de Lapresle said that he is pleased with the course of  the implementation of the cease-fire agreement in Croatia so  far, adding that not all the provisions of the agreement have  been implemented 100 percent, but that the newly created  problems would be resolved by joint committees which had been  established for that purpose. He empahized his pleasure at the  cooperation with the Croat authorities, saying that he and Gen.  Bobetko shared the wish that the cease-fire agreement should be  implemented, which is a precondition for the second step in the  normalization of Croatian-Serb relations -- the resolution of  economic problems.    The UNPROFOR commander will chair a meeting of a central  joint committee in Turanj near Karlovac tomorrow, at which the  implementation to date of the Zagreb cease-fire agreement will  be examined.</p>

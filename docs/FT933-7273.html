			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Universities relax science entry standards UNIVERSITIES have slashed the number of arts and humanities courses available on the clearing system, but entry requirements for science subjects have been lowered and admissions tutors are having difficulty in filling places. The extent of the difficulty emerged at the weekend. It will put pressure on Mr John Patten, education secretary, to announce new measures on university funding. He returns to his desk today after a six-week absence due to illness. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals said 'thousands' of young people were being denied university places due to government inaction. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, called the situation a 'scandal'. A rise of 1.6 per cent in the proportion of A-level candidates in the top three grades usually required for university entrance, combined with a fall of 9.6 per cent in candidates entering for physics, were held responsible for the problem. But difficulties had been widely predicted since tuition fees paid for each student by the government for classroom-based courses - mostly arts and humanities - were cut in December. Tuition fees for science courses remained unaltered, with the intention of encouraging more science students. According to clearing administrators, university admissions tutors are offering places on science courses to applicants who narrowly missed gaining places on arts courses, and who have no more than GCSE qualifications in science subjects. Many have introduced courses combining business studies with science subjects, in an attempt to maximise their tuition fee income from the government. According to the Department for Education, tuition fees are directly related to the number of students so that they can encourage universities to expand. They also allow policymakers to control the numbers of students entering different disciplines. Statistics published today illustrate that tuition fees encouraged universities to take on more students in the academic year 1991-92. The total paid in tuition fees increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 1.028bn, while total recurrent income was Pounds 4.693bn, a 10 per cent increase over the previous year. The figures, which do not apply to the former polytechnics, show that student numbers rose by 9 per cent, while the number of staff increased by 4 per cent. They also show that universities had more success in raising income from endowments and donations, with funds raised this way rising by 13 per cent to Pounds 175m. Older universities appeared to find it easier to raise donations - they accounted for 11.6 per cent of Cambridge's income and 9.5 per cent of Oxford's, while no other university raised more than 6.1 per cent of its income this way.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina de Chikoff: "Alain Juppe: At the Risk of </F> Existing"]    [Text] As a result of the GATT negotiations and  his management of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, Alain  Juppe, still secretary general of the RPR [Rally for the  Republic], has emerged as one of the leading figures in the  Balladur Government.    Too much of a dandy to reveal his heroic nature, the foreign  affairs minister seems rather to have descended from the line of  the musketeers. More Aramis than d'Artagnan--he was a cadet in  Gascogny in his younger days and the epic dimension is essential  to him--he sits down at the table at L'Ami Louis as if he were  Porthos, but when he takes up his pen, Athos appears. In the  days of Louis XIII, he would have been a dashing swashbuckler,  thumbing his nose at the Cardinal. Born on 15 August 1945 in  Mont-de-Marsan in Landes, where his father was a farmer, Juppe  enrolled at the Ecole Normale, earned his doctorate, and  graduated from the ENA [National School of Administration].    He looks like an Andalusian. It is easy to imagine him  striking the bullfighter's pose in the middle of the arena, with  cries of "Bravo!" from the Sevillians ringing in his ears. As a  matter of pride, he disdains "applause meters" and refuses to  "tailor" an image for himself. Yet how could he manage to  refrain from glancing--albeit scornfully--at the polls,  particularly when they are so favorable to him? "I have been  popular for the past two weeks," Juppe says. About to turn 49,  he thinks people have been somewhat slow to discover him. He  loves to be recognized for his qualities and does indeed have  some, having "toiled" since he was a child.    Ever the leader of the class, he entered politics by virtue  of "the Word." In 1976, Jerome Monod brought him on board as a  speech writer for Jacques Chirac, then Valery Giscard  d'Estaing's prime minister. Technical adviser to the mayor of  Paris in 1978, then the capital's director of finance, he was  next elected deputy from the 18th arrondissement in 1983 after  two failures in Landes. Beginning in 1984, he handled economic  affairs for the RPR. Appointed deputy minister for the budget  during the first cohabitation, he was never able to show his  stuff and fretted and fumed in the shadow of Edouard Balladur,  then head of Finance.    His attempt to lend credit to the idea that there was a  "Juppe band," just as there was a "Leotard band" at the time,  fell short.  <H5>  Quai d'Orsay </H5>   In 1988, he became secretary general of the RPR and  transformed it from top to bottom. In 1989, on the ticket behind  Valery Giscard d'Estaing, he headed the RPR-UDF [French  Democratic Union] list in the European elections. In 1992, he  had to stand aside for Michel Giraud as president of the  Ile-de-France region. Indeed, he has had his fill of "playing  the supporting role." Like d'Artagnan meeting Rochefort, he  could say, 20 years later: "Me? A favorite? I am more the cadet  from Gascogny than when I first saw you in Meung (...), still a  lieutenant of the musketeers!"    The March 1993 legislative elections opened new horizons for  him. This time he would refuse to be denied, preparing with  diplomatic advisers. He studied all the issues, made contacts,  went after the indispensable connections, beleaguered the Quai  d'Orsay even before the outcome of the election.    Once the elections were over, there was no choice but to  yield to the evidence: Juppe had to go to Foreign Affairs.  Edouard Balladur supported him, Francois Mitterrand put up no  objection, and even if Jacques Chirac said he was still  indispensable on Rue de Lille, Juppe stood firm. Go for it!  Either he would captain the ship or he would start touring RPR  federations in the Overseas Departments and Territories  (DOM-TOM)! Chirac yielded and Juppe made one concession: Even  though he would take office at the Quai, he would remain  secretary general of the RPR.    The press soon began to talk about Juppe's metamorphosis. No  longer is he the pretender to the throne with a fine future in  store for him! He is said to be less abrupt, to which he has a  concise reply: "Public office ennobles one." He manages to exist  between the Elysee and the Matignon [office of the prime  minister], no mean feat. His name is constantly in the  newspapers. At the Quai d'Orsay, he is Prince Charming come to  waken Sleeping Beauty! The president praises the  "professionalism" of the new minister who comes every Tuesday  evening at 1700 hours for a private discussion of current  affairs. Juppe always has his homework done, arriving with the  "finished product," as his aides put it. Nothing is left to  chance. Everything is prepared by Quai d'Orsay teams, analyzed  by experts, confirmed with sources in embassies now working in  direct contact with the minister's staff.    Following his meeting with the chief of state, Juppe goes to  the Matignon to pin things down with the prime minister. Things  are finalized at the Cabinet meeting the next day, after which  the Cabinet inner circle further refines the issues. The Quai  d'Orsay is immediately informed of possible adjustments and  adapts as quickly.    "The blood is finally circulating at headquarters,"  according  to Dominique de Villepin, Juppe's chief of staff, "and despite  the cohabitation, decisions are made more quickly than they were  before." For him and his deputy, Maurice Gourdault Montagne,  there are no secrets or magic. They summarize the Juppe method:  "Mobilization of staffers, maximum synthesis, and integration of  the media." They conclude: "The Matignon is never dizzy and the  Elysee is not worried."    In his enormous office, Juppe allows himself a cautious  smile. Sensitive to compliments as all men are--politicians are  even moreso--the foreign affairs minister does not conceal his  pleasure, saying, "I am totally at home." They shower him with  praise, endlessly refer to his intelligence--the sharpest of his  generation--the strength of his convictions, his pugnaciousness  vis-a-vis the Americans, who were so reluctant to get further  involved in the Bosnian crisis. He stares at the soles of his  loafers, not finding the praise too effusive. Early on he had  sought to have the "doorway to power" open to him, had been kept  waiting in the corridors too long. The GATT negotiations and the  war in the former Yugoslavia finally allowed him to take off.  Never had he doubted himself; only the ability of others to  recognize that he is worth more than his reputation as a machine  politician and technocrat.  <H5>  Tragic Dimension </H5>   But what about the GATT talks? For him it was an  "interesting" issue. At his first European Council of Ministers  meeting on 5 April, his mission consisted of gaining time and he  obtained a one-month delay. In May, he presented France's  memorandum and the Europeans began to understand Paris' logic.  In September, Juppe, as head of the delegation, crossed swords  with Sir Leon Brittan, who was conducting the negotiations on  behalf of the European Commission, and imposed a mandate on him,  warning: "It is not you who have the power to make decisions; we  do!" In December, he played in a link-up with Nicolas Bazire,  Balladur's chief of staff, and the two won the last game. Juppe  would like the prime minister to remember it.    And Bosnia? "I am measuring precisely what it means to  assume  one's responsibilities," Juppe says. "Because we have 2,000 men  in the field, the issue has a tragic dimension." The minister  admits his anxiety: "If it turns out badly, if we have to start  strikes...." And yet, he also affirms his determination: "We  must not back down or we shall suffer an even greater disaster."  No one begrudges Juppe his share of the success in the handling  of the crisis or his ability to convince the United States that  France is not trying to get that country bogged down, but merely  to save what is left to be saved.    Immobile but vibrant, his face unlined--his enemies accuse  him of holding back, of emerging from all battles apparently  intact--his legs crossed, Juppe is visibly happy. He has thrived  at the Quai. His chief of staff, Patrick Stofanini, and his  assistant, Jean-Louis Debre, are looking after things in the  RPR. He personally visits Rue de Lille once or twice a week.  Despite a heavy schedule, he never gives the impression of being  in a hurry. Juppe is not a man to let himself be overwhelmed.  All his pencils are sharpened, all his business organized,  nothing is left dragging on his desk. He is not even fanatical;  just organized. He now jogs less than he once did, naturally,  but whenever he can he slips off to the Interallie to swim a few  laps.    What is his schedule like? Monday: Hotel de Ville de Paris  with the top dogs in the RPR. Tuesday: breakfast with Francois  Leotard, lunch at the Matignon, the Elysee in the late  afternoon, back to the Matignon. Wednesday: Cabinet meeting,  lunch with members of Parliament, a meeting if there is one.  Thursday: private meeting. Friday: meeting of the Quai d'Orsay  chiefs of staff. Travel, receptions, meetings, campaign travel  for the cantonal elections tucked into the basic schedule.    The weeks fly by, which does not frighten Juppe. He fears  only routine boredome, time wasted picking daisies! All doubts  have dissipated; depression also. He has emerged from the cadet  pack and knows it. Is it zest for the game or Athos-type  lucidity? "The Tarpeian Rock is close to the Capitol," he says.  Often swept to the pinnacles, he has never fallen in the literal  sense of the word, but observes that people forget him almost as  quickly. Why can he never quite catch the light?  <H5>  Desire To Compete </H5>   People refer to his moodiness, labeling him as cold,  impatient, scornful, to which he replies: "I am not very  relaxed. I am also competitive. I like to compare myself with  others, get into the fray, find the chink in the other man's  armor. I like to engage in irony. I don't like people to meddle  in my business and say so."    Juppe takes a drink of cold water without offering anyone  else any, but does not even notice. His aides say he often  passes right by without even seeing them and they make no bones  about it: "Alain is off on another of his tangents!"    He is not an emotional man, they explain, but one can  nevertheless rely on him. He is never a wheedler and is a loyal  friend. In his book, The Venetian Temptation, the  foreign affairs minister raises one corner of the veil,  describing his emotions, his rage, his tears when he listens to  Verdi. Alain Juppe the romantic?    It would not be smart to make such an argument with a number  of RPR leaders or deputies. For them, the man is a kind of  computer (have they not dubbed him "Amstrad"?)--an ambitious,  arrogant martinet? "To catch up with Alain Juppe," says one of  his friends in his defense, "you have to get on the mule path."    Either the top or nothing. A fugue is an obsessive kind of  music that runs through the foreign minister's head. It is as if  he had a furious desire to exist, not to miss out on "real  life!" What if it were to be found elsewhere? Juppe succombs to  the temptation whenever fate is unkind to him. It is at these  times that he is ready to become a wanderer or archeologist like  Aramis, who became a priest every time the Duchess of Chevreuse  seemed about to leave him. Yet one letter from his beloved and  he was off again! The musketeer gives the orders: "Fat capon,  larded rabbit, leg of lamb with garlic, and four bottles of old  burgundy!" At the Quai, Juppe no longer thinks about his periods  of Beethoven, Hugo or Chateaubriand. Never again will they make  him eat crow, as they did in the last regional elections. He is  free, a real contender, liberated from all the old yokes. One  has but to see him to understand that he has settled all  accounts, paid his debts, and any other dues. His fate seemed to  precede him, but he has finally caught up with it. He has seized  it at the risk of never again being able to change it!</p>

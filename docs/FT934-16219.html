			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Invergordon bid would be 'inadequate' INVERGORDON Distillers, the scotch whisky distiller, said that if a bid were made for the company at 300p it would be 'inadequate' and would 'fail to reflect the strategic value' of Invergordon. The statement was made after the market closed with the shares up 6p at 294p. The announcement followed a joint statement from Whyte &amp; Mackay, the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands, and Fleming Investment Management on Tuesday, which said they were in talks that might lead to FIM selling its 13.6 per cent stake in Invergordon to WM. If WM bought the stake it would be obliged to bid for the whole of Invergordon as it already holds 41 per cent of its shares, the legacy of an unsuccessful bid two years ago which was pitched at 275p. FIM had supported Invergordon then. Under the Takeover Code, WM would have to offer shareholders at least the same price that it paid to FIM. WM and FIM have not publicly stated the possible price at which FIM might sell. A price of 300p has been mentioned in the press, with FIM reported to have rejected that amount. Invergordon said yesterday that WM was 'denying the (Invergordon) board the opportunity to represent the interests of all shareholders' by not putting the proposals directly to it. It is to write to shareholders shortly and advise them what action to take. Invergordon is advised by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, while FIM, the investment management arm of Robert Fleming, is being advised on this issue by SG Warburg.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flaws and breach of trust behind BT performance related pay scheme Sir, I read with some concern Robert Taylor's report on the complexities of BT's performance related pay scheme ('Must try harder', February 2). I would like to add three points. First, BT's own pay comparison study is seriously flawed, being based on crude and implausible averages, with no consideration given to length of service, distribution, population change, performance profiles or relative expectations. Even more astonishingly, although BT describes it as comprehensive, it in fact fails to cover more than half the managerial and professional jobs in BT. Second, BT's recently discovered ambition to go down market implies it understands its position in the labour market it talks about. There is no evidence of this. BT's casual disregard of the prospect of its more talented managers leaving is evidence of its down-market approach. This cannot inspire the customers whose business it needs to win. Finally, it is a pretty fundamental breach of trust if BT, after telling people they will be paid for their performance, then suspends the performance pay scheme. BT's profits this year will increase to more than Pounds 3bn. For it to say to its 26,000 managers and professionals that 10 per cent of them can share Pounds 2m as a consolidated pay increase is grossly insulting. It is, after all, considerably less than the BT board paid itself last year. We must not let our concern with the complex mechanics of performance pay schemes blind us to the simple truth that mistakes of this magnitude totally destroy any prospect of performance pay improving performance.

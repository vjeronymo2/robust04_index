			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Bonn rejects further pay talks: Public sector union's leadership in disarray after members vote against deal THE German government yesterday rejected any move to reopen pay talks after public sector workers rejected a pay deal agreed by their leaders last week. A ballot among the almost 450,000 union members of the oTV, the largest and most militant public sector union, showed just 44.1 per cent in favour of the 5.4 per cent pay deal. Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister and leader of the employers' side in the talks, said the ballot result reflected the 'completely unrealistic expectations' aroused by the union's 9.5 per cent pay claim. He said: 'No one can expect the negotiations to be reopened.' The result leaves the oTV leadership in disarray. Although it is unlikely to lead to further strike action in the public sector, the vote could stoke militancy among 4m engineering workers who are preparing for strike action. Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the German employers' association, issued a warning that engineering workers taking action would face 'lock-outs on an unprecedented scale'. The last formal negotiations in the engineers' dispute, between employers and unions in North Rhine-Westphalia, were called off last night before they began, after the unions declared there was no point in attending. Three key regions have called strike ballots for next week and strike action is expected to start on May 25. Industrial relations turmoil, fuelled by resentment over rising taxation, inflation running at 4.6 per cent, and the overall cost of German unification, continued to spread yesterday. Textile workers have called a meeting for Monday to decide on possible strike action. Arbitration for print workers will begin on May 21, but token strikes are already taking their toll of newspaper production. The confusion over the public sector pay award is expected to stoke militancy among members of IG Metall, the large engineering workers' union, convincing the union leadership of the dangers of accepting too low a deal. However, the union has lost the advantage of having a base figure from which to launch its own demand. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, the high-profile oTV union leader who led the 11-day public sector strike, and then recommended last week's deal, yesterday refused to resign after the setback. 'The result depresses us all, and it affects me in particular', she admitted. 'We simply did not expect this mood.' She said that any attempt to restart the strike was unlikely to produce a better offer from the employers, representing the central government, the 16 federal states, and local authorities. Instead, she has ordered her officials to 'consult the grass roots', and report back to a national executive meeting on May 25. All the other unions in the dispute have now accepted the 5.4 per cent pay deal, including railway and postal workers, police, and clerical workers, leaving the oTV isolated.

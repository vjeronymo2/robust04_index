			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak by Robert </F> Stoppacher; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Tens of thousands of people from Bosnia-Herzegovina  have left their country and found refuge in Austria since the  beginning of the war. Two years ago, federal and provincial  authorities created the so-called de-facto refugee organization,  intended to house and feed the refugees. The operation costs  approximately 75 million schilling per month for some 40,000  people. Another 20,000 have been accommodated by friends and  relatives. All of them allegedly intend to stay in Austria.  Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak has said that this is too  many. Together with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, he  would like to organize the resettling of refugees. Yet, for the  time being, the aid for the Bosnian refugees should continue.  The operation, which has been sponsored by the Interior  Ministry and provincial authorities, was scheduled to expire at  the end of June.    [Loeschnak] We are planning to extend the operation to the  end of the year. We are aware of the fact that, even if the war  were to end within the next few days or weeks, the operation  cannot be phased out by late June because several thousand will  probably be unable to return. We have to continue our efforts  to integrate a part of the war refugees.    [Stoppacher] For months, you have been appealing to  provincial and local authorities to take action. Has some  progress been achieved as far as integration is concerned?    [Loeschnak] This is really a slow process, and one has to be  persistent. I hope we have that persistence. At least as far  as work permits are concerned, we have found jobs for a few  thousand people.    [Stoppacher] How many exactly?    [Loeschnak] A total of 9,500 within one year. This is quite  an achievement.    [Stoppacher] Some 9,500 out of a total of almost 60,000.    [Loeschnak] That is not quite right. We assume that only  20,000 of the 60,000 refugees are fit for work. The remainder  -- the great majority -- are elderly people and women with many  children. So, we start from a number of 20,000, half of whom  have found employment. We will try to find jobs for a few  thousand more over the next few months. As far as housing is  concerned, the situation is not as good. A few weeks ago, we  had intensive discussions with the provinces on several  alternatives. I hope that the provinces will take up one or the  other initiative.    [Stoppacher] Could you elaborate on that?    [Loeschnak] We have mainly considered refurbishing existing  housing stock in the provinces with Federal Government support.  We are now waiting for the provincial authorities to take some  action, the funding of which could be discussed with the finance  minister. If peace were really to be restored, we would have to  consider a repatriation operation in coordination with the UNHCR  to encourage the people to return to their home country.    [Stoppacher] Repatriation always sounds a bit dangerous.  Would that mean on an absolutely voluntary basis?    [Loeschnak] All those allegations that have been made  ranging from deportation -- as it was called -- to forced  repatriation have never been justified because such actions have  never taken place in Austria. We have always talked with the  people, even when the armed conflict, for example in Croatia,  was over. Of the 28,000, a total of 26,500 returned at that  time. Some 1,000 could not or would not return, and we were  able to make the necessary provisions for them.</p>

The prime minister "has failed" and "disappointed society,"  Aznar stated. He added that he will not give up the task of  opposition, although the party will act "responsibly" with  respect to the crisis. He asserted that there is no other  meeting with Felipe Gonzalez on his agenda.    At a news conference in Salamanca, Aznar took stock of the  six months that have elapsed since the election, and noted that  the main conclusion is that Felipe Gonzalez "has failed" both in  his attempt to bring the nationalists into the government and in  efforts to secure a social pact, and has shown that he does not  know how to govern in a minority.  <H5>  Unemployment and Recession </H5>   The result of these six months from the economic viewpoint  is  more unemployment and recession; from the political viewpoint,  the People's Party's consolidation as an alternative and the  demonstration that the "change of change" proposed by the PSOE  was an electoral alibi.    In this context, the People's Party leader demanded that the  government correct its policy as a way to surmount Spain's  "weakness," although he added that he does not expect this to  happen and stressed that his party will act responsibly "so as  not to exacerbate the crisis."    That responsibility does not imply relinquishing the task of  opposition to a government lacking ideas in which Felipe  Gonzalez "has disappointed society," he said. Regarding the  prime minister, Aznar stated that the possibility of another  meeting, following the meeting held two months ago which cleared  the way for meetings between delegations of the two political  forces, is not on his agenda.    He stated that these dialogues, "whether wanted or not, are  constitutionally obligatory" for matters such as the choice of  the ombudsman and the renewal of the General Council of the  Judiciary, since "the qualified majorities are laid down in  order to force agreements."    After emphasizing that the aim of any contact with the PSOE  is to improve Spain's situation, Aznar ruled out the possibility  of a government coalition and the imminence of another election.    He recalled that the Socialists rejected the agreement on  economic policy proposed by the People's Party several months  ago, and added that the presentation of recovery measures by his  group is due to the fact that the government itself is  presenting none.</p>

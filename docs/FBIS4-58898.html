			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by M. Pay'edar: "Rabin in Moscow"] </F>   [Excerpts] The Zionist regime's prime minister, Yitzhaq  Rabin, arrived in Moscow on 24 April on a 4-day visit. This is  the first visit to Russia by a high-level official of the  Zionist regime, ostensibly in response to Kozyrev's visit to Tel  Aviv last week. During his visit, Kozyrev had reminded the  Israeli officials that despite its support for the Middle East  peace process and an end to longstanding animosity between the  Arabs and Israel, he is not satisfied with the actions taken so  far and the prevailing trend of the talks.    Diplomatic sources resident in the Middle East state that  Kozyrev had told Rabin during his visit to occupied Palestine  that it is unacceptable to accord Russia a second-line role in  the Middle East peace dealings. The same sources state that  Kozyrev's unexpected behavior toward the Israeli officials was a  result of the Zionist regime's cold reception to Russia's  proposals regarding the future of peace in the Middle East. No  official report has been released on the nature of these  proposals, but Israeli sources state that Kozyrev had presented  the following five recommendations to the Israeli officials in  order to expedite the peace trend in the Middle East:    1. Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.    2. Halting construction of settlements on the West Bank  and Gaza Strip until the fate of these two areas becomes clear  in the peace talks.    3. Continuation of the talks in Moscow.    4. Russian assistance in lobbying for recognition of  Israel by Syria and in persuading the latter to join the peace  talks.    5. Motivating the Syrian leaders to end what Kozyrev  referred to as support for hardline factions and anti-Zionist  resistance groups in the region.    Even though Kozyrev's proposals were received with  indifference by Israeli officials, Kozyrev asked Rabin to visit  Moscow to deepen bilateral relations and for a better  understanding of Russia's stance.    The importance of Tel Aviv-Moscow relations is worth  assessing from two aspects: First, the relations and their  inherent importance; and second, viewed in the context of the  Middle East crisis. [passage omitted]    Israel has realized, for better or worse, that without  taking  Russia's viewpoint into account, no kind of peace process will  be successful. Regardless of whether Tel Aviv has reached this  conclusion in view of Syria's role in the Arab Middle East or  because of the traditional role of the Russians in the Middle  East, the Zionist regime's leaders have been motivated to accept  changes in view of developments in the region that will in turn  make them give certain concessions to the other side. What the  privileges will be and whether it is possible to end the current  impasse in the Middle East, only time will tell.    Independent news sources in Moscow have reported that in the  course of his talks with the Russian president and prime  minister, Rabin said that if Moscow does not revise its military  treaty with Syria, withdrawal from the Golan Heights is out of  the question. By supporting the anti-Israeli groups, Syria has  proved that it is not serious about the peace talks.    The newspaper MA'ARIV, the mouthpiece of the Zionist  regime's  foreign ministry, referring to the above issue commented that  Tel Aviv believes that the sale of Russian weapons to Syria has  had a negative effect on the peace talks. [passage omitted]    For Russia to halt arms sales to Syria merely at Israel's  behest or for it to place all its eggs in the U.S. basket  without any major concessions would be an act of political  naivete that seems quite unlikely. It seems certain that this  will be a complicated and prolonged process and a test for  Russian diplomacy in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet  Union.    This is why Rabin's trip to Moscow has not causes any  concern  among the Damascus leadership. Hafiz al-Asad is quite confident  that Russia will not bestow any major privileges on Israel at  the expense of its own interests or leave Syria at the mercy of  a turbulence-ridden peace. [passage omitted]    Thus, Rabin's visit to Moscow may not herald any major  changes in the current trend of Middle East talks. Besides,  changes are not foreseeable. What is certain is that the  anti-Zionist resistance and opposition to the growth of U.S.  influence in the region will have a remarkable effect on the  current treacherous trend. This opposition and resistance will  not be limited to Damascus' perspective or viewpoint; even the  Zionist regime's officials have admitted this. They have  acknowledged that despite its influence among the Lebanese and  Palestinian groups, Syria does not have tight control over their  actions.    It is a fact that the green light from Russia and other  regional countries to Israel will not terminate the resistance.  One should concede that in view of the expansionist nature of  Israel, which overtly conflicts with the people of the region  who have been disillusioned by the contemptuous attitude of the  United States, the Middle East will witness a new wave of  violence and insecurity in the future.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Real genius Sir, In his review of Romeo et Juliette ('A night off for the intellect', October 31), Richard Fairman states quite correctly that turning Shakespeare into opera is work for a genius, as the two indisputable successes (both of them by Verdi) show. Surely he means three, all of them by Verdi: Falstaff, Macbetto and Otello. Hector Eduardo Luisi, 7415 Beverly Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, US</p>

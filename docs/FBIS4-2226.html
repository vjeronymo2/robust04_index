The reports quoted a Ministry of International Trade and  Industry official as saying that "the development will be  unclear" despite the fact that talks between Japanese Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor are likely to be resumed next week.    Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morroco next  week at the signing ceremony for the global trade pact concluded  in the Uruguay Round last December under the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

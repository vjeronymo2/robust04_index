MICROCHIP  </P> <P> I hit the (chalk)board, making a $37 overall profit when my $30 exacta from  Iroquois Park to Saddle Up in the fourth race paid $7.80.  </P> <P> Not much, but I want to make hay until the computer's sun shines again --  probably Thursday.  </P> <P> Bob's Sunday Bankroll: $1,946  </P> <P> Sunday's Profit: $37  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,983  </P> <P> The computer, which previously had bet only allowance races or better, lost $40  when it went slumming in the first two races -- both claimers -- Sunday. It  would have lost more, but Ki-Nobre scratched from the second.  </P> <P> Computer's Sunday Bankroll: $1,619.50  </P> <P> Sunday's Loss: $40  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,579.50  </P></p>

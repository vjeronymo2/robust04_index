			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] confused its own international acceptability with  that of its leader, Nelson Mandela, who was indeed  internationally accepted as a martyr, Transvaal National Party  [NP] leader Pik Botha said on Thursday [3 February]. He was  given a standing ovation at the NP federal congress at Kempton  Park's World Trade Centre for a sharp attack on the ANC while  speaking in support of the NP's new election manifesto.    The ANC was not African or national or a congress, he said.  The ANC was an embarrassment everywhere in Africa because it  pursued policies which were no longer practiced anywhere on the  continent. "They still call each other 'comrade', and African  leaders ask me why can't the ANC get rid of the past. It claims  to have international acceptability but, but by whom? They  confuse their acceptability with that of Mr Mandela who is a  martyr," he said.    "They are not African because there is not one country in  Africa that propagates their policies. They are not national  but a conglomeration of converse foreign ideologies. They are  also not a congress but a conglomeration of confused people."    The ANC also could not refrain from personal insults against  President F W de Klerk. In front of foreign governments and  audiences where Mr de Klerk was regarded as a man of integrity,  the ANC acknowledged this. But the moment the ANC addressed an  audience that "lives in the past with a racist orientation", Mr  de Klerk was reviled as a criminal and racist terrorist. "There  was only one man who liberated South Africa -- not as a sign of  weakness -- and that is why he got the Nobel Peace Prize," Mr  Botha said.    Mr Botha received a standing ovation with some black women  delegates ululating and whistling.</p>

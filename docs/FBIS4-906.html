			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The OAU is still concerned about the border  dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria. An OAU delegation arrived  in Yaounde yesterday to discuss the Cameroon-Nigeria border  dispute. According to the Cameroonian Government daily CAMEROON  TRIBUNE quoting sources close to the Cameroonian Ministry of  External Relations, this visit follows, and I quote, Nigeria's  illegal occupation of some areas of Cameroonian national  territory, including the Bakassi Peninsula, an area in the Gulf  of Guinea which Cameroon and Nigeria have been disputing since  December 1993. [no reference to closing of quotation as heard]  [passage omitted]    Well, what is the purpose of the OAU mission to Yaounde?  Here is the response by Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni,  Cameroonian minister of communication and government spokesman,  who spoke to Raphael Mbadinga this morning.    [Begin Kouomegni recording] It is normal for an OAU mission  to come to Cameroon. It could also go to Nigeria because  recently, the OAU's central body for the prevention, management,  and settlement of conflicts asked the OAU secretary general to  report on the situation in Bakassi within one month after the  adoption of the resolution asking Nigeria to leave Cameroonian  territory. I, therefore, believe that the OAU mission, which  has come to Cameroon and which could also go to Nigeria, will  gather the necessary information to enable the OAU secretary  general to prepare his report. This report will also enable the  OAU's central body to know whether the two sides have  implemented the resolution. [end recording]</p>

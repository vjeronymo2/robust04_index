			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Mawhinney may turn transport in a new direction  -Charles Batchelor says the government will be able to show at little cost whether it favours public systems over the car The government will have an opportunity to spell out its commitment to public transport at very little cost in the Budget on November 29. Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary for the past four months, will be able to demonstrate whether his sympathies lie with public transport or the car and respond to growing pressure to switch spending. At the same time government plans to involve private finance in the public transport infrastructure mean it would not be required to pledge large amounts of public finance to any ventures. The Department of Transport set out its stall earlier this month in a glossy catalogue, Building Tomorrow's Transport Network, which lists infrastructure projects in which private finance will play an important role. Among the opportunities identified are several projects for which preparations are well advanced, such as the Pounds 500m West Coast rail line modernisation, and 'design, build, finance and operate' road schemes. They include Crossrail, the underground rail link across London which is looking for an alternative way forward after being rejected by a parliamentary committee. A few days after the publication of this catalogue Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the panel set up to promote projects eligible for private funds, said his main problem had shifted from finding suitable projects to handling the work coming in. Sir Alastair said the private finance initiative had the backing of Mr John Major, the prime minister, and its potential was now more clearly recognised in government departments. The panel has identified projects worth Pounds 10bn, some in transport but others in fields such as information technology, water and sewage and education. Among the projects the chancellor might seek to highlight in his Budget statement are: Light rail or 'supertram' projects planned in several cities. A strong case for public backing can be made by the Croydon Tramlink, a 17-mile network to improve communications in south London. It would provide an orbital link between Wimbledon, Croydon, Beckenham and New Addington, reducing bus journey times on crowded suburban roads. Its promoters, London Transport and Croydon Borough, believe that because London travellers are used to paying higher fares, the private sector would be willing to provide more than half the Pounds 160m cost of the scheme. This would be far more than raised for earlier tram projects in Manchester and Sheffield. A second tram project which is well advanced is the Midland Metro, which would link central Birmingham with Wolverhampton over 13 miles of track. The private sector contribution to this Pounds 112m scheme is estimated at just Pounds 10m but it would make a considerable contribution to reducing congestion. New rolling stock for London Underground's Northern Line. London Underground fought to have this project accepted under the private finance initiative and has two remaining bidders for the Pounds 400m project. The chancellor may announce final approval in the Budget. Thameslink 2000, which would quadruple capacity on London's only cross-town rail link, between London Bridge and St Pancras stations. The government has said this Pounds 500m project must be financed entirely by the private sector. It would extend the cross-London link to new destinations in East Anglia and on the south coast. The West Coast line featured in last year's Budget announcement and a project team is trying to define the scheme more closely so that it can be put out to tender next year. The revival of interest in rail following the completion of the Channel tunnel has attracted the attention of consultant engineers and construction companies. The roads programme is being cut. Even so, road-related schemes could still feature in the Budget. They could include: Proposals for a second Forth road bridge costing an estimated Pounds 400m which are being studied by the Scottish Office. On present estimates the existing road bridge, dating from 1964, will soon be heavily congested. The Lothian region would prefer improvements to rail services. Technologies for the introduction of electronic tolls on motorways are being evaluated by the Department of Transport for testing next year. The chancellor may announce more details of the expected private sector contribution. A second tranche of 'design, build, finance and operate' projects, paid for by the government through 'shadow' tolls, may be announced following the unveiling of the first four projects last August. The chancellor may, however, surprise his listeners with schemes which have received no previous publicity. Channel tunnel, Page 13 Letters, Page 18</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS / DISTRICT ATTORNEY;  </P> <P> GLOVES OFF -- BEHIND THE SCENES  </P> <P> As the neck-and-neck race for Orange County district attorney entered its final  week, longtime adversaries Michael R. Capizzi and James G. Enright voiced  familiar campaign themes in public Tuesday but added a new twist behind the  scenes.  </P> <P> They started the day shortly after sunrise with a spirited, face-to-face  discussion before more than two dozen Mission Viejo Kiwanis Club members at the  Laguna Hills Holiday Inn.  </P> <P> It will be more of the same for the candidates in the days to come, with each  tackling a busy schedule of speaking engagements and other political events as  they grapple for the upper hand in a race that has so far attracted little  interest from the electorate.  </P> <P> During their 45-minute debate in Laguna Hills, Capizzi and Enright stuck mainly  to the major themes of the campaign, each taking only occasional swipes at the  other.  </P> <P> Enright, chief deputy district attorney in Orange County for the last 24 years,  pledged to prosecute environmental crimes aggressively and to tackle gangs and  drug dealers. But he stressed that the best remedy for such ills is "education  that begins in grammar school."  </P> <P> Capizzi, who was appointed district attorney by the Board of Supervisors in  January, agreed that education programs are important but suggested that  prosecutors have to "recognize our role" and stick "in the courts, not in the  classrooms."  </P> <P> When Capizzi noted that he had received support from 86% of the office's  prosecutors, Enright countered that just 55% of the deputy district attorneys  voted, because of fears that the ballots were not being kept secret.  </P> <P> "That's not an election," Enright said, comparing it to "something you'd see in  the Philippines" during the days of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.  </P> <P> Capizzi did not counterattack during the morning gathering but later in the day  issued a press release accusing Enright of conspiring with Deputy Dist. Atty.  Thomas Avdeef, an unsuccessful district attorney candidate in the June primary,  in a "brazen attempt" to blackmail him.  </P> <P> Capizzi scuttled Avdeef's chances for a promotion on May 2, about a month  before the primary. Avdeef sought to have the decision reversed, but the  county's Personnel Department rejected the appeal on May 30.  </P> <P> On Oct. 24, an attorney for Avdeef -- who has endorsed Enright and is working  with his campaign -- sent a letter to Capizzi, saying his client had been  wrongly passed over because of politics. The letter demanded that Avdeef be  promoted.  </P> <P> Capizzi said that "circumstantial evidence" ties Enright to Avdeef's effort to  gain promotion just days before the Nov. 6 election. He noted Avdeef's  political ties to Enright in the current campaign.  </P> <P> In addition, the two shared the same attorney when they tried unsuccessfully  earlier this year to block the appointment of Capizzi as district attorney, he  said.  </P> <P> "It's an effort by them to put me in an untenable position," Capizzi said  Tuesday afternoon. "If I ignored it, they would go ahead and file a lawsuit and  say I tried to sweep it all under the rug. I hope they know me well enough to  know I would never consent to giving in."  </P> <P> Enright said those allegations against him are "absolutely absurd."  </P> <P> He denied talking to Avdeef about sending the letter. "It's amazing that  (Capizzi) is the one who went forward and talked to the press about this  thing," Enright said. "It must mean he's a little desperate. I don't have the  slightest idea what he's going to gain from it."  </P> <P> A recent Los Angeles Times Poll indicates that nearly half the voters remained  undecided about which man to support. The poll showed Enright leading Capizzi,  29% to 23%, with 48% undecided.  </P> <P> But Capizzi holds a solid lead in raising campaign funds, with a war chest of  more than $222,000 as of Sept. 30, compared to about $80,000 for Enright.  </P> <P> "There will be no stone left unturned," Capizzi said of his strategy, which  will include campaign mailers, telephone calls to voters and other tactics  during the final days. "I'm approaching this as I always approached the trial  of a criminal matter -- with thoroughness."  </P> <P> Enright, meanwhile, planned to keep up his end with advertisements in  newspapers and mailers to select county areas with a large voter turnout.  </P> <P> "It will all be positive-type stuff, nothing negative," he promised.  </P></p>

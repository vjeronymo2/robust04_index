			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL CITY CAMPAIGN GIFTS SLIP BY BECAUSE OF LACK OF ENFORCEMENT FUNDS  </P> <P> A voter-approved Los Angeles law aimed at curbing the influence of major  campaign contributors has never received enough money to enforce it, and  illegal gifts have made their way to candidates as a result, officials said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The insufficient funding has caused a backlog of campaign audits in the city  clerk's office. Because of the backlog, City Clerk Elias Martinez said Tuesday  that at least two candidates in the 1987 city elections escaped possible  criminal prosecution for receiving illegal contributions.  </P> <P> The law in question is a City Charter amendment approved by voters in 1985 that  sets a $500 ceiling on campaign gifts to City Council candidates and $1,000 for  citywide candidates. Candidates who knowingly accept gifts exceeding the limit  are subject to criminal prosecution and could be sentenced to as much as six  months in jail if convicted.  </P> <P> The original law, however, had a statute of limitations of one year from the  time of the contribution.  </P> <P> Recently completed audits by Martinez's office have found contributions  exceeding the limit to 1987 council candidates Pat Russell, an incumbent who  was defeated, and Councilman Robert Farrell. Assistant City Atty. Charles  Goldenberg said the audit showed no evidence of criminal intent on the part of  either candidate, but that in any case, prosecution would be impossible because  of the statute of limitations.  </P> <P> In Farrell's case, city attorneys said, about $5,400 was contributed in  violation of the limit. Farrell said Tuesday that he will soon hold a  fund-raiser so he can return the disputed contributions. Russell's  contributions violating the limit amounted to about $38,000, city attorneys  said. Russell, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, was quoted by the  Herald-Examiner as saying the figure was "wildly inaccurate."  </P> <P> Martinez said the city elections this spring could add to the auditing backlog  as scores of candidates vie for eight City Council seats and three citywide  offices, including the mayor's.  </P> <P> Goldenberg, noting that no one has been criminally prosecuted under the 1985  law, acknowledged that it is difficult to prove that anyone intentionally  received an illegal contribution. But he was optimistic that changes in the law  approved by voters in 1987 will make future violations prosecutable.  </P> <P> The 1987 changes extended the criminal statute to two years and introduced a  civil penalty mechanism that has a four-year statute of limitations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Use of Employees  </P> <P> The audit by the city clerk's office is an essential part of enforcement. Under  the law, the clerk's office must review each candidate's contributions  statement before prosecution on an illegal campaign gift can begin. The audit  determines whether an individual gave more than allowed or if, for example, a  major contributor has circumvented the contribution limit through the use of  employees or affiliated companies.  </P> <P> In 1987, the first year the contributions limit law was applied, Martinez put  in a budget request for 13 auditors to review the 1987 election reports. City  records show that Mayor Tom Bradley agreed to only seven auditors and that the  City Council reduced that to three.  </P> <P> Ironically, the council's action was based on the theory that voters a few  months later would approve the change in the criminal statute of limitations to  relieve the pressure on the city clerk. While that is expected to improve  enforcement of the law in subsequent elections, it is of little help for  auditing the 1987 contests.  </P> <P> "I don't think anyone raised the issue" of what to do about the 1987 elections,  said Martinez's chief deputy, J. Michael Carey, adding that that included  himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'One-Year Statute'  </P> <P> Martinez, added, "I don't think there's any question a one-year statute can't  be complied with, given three (auditors)."  </P> <P> The city attorney's office did not warn the council that a prosecution might be  jeopardized -- as it apparently has been -- unless Martinez received a larger  auditing staff to review the 1987 campaign reports.  </P></p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Thomson asked to consider CSF-TCE merger THE FRENCH government has asked Thomson, the state-controlled electronics group, to consider merging Thomson-CSF, its defence electronics arm, with Thomson-TCE, its consumer electronics subsidiary, as part of the shake-up of France's public sector. Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, said in an interview with Les Echos, the financial newspaper, that he had asked Mr Alain Gomex, chairman of Thomson, to examine 'how to bring together the two sides of the group'. Thomson said it could not comment. The two businesses are in different areas of electronics and are different in terms of their relationship to the Thomson group and their financial condition. Thomson-CSF, which specialises in defence electronics, is controlled by Thomson, with a 60 per cent stake. The remainder of its shares are quoted on the Paris stock market. It made net profits of FFr1.52bn (Dollars 281.5m) in 1992, a fall of 35 per cent on the previous year due to the losses on its holding in Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group. Thomson-TCE is involved with consumer electronics and wholly-owned by Thomson. It has been badly affected by the competitive state of the European consumer electronics industry and last year made a net loss of FFr1.77bn, thereby contributing to the Thomson group loss of FFr544m. Mr Longuet said he was aware that the two sides of Thomson had different cultures and of the contrast in terms of product sector and financial condition. However, he said he could not exclude merging them and then privatising the combined CSF-TCE group. Thomson, scheduled for sale to the private sector in the mid-1980s by the last French centre-right government, is one of the current privatisation candidates.</p>

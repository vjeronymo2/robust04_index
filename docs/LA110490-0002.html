			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> In the Oct. 14-20 issue of TV Times, Shav Glick's description of Jackie  Robinson as ". . . combative, rebellious, and provocative. . ." is totally  uncalled for.  </P> <P> At best that characterization closely follows many of the comments made by  writers when Robinson first signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers.  </P> <P> Robinson was chosen by Branch Rickey because he was an intense competitor and  because his high school and college coaches knew that he could handle the  humiliation that would be thrown his way by opposing athletes, spectators and  sportswriters.  </P> <P> I knew Jackie as a teammate at John Muir Technical High School in Pasadena, as  a member of the football and track teams of 1935-37, and as a member of the  track team of 1938 at Pasadena Junior College. Robinson was a competitor all  the way. Rebellious, provocative and combative he was not! As a leader and a  competitor more often than not, he was the catalyst that kept the rest of the  team loose and ready to play.  </P> <P> Bruce O. Smith, Alta Loma  </P></p>

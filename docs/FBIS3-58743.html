Not least of these snubs was the one inflicted on him by  Admiral Bobby Inman, the man chosen to succeed Les Aspin as  Pentagon chief. The fact that the defense secretary, a man who  is expected to keep his cool at all times, seems apparently  incapable of surviving an editorial in the NEW YORK TIMES, is  reason enough for concern at the way in which Mr. Clinton  selects the members of his entourage.    Regarding Bosnia, at the NATO summit last week the U.S.  President approved the threat of air strikes against the Serbs  at Tuzla and Srebrenica, while personally emphasizing that no  more threats should be made that were not followed up by action.  Since then, Mr. Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has  openly mocked this position, UN representatives have rejected  it, Moscow has implicitly vetoed it, and the U.S. head of the  joint chiefs of staff has personally criticized it. No  elementary consultations had taken place. Today, it is not just  the White House, but also NATO, which is losing creditworthiness  in that context.    The slaps in the face given by Moscow are hitting home even  harder. The continuation of economic reforms there would appear  to be largely compromised, but against the advice of the best  observers and of the market itself, Mr. Clinton is continuing to  play down the possible absence of Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov in  the next Russian Government, two men he openly supported last  week in Moscow, whereas attempts are now being made to sweep  them aside or demote them. The U.S. Administration, their  attention trained on Mr. Yeltsin, manifestly failed to take into  account the increasing power of Mr. Chernomyrdin, the  conservative prime minister.    By the same token, three days after the U.S. President  explicitly asked Russia to complete the withdrawal of its armies  from Latvia and Estonia, the Russian foreign minister stated  that the Baltic states belong within Russia's strategic zone of  interest -- to the extent that the Latvian prime minister is  wondering whether this position has been coordinated with the  United States. And with the U.S. President having just left  Moscow, Washington has been reduced to asking the Russians to  explain themselves. Furthermore, no response is being made to  the growing affirmation of the Kremlin's desire to recreate its  sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union, and to retain a  right to watch over affairs in Central Europe.    The fledgling democracies of Central Europe, limited to  rallying behind a "partnership for peace" which favors  consultation with Moscow and which everyone mistrusts, have in a  few days -- and despite the hugs and kisses from Prague -- lost  much of their faith in the support that the United States is  capable of offering them.    This retrospective assessment of one year of foreign policy  conveys a strong impression of thoughtlessness, of alienation  from reality, of ignorance regarding the true situation  regarding the balance of power, or -- in the case of Bosnia,  Somalia, or Haiti -- of pure and simple disinterest. Referring  to the trust Bill Clinton placed in the Syrian leader Hafiz  al-Asad, or the manner in which he compelled Ukrainian President  Kravchuk to give his nuclear arsenal back to Russia, the author  of a WALL STREET JOURNAL editorial speaks of naivety. In any  case, there are mumblings about a certain otherworldliness of  the kind that characterized the policy conducted by Jimmy Carter.    Admittedly, President Clinton has scored successes,  especially on the domestic scene and at the level of trade,  particularly with regard to the conclusion of the GATT and NAFTA  agreements. His Asian policy, taking form at the recent APEC  [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit in Seattle, would  also seem to be resolved. Beijing, meanwhile, is still very much  on trial and, with the upcoming visit by Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen to China, is apparently making the minimal  concessions required to secure the extension of the most-favored  nation clause. There, too, no excessive naivety should be  displayed. No more than in North Korea, where Washington,  although apparently satisfied, has not obtained any real  guarantee of being able to keep tabs on the development of  nuclear arms.</p>

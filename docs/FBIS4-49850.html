			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, may 10 (XINHUA) -- An executive meeting of  the State Council, China's highest governing body, today  approved in principle a set of draft detailed regulations for  the implementation of China's State Security Law.    Participants in the meeting, presided over by Premier Li  Peng, decided that the draft regulations will be revised before  being issued by the State Council.    They agreed that since coming into force on February 22,  1992, the State Security Law has played a significant role in  maintaining state security, defending the people's democratic  dictatorship and the socialist system, and ensuring the progress  of the reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive.    The formulation of the detailed regulations is needed to  enforce the law more effectively, they noted.</p>

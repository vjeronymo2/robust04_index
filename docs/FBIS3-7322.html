The study body, attached to the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, will file an interim report later this month  calling for a redesign of the local networks under the "Neo  Teletopia Project."    Under an upgraded version of the 1983 "Teletopia Project,"  all local areas will eventually be integrated into a nationwide  network.    The Telecommunications Council, an advisory panel to the  posts minister, has discussed the development of an optical  fiber information network, officials said.    The Neo Teletopia Project is preparing for Japan's next-  generation telecommunications network in the age of multimedia,  which will require vast data-processing resources.    Under the current Teletopia Project, local governments  receive financial aid to improve their telecommunications  systems if deemed necessary. So far, Okinawa Prefecture and 287  cities, villages, wards and towns have received such support  from the central government.</p>

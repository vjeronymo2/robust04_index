			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Direct Line to be member of PIA Direct Line, the telephone insurance company owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, has taken another step towards expanding into life insurance. It has been accepted by the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog that protects private investors. The range of policies which the company plans to sell from January is directed at protection rather than investment. Most do not need to be regulated by the authority. However, one type of policy does require regulation, and gaining PIA membership also clears the way for Direct Line to diversify into more complicated investment plans. Such a move would bring further cost competition into the life insurance sector when companies are already under pressure to cut expenses. In setting up a life insurance subsidiary the company has had to meet not only the PIA's requirements in terms of the extent and quality of training it will provide for its staff but also those of the Department of Trade and Industry. At its launch the life company will have 40 staff. All telephone calls will be recorded and saved in a system that allows easy retrieval in order to ensure that the regulator's requirements are met. Mr Russell Devitt, the subsidiary's chief executive, said the operation would prove that it was possible to sell life insurance over the telephone - an idea which some traditional life insurers doubt.

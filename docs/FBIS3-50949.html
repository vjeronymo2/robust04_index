			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mirta Rodriguez Calderon] </F>   [Text] The people's great concern about the proliferation  of theft and black marketeering is reflected in the letters that  suddenly piled up on my desk or the telephone calls I received  after an article published a few weeks ago.    It seems as if many people had been waiting to see these  ideas that have so much to do with our future set down in black  and white. Apart from the need to identify these serious  problems, everyone asked how to stop a phenomenon that is  compromising our society's value system.    Who will our leaders be, and what will they be like in 2010  or 2020? We wonder about this if our children grow up immersed  in contradictory situations: when they are told one thing by  their families or their school, and then they see shady deals or  observe goods coming from the black market, as well as other  improper behaviors.    Such situations also have equivalents in language, in which  actions have an abstract representation.    For people now in their thirties, the expression being a  fighter was related to high ideals. Not so now.    Earning a living used to be applied to examples of  self-denial and hard work in extreme poverty: mothers who worked  as laundresses, fathers who held multiple jobs, all of which  they undertook to support their family. Not anymore.    Making good bread used to mean just what the words said, and  was a badge of pride if applied to a creator of bakery  delicacies. Now, though, that expression may refer to the  productive night of a petty thief who skims off goods from a  state store.    Similar semantics have produced at least a hundred  linguistic  innovations related to that vital area where things that belong  to all are enjoyed by a few, and what should be distributed  through the commercial network goes out through back doors, to  be sold on street corners, in city alleys, and semiconcealed  outlets.    These phenomena are certainly hard to root out while we are  living in this time of shortages, but it is essential to act  from an ideological viewpoint if we want to preserve values that  are the mainstay of our nation's ethical heritage.  <H5>  Hitting Bottom </H5>   That is the title of a book my colleague Jorge Rodriguez  Hernandez is writing, in which he reveals, denounces, lays bare,  and reports on trends in the black market and other distortions  of Cuban market relations at the present time. Jorge  investigated these problems in response to calls from listeners  to his radio program, who contacted him and asked him to look  into the numerous irregularities on the fringes of or in the  underground economy.    He has compiled over 1,000 files and documents on  embezzlement, pilfering, corruption of various sorts, and the  outcome of trials in cases that were detected. After five years  of systematic work, he has prepared a number of graphics  illustrating his investigations, plus pertinent contents of  official reports, speeches, and information.    Between 1988 and 1990 my colleague followed 35 court trials.  In reviewing his notes, Jorge found that 25 of these economic  crimes took place in the capital, and the total damages to the  nation came to 19.5 million pesos! In three cases the persons  implicated were handling over 1 million pesos in each case, and  in another 11 cases, over 100,000 pesos.    On 32 occasions over three persons were involved. In 19  cases  the administration was involved, and in another 19, businessmen,  officials, accountants, and drivers were involved. Of these 35  crimes, 94 percent happened in the area of material  distribution, and within that category, 80 percent involved  commerce, restaurants, and services. Fraud was a component of  the modus operandi in 91 percent of the cases.    "All this shows," Jorge Rodriguez told me, "the organized  character and the degree of complicity of people who, far from  exercising positive authority, become lawbreakers. Another  symptomatic feature is the occupational status of the criminals,  for these are people with jobs, people who work, and in their  position or job they become corrupted and corrupt others."    "In black market retailing," he added, "the situation is  different: the biggest suppliers are individuals with jobs, and  it is usually unemployed people who take the product to its  final destination."  <H5>  Four Years of the Black Market </H5>   Jorge has become an expert on the underground economy. One  of  his most careful investigations always arouses interest. Over a  four-year period he followed black market price trends of 19  important consumer items: fats and oils, coffee, fluid,  condensed and evaporated milk, beans, cigars, rum and beer,  laundry detergents and bath soaps, butter, chicken, beef, and  eggs.    A combination of one unit of each of these goods comes to a  total, at the official price, of 17.29 [pesos]. Jorge began his  calculations in the last quarter of 1990, and they have  continued through 1993.    Underground sales have fluctuating prices that rise as  demand  increases and supply declines, just like in capitalism. So  buying a pound, bottle, or part of the 19 products selected for  the study would have cost between 129 and 150 pesos in September  1990; between 185 and 226 in October 1991; and in July 1992  these black market prices had risen to between 283 and 398  pesos. Three months later, at the end of October, they were  between 347 and 508 pesos.    On 31 January 1993, while the state market allowed Cubans to  continue purchasing what was available of these items for the  same minimum price they had cost years before, in the  underground economy they cost between 392 and 570 pesos; three  months later, at the end of April 1993, they cost between 489  and 660 pesos. More recently, at the end of the first two weeks  of October, these prices had almost doubled: between 788 and  1,014 pesos in Cuban currency.    If a buyer in this market earned a minimum salary of 100  pesos a month he could not have made these underground purchases  unless he also got between 29 and 50 pesos in addition in 1991;  between 158 and 233 in April 1992, and between 389 and 560 in  April 1993. If he received a maximum salary of 450 pesos, three  years ago he could have bought all these items easily, but on 30  April 1993 he would have been 40 pesos short because by that  time prices had risen between 28 and 38 times. In October the  increase came to between 45 and 59 times.    All these factors will be used in forming individual and  collective judgments of what is happening and what to do to  diminish the harmful nature of these phenomena. It will at least  be useful to speak out openly about this as a reality that must  be temporary, and to inculcate in minors a sense of how this  double standard of morality destroys the honor of society as a  whole.    Making lies and simulation a standard of behavior is highly  dangerous. Promoting or participating in embezzlement, bribery,  or complicity in thefts from the state, and, therefore, from  every other citizen, means a crisis of values that, aside from  needing to be put down and punished, must quickly be rooted out  from both institutions and individuals. It is vital to stop  robbery and corruption and to force them back so they will not  destroy the social conscience of our times. In the history of  Cuba and in that of other countries, never have petty criminals  figured among the legions of those who love and create.  <H5>  Five Hundred People Surveyed </H5>   What do people think, and how do they react, whether or not  they are involved in activities that give rise to these  situations?    Jorge Rodriguez Hernandez asked 500 workers, 44 percent of  whom were under 30, and 54 percent of whom were male. They  worked in commerce, restaurants, and services. They were  employees in the Matadero and la Planta Habana, in food service,  in factories, and light industry shops, in addition to  professionals, middle management, and white-collar employees.  They were members of the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] and  MININT [Ministry of the Interior], plus some retired people,  housewives, and people who were unemployed when the survey was  conducted in 1991.    What did these 500 people say? Sixty-six percent said they  were dissatisfied with the way material and financial resources  were being protected; 57 percent said they were also unhappy  about the use made of those resources.    Fifty-five percent felt that their standard of living was  not  the same as that of other members of society; 72 percent added  that their needs were not being met as were those of other  people. In spiritual and cultural matters, 57 percent said they  believed those needs were being fulfilled on an equal basis.    Jorge asked people who work in restaurants, services, and  commerce what they thought about the connection between their  salary and their contribution to society. Sixty percent thought  there was no correlation, and 64 percent thought there was no  correlation with the quality and service they provided. And one  interesting fact to note: between 61 and 66 percent of those  polled in these sectors did believe that social property was  well protected and used in terms of normal socialist aspirations.    The details of these evils obviously need much more than one  investigative report. These really are issues that cry out for  public thought and discussion. Starting with the crisis in  authority affecting some people who should be controlling and  protecting; and the decline of the community's scorn for a group  of behaviors linked to crime and disorder....    For, as my colleague Jorge Rodriguez noted: "Many of the  efforts of the state leadership are devoted to plugging up the  holes used by people engaging in shady deals. The other thing is  that in Cuba there is no exploitation in production.  Exploitation is privatized and the traffickers in money and  merchandise are the ones engaging in exploitation."    We wondered over and over what can we do about this? What  can  be done, aside from doing our jobs responsibly, at a time when  this entails greater sacrifices?</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GENERALLY TEPID BUSINESS . . . OR AN INSPIRED COMIC WEAVE?;  </P> <P> THE GARDEN GROVE COMMUNITY THEATER DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO WORK WITH IN THE TAME  'HOW THE OTHER HALF LOVES.'  </P> <P> "How the Other Half Loves" is probably Alan Ayckbourn's most popular comedy; it  seems to have found everlasting life on revival stages.  </P> <P> But this flyweight number can't be called Ayckbourn's best work. The British  playwright, who has been described as an urbane Neil Simon, can write  pungently, as he did in "Intimate Exchanges." But "Other Half" is generally  tepid business that lacks original terrain (subject: marital infidelities  involving the boss's wife) and often pushes too hard in its attempt to find  laughs.  </P> <P> The Garden Grove Community Theatre production of "Other Half" doesn't do much  with it -- but again, there's not much to work with. We get, in one of  Ayckbourn's trademark manipulations of dramatic structure, three separate  couples moving through their haphazard lives simultaneously. Everybody occupies  much of the same space, with the action occasionally overlapping. To director  Ray Williams' credit, the play does not become too confusing. If only it were  funnier.  </P> <P> Bob (Keith McCarthy), "office Romeo" and basic cad, is sleeping with Fiona  (Diana Kolchier), whose husband, Frank (Mark Beaver), is a self-centered bore  who ignores her. Fiona just wants to get some kicks. Soon after the play  starts, things begin to unravel. Bob's wife, Teresa (Cleta Cohen), isn't  brainy, but she has enough gray matter to know something's up. Frank, on the  other hand, is dim to everything. In fact, he thinks twitchy Mary (Ilona  Honeyman), who's married to meek William (Jeff Bickel), is doing nasties with  Bob.  </P> <P> The performances follow the customary path of domestic farce, with lots of  energy, some face-making and comic gestures. None of the approaches really  stand out in any way, although Beaver's handling of Frank is remarkable for its  approximation of Monty Python's John Cleese in a pompous mood. The best job is  done by Bickel, who lends William the twerpy self-conscious air of someone on  the verge of evolving into a complete nincompoop.  </P> <P> 'HOW THE OTHER HALF LOVES'  </P> <P> A Garden Grove Community Theatre production of Alan Ayckbourn's comedy.

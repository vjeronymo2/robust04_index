In a  statement to the SABA' news agency, al-Iryani said that he  discussed with U.S. officials several topics related to the  cease-fire within the framework of UN Security Council  Resolution 924 which is based on the fact that legitimacy  belongs to the Republic of Yemen and that nothing else is  legitimate.    Al-Iryani said that Resolution 924 was the key to all  discussions. He said everybody was eager to realize a  cease-fire, noting that the National Defense Council's  cease-fire declaration represents a very important step which  affirms the credibility of the Republic of Yemen Government's  commitment to implementing the Security Council resolution.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Andro Devdariani, chairman of the board of </F> the Agroindustrial Bank by Maradi Anasashvili: "It Is the Bank  That Will Save Georgia"; place and date not given]    [Text] The Great Ilia    [Chavchavadze] said, "Every year the banks shall be obliged  to make public how well or poorly they are doing and allow every  man to inspect and assess the length and breadth of their  activities."    This is exactly the style and method favored by our  guest today, Andro Devdariani, the chairman of the board of the  Agroindustrial Bank.    He was born in 1956 in Tbilisi. He graduated from  Secondary School No. 58. In 1973-1974 he worked in the Kirov  Machine Tool Factory. He graduated with honors from Tbilisi  State University's Economics Engineering Faculty, and later  defended his candidate's dissertation.    He is a candidate of economic sciences and has written  about 20 scientific works.    In 1985 he was awarded the Komsomol Prize in science  and technology. After that he worked as a laboratory head in the  University, as a teacher, as a docent, and as chairman of the  party commission. He is now a doctoral candidate. He was the  council chairman of the Golden Bank Commercial Bank.    Batoni Andro and his friends laid the foundation for  the revival of the villages of Dzhavakhetia. Through the years,  he worked with students to build the Georgian village of  Kotelia. In various parts of Georgia they rebuilt and restored  churches and monasteries that had been destroyed and virtually  forgotten, and they also did much to save the Garedzhi  Complex.    He is married to Maia Kvezereli-Kopadze, a university  docent, and they have two children.    [Anasashvili] Batono Andro, what kind of problems did you  inherit on first coming to the bank?    [Devdariani] Well, when you come to a bank you have to know  very well what kind of responsibility to the people and the  country you are assuming. So being appointed to this post is a  great honor and a burden to me, one that is not easy to bear,  especially under today's conditions.    I came to the bank from science and business, and I have my  own ideas and vision as to the most urgent changes in the system  to be anticipated in the near future.    It was Great Ilia, you know, who founded banking in Georgia.  His banking efforts alone are sufficient proof of the role the  banks play in building the country.    [Anasashvili] Indeed, Ilia devoted much time and energy to  banking, and people often said of him that "the bank is making  him neglect his calling as a writer." In fact, someone even  wrote a little verse:    "Do not give up your steed, "put down your abacus, Ilia,  "all  of this will vanish, pass away, "what will remain is your  [immortal poem] `The Hermit.'"    [Devdariani] These days, sad to say, Ilia's spirit in the  banks is confined to hanging his portrait in the board room.    Remember that a bank's reputation is the foundation of the  public's trust by which every bank prospers. Rumors and slander  cost the country dearly. Anyone who is dishonest deserves  reproach, but all this endless talk and carping are unseemly.  The way we do business, a dishonest man is quickly exposed.    But let's get back to our problems.    Although the Agroindustrial Bank is one of the biggest state  structures, I found that wages and salaries were very low.  Paradoxically, the bank's staffers have the least social  protection.    Our bank's building is also in sad shape. One floor is  occupied by the city commandant's office and we haven't been  able to get it back. They don't even pay their lease.    We also have cadre problems; there are many nonprofessionals  employed in this system who are not even qualified. Most  important, they totally lack the necessary knowledge, skills,  and habits.    Our bank has lots of other problems too. The first thing we  need to do is root out vices such as the misuse of funds and  personal travel at the bank's expense. We will no longer permit  the subjective approach in granting loans, the way we used to  grant loans at low interest rates on flimsy grounds. There were  absolutely no criteria for setting the rates. This gave  dishonest persons many loopholes and caused a lot of talk.    To make a long story short, I found I had more than enough  to  do. I've only been examining the problems for a few weeks; soon  I will work out plans and begin to take practical steps. The  public will be fully informed about what we do.    One thing is certain: most of the bank's profit has to be  spent on social needs.    [Anasashvili] The country's agrarian sector is in critical  condition. How can the Agroindustrial Bank help the countryside,  the peasant?    [Devdariani] Of course the bank and the banking system must  play a crucial role in solving the country's crisis.    It needs to be in tune with the structure of the national  economy and conduct a reasonable monetary-credit policy to boost  the economy.    By its nature, the Agroindustrial Bank is a versatile  institution, serving our economy's strategic sector--the  agrarian sector--through more than 70 offices. Right now, up to  80 percent of our credit investment (400 billion coupons) is in  the form of loans to financially shaky partners in agriculture,  and the recovery of these loans is doubtful. The recovery  failure rate of loans given in past years is due primarily to  the breakdown in state discipline in agricultural enterprises,  massive theft and wastage of products, and general lack of  control.    Given the present disarray, I think it is totally  unacceptable to grant credit at "reduced rates" to agricultural  enterprises that are in shaky financial shape. The fact is that  most of them are practically bankrupt. This also has resulted  from the fact that 70 percent of the 10-percent loans granted to  agricultural enterprises last year have not been recovered.    Things are made worse by the fact that the mechanisms  stipulated in the law on mortgages, which would have made  relations with debtors easier, have not been activated.    In general I think that granting loans at reduced rates to  unpromising enterprises fails to stimulate their financial  performance. Managers of such enterprises are used to sitting  around waiting for government handouts, waiting for the  low-interest loans that are charged to them to be written off or  deferred.    As for the countryside and the peasant, we hope to benefit  them in many ways. I'm optimistic because there are many  knowledgeable, industrious, professional, and--most  important--honest people working in our bank. They are always  doing their best to help the countryside; the country can count  on that.    [Anasashvili] At a meeting of the government's Food  Commission, as we know, the National Bank proposed that you be  obliged to allocate 65 billion coupons from your own funds so  the agricultural enterprises could complete their spring  operations. You came out categorically against it. Why?    [Devdariani] Here's why.    The National Bank stipulates that loans can be granted using  a bank's own resources only if it has a stable surplus. But a  surplus is possible only if there are deposits. In the case of  Agroindustrial Bank institutions, however, there are practically  none.    We are against that kind of loan practice because it is  quite  possible that it will inevitably lead to granting emission  credit, which is the government's sole prerogative.    Considering our inflation and market conditions, giving  credit--at the rate of 120 percent annually--is totally  unacceptable.    In short, Georgia's economy is in terrible shape. The  situation in the sphere of monetary-credit policy, as well, is  uncertain, to put it mildly. In my opinion, both the former and  the present managers of the National Bank are not conducting a  real monetary-credit policy, they are just making individual  decisions which they think reflect the country's essential  interests.    [Anasashvili] Everybody knows that the banks are the life  blood of the economy, which depends on them to function  normally. In your opinion, what shape is Georgia's banking  system in today?    [Devdariani] Georgia's banking system is only in the  formation stage today. It is developing rather slowly, owing to  many objective and subjective factors.    All else aside, the formation of a monetary-credit system  characteristic of a market economy is a complex process. The  right kind of banking system is being created, and taking part  in it is a crucial and complex business, because essentially new  banks are being formed. It requires working in a new way, new  cadres.    The system is having a hard time getting free of old  stereotypes. The number of banks is increasing day by day, of  course, but numbers alone are not going to help things. Another  negative factor is that the process is not being analyzed. A  bank, of course, is a specific institution, but it must not have  the seeming of a clan institution.    Another reason for the banking system's many shortcomings is  the fact that conditions in the country are unstable.  Furthermore, political forces have ambivalent attitudes toward  the banks. Today, unfortunately, at some stage or other, any  particular bank's power is defined by whoever stands behind it  and sponsors it. Another unacceptable practice is when high  officials establish banks just to "secure their own future."    Banks are institutions full of bustling activity, where  everything is done according to the law, and where, as in any  other sphere, you can even get rich, but only while maintaining  human dignity, complying strictly with rules and regulations,  according to your talent and ability. But ordinary people do  work in banks, and all the woes afflicting our society can be  sensed there as well. It is essential, therefore, for us all to  struggle to restore things to health. Most important, I think,  is the fact that always, and especially today, the banks have a  grand national cause to pursue, requiring not only  competence but also clean hands and a clean conscience. The  bankers who were appointed as board chairmen along with me are  educated, knowledgeable, honest, and "still unblemished"  persons. We have to do the people's business; the public, the  press, and television must be informed of our every step; and  the people must hand down the verdict--not the way it's being  done now, with prejudiced notions, using campaign methods, and  insinuating statements, but weighing everyone's virtues and  defects.    Banks, and bankers, must work strictly according to the  rules  and laws.    It is urgent and essential to create banks of the Western  type. The wheel has already been invented, and we can't do any  better; what we have to do is pick up on everything advanced and  progressive and adopt it in accordance with Georgia's interests  and Georgian realities.    We must also keep in mind that our banks' computer equipment  is very primitive, and transactions are being carried out using  the old methods at the same old pace. The reason is that the  system is backward. Everything needs to be changed as soon as  possible. I repeat, it is essential to create a banking system  that befits a civilized country. It is the banks that will have  to save Georgia. I hope that a strong cadre of bankers will soon  take shape in Georgia to serve as a guarantee of the  irreversibility of the country's democracy. [end of Q and A]    It looks as if this new executive, who is dedicated to  his cause, pays attention to every detail, and favors strong  financial discipline, is going to have to thoroughly overhaul  the banking business.    Meanwhile, the hullabaloo concerning the banks  continues. There are some who are categorically rejecting the  new people. There are those who are doubtful that the new  people's experience is sufficient to rebuild the banks and solve  their problems.    Whatever the case, the choice has been made, and a "new  broom" is coming.    We would like to accost the Great Ilia once more and  remind you of what he said: "The bank represents one of the best  and most reliable aspects of our life. Therefore, anyone who  cares about our country ought not to gleefully seize upon every  mistake, failure of foresight, and other shortcomings of the  bank--these are inevitable in any new endeavor--but rather take  careful note of them and just as diligently try to correct the  mistake and eliminate the defect."</p>

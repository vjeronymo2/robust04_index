			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iraq informed Britain that it has detained a British nurse in connection with  the activities of a British-based journalist arrested last month, the Foreign  Office said in London. An Iraqi spokesman said Daphne Parish, 45, was arrested  Sept. 19 while working in a private hospital in Baghdad. Iraqi authorities, who  have so far refused to grant British consular officials access to Parish, told  the Foreign Office that her detention is linked to the arrest Sept. 15 of  Farzat Bazoft. The Observer newspaper said last month that Bazoft covered  elections in Kurdistan and then went to the Al Iskandria area south of Baghdad  to investigate reports of a huge explosion.  </P></p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Court probe into cash dispensers: Banks and building societies face action over 'phantom withdrawals' BANKS and building societies face the prospect of a High Court action later this week which will attempt to prove legally for the first time that the ubiquitous hole-in-the-wall cash dispenser is fallible. However, Mr Denis Whalley, a Merseyside solicitor who is preparing the cases of about 400 alleged victims of 'phantom withdrawals' from automated teller machines (ATMs), believes banks and building societies are doing their utmost to avoid appearing in court. Their blanket defence that ATMs are infallible has not been legally tested in any country. After months of resistance, there has been a sudden flurry of ex gratia payments of up to several hundred pounds to customers who were preparing to take financial institutions to court, according to Mr Whalley, an associate solicitor at J Keith Park Co in St Helens. Mr Richard Tyson-Davies, of the Association of Payment Clearing Services, the inter-bank organisation which handles cheque-clearing and other payment systems, said he was not aware of any 'run for cover'. He said he expected the financial institutions to fight the court action prepared by Mr Whalley. 'The banks are confident in the security of their system,' he commented. Mr Whalley believes the ex gratia settlements are unsatisfactory. 'You do not cure a toothache by taking an aspirin. Eventually you have got to go to the dentist.' He will attempt to prove that withdrawals can be made from ATMs through no fault or involvement of the card holder. The banks argue that there is no such thing as a phantom withdrawal. The card and the personal identification number (PIN) are needed to withdraw cash and because card holders undertake to keep their PIN secret, it follows that no withdrawal can take place unless the holders break their side of the contract, according to the banks. Mr Tyson-Davies says ATM fraud is not a serious problem. 'Out of Pounds 165m worth of plastic fraud last year, under Pounds 3m occured through ATMs. There is no evidence that somebody has found a way into the system,' he said. Mr Whalley intends to open a 'multi-plaintiff action' in the High Court. He has prepared about 30 cases, and he plans to add on cases week by week. Many of them are taking a long time to administer because of legal aid requirements. He hopes his tactics of flooding the banks and building societies with complainants will prevent them settling cases on an ad hoc basis. This will be the first group action involving a large number of people with relatively small claims who could not afford to sue individually, according to Mr Alistair Kelman, counsel for the group. The case will be heard in the official referee's court, which deals with highly technical disputes. The prosecution, in an-other first, will use a database in the trial. 'The database will cross reference the cases and discover links between them and where the faults are occurring. We will be able to make all sorts of complex searches,' said Mr Kelman.</p>

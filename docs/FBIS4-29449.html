			<p>BFN     [Text] Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong has  proposed a two-step approach to keep Singapore active in the  global economy. He said the government will continue to come out  with competitive strategy to further strengthen the domestic  economy which will be the mainstay of the nation's prosperity.  In addition, Singapore must create more economic space by  becoming a partner of growth in the Asia-Pacific region.    Mr. Yeo was speaking at the Singapore International Chamber  of Commerce luncheon. He said given the abundant regional  opportunities, Singapore's external economy should grow rapidly  to match that of Switzerland and the Netherlands. At present,  our level of private investment abroad is only about two-thirds  of these two countries. However, Mr. Yeo stressed that  Singapore must ensure a right balance between the domestic and  external pressures. The growth of the external economy should  complement and not fall out with the domestic one.</p>

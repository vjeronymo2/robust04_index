			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: A NEW NOTE IN HISTORY  </P> <P> When you think of American history books, what comes to mind is volumes filled  with lofty and exalted names out of our nation's illustrious past: George  Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln.  </P> <P> But a new scholarly work, written by Richard Aquila, a professor of history at  Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., contains some names that probably have  not appeared in previous studies of the United States and its historic legacy:  the Ronettes, Paul and Paula, the Hollywood Argyles, Eddie Cochran, Ferlin  Husky.  </P> <P> The book, from the looks of its cover, appears to be a lighthearted piece of  fluff; it is called "That Old Time Rock &amp; Roll," and the cover art is of  the parking lot of an ice cream stand. But the subtitle is "A Chronicle of an  Era: 1954-1963," and Aquila insists that his intention was for the book to be a  learned and serious examination of that era of American history.  </P> <P> "That was the first decade of rock 'n' roll," Aquila said. "The image of young  Americans of that era is of people in motorcycle jackets, carrying switch-blade  knives. The truth, though, is that although there were certainly signs of  rebellion, for the most part it was a conservative era, and the rock 'n' roll  songs reflected traditional values regarding the family unit, religion and  anti-communism."  </P> <P> For supporting evidence, the professor fills 370 pages with examples and  analysis of the music of the times. "Take the song 'Mama Said,' " the professor  advised, referring to a 1961 tune by the Shirelles. "Rather than showing  rebellion against a parent, 'Mama Said' points out a desire for a close  relationship with the mother. The mama has said that there will be 'days like  this' -- and the child knows that the mother is right."  </P> <P> Relationships between males and females are mirrored in the songs of the era,  Aquila said. "One of the best examples is 'I Will Follow Him,' " the professor  said.  </P> <P> (Columnist's note: "I Will Follow Him" was released by a vocalist named Little  Peggy March in 1963, and if you had ventured the thought back then that one day  Little Peggy March would appear in a history book, you would have been laughed  at. Come on now. Little Peggy March.) " 'I Will Follow Him' reflected the  common notion of the time that women must be subservient to men," Aquila said.  "Little Peggy March sings that she will 'follow him' regardless of where 'he'  goes -- over mountains, oceans. She keeps repeating: 'I love him, I love him, I  love him, and where he goes, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow.'  </P> <P> "It was different for males. Dion presents an interesting example. In  'Runaround Sue,' Dion is referring to a girl who fools around with other guys.  And what is Dion's message? 'Stay away from my Runaround Sue.' Runaround Sue is  considered bad. But in his very next release, 'The Wanderer,' you can see how,  when it's the male who behaves that way, it is considered acceptable. Dion's  message is that it is cool to have a girl on each arm -- and 'Rosie' tattooed  on his chest."  </P> <P> Aquila's previous book was "The Iroquois Restoration," a history of American  Indians, and he said that his methodology for that book was the same as his  methodology for this one. This time around, though, he is using the Kingston  Trio's "Scotch and Soda" as an artifact of the nation's attitude toward alcohol  consumption, and Skeeter Davis' "The End of the World" -- which I always  thought was just a sad, pretty song -- as an example of "the apocalyptic  imagery of the Cold War era."  </P> <P> There was one question I had to ask the professor: What about "Bobby's Girl"?  </P> <P> "Marcie Blane sang that song," Aquila said.  </P> <P> "I'm quite aware of that," I said. "I just want to know if it means anything  historically."  </P> <P> "The lyrics were blatantly sexist," he said. "They relegated the girl's  existence to a mere appendage of the boy's -- which was a good reflection of  the times. The girl's only goal is to prove she's 'not a kid anymore.' She is  implicitly willing to put her career and her life on the back burner. Why? So  she can achieve the one role that is important to her -- to be 'Bobby's Girl."'  </P> <P> The professor's next book, he said, will be another history of American  Indians. Presumably Little Peggy March will not be included. Although you never  know.  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Industry must highlight abuses Sir, Andrew Baxter's article ('UK alleges EC procurement malpractice', September 23) identifies a number of the obstacles to the application of the EC public procurement rules. However, it also underlines the general lack of awareness of this area of the internal market rules. There are now half a dozen public procurement directives (rather than a single one), the earliest of which, covering the award of public works contracts, has applied to UK authorities since July 1973, some 20 years before the date indicated in the article. The latest directive, covering the award of contracts for services by both public and private utilities, was to have been implemented by July 1 this year. The UK has not yet done so and is therefore itself not entirely above criticism. The rules allow those unfairly excluded from a public tendering procedure to apply to the national courts for an injunction suspending the procedure and also provide for an award of damages. At the same time, the Department of Trade and Industry and the European Commission are usually receptive to complaints about failure to comply with the rules. It is largely up to industry to highlight the abuses so that the institutions can act. Peter R Willis, solicitor, Turner Kenneth Brown, 19 avenue des Arts, 1040 Brussels, Belgium</p>

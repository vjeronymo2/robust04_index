The Board's Rules of Procedure provide that a request for reconsideration of a Board decision must present relevant facts that for good cause shown were not previously presented to the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shawmut represents in its request that relevant facts not previously considered by the Board are now available. In particular, Shawmut refers to its settlement with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission of charges of illegal discrimination by Shawmut Mortgage Company; its improved lending record as reflected by 1993 data filed under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA); the results of its efforts to ensure that HMDA data are accurate; managerial and organizational changes designed to strengthen compliance; and the results of steps initiated to improve its lending to minority and low- and moderate-income communities. In light of these facts, Shawmut maintains that the Board should grant the petition and approve the proposed acquisition. Notice of the filing of the petition is published in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the petition. The Board expects to act on the petition no later than May 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551.

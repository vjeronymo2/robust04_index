			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cascades to sell eight boxboard plants CASCADES, the international packaging and fine paper group, has put eight North American boxboard plants, valued at CDollars 300m (USDollars 235m), up for sale. The cigarette packaging and converting plants, which employ 1,250, were part of Cascades' acquisition of Paperboard Industries in 1992. Paperboard, which is 63 per cent owned by Cascades, now includes all the Cascades group's European and North American boxboard interests. It went public last year. Mr Laurent Lemaire, Cascades chairman, said the eight plants, some of which are unable to use recycled material, did not fit into the company's long-term strategy. There were five or six potential bidders for the plants, he added. Cascades Paperboard recorded a loss of CDollars 5.1m, or 13 cents a share, in the quarter to March, against a profit of CDollars 443,000, or 2 cents. Mr Lemaire said that Paperboard sales and profits should improve later this year, though the North American and European markets remained generally depressed. A boxboard plant in Duffel, Belgium, will be closed temporarily and converted to use recycled materials. Air Canada is raising USDollars 190m by selling five Airbus 320 aircraft to a group of international banks in a long-term leasing deal.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodwyn gas site insurance settled Woodside Petroleum, the Australian oil and gas company, announced yesterday that the partners in Western Australia's North West Shelf gas project had settled an insurance claim for repairs to the foundation piles for ADollars 280m (USDollars 205m). This is ADollars 40m below the actual remedial expenses, put at ADollars 320m, before allowing for the cost of delays. The problem arose two years ago when piles being driven into the seabed underneath the Goodwyn gas and condensate production platform buckled. The insurance money returned, and the remaining costs, will be shared equally between the six partners, Woodside, BHP, BP, Chevron, Japan Australia LNG (MIMI), and Shell.</p>

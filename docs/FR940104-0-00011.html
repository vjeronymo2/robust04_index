			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that Order No. 497&hyph;D is inconsistent with Order No. 636. They assert that the Commission has unequivocally found in Order No. 636 that sales services are competitive and has set in motion a restructuring of the pipeline industry that is intended to result in competition for sales on an even basis by producers, pipelines, and marketers. The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that Order No. 497&hyph;D is at odds with Order No. 636 in its assumption (which is unsupported by record evidence) that pipelines possess sales and marketing information which flows from the pipelines' anticompetitive market power. They state that, as the Commission documented in Order No. 636, most pipeline industry market power has already been eliminated, and some individual companies have completed the transition to competitiveness by unbundling. They further state that to remove the last vestiges of pipeline market power, as the Commission sees it in Order No. 636, an industry-wide unbundling is to be in place by the start of the 1993&hyph;94 heating season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that in light of unbundling under Order No. 636, it is inexplicable how the Commission could see a need to re-promulgate standard (f) with regard to sales and marketing information. They state that when Order No. 497 was issued, prior to unbundling, the Commission's intent was to prevent preferential treatment of an affiliated marketer by an interstate pipeline in the provision of transportation services. The pipelines and the Joint Parties state that, as recognized by the Commission, pipelines have no monopoly power over sales. They assert that it is only a pipeline's transportation function which even arguably puts it in a position of being able to favor its own marketing affiliates. Consequently, they argue that the standards of conduct under Order No. 497 should only apply to pipeline transportation information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that the new contemporaneous disclosure requirement in Order No. 497&hyph;D imposes unnecessary and unreasonable burdens upon pipelines. They state that, as Chair Moler noted in her dissent to Order No. 497&hyph;D, the standards of conduct under Order No. 497 already preclude pipelines from disclosing to marketing affiliates any information obtained from non-affiliated shippers, or otherwise giving any advantages or preferences to their marketing affiliates in the provision of transportation service. The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that these requirements effectively prevent pipelines from using any remaining market power they have over transportation services to benefit their marketing affiliates, and make the Order No. 497&hyph;D disclosure requirements unnecessary. The pipelines and the Joint Parties do not believe that in light of all of the current competition in the natural gas industry, pipelines have significant market power over transportation service. However, to the extent there is any remaining market power over transportation service, the pipelines and the Joint Parties argue that the Order No. 497 standards of conduct adequately address this issue without a need for the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for sales and marketing information. They submit that the Commission's imposition of the Order No. 497&hyph;D contemporaneous disclosure requirement only serves to benefit pipeline competitors, and imposes unnecessary burdens on pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pipelines and the Joint Parties argue that the Commission cites no evidence to support its critical conclusion that the sales and marketing information that a pipeline derives from its ongoing relationship with its customers is a product of either past or present anticompetitive market power. They assert that the Commission's error on this point is exacerbated by its lack of jurisdiction to regulate the disclosure of sales or marketing information at all. The pipelines and Joint Parties state, as the court noted, because the Commission is authorized to regulate only those practices that are unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission appears to lack the authority to prevent pipelines from preferring their affiliates with exclusive access to sales or marketing information unless that sort of preference is undue. The pipelines and Joint Parties contend that the Commission cannot resolve questions about the very existence of its authority based on nothing more than its sense that the informational advantages that a gas marketer derives from an affiliated pipeline result from anticompetitive market power rather than the economic efficiencies of vertical integration. The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that the contemporaneous disclosure requirement also exceeds the Commission's lawful authority because the Commission is only empowered to act with respect to any transportation or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. They state that the contemporaneous disclosure requirement apparently applies to the sharing of information regardless of whether a jurisdictional service is being performed. The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that there is plainly no lawful basis for the Commission to extend its regulation to non-jurisdictional services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pipelines and the Joint Parties argue that even assuming that the pipeline generates certain sales and marketing information that is not publicly available, mere sharing of this information with an affiliate does not translate into a transportation advantage for an affiliate,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> even if the pipeline informs an affiliate of a potential sales market, that does not mean that the pipeline can automatically provide the affiliate with the transportation capacity necessary to complete the deal. Indeed, they assert that the affording of such a preference is precluded under &sect;161.3(c) which states that a pipeline may not give its marketing affiliate preference over nonaffiliated customers in matters relating to part 284 transportation, including, but not limited to, scheduling, balancing, transportation, storage, or curtailment priority. The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that all the Commission's contemporaneous disclosure requirement does is to limit the flow of information in the market in a manner which hinders competition and serves no legitimate purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

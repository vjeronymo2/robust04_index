			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL MASS TO BE OFFERED GAY CATHOLICS  </P> <P> Homosexual Catholics will be offered a special weekly Mass by the Diocese of  San Jose, starting April 1.  </P> <P> Bishop Pierre DuMaine also announced plans for expanded sacramental and  spiritual activities as part of the diocese's new pastoral guidelines for the  ministry of homosexuals.  </P> <P> "The guidelines accept, without elaboration, the perennial teaching of the  Catholic Church on sexual morality, conscience and personal sin," said Father  Eugene J. Boyle, spokesman for the diocese, which serves 355,000 Catholics.  "It's a matter of supplying religious services for members of this (homosexual)  group who want this service.  </P> <P> "This is not an attempt to segregate gay and lesbian Catholics out," he said.  "Many will continue to go to their parishes, where, for the most part, they are  accepted."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mass at University  </P> <P> A chapter of the national Catholic gay group, Dignity, has been sponsoring Mass  at the Campus Christian Center chapel associated with San Jose State  University. Members of the group worked out an arrangement with church  officials to allow the diocese to take over sponsorship of the services.  </P> <P> "It seems to be in complete conformity to what the Vatican asked for and what a  few other dioceses in this country are doing," said Bill Ryan, spokesman for  the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington.  </P> <P> Despite church teachings against an active homosexual life style, dioceses in  Chicago, San Francisco and a few other cities have held services for  homosexuals and taken over sponsorship from Dignity after its 1987 declaration.  The archdiocese of Los Angeles does not have weekly services specifically for  homosexuals but welcomes them at regular Mass.  </P> <P> Homosexual orientation is being accepted, Boyle said, though Catholic teaching  declares sexual activity outside marriage immoral.  </P> <P> In 1986, the Vatican issued a letter to bishops on the pastoral care of  homosexuals and asked them to develop "appropriate forms" of care.  </P> <P> "No one's going to make a personal judgment on who comes to Mass or does not  come," Boyle said. "We're offering the opportunity of religious services for  gay and lesbian Catholics who want to partake of it. When it comes to matters  of conscience, that's between themselves and God. We're not going to judge  that."  </P></p>

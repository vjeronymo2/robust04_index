Semenov, Moscow;  UDC541.143]    [Abstract] Photochemically active poly-functional  compounds, which may be derived from styryl dyes and contain the  crown ester group, and capable of selective complex formation  with metal cations, present great interest. Such selective  chromogenic crown esters may be used, for example, in the  colorimetric determination of cations. Furthermore, the  capability of crown ester-containing styryl dyes to change  structurally under light makes it possible to consider them as  elements in photo-switching molecular devices. In the present  work the synthesis of indole from nitropyridinium salts was  improved and a method was developed for the synthesis of  quaternary salts of new indolenine derivatives. The resulting  indolenine salts condense with formyl derivatives of crown  esters to styryl series dyes. Photoisomerization and complex  formation of the crown ester-containing dyes with salts of  alkali and alkaline earth metals was studied. A correlation was  found to exist between the magnitude of spectral shift of the  long wave absorption maximum of the dye, and the size and charge  density on the metal cation.

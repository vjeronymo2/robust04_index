			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tanja Jakobi: "When the Illusions Die"] </F>   [Text] "Approximately 180,000 people, representing the  technological redundancy in the economy of Serbia, could  immediately move to the country," the deputy director of the  republic labor market has said. Dr. Zoran Popov, member of the  coordinating body for implementing the anti-inflation program,  who is responsible for social welfare issues, laconically stated  that those who go back to agriculture will be far better off  than those who stay in the city. He added that 250,000 out of  the 2 million employees in the socialized sector of the economy  possess an average of seven hectares of land. And that, it  seems, is that: The half-breeds should simply pack their  suitcases and go back to their native village.    Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, professor, whose team includes Dr.  Popov, never misses a chance to say that no one will be left  without a job and put out on the street. Jovan Zebic, federal  deputy prime minister (responsible for carrying out this  program), has said that amendments of the law will soon be  examined making it possible for enterprise directors to rid  themselves of technological redundancies more easily, but only  to a maximum of 20 percent of the total labor force. The Serbian  Government (whose task it is to put the measures in its domain  in operational terms) has extended the validity of the current  decree on mandatory leave to 31 March and left it to the new  government to rack its brain and leave office because of the  worker dissatisfaction that is in the offing.    In the meantime that part of Avramovic's program which said  that the surplus of employed persons in the economy is estimated  at a million people has been "edited." Forecasts are now being  mentioned stating that in the second half of the year 300,000  people would be on mandatory leave, as many again would be the  "employed redundancy," accompanied by the cloudy remark that in  the first half of the year that ratio was somewhat less  favorable. The suitcases of the half-breeds, then, can stay  where they are at least two months more.  <H5>  The Mistake </H5>   Just as a law was passed a few months ago whereby everyone  who has a private firm and works in the socialized sector must  urgently give up one or the other fired up the "small fry"  (owners of firms that exist on paper) and caused a stampede in  front of the registration courts, so this idea of purging the  "sluggish socialist economy" has caused static. The  half-breeds--fearing to lose their jobs, are saying that the  land is not actually theirs, and the "city dwellers" are  exulting in secret.    There is some economic and social basis for referring to the  half-breeds as a category that can be "displaced" from the  factories most easily and painlessly. An analysis done in the  Economics Institute in Belgrade shows that in the dramatic  stratifications of population over the last 15 years, and  especially over the last three years, the nonfarm and purely  agricultural households have been impoverished the most, while  the half-breeds suddenly escaped poverty. Most of the  half-breeds come from households that have at least the average  landholding, and very few of them have small parcels.    A few other figures support the position of the government:  In the breakdown of the income of these households, 45 percent  comes from regular employment, while the remainder is income  from a shop or from a farm. Ergo, the half-breeds have already  created a second and stronger source of income. Third, the  half-breeds by and large have lower qualifications, so that it  is easier for the firm to do without this kind of manpower.  Finally, the government (and society), in view of investments in  their education, is losing less by their return to the country  than through the "brain drain" of highly trained personnel.    "The return of the half-breeds to the country is a frivolous  idea and completely unfeasible if we preclude repression," is  the categorical assertion of Dr. Mladen Stojanov, professor of  rural sociology at the School of Agriculture in Novi Sad. "The  half-breeds are people who work somewhere and have a bit of land  or some tie to the country. It is certain that they will  strengthen their ties to the country, but they will not leave  the city."  <H5>  The Misunderstandings </H5>   The hard logic of capital, Dr. Stojanov explains, says that  agriculture has been and still is a subsidized sector, and there  is no chance of its becoming so profitable that it would  "outstrip" the city. "It is only the airheads and the burghers  in the city who tend to think: `You have carrots, you have  potatoes, life is easy for you.' Those are misunderstandings."    Professor Stojanov is given indirect support for his  position  by Dr. Petar Markovic, another professor who teaches in the  School of Agriculture in Belgrade. In an open letter sent to  Prime Minister Kontic, he warns that "rural life is being  extinguished because for decades income has been taken away from  agriculture and because of a number of unresolved issues related  to the status of farmers, land policy, and settlement," and in  demographic terms rural areas are being depopulated. So, there  is no economic interest in going back to the country.    "All our experience last year," says Dr. Mirosinka Dinkic of  the Economics Institute in response, "shows that those workers  who were sent on mandatory leave and had land in the country  have themselves and without pressure turned to farming, behaving  in accordance with their own sound economic interest, and thanks  to that they have preserved their standard of living."    When she speaks about the return of the half-breeds to the  country, Dr. Dinkic is primarily thinking of the smaller cities  in Serbia and their industry, which was in fact conceived in  order to employ the rural population. That "subspecies," as we  might call it, of half-breed (by contrast with those in  Belgrade, for example, who have built houses on the outskirts of  the city, but their farms are somewhere in the south of Serbia)  already lives in the country, has up to now been commuting to a  nearby city to work in a factory (Gornji Milanovac, Kragujevac,  Cacak, Backa Palanka), so that it was engaged in production work  in the first part of the day and farm work in the latter part.  "Why should these people not devote themselves exclusively to  farming, at least temporarily, now that the situation in  industry is so difficult? The idea of the program is not  repression nor distributing pink slips, but for the person who  is receiving the minimum compensation from the budget and has  social security to decide himself whether he will go into the  private sector, say, or to what is perhaps closer to  him--farming. In that case, the government could stimulate this  process by exempting those who return from the tax on cadastre  income," Dr. Dinkic said.    Because the average mixed household has four members and in  a  third of such households both adult members are employed in a  socialized firm, it would be enough for only one to return to  farming, while the other could maintain ties to the city. In the  opinion of Dr. Dinkic, there is no reason to overlook Belgrade  either, because most of the half-breeds are mainly employed  seasonally on construction work, they usually do not bring their  family to the capital (so the problem of educating the children  is not raised), or at the least they have parents in the country.    "In order to create space for those people to go back to the  country, they would have to have plots larger than 50 hectares,  not three hectares, which is the average for Serbia, and a great  deal of startup capital, which they do not have," Dr. Stojanov  said.    Prof. Jeremija Simic of the School of Agriculture in  Belgrade  points to another dimension of this problem: 60 percent of the  manpower in Yugoslavia comes from mixed households and for  precisely that reason they have been able to withstand the  crisis, and the entire society thanks to them. "Why would any of  them at this point want to change that position of theirs, which  is not good, but tolerable, for a position that is worse?"  Professor Simic asked.    "So long as the process of going back to the country is a  spontaneous and individual act, that is fine. But a large-scale  return to the country is a process that has not been recorded  anywhere in the world. Any directive from the government,  however well-intentioned it might be, would be dangerous. Here  is why: Let us assume that a worker in a firm has high  qualifications and land, while another does not have a farm and  has low qualifications. In that case, is the firm supposed to  get rid of the expert, only because he has some other income,  and commit itself to the social welfare approach and hold on to  the one who is not contributing to the work process, but would  be a welfare case if he left the firm?" Contrary to the  proclaimed goal of the anti-inflation program--to move social  welfare out of the economy, Professor Simic believes that both  the firm and government must conduct some kind of social welfare  policy. He cites Sartid 1913, which has turned from castings to  raising mushrooms, as an example of how the technological  surplus can be employed, but in close relation to agriculture.  "Other firms might also lease land for their workers and engage  in the production of medicinal herbs, the raising of mushrooms,  or fish farming," NIN's informant proposed. "Aside from the  natural factors, live manpower is our only resource, and instead  of the idea of a return to the country, we should turn toward  production programs which seek intensive activation of manpower."</p>

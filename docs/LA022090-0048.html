			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: THE TRUE GENESIS OF HIS AWARD REMAINS UNCERTAIN  </P> <P> Having written columns in defense of bats, coyotes and frogs, I found myself  the other day among 27 recipients of the Genesis Award at a luncheon given by  the Fund for Animals in the Beverly Hilton.  </P> <P> Although the menu was vegetarian, in keeping with the spirit of the awards, the  audience was enthusiastic -- almost boisterous -- greeting the winners with  heavy applause, whistles and hoots of approval. There were many celebrities  present.  </P> <P> The award itself was a plaque bearing a bronze replica of the fund's logo --  Noah's ark, whose story in Genesis was cited in the program as the first "news  report" of an animal rescue operation.  </P> <P> By pure luck I sat next to Karen Caesar, an intense, articulate young woman who  exemplifies the principles of the animal protectionists. Ms. Caesar not only  does not eat meat in any form, she told me, but also avoids eggs and dairy  products, and does not wear fur or leather.  </P> <P> "You don't even have leather shoes?" I asked.  </P> <P> She said no; it is quite possible to buy shoes made of vinyl and other  non-animal products.  </P> <P> Chastened by this litany of self-denial, I was happy with my luncheon of  vegetable crepes on a bed of fresh spinach, with baby carrots, asparagus and  carmelized onion.  </P> <P> Most of the winners were from radio, television and the movies, and with a few  exceptions, they were present. Video clips of various winning shows were shown  on a screen.  </P> <P> Especially entertaining were clips from "General Hospital," about the ivory  trade, "L.A. Law," about the trapping of fur animals, "Born Free," about the  liberation of a lion, and "Gorillas in the Mist," about the life and death of  Dian Fossey among the gorillas.  </P> <P> I was first on the list to receive my award. Foreseeing that it was going to be  a long afternoon, I tried to set a good example by being brief. I said I didn't  know why I was being honored, but I thought it might be for something I had  written about frogs.  </P> <P> What I had written about frogs, actually, was a column applauding Jenifer  Graham, who, as a high school girl, had defied the authorities by refusing to  dissect a frog in biology class. I recalled that I had had to dissect a frog in  my biology class, and that I had not enjoyed it.  </P> <P> Some time later I was upstaged by the appearance of Ms. Graham herself. CBS had  received an award for a dramatization of her story. A video showed a scene in  which an actress playing Graham explained her feelings before a board.  </P> <P> Afterward I fought my way through the crowds to Graham and asked her if she had  read my column. She didn't remember it. Oh, well, maybe I got the award for the  ones about bats and coyotes.  </P> <P> Actually, my consciousness was raised. I was horrified by video clips on the  poaching of elephants for ivory, the cruel trapping of animals for fur, and the  imprisonment of calves for veal.  </P> <P> I asked Ms. Caesar if it was all right to eat eggs. She said it was all right  if the hens were range-fed, "so they have room to run around in."  </P> <P> I didn't ask about bacon. I felt sure I knew what the answer would be.  </P> <P> I am an animal lover, and I don't like to see them exploited or mistreated. But  I'm afraid my commitment is not quite pure. I have virtually given up red meat  (except for an occasional hamburger), but I eat chicken and fish. I do not wear  fur or buy fur. I shun ivory. I do take insulin, which I suppose was developed  through laboratory experiments on animals. But I don't use cosmetics.  </P> <P> A pretty spotty record, actually, for a Genesis Award winner.  </P> <P> But I discovered that Ms. Caesar has a chink in her armor, too. "Twice a year,"  she said, "I eat a turkey sandwich. I love it."  </P> <P> However, she went on to say, she does not eat turkey at Thanksgiving. "I feel  that at Thanksgiving I have to make a stand."  </P> <P> I have decided not to eat turkey at Thanksgiving, and I am going to give up  turkey sandwiches altogether. But I don't think I can give up leather shoes.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, be nice to a coyote and make room in your heart for a bat.  </P></p>

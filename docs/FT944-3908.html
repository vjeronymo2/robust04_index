			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: US airlines The tumble taken by the US air transport sector last week after Southwest Airlines' profits warning is understandable. If Southwest, the most consistently profitable US airline, is heading into turbulence, the outlook for the others must be grim. The paradox is that the industry's macroeconomic environment is bright. The US economy is in the fourth year of recovery; passenger growth this year is a steady 4 per cent and fuel costs are near all-time lows. The industry is also helping itself by cutting domestic capacity. Yet the industry is not prospering. While people are travelling more, they are paying less. Discounting is acute because the barriers to entry in the airline industry are so low. Each time an established airline cuts staff and aircraft it gives new carriers the chance to pick up jets and trained staff on the cheap. Costs at Valujet, a no-frills airline, are 40 per cent below those at USAir. The big airlines can cut distribution, maintenance and staff costs further, but not far enough. Consolidation would help, but only for a while, until new low-cost carriers took the place of those merged or closed. Those with high margin routes to markets such as Latin America and Asia may prosper. For large carriers cornered in the domestic market, prospects are bleak.</p>

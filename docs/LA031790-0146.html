			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RETIREES VOLUNTEERING TO ASSIST THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES  </P> <P> Pierre le Boulanger, 60, a retired farmer from Brittany, had never left France  before he went to Cameroon to help an investor set up a poultry farm. Annick  Marie, 58, a former secretary, stayed a year in Togo teaching a young secretary  in a Christian diocese.  </P> <P> They could have stayed home watching TV or playing with their grandchildren.  Instead, like about 2,000 other retirees in France, they volunteered to share  time and knowledge with Third World countries through a private nonprofit  association of retired people dedicated to promoting development and  cooperation between the West and developing nations.  </P> <P> The oldest volunteer in the group known as AGIR is 88, the youngest 43. The  group says retired craftsmen, bankers, technicians, nurses, teachers,  engineers, farmers and company managers have put in a total of 30,000 workdays  in the Third World since the group was created in 1983.  </P> <P> Volunteers are performing such tasks as conducting a study on the  reorganization of the National Development Bank of Mali, taking care of  disabled and abandoned children in Haiti and assisting a Tuareg tribe of nomads  begin a settled agricultural life.  </P> <P> "We are retired people who want to live more wisely than just playing Petanque  or dealing out cards," says the group's president, Jean Petithory, 55. "What we  are doing may just be a drop in the ocean -- sometimes you have to use a  magnifying glass to notice it -- but several drops dispersed all over the  world, combined with the action of other non-governmental organizations, can  make a difference."  </P> <P> But the study of the National Development Bank of Mali was not a drop in the  ocean, development experts say. The volunteers were contacted by the World  Bank, which otherwise would have hired expensive specialists. The team has  spent more than two years rethinking an institution responsible for 80% of the  government loans to Malian companies.  </P> <P> "Since the National Development Bank closed, the Malian economy was stalling,"  said Robert le Duhan, 67, a former financial public administrator.  </P> <P> Fifty volunteers went to Mali, among them six financial specialists who worked  through the end of last year. Another project sent 15 professors to Cambodia to  work on rebuilding an education system for 10 villages.  </P> <P> The group is funded by subscriptions, private sponsors and public grants. It  usually asks clients to pay for travel and accommodations for volunteers. When  the project involves major funding, however, they work with other  non-governmental organizations, such as the Friends of Mother Theresa.  </P> <P> In his professional capacity, Le Duhan administered varied organizations that  used public funding. He has used that experience in five trips to Africa to  reorganize clinics, dioceses or manufacturers, often living in the poorest  areas.  </P> <P> He remembered with emotion the warm welcome he received: "It is always the poor  people that give the most. Villagers were amazed and admiring of this old lady  or this old man who came to see, talk and work with them instead of staying  home and playing bridge."  </P> <P> He said he is spiritually richer and has new vision: "Now I have a more  realistic view of developing problems. But above all, I have discovered  populations accepting their fate with a dignity and a happiness unknown in  France."  </P></p>

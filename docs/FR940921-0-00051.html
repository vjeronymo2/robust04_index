Given the wide range of natural gas compositions currently available throughout the United States, the Agency proposed very broad specifications for natural gas certification fuel. These specifications included a range for methane content of 74 to 98.5 percent, as well as broad ranges for several other parameters. In the case of LPG fuel, much less information is available about composition variability nationally. Thus, commercially available LPG was proposed as the certification fuel, with no specific ranges set on any parameters other than that the primary constituent be propane. The NPRM contained no provisions for the regulation of in-use composition of either fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the Agency received some comments in support of its proposed certification fuel specifications, in general commenters believed that the proposed specifications were much too broad. In terms of natural gas specifications, the comments in favor of tighter specifications fell into two general categories. First, several commenters stated that they agreed with EPA's general approach of a broadly defined specification in order that certification fuel be representative of in-use fuel. These commenters, however, felt that the proposed fuel specification was much too broad and encompassed fuels which could not be considered representative of most natural gas. Other commenters felt that, in order to be able to meaningfully compare results from different tests, a very narrowly defined test fuel specification is needed. Most of these commenters recommended that EPA adopt the California Air Resources Board (CARB) certification fuel (90% methane,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1%, among other requirements) as the federal certification fuel. Some of the commenters who recommended a narrower range of specifications suggested that EPA adopt a range of specifications which would allow the use of CARB certification fuel (e.g., 89% methane, minimum, etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency received little comment on the proposed LPG certification fuel specifications. A few commenters suggested that EPA adopt the CARB LPG certification fuel specifications (93.5% propane,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1%, etc.) as the federal certification fuel. Some commenters agreed with the proposal, stating that it allowed for the use of butane mixtures in LPG vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to comments about certification fuel specifications, several comments were received requesting that the Agency adopt in-use fuel specifications. These comments generally came from engine and vehicle manufacturers. These commenters explained that in order to get maximum emission benefits from gaseous-fueled vehicles it is important to minimize in-use fuel composition variability. In addition, heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers stated that, unlike stoichiometric engines utilizing oxygen sensor feedback control systems, lean-burn diesel engines have no way of accounting for fuel composition variability, and thus may encounter operational difficulties on some fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency both understands and sees the merits in the arguments for tighter certification fuel specifications. However, as was previously stated, EPA also believes it is important that certification fuel be representative of in-use fuel. Thus, in developing today's final rule the Agency has attempted to find a middle ground between these seemingly conflicting needs. In the case of natural gas certification fuel, the Agency is adopting the approach suggested by some commenters that the specification remain somewhat broad, but allow for the use of CARB certification fuel. This specification includes a minimum methane content of 89 percent, among other parameters. For the complete certification fuel specifications please see the regulatory text of today's rule. These specifications were chosen both because they encompass over 90 percent of natural gas sold in the country and because there was some general support for them in the comments as a good compromise between EPA's proposed specifications and CARB certification fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Almost all of the gas not covered by this specification (i.e., gas with a methane content below 89 percent) is sold in high altitude areas where the gas tends to contain higher levels of inert gases than that sold at low altitudes. The Agency believes that excluding high altitude gas from the specifications should not present a problem for vehicles which are certified using the 89 percent minimum methane certification fuel but are operated at high altitudes because, in general, vehicles which will be certified under the provisions of today's rule are expected to utilize electronic feedback control systems for proper management of the fuel/air ratio. The Agency believes that these systems will be able to account for any differences in fuel composition between high altitude natural gas and natural gas in the rest of the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

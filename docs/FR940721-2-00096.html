No. 85&hyph;3073 (E.D. Pa.), was lodged on June 29, 1994, with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This proposed Modification to Consent Decree conforms the remedy for certain groundwater contamination affecting municipal drinking water wells in Hatboro Borough, Pennsylvania to the remedy chosen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') in its Record of Decision (``ROD'') to abate groundwater contamination at and under a Site located at Jacksonville Road, Hatboro Borough commonly referred to as the ``Raymark Site.'' The original Consent Decree was entered prior to EPA's publication of the ROD and required the Hatboro Borough Municipal Authority (which had been compensated under the Decree by Defendants' payments of $612,500) to perform pumping and treating of water at a location different than that later set forth in the ROD. Under the proposed Modification to Decree, Hatboro will remain responsible for performing work which ultimately will exhaust the $612,500 it received under the Decree, as well as interest earned on those funds. EPA will perform all other remedial measures, using Superfund money. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree Modification.

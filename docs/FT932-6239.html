			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Germany's 'first lady' retires at 81 MRS Grete Schickedanz, 'the first lady of the German economy', has given up her last business commitments at the age of 81. As head of the family which owns the Gustav und Grete Schickedanz group, a mail-order, retailing, paper, beer and banking concern with around DM18bn (Pounds 7.10bn) annual sales, she is one of the most celebrated business people in Germany. The unofficial 'first lady' title was conferred by Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the federal president, and earned through her adventurous, innovative style. In 1975, for example, she successfully established the Quelle mail-order and retailing business in Hungary. Quelle was also one of the first west German companies to invest in the former GDR after unification. A DM1bn investment programme, still under way, was established to create 5,000 jobs. Quelle, meaning 'source', as started in the 1920s by Gustav Schickedanz, and bombed out of business during the war. Mrs Schickedanz, who married her boss in 1942, restarted the family business with a single shop in 1946, and took sole control over the developing empire on her husband's death in 1977, when annual sales were DM8bn. After giving up operational management in 1987, she continued active work as head of the supervisory boards of the main companies in the group. These posts will now be taken over by her son-in-law, Mr Wolfgang Buhler.</p>

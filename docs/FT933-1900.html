			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Miners blockade threatened pit HUNDREDS of coal miners blockaded the threatened Bergkamen pit in Germany yesterday after Ruhrkohle, the country's largest coal producer, announced 6,000 more job cuts, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. The company, which produces 80 per cent of west German coal, said it would close down the Bergkamen pit and reduce production by two-thirds at two other pits, from January 1994. The move aims to cut output by 3m tonnes of coal and coking coal. The latest cuts, bringing planned job losses to 18,000 by the end of 1994, were caused by the worsening crisis in the steel industry, the company's second-biggest customer after energy, Ruhrkohle said. IG Bergbau, the miners union, said it would organise protests next month before the company's supervisory board meets to ratify the decision, expected in November. 'We have run out of space to store it and must reduce capacity,' the company said.</p>

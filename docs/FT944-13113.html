			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway to close Statfjord platform Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, says it plans to close one of three platforms in the prolific North Sea Statfjord field by 2003 in a bid to avert early closure of the entire field in 2007. This announcement comes while several other oil companies are in the process of either closing or planning to close platforms. The Statfjord field comprises three fully integrated production/processing platforms but the company says that by de-commissioning the A platform in 2003 the remaining B and C platforms could continue full operations beyond the 2009. They would face closure in 2007 if the A platform remained in operation beyond 2003 and the field's overall economics would, under this scenario, deteriorate substantially. 'Compared with other options, this solution should boost the residual net present value of the field by NKr1.64bn (Pounds 155m)in 1995 money, before tax,' estimates Mr Morten Krogh, head of the team in charge of the de-commissioning. Statfjord's daily average production has reached 650,000 barrels, exceeding the 1993 production plan for 600,000 barrels, but the rate will plunge to about 26,000 barrels a day by 2009. By the end of this year about 2.9bn barrels of the field's 30bn barrels of recoverable reserves will have been extracted and output is expected to fall to 25 per cent of today's level within five years. The Statfjord A platform produces 170,000 b/d but processes 320,000 b/d, 175,000 barrels of which is derived from the adjacent Snorre field, operated by Saga Petroleum. Processing of Snorre crude will have to be undertaken by one of the other two Statfjord platforms when the A unit is closed. According to Norway's field licensing arrangements, platform operators are obliged to remove the massive structures from the field once production ends. But the parliament has postponed discussion of a government White Paper on platform removal guidelines until next spring, so it remains unclear what platform abandonment requirements will be made of the oil companies. Production from the North East Frigg field ceased last year and work is currently under way to close down the Odin field. In addition, the Frigg field will soon end production as Phillips Petroleum completes plans for the closure of several platforms in the Ekofisk field.</p>

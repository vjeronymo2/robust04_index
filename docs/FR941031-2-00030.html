The proposed water intake and pipeline would be located in Brunswick, Greenville, Sussex, Southhampton and Isle of Wight Counties, Virginia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 1, 1994, the Commission issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS and to conduct Scoping Meetings.

At this time, the process of reviewing and analyzing comments received during scoping is complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the process of scoping the EIS, the Office of Hydropower Licensing has produced a Scoping Document Two (SD2).

Further, the SD2 provides a general overview of issues that will be evaluated in the EIS as well as issues that do not warrant further evaluation. The SD2 also includes a schedule for issuing the draft EIS and final EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the SD2 are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further information, please contact Steve Edmondson at (202) 219&hyph;2653. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

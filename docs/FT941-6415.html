			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Gould may be forced to quit early Mr Bryan Gould was yesterday under mounting pressure to stand down early as an MP after the death of Mr Ron Leighton, his Euro-sceptic Labour colleague, raised the prospect of by-elections in three neighbouring east London constituencies. Mr Gould announced last month that he was quitting politics to return to his native New Zealand. He said he would resign his seat in Dagenham with effect from September 1. But the necessity for a further by-election is understood to have increased the desire of some in the Labour leadership to force Mr Gould to step down sooner. Mr Gould appears determined to resist such pressure. The third by-election will be in Barking, a seat held for 20 years by Ms Jo Richardson, who died last month. Mr Leighton, 64, a former chairman of the Commons employment committee, died on Monday night of natural causes. A printer, he was brought into politics by his fierce opposition to the Common Market, acting as national organiser for the No campaign in the 1975 referendum. Four years later he won Newham North East. He consistently backed Mrs Margaret Thatcher in her battles with Britain's European partners to reduce Britain's budget contributions. Mr Smith paid tribute to Mr Leighton yesterday, saying he 'fought his corner passionately and sincerely but always with tolerance and respect for those who disagreed with him'. Mr Denis MacShane, a veteran trade unionist, is to be Labour's candidate for the Rotherham by-election caused by the death of Mr James Boyce. Labour had a 17,561 majority at the last election.</p>

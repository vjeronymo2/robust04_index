If an institution's cohort default rate meets the following levels, a default penalty is imposed on the institution as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 15 percent, the institution must establish a default reduction plan in accordance with &sect;674.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent, but is less than 25 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced by 10 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 percent, but is less than 30 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced by 30 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced to zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cohort default rate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) The term ``cohort default rate'' means, for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment in that award year on the loans received for attendance at that institution who default before the end of the following award year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In determining the number of students who default before the end of the following award year, the Secretary excludes any loans that, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For any award year in which less than 30 current and former students at the institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the institution, the ``cohort default rate'' means the percentage of those current and former students who entered repayment on loans received for attendance at that institution in any of the three most recent award years and who defaulted on those loans before the end of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Defaulted loans to be included in the cohort default rate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under paragraph (b) of this section_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A borrower must be included only if the borrower's default has persisted for at least_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) 240 consecutive days for loans repayable in monthly installments; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) 270 consecutive days for loans repayable in quarterly installments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A loan is considered to be in default if a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with the institution, in order to avoid default by the borrower;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)(i) Any loan that is in default, but on which the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan, or any loan that has been rehabilitated before the end of the following award year is not considered to be in default for purposes of the cohort default rate calculation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one institution, the student and his or her subsequent repayment or default are attributed to the institution for attendance at which the student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Improper servicing or collection means the failure of the institution to comply with subpart C of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Locations of the institution <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution as it exists on the first day of the award year for which the rate is calculated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution from the date the institution is notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the Secretary that the rate no longer applies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a free-standing institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the institution's status as of July 1 of the award year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)(i) For an institution that changes status from a free-standing institution to a location of another institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from both the former free-standing institution and the other institution. This cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated institution and all of its current locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For free-standing institutions that merge, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from both of the institutions that are merging. This cohort default rate applies to the new, consolidated institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a location of another institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the number of students who default during the applicable award years from both of the institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to the respective locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This notice asks each commenter to identify, in order of priority, those regulations that are believed to be unwarranted or inappropriate. In order to focus agency consideration, each commenter is asked to concentrate on no more than three regulations he or she believes to be of primary concern. The agency asks further that each commenter provide a brief explanation of: (1) The bases for the three highest priority recommendations to amend or eliminate the regulations; (2) the ways in which each regulation's objective is otherwise fulfilled ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> by duplicative regulations or by technological advances that render the regulations obsolete); and (3) where appropriate, a suggested substitute or amended version of the regulations identified. This information will help the FAA to respond to the Administration's direction to design regulations in the most effective manner to achieve their regulatory objective. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be submitted on or before March 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed, in triplicate, to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;200), Docket No. 27581, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments delivered must be marked Docket No. 27581.

This effort initiates a response to the recommendations of the 15-member National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry, the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, and DOT and FAA regulatory initiatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In April 1993, the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (Commission) was established by Public Law No. 103&hyph;13. The Commission was asked to investigate, study and make policy recommendations regarding the financial vitality and future competitiveness of the U.S. airline and aerospace industries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August 1993, the Commission issued a report to the President and Congress that addressed, among other things, the legal and administrative policies that govern the regulatory responsibilities imposed on United States airlines. The Commission found that Federal regulations impose a cumulative burden on airlines. While the FAA has not quantified that burden, the Commission estimated that existing rules have added to airline costs and concluded that the costs of these rules have a direct impact on the airlines' financial condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To enhance the FAA's ability to perform its statutory role without undue economic impact on the aviation industry, the Commission recommends that the ``FAA/DOT undertake a short-range regulatory review_in close consultation with industry and other interested parties_to eliminate or amend existing regulations to reduce regulatory burdens consistent with safety and security considerations.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Executive Order 12866 requires that agencies ``identify regulations that are cumulative, obsolete, or inconsistent, and where appropriate, eliminate or modify them.'' In light of these concerns, and consistent with the Administration's Civil Aviation Initiative, this notice solicits public comment that will assist the FAA in focusing attention on areas where the public believes the regulatory burden is excessive and unjustified. In particular, the agency requests that each commenter identify the most significant regulations that the commenter believes may no longer be necessary, are unduly burdensome, or impose excessive costs or red tape. In some cases, for example, important innovations, technologies, or new market opportunities may have taken place or may have been created since a rule was promulgated, potentially rendering a rule obsolete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA requests commenters to focus their recommendations on up to three regulations they believe to be of primary concern_rather than catalogue all rules that they may view to be objectionable in some respect. This will facilitate development of a manageable overall proposal. Further, each commenter should rank  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in priority order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the regulations that the commenter believes the agency should address first. In addition, each submission should include an explanation of: (1) How the identified regulatory requirement is burdensome; (2) how the requirement should be changed or deleted, including, where possible, suggested draft substitutes; (3) how a regulatory change would benefit the public; and (4) how a proposed regulatory change would provide an adequate level of safety, security, or environmental protection. Specific economic information to support a reliable cost/benefit analysis of the proposed change will also be of assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments in response to this notice are also expected to facilitate the FAA's regulatory review envisioned by Executive Order No. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' issued September 30, 1993. This executive order requires each agency to create a program under which it will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any should be modified or eliminated to make the agency's regulatory program more effective and less burdensome. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments provided in response to this notice will assist the agency in establishing its priorities for future regulatory changes, including repeal or modification of rules where appropriate, to maintain safety and security while reducing regulatory burdens. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on January 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David R.

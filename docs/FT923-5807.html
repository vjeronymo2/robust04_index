			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Lopez leads GM car parts crusade  -A man whose warriors made an industry squeal Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua may be the most unpopular man in the US automobile industry. Mr Lopez, a Spaniard who shook up GM's supplier base in Europe in the late-1980s, is trying to do the same in the US, and the American parts industry is squealing. Since taking over four months ago as GM's vice-president of worldwide purchasing - a new position - his efforts to renegotiate contracts with US suppliers and forge relationships with them have been half-jokingly dubbed 'the 100 days of terror.' Supporters say he is making a much-needed shake-up in GM's over-cosy relations with its parts suppliers, both internally from GM-owned parts plants, and externally, from independent manufacturers. Critics complain that he and his purchasing troops - whom Mr Lopez reputedly calls 'warriors' - have been crusading with a ruthlessness which could considerably damage the parts industry. The issue moved forward this week. First, Mr Lopez broke his long silence and delivered a speech which sought to explain his strategy and win support. Second, the United Atuo Workers union yesterday went on strike at a GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which makes parts for 14 GM models, including the company's hot-selling Saturn compact model, which is in short supply. A union official said a key problem was job security at the plant. Unconfirmed reports said the company wanted to eliminate 240 jobs in Lordstown's die-making operations. The strike may not be directly connected with Mr Lopez's cost-reduction drive, but it does represent a warning shot by the UAW, concerned that a GM tilt away from favouring its in-house parts operations for new contracts could mean a significant loss of union jobs. GM certainly needs to slash its manufacturing costs across the board in North America, where it is still losing money heavily on its automobile operations. Concern over the group's slow progress prompted a boardroom revolt last April which saw Mr Jack Smith, who successfully turned round GM's European operations in the 1980s, elevated to the presidency of the group with a mandate to shake up North America. One of Mr Smith's most important appointments was that of Mr Lopez. Mr Lopez has sent parts manufacturers into apoplexy by re-negotiating supply contracts and reportedly demanding huge cuts in prices of 20 per cent or more over several years. And he has made clear that if US suppliers cannot meet GM's price and quality specifications, the company is prepared to go to other global suppliers who can. The critics complain that, while such tactics may have been appropriate in Europe, where there may have been fat on the parts industry, the US suppliers have already been through years of cost-cutting initiatives and GM's action may now simply drive the weakest companies to the wall. The key to his drive is a management process with the brain-numbing title of Purchased Input Concept Optimisation with Suppliers, or PICOS for short. This involves selecting suppliers on how they meet three criteria - quality, service and price - and working with them to improve all of these. In his speech, Mr Lopez argued the world was in the throes of a third industrial revolution which forced companies to change rapidly the assumptions behind the way they did business. He then applied this idea to manufacturers' prices. Under conventional business practices, companies would determine their costs, add a reasonable profit, and thus fix a price. But he said this method was obsolete. Manufacturers must reverse the process  -first determine what price was acceptable to the customer, then fix their profit margin and finally work out how they would achieve manufacturing costs to reach these goals. Mr Lopez said that in Europe GM had held PICOS workshops at 158 supplier locations and on average had improved productivity 51 per cent, cut materials in process by 51 per cent, reduced the factory lay-out by 26 per cent and lead times by 51 per cent. So far in North America its 45 workshops - both inside and outside GM - had improved productivity 63 per cent, cut the materials figure by 56 per cent, reduced layout 36 per cent and boosted lead times 61 per cent. 'And it's clear there is still a lot of room for improvement,' he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of DPRK Forestry Ministry Spokesman" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  authorities dared to mock at the human rights of the workers of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea now engaged in a  regular felling in the far eastern region of Russia, volubly  talking about "dispatch of a fact-finding team" and "defection  operation", said a spokesman for the Ministry of Forestry of the  DPRK in a statement today.    He condemned this as another premeditated act of treachery  to  expand overseas the present-day North-South confrontation which  they have carried into extremes and thereby create a more  serious national antagonism and impair the ever growing prestige  of the DPRK and the might of its singlehearted unity.    At "the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of the  National Assembly" on March 30 the South Korean authorities  reportedly brought up the "human rights" of the DPRK's lumbermen  and impudently blared that "a fact-finding team" would be sent  to Russia. They went so far as to say that they would induce  the DPRK's lumbermen to "defect" to South Korea, getting them  recognized as "refugees" through the offices of the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.    The statement says:    It is clear to anyone that such "human rights problem" as  the  South Korean authorities described has never existed and can  never exist for our lumbermen.    Under our anthropocentric socialist system the human rights  of the people from all walks of life are fully ensured legally  and institutionally. Our lumbermen too are guaranteed a free  and happy life like in the homeland, though they are working in  an alien land. Each of them enjoys a true political life and  adequate material and cultural life. They live a stable life,  engaged in normal production activities pursuant to our labour  law and the law of the Russian Federation.    This notwithstanding, the South Korean ruling quarters are  insolent enough to mock at and provoke the dignity and human  rights of our workers. This impudent behavior is a shameless  interference in the internal affairs of our republic and a  criminal act that cannot be permitted under the international  law.    Unjustifiable and unpardonable is the insidious attempt of  the South Korean authorities to create a new national discord  and aggravate the North-South confrontation by inventing the  "human rights problem" of our lumbermen at a time when the  national concord must be promoted by transcending the difference  in idea, ideology and system and an independent and peaceful  reunification of the country be accelerated through the great  unity of the whole nation.    If the South Korean authorities send "a fact-finding team"  to  do harm to our workers who are engaged in creative production  activities in an alien land for the socialist motherland, or  launch into an unjustifiable "defection work" among them, we  will decisively counter it.    And we will never tolerate any country or international  organization joining the South Korean authorities in their  criminal intrigues.    Should any other country or international organization join  the South Korean authorities in their reckless act, it would  extremely complicate things and entail irretrievable, grave  consequences would. [sentence as received]    In case some of our lumbermen now in the far eastern region  should disappear in the days ahead, we will consider that the  responsibility entirely rests with the South Korean authorities  and that they kidnapped our workers, motivated by their sinister  political purpose, and will immediately take a decisive  countermeasure.</p>

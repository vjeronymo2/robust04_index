			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 12  April.    Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy minister, has  reported the government has managed to sell 90 percent of  treasury bonds worth $452 million it issued in 1993. The  revenue was used to pay part of the national debt. The  Comptroller General's Office has listed the debt, as of 31  December 1993, at $7.2 billion, of which 27 percent is domestic,  53 percent is foreign, and 21 percent is interest and expenses.  (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 6 April 94, p 8E)    The Panamanian Exporters Association, Apex, and the  Association of Panamanian Industrialists, Sip, have reported  that 1993 exports of manufactured goods totaled $58.3 million, a  figure considerably lower than the $102.8 million of 1992.  Although certain exports, such as chemicals, increased as much  as 69 percent, prices dropped by 9 percent. Competition,  particularly in the Central American market, forced prices down,  while production costs tended to grow. (Panama City EL PANAMA  AMERICA in Spanish 6 April 94, p 8E)    The consumer price index dropped .1 percent during the first  two months of 1994. The drop was mainly due to a .3-percent  drop in food and beverages and a 5.4-percent drop in fruits and  vegetables. February showed an increase of 1.1 percent as a  result of a 5.5-percent increase in transportation and  communication costs. Compared to the same period in 1993, there  was an increase of 1.2 percent. (Panama City LA PRENSA in  Spanish 8 April 94, p 11A)    Apex President Juan Alberto Pascual has called on the  government to "implement a more aggressive export policy," as  industry is still faltering in the face of growing competition  and higher production costs. "As long as these factors exist,  the country will never be competitive on the international  market," he has said. Meanwhile, Economist Rogelio Alvarado,  from the Sip, has said exports have been steadily slipping for  some time now, "mostly due to restrictions imposed by the  European Union in July 1993."

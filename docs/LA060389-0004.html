			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> The 16th annual Los Angeles Mayor's Prayer Breakfast will be held next  Saturday, renewing an event that tends to feature charismatic Protestants and,  lately, a little political suspense.  </P> <P> The breakfast drew its highest attendance last year -- 2,000 -- when the  featured speaker was House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), who resigned that  position Wednesday after defending his handling of personal finances against  ethical violations charges by the House Ethics Committee. That panel voted to  begin its investigation shortly before last year's prayer breakfast.  </P> <P> The featured speaker this year is U.S. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole, who  is under no such cloud. But questions about financial conflicts of interest  have been raised recently in Los Angeles about Mayor Tom Bradley, who will be  present and speak briefly at the 8 a.m. event at Westin Bonaventure Hotel.  </P> <P> Chairman Keith Phillips said he does not know whether advance ticket sales,  which reached 1,000 this week, reflect any sympathy for the mayor. "I think the  sense of the Christian community is that if the mayor ever needed prayers, he  needs them now," said Phillips, adding that he was making no judgment on the  validity of various charges.  </P> <P> "The breakfast is not tied specifically to Bradley; we pray for the well-being  of the city -- for concerns about drug and gang activity," said Phillips, who  heads World Impact, an inner-city ministry that is handling ticket reservations  ((213) 735-1137).  </P> <P> Among the charismatic Christians taking part in the program are master of  ceremonies Pat Boone, who will sing; Trinity Broadcasting Network owners Paul  and Jan Crouch; Bishop Charles E. Blake of the Church of God in Christ; Pastor  Lloyd John Ogilvie of Hollywood Presbyterian Church and Pastor Jack Hayford of  the Church on the Way in Van Nuys. Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians  believe in speaking in tongues and other "gifts of the Holy Spirit."  </P> <P> Last year singer Andrae Crouch, ex-football star Roosevelt Grier, actor Dean  Jones and the Crouches took part in the program.  </P> <P> Phillips said the breakfast's sponsoring committee is only 50% charismatic  Christian and the predominant participation of charismatics this year and last  was unintentional. "I am not a charismatic myself," he said. He suggested that  the selections came about because charismatic clergy and lay people are among  those who are best known in public life for their Christian identity.  </P> <P> CONFERENCE  </P> <P> A conference on Jewish spirituality, including mystical traditions in Judaism,  is being held for the third year by the Westwood Kehilla, which describes  itself as an eclectic Orthodox community embracing members at varied levels of  religious observance. Rabbi Abner Weiss, the spiritual leader of Beth Jacob  Congregation, will give a plenary talk on the "spiritual dimension" of sex,  love and marriage at the June 11 conference. Workshops include "Hassidic  Wisdom," "Kabbalah of Love and Meditation," "Music as a Vehicle to God" and one  by Rabbi Joel Zeff, the congregation's spiritual leader, on "Prayer: Making the  Rote Meaningful." The conference, which will start at 8:30 a.m., will be held  at Hillel Hebrew Academy in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Mary Elizabeth Moore, a professor at the School of Theology at Claremont, has  been elected to chair the board and serve as president of the Religious  Education Assn. She is the first woman to head the board in the 86-year history  of the organization. Moore said the association is an interfaith body that  brings together theorists and practitioners, and the only such organization  "working internationally in religious education." The spring issue of its  quarterly journal, Religious Education, featured articles on religious  education trends in Islam and eastern religions.  </P> <P> Gordon Stein has resigned as president of Atheists United, a small but active  Los Angeles-area group with an office in Sherman Oaks, to accept a position as  associate professor of biology at the University of Rhode Island. Stein, who  was succeeded by Herb Livingston, edited the two-volume "Encyclopedia of  Unbelief" and edited two anthologies of atheist and rationalist writings during  this decade for Prometheus Press.

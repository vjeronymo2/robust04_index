			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 4 (AFP) -- Five coal miners who  helped coordinate a strike last week in the Kolubara basin near  here were detained Tuesday, as court authorities launched a  probe into allegations of sabotage linked with the stoppage,  reports said. The arrests were announced by Zdravko Vucetic,  the miners' union leader in the region 80 kilometres (50 miles)  south of the capital, who told journalists that plans to resume  strike action Tuesday had been shelved.    "We have suspended the strike until January 15, but... none  of our demands have been met," he said. Vucetic named the five  detainees as Milan Rankovic and Jelenko Micic -- both members of  the Serbian Electricians' Union -- and strike committee members  Ivan Zdravkovic, Dragan Vesic and Milisav Mihajlovic.    Meanwhile the Belgrade prosecutor opened an inquiry into  alleged sabotage in connection with the strike, and called on  police to "identify the employees at the Kolubara coal mine  whose work stoppage caused enormous difficulties in electricity  distribution," the TANJUG agency reported. Under Serbian law,  anyone found guilty under the inquiry could be liable for a  minimum sentence of three years in prison.    Vucetic said he was "indignant" at the sabotage accusations,  which he rejected. The miners suspended their action on Friday  for the New Year break as the stoppage triggered sharp power  cuts throughout Serbia. The strikers had demanded a monthly  salary of 35.9 [German] marks (around 20 dollars) and goods to  the value of 50 marks by December 31, plus 10 kilogrammes (22  pounds) of meat at "affordable" prices by the end of January.    In a separate development here Tuesday the medical staff at  a  suburban hospital resumed a strike they suspended for the New  Year's holiday, Belgrade radio said. The director at the  hospital in Zemun said doctors and nurses were handling only  minimal emergency services. They launched their action over a  salary dispute Thursday, amid a spate of strikes that paralysed  several sectors, including mines, railroads, and public  transport and health services during the last two days of  December. Two leaders of the railroad strike were detained by  police over the weekend. Although authorities have granted  several recent demands for higher wages, any increases have been  quickly cancelled out by the effects of the hyper-inflation  hitting Serbia.</p>

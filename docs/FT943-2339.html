			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Tawdry Trocadero rescued yet again: The troubles of a 'very 1970s' shopping complex in central London Located just off London's Piccadilly Circus, one of the world's busiest tourist thoroughfares, the Trocadero leisure and shopping centre attracts 16m visitors a year. About half of them, however, spend no money there. The vast majority of visitors stay for less than 30 minutes. On a rainy afternoon it is not hard to see why. The Trocadero, off Piccadilly Circus, is a tawdry and gloomy place. In its shabby food hall yesterday the toilets were closed and staff at a sushi bar were arguing with a customer about whether he had paid for his food. Today the Trocadero acquires its fourth owner in 10 years. Burford, the property group, has acquired the centre from receivers KPMG Peat Marwick for Pounds 94m. Mr Nick Leslau, Burford's chief executive, plans to turn the Trocadero into an 'urban theme park'. It will, he says, become Europe's leading high-technology leisure centre. Burford is negotiating with companies interested in renting the 120,000 sq ft of vacant space at the Trocadero - about a quarter of total space. Companies involved in the negotiations are believed to include Sega Enterprises, the Japanese maker of electronic games, which could build an electronic theme park in the centre. Mr Leslau agrees that in its current state the Trocadero is 'tired'. He adds: 'It feels very 1970s. It lacks direction.' He insists, however, that the Trocadero should be successful. It stands on one of the world's busiest streets, between Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square. About 75 per cent of the 20m foreign tourists who come to the UK each year visit the area. Half the Trocadero's visitors are tourists. By the time Burford has finished its Pounds 10m to Pounds 12m refurbishment of the centre it will feel like something out of the 21st century, he says. 'It's going to have this buzz of people walking along aerial walkways and elevators.' Burford is respected in the City as a conservatively-managed property group. With the Trocadero, however, it is attempting to succeed where others have failed. In the 1920s two restaurants opened on the site, the Trocadero and a Lyons Corner House. Lyons, which operated both, sold the buildings in the 1950s, after which the area steadily deteriorated. In 1984 the Trocadero reopened as a shopping and entertainment centre, under the ownership of Electricity Supply Nominees, the pension fund of the electricity supply industry. The project was plagued by cost overruns. In 1987 Brent Walker, the leisure group, teamed up with Power Corporation, the Irish property group, to buy the Trocadero. Both companies suffered financial damage as a result of the purchase. At the beginning of last year the centre went into receivership. The receivers have won several new tenants including the Planet Hollywood restaurant. Staff at the existing attractions, such as the Guinness World of Records exhibition and Emaginator, a simulated train ride, appear cheerful and well-trained. Mr Leslau accepts that service throughout the centre will have to improve. He says Burford has the advantage of having paid a realistic price. At the height of the property boom the Trocadero was valued at Pounds 250m.</p>

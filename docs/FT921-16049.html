			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Personal View: How to make the Budget a real budget As Samuel Brittan observed last month, Treasury forecasters have achieved a hat trick. 'They failed to foresee the inflationary boom of the late 1980s; they failed to foresee the subsequent recession, and then they forecast a fictitious recovery' (FT, December 19). This tragi-comedy of errors is not just a problem of poor forecasting. It is also a consequence of the arcane and illogical way British economic policy is made. A key problem is the arbitrary separation of the public expenditure decisions announced in the Autumn Statement each November from the tax measures revealed in the Budget in March. In almost every comparable industrialised country, the sums to be spent by government and raised in revenue are decided at the same time. In Britain, however, the Budget is not really a budget at all. It is merely a statement of tax changes hopefully related to expenditure decisions announced months beforehand. In my view this arrangement fails to encourage either the development of coherent policies or honest debate about the economic priorities facing the nation. It hinders medium-term assessment of public expenditure priorities and their revenue implications, and it makes it significantly harder to determine the overall macro-economic impact of different fiscal and budgetary policies. Making matters worse is the relative invisibility of the Autumn Statement in comparison with the Budget and the famous theatrical attractions that the latter offers to chancellors of the exchequer on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street. As a result, the electorate's awareness of vitally important public expenditure decisions remains low while interest in possible tax changes is kept artificially high. A further difficulty is that reforms designed to improve parliamentary scrutiny of public expenditure have so far achieved the opposite. Departmental reports introduced in the last two years to replace the former Public Spending White Paper have made it even harder to assess overall public spending trends and priorities. And the traditional debate on public expenditure that used to follow publication of the White Paper is soon to be subsumed within the general economic debate that occurs after the Autumn Statement. The time has come, I believe, for a complete review of the way in which major aspects of economic policy in this country are formulated and presented to parliament. Proposals for reform of the UK's budgetary process were made 12 years ago in the report Budgetary Reform in the UK, published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. This report, prepared by a committee chaired by Lord Armstrong of Sanderstead, recommended that revenue and expenditure decisions should be taken together and that the government should also publish a provisional Budget some months before the final version is presented to parliament in March. Of course, publication of a draft or provisional budget does raise some difficult issues: notably the risk that proposals for tax changes given in advance could be disruptive and encourage avoidance. Some degree of budget secrecy, therefore, is probably inevitable. This constraint, however, need not prevent government from taking steps to encourage, in advance of the Budget, a more informed public and parliamentary discussion of general economic policy options including issues of tax and expenditure policy. Why not, for example, consider longer-term questions of tax reform, such as the distribution of the tax burden among income groups (a subject not especially popular with current Treasury ministers), or examine the likely macro-economic effects of different tax changes. Public debate of this kind might have prevented the most serious fiscal policy errors of recent years, notably the pro-cyclical inflationary tax cuts of 1988 and the similarly ill-timed VAT increase in last year's Budget. The decision to link expenditure and revenues in the Budget would enable a new role for the Autumn Statement. It could become a key statement of overall economic policy, providing not simply a forecast, but a detailed assessment of the options facing the economy. This new-style statement would initiate a national dialogue on economic policy that could inform and improve the decisions that governments eventually take in the Budget. A further reform, not strictly related to the Budget process but long overdue nevertheless, is to ensure the independence of the Government Statistical Service. The combination of expenditure cuts in the early 1980s and the Conservative government's marked tendency to manipulate official data have seriously damaged the integrity of British statistics. The numerous changes to the method of compiling the numbers of unemployed and government ministers' inconsistent use of the retail price index and measures of the underlying rate of inflation (depending on which happens to be lowest at the time) are probably the most glaring examples of their statistical sleight of hand. An independent statistical service would restore public confidence in the statistics that ultimately guide government decision taking and complement a reformed process of budget making. Together these changes would, I believe, not merely improve the quality of our democracy; they would also improve the effectiveness of economic policy and contribute to better performance by the British economy.

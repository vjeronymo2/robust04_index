Spero, a top State Department official in charge of economic  affairs, is likely to arrive in Japan before or around March 9,  when U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher is also due in  Japan, the official said.    She is likely to hold talks with Deputy Foreign Minister  Koichiro Matsuura, a top negotiator in the bilateral trade  "framework" talks, he said.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton  met on February 11 in Washington but failed to reach accord on  the framework talks.    Christopher is scheduled to visit Japan between March 9 and  11 on his three-nation Asia-Pacific trip.    It is not yet clear whether Spero will accompany Christopher  to Japan or will make the trip separately, the official said.</p>

Speaking at the Design Renaissance Conference in Glasgow this week, Stefano Marzano, the company's director of corporate design, called for a 'new ethic' within the industrial design profession. 'As we approach the millennium, we are being confronted with the effects of a gross imbalance in material circumstances around the world. We must try to restore the balance in our natural environment and in our social and cultural environment.' Conferences on design often include such statements.

If pursued to its logical conclusion, his sentiment would represent a U-turn for Philips which followed a globalist design policy until Marzano's appointment in 1991. Philips makes identical 'global' products in its manufacturing sites worldwide. It now proposes to reflect the cultural preferences of segmented markets in its products. The shift sends an important signal to other manufacturers. Moves are in hand at Philips to factor new thinking about sustainable growth and product life-cycle assessment into the development process. But Marzano extended the scope to social and cultural issues. Adopting such a policy would amount to a new ethical standard. 'We must not fall into the trap of designing products with features people don't need.

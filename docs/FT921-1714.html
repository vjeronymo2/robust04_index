			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (4): Serious competitor - New savings bank established THE finishing touches are being put to a new bank which is set to become the largest in the Nordic region when it opens its doors for business at the beginning of next year. To be called provisionally Sparbanken Sverige AB, but known as Swedbank abroad, it will unify the country's larger and medium-sized savings banks in one organisation. The conglomerate will have assets totalling SKr540bn, at least 3m customers and will employ 14,000 staff in 785 offices. The new enterprise will account for as much as 90 per cent of Sweden's savings bank business. It will become a joint stock company and Mr Goran Collert, who will be head of the bank and is now president and chief executive at Swedbank, hopes that it will be listed on the Stockholm bourse, perhaps by the end of next year at the earliest. 'We are going to be a strong player as a full service bank in Sweden', says Mr Robert Stenram, head of the London branch of Swedbank and executive vice-president. He points out that Swedbank already accounts for 34 per cent of the mutual funds business in Sweden, 30 per cent of long-term mortgage financing, 20 per cent of foreign exchange trading and half the Swedish market in domestic credit cards. The emerging giant should at least bring some semblance of order to the confused and fragmented Swedish savings bank scene by bringing together all 10 regional savings banks who account for three quarters of Sweden's savings bank activities, Sparbankerna's bank and the ailing Forsta Sparbank. However, about 90 other small local savings banks will continue to operate outside the new body although they will have working agreements with it. The catalyst for change in Sweden's savings banks has mainly come from the huge rise in credit losses due to bad real estate and stock loans suffered by a growing number of the banks. This was highlighted most dramatically last October when Sweden's new centre-right coalition government was forced to bail out the Stockholm-based Forsta Sparbanken by giving it an unconditional guarantee for a SKr3.8bn loan from Sparbanken's gruppen AB, the federation of regional savings banks. Forsta Sparbank had revealed it made a pre-tax loss of SKr3.1bn for its first eight months of the year and the bank estimated its full-year loss would be about SKr4bn. Its loan losses had climbed to an astronomical SKr4.5bn, 10 per cent of its outstanding loans, while the bank said it had doubled its loan portfolio between 1987 and 1990 to nearly SKr45bn outstanding. Last autumn's disaster at Forsta Sparbanken has helped to create an understandable sense of crisis and forced Sweden's savings banks to recognise that if they want to survive and prosper they need to accept closer integration to deal with the problems of financial viability, shortage of capital and a possible lack of confidence in them by their customers. In fact, Sparbankerna's bank boosted profits by 21 per cent last year to SKr1.03bn despite credit losses of SKr1.11bn. The coming merger is certainly an obvious way of ensuring a better utilisation of resources for all the savings banks involved. It has been estimated there could be savings of up to SKr2bn a year as a result of rationalising the savings bank sector. Economies of scale - it is being argued - could also help to improve the range and quality of services on offer and strengthen the bank's international activities. One point, however, that the new bank's customers will be glad to hear is that it promises to be prudent and concentrate on basic services. The days of pan-Nordic dreams are over even for an organisation that looks like becoming a serious competitor for Sweden's existing commercial banks.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / People: Norcros shuffles its titles Norcros, the building products and packaging group, is switching Michael Doherty to the post of executive chairman and doing away with the title chief executive. Doherty joined Norcros as chief executive five years ago - after it had escaped the clutches of Williams Holdings - from Cope Allman. He also took on the role of deputy chairman in 1989 when Julian Sheffield, son of the founder, became chairman. Sheffield is stepping aside as chairman but stays as a non-executive director. Robert Alcock, who joined as finance director from Nabisco UK in October 1989, is being promoted to the new post of group managing director. Norcros is seeking a replacement as finance director. According to Doherty: 'Robert will look at the business from month to month and I will look at it year-to-year.' Although the changes are not a direct response to the Cadbury report, Doherty says, some of the requirements mean that 'the role of chairman is much more demanding'. As a 'virtually full-time' chairman of Norcros, he had few other business interests. The main one was the chairmanship of Henlys, the motor group. This proved rather onerous last year as it was fighting off a hostile bid from T Cowie. Norcros is making the post of deputy chairman non-executive and Anthony Elliott, a merchant banker who has been on the board for six years, will fill that role. He is also a director of SG Warburg and Bridon, the wire rope maker.</p>

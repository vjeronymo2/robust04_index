			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- "Answers to questions  raised by the general director of the Latin America News Agency  "'PRENSA LATINA'", a work of the great leader President Kim  Il-song, was carried by the Yugoslav paper BORBA.    Quoting the work, the paper said:    In the work President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea said since the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula has emanated from the United States' hostile policy  towards the DPRK, it must be resolved through dialogues between  the DPRK and the United States.    Noting that pressure can never be a solution to the problem,  he said it is a miscalculation to think that they can bring the  Korean people to their knees by means of pressure and force, the  people who regard independence as their lifeblood. If the  United States continues to clamour for putting pressure on the  DPRK, the DPRK will be compelled to take due measures of  self-defence to safeguard the dignity of the Korean nation and  the sovereignty of the country, he stressed.    This work was also reported by the Yugoslav Tanjug News  Agency and Belgrade radio and television, the Mozambican paper  NOTICIAS, the Tanzanian paper DAILY NEWS, the Malaysian paper  SIN CHEW JIT POH, the Thai paper SIN CHONG YUAN PAO, the  Tunisian papers LA PRESSE and LE RENOUVEAU, the Pakistani papers  MUSLIM, PAKISTAN OBSERVER, HABARE and MARGAJ, the Kazakh paper  EXPRESS, the Indonesian Antara News Agency, a Malian radio and  Madagascan radio and television.    His work "Answers to Questions Raised by a Delegation of  Journalists of WASHINGTON TIMES from the United States" was  carried by the Russian paper MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, the Yemeni  paper AL THAORAH and the U.S. paper INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE.</p>

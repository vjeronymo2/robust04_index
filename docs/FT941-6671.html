			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Dozen MPs rapped for flouting financial disclosure rules Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, are among 12 MPs who were yesterday criticised by a Commons all-party report for failing to comply with new rules governing disclosure of financial dealings. The MPs, all members of Lloyd's insurance market, have been urged by the Commons committee of members' interests - which published the new register of members' interests - to 'comply without further delay'. Another 11 MPs, including Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, failed to re-register their interests in time for the latest edition. The committee 'regretted' that so many failed to meet the deadline. Referring to MPs who had not complied with the new requirements, the committee said: 'Some have refused outright, making clear that they regard the new rule as an unwarranted invasion of privacy which will be abused by the media. 'Several other members, while complying with the new rule, have made clear that they are doing so under protest.' Ms Angela Eagle, Labour MP for Wallasey and a member of the committee, said the Lloyd's Names who failed to supply their syndicate numbers were challenging the House. 'It is extremely dubious to allow individual members to flout resolutions of the House. That can't be allowed to continue,' she said. She has called for a meeting between the chairman of the select committee and the Speaker at the 'earliest possible opportunity' to decide what action could be taken to put pressure on members failing to declare their syndicate numbers. In the Commons Mr Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South and another committee member, accused the 12 of a 'concerted and co-ordinated attempt to refuse to provide information'. Mr Hunt said he would reveal his Lloyd's syndicate numbers when he had finalised his underwriting arrangements for the coming year. The register is the first public document to reveal which syndicates include MPs. It does not, however, provide details of how much capacity the MPs provide to each of their syndicates, nor of their stop-loss insurance - a personal reinsurance policy which limits possible loss.</p>

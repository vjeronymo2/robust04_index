			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LLOYD DEFEATS TIM GULLIKSON, FACES BROTHER TOM IN FINAL  </P> <P> When Tim Gullikson broke John Lloyd's serve to take a 3-2 lead in the first set  of the semifinals in the Prudential Bache Grand Championships, it looked to be  a key game in the match.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Gullikson, it was.  </P> <P> Gullikson held his serve to go up 4-2, but it was Lloyd who rallied around  Gullikson's break to tie the set at 4-4. Lloyd eventually won the first set in  a 10-8 tiebreaker and went on to a 7-6, 6-4 victory at the Newport Beach Tennis  Club.  </P> <P> The victory means Lloyd will face Tom Gullikson, Tim's brother, in the singles  final at 1 p.m. today. Lloyd and doubles partner Hank Pfister, who defeated  Peter Fleming and Marty Riessen, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3, will play for the doubles  championship against Tim and Tom Gullikson, who defeated Ross Case and Jaime  Fillol 6-2, 6-2, in the semifinals.  </P> <P> But it was Lloyd's doubles victory that almost cost him his singles match.  </P> <P> "My mind was wandering a little and I wasn't fully in the match until I was  down 4-2," Lloyd said. "I started making excuses for myself saying, 'I just  finished a two-hour match,' or 'My leg is sore and my elbow is sore,' but then  I tried focusing and told myself to run down every ball.  </P> <P> "Before the (service) break I was sort of hoping he'd make a mistake instead of  trying to make things happen," Lloyd said. "I play better when I make things  happen."  </P> <P> Lloyd started to make things happen by landing more of his first serves -- he  struggled at 50% for the first set -- and using "my bread and butter," his  backhand, more effectively.  </P> <P> Lloyd rallied to tie the set and won the tiebreaker after trailing 5-6.  </P> <P> Lloyd led, 5-3, in the second set. Gullikson held serve, but Lloyd won the  final game with an overhand smash.  </P></p>

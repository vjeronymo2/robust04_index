			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Loophole closed on EC share issues The issue of shares within the EU is exempt from VAT, which means that traders making an issue cannot reclaim the VAT on any associated costs. VAT avoidance schemes have been set up to avoid this by selling a few shares outside the EU, because VAT on the costs of selling shares to purchasers outside the EU is recoverable. From accounting periods starting on or after December 1 1994, businesses will have to identify more precisely the VAT they incur on shares issued outside the EU.</p>

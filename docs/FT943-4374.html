			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / CBI may shift on EU social policy Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, is to meet Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, later this month in a move which could lead to a significant shift in the CBI's attitude to the European Union's agenda on social affairs. Many larger members of the Confederation of British Industry with interests in mainland Europe believe the organisation cannot afford to sit on the sidelines as others decide on EU social policy that affects them. The two men intend to search for common ground that would enable the CBI to participate fully in the 'social dialogue' approach in Brussels on employment issues. The social dialogue approach is being developed with the encouragement of the European Commission by Unice, the European employers' federation, and the ETUC union federation. The social dialogue approach involves negotiation between employers and unions at EU level of framework agreements as an alternative to the imposition of legally enforceable directives. The CBI was involved earlier this year in an attempt to negotiate a framework agreement on European works councils, but pulled out of the Unice negotiating team as a result of pressure from its smaller and medium-sized members. A growing number of the CBI's large affiliates want the organisation to take part in European decision-making in spite of the government's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Jacques Santer, the new EU president, is to speak at the CBI's annual conference this autumn. Some CBI officials say they are not opposed in principle to involvement in the social dialogue at European level. They do not believe this would conflict either with British employment law or the industrial relations system. But the CBI would like to see a much longer timetable than at present for considering issues under the social dialogue, which now involves a process of two periods of six weeks within three months to reach agreement. Union leaders are willing to try to reach agreement with the CBI on European social issues. Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU engineering union president, who is due to speak at the CBI's conference this autumn, has invited the CBI to discuss with the TUC a framework agreement on life-long training.</p>

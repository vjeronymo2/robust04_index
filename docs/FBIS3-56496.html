			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Simferopol, 17 Jan -- [passage omitted] The  Central Electoral Commission has confirmed the results of the  vote and appointed 30 January 1994 for the additional round of  Crimean presidential elections, with two candidates, Yuriy  Meshkov and Mykola Bahrov, included in the ballot paper.    In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Yuriy  Meshkov, in the lead in the presidential race, said he would  have won the first round of elections had it not been for a  split in the Russian movement blamed on Serhiy Shuvaynykov, who  had refused to withdraw his candidacy.    As for the probability of his victory in the second round of  elections, the RPK-RDK [Republican Party of the Crimea-Party of  the Republican Movement of the Crimea] leader did not deny  rumors of a possible transfer in his favor of votes in support  of Serhiy Shuvaynykov. In the elections Shuvaynykov had the  backing of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia],  Zhirinovskiy, and those in favor of the communist Leonid Hrach.  Meshkov did not rule that it was possible those in power would  obstruct the holding of the second round of the elections.    Also in an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent on  the eve of the elections, Yuriy Meshkov stated he was convinced  that in the event of his election he would be able to avert a  conflict with the Ukrainian leadership. At a meeting with  representatives of political parties in December, in his words,  Leonid Kravchuk did not oppose holding the elections of the  Crimean president (UNIAN has it that Leonid Kravchuk only said  it was unreasonable to counteract it). In Yuriy Meshkov's view,  there is a legitimate basis for relations between Ukraine and  the Crimea, as well as those between Russia and the Crimea, to  be settled legally. He evaded a straight answer to the question  on whether his victory would ensure the participation of Crimean  districts in the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Council in  March, which are to be with elections to the Crimean Supreme  Council. The RDK leader stated that all-Ukrainian elections  could only be held on condition they would not contravene the  interests of the Crimea and that he would not take a decision on  that issue on his own. He did not, however, specify what these  interests exactly were as seen by him.    Yuriy Meshkov is 45 years old. He is Russian. He chairs the  Republican Party of the Crimea-Party of the Republican Movement  of the Crimea and is a people's deputy of the Crimea. He  graduated from the law department at the Moscow State  University, is married and has two children. The planks of his  pre-election campaign were the full state independence of Crimea  and a referendum on this issue; the accession of the Crimea to  Russia; his negative attitude toward quotas for participation in  the Crimea's elected bodies being granted to deported peoples;  and on land being unavailable for private property. [passage  omitted]    Crimean Tartar Majlis Chairman Mustafa Dzemilev on his part  stated in an interview with a UNIAN correspondent that if Yuriy  Meshkov was to be elected to the post of the Crimean president,  then "given his overt program of having the Crimea quit Ukraine,  we shall regard him solely as a president of his voters but in  no way as that of the Crimean Tartar people".</p>

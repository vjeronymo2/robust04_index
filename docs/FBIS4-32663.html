			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by S. Markovski: "Sentences From Five to Eight </F> Years"]    [Text] More than seven and a half months since the  beginning of the court trial in the so-called "Albanian  paramilitary army," in the big hall of Skopje District Court, a  council of three presided over by Ljubomir Jovevski, a judge in  Skopje Communal Court II, stated its verdict yesterday. The 10  defendants were given prison sentences of a total of 65 years.  Judging by the first reactions, all the defendants except the  seventh, Burim Murtezani, received their verdicts calmly,  without any emotion. However, their lawyers expressed  dissatisfaction with the harsh punishment and they said they  would appeal against the first decision. The families of the  defendants expressed even greater dissatisfaction because they  obviously had expected them to be released. Only the deputy of  the district attorney Stevan Pavlovski showed neither  satisfaction or dissatisfaction. He said he would express his  satisfaction or discontent depending on the written explanation,  that is, after the lawyers and defendants have lodged their  appeal.    After the verdict was read, and was also amplified by an  explanation, taking into account the defendants' statements in  the investigation and the main court proceedings, evaluating the  verbal evidence (statements of witnesses, mainly of the defense)  and comparing this to the material evidence, we can conclude  that the court council fully accepted the accusation. In other  words, it was concluded to be true that in October and November  of 1991, by mutual consent, Mithat Emini, Hasan Agusi, Resmi  Ejupi, Selam Elmazi, and Redjep Sinazi created a hostile  association under the name of "National Defense Headquarters,"  and that until November 1993 they engaged in a number of hostile  activities with the aim of a violent change of the  Constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. The Court concluded as true  the undoubted association, the provision of currency and arms  from abroad, the assembling of a computer center, the formation  of a Headquarters led by Mithat Emini together with others who  were responsible for various military, strategic, and political  functions, the formation of paramilitary units for the whole of  western Macedonia, as well as for Skopje and Kumanovo, the  preparation of an analysis on the political and security  situation in the state, as well as on the activity and power of  the enemy (The Macedonian Army, the Interior Ministry, and all  the non-Muslim population), the formation of a messenger  service, all as a function of the so-called "Ilirida" republic,  as well as the issuing of a slogan according to which Albanians  could speak to Slavs only via arms.    Having evaluated the whole event, the Court found all 10  defendants guilty and passed the following sentences: Mithat  Emini (49) from Tetovo was given eight years imprisonment. The  same sentence was given to Hasan Agusi (34) from Gorni Lipljan,  Kosovo, present Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Resmi Ejupi  (46) from Gostivar, also citizen of the United States, Selam  Elmazi (46) from Gostivar, and Redjepi Sinazi (40) from Tetovo  were sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Husein Haskaj (43)  from Djakovica, former Macedonian deputy defense minister,  living in Skopje, Akif Demiri (53) from Cegrane, Gostivar  district, and Abdiselam Arslani (48) from Poroj, Tetovo  district, were sentenced to six years. Burim Murtezani (30)  from Tetovo and Eugen Cami (53) from Debar were sentenced to  five years in prison. The time they spent in prison during the  investigation will also be taken into account.    The court also issued protective measures. Thus, Hasan Agusi  will be expelled from Macedonia for good after he has served his  sentence. All objects were confiscated by the state (guns,  computers, vehicles, and so on).    Savo Kocarov, the defense lawyer of Mithat Emini announced  that he would appeal and asked why a court proceeding was  necessary when the Court reached its verdict on the grounds of  an investigation that was mainly denied by the defendants at the  main trial. The defense lawyer of Husein Haskaj, Burim  Murtezani, and Eugen Cami also announced their intention to  appeal, saying that the Court had not accepted any arguments  presented by the defendants and the defense.    Contrary to this, the explanation of the verdict specified  that all extenuating circumstances had been taken into account  (the defendants had no previous convictions, they had no  significant possessions, and some of them are in bad health).</p>

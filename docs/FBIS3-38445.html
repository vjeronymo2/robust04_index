			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The French Foreign Ministry  insisted Wednesday [2 February] that the airport in the northern  Bosnian town of Tuzla be reopened immediately to relief flights  and condemned the shelling of the airport by Serb troops.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque warned that  Tuesday's shelling of the airport was a direct affront to the  international community and recalled the recent decision by the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to consider air  strikes to ensure the reopening of the airport.    The airport has been shut down since May 1992.    Meanwhile, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana stopped  briefly in Split Wednesday on his way to the southern Bosnian  town of Medjugorje where he is to meet with the Spanish UN  battalion based there.    Solana said prior to his departure from Madrid that the  Spanish troops would have to be redeployed to new positions in  case of NATO air strikes.    He added that although the Spanish troops would remain in  the  former Yugoslavia throughout the winter months, the Spanish  Government may reconsider the situation if a peaceful solution  to the conflict appears unlikely.    "Perhaps after winter we should make an in-depth analysis of  the situation with other countries involved and make a decision  if a peaceful solution to the conflict has not been reached by  then," he said.    On Tuesday, the commander of Spanish troops in Bosnia,  Colonel Luis Carvajal, said UN peacekeepers would be in danger  in case of NATO air strikes as they are ill prepared to respond  to any retaliatory attacks and Serb reaction to the strikes  would be "unpredictable."    Earlier this month, the opposition Popular Party in Spain  also demanded the withdrawal of the Spanish troops from Bosnia  since it said the situation on the ground there was becoming  increasingly dangerous.    Spain has 1,180 UN peacekeeping troops deployed in the  former  Yugoslavia.</p>

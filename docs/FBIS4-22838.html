Timofeyev, </F> Russian Science Center ``Kurchatov Institute''; UDC 621.039]    [Abstract] Recuperation of the plasma energy in fusion  reactors by direct thermonuclear-to-electric energy conversion  is considered, a method of connecting the recuperator trap to a  closed dragon trap being proposed which is simpler than the  conventional use of a bundle diverter. The recuperator is a  curvilinear adiabatic trap which contains a mirror machine  identical to those in the dragon trap. The method of connecting  the two traps utilizes the peculiarities of plasma diffusion  within the dragon, the latter confining three groups of charged  particles: 1) drift particles in its toroidal segments, 2)  ``superbanana'' particles confined between locks in its  curvilinear collision-radiative electron lenses, 3) particles  confined in its axisymmetric mirror machines. The key to the  proposed method are the different modes of their diffusion,  those restrained in a mirror machine diffusing in the classical  mode across the magnetic field while drift and ``superbanana''  particles setting in the toroidal dragon segments diffuse in the  neoclassical mode. Diffusion of electrons and of ions is  analyzed quantitatively according to theory. The relevant plasma  parameters are evaluated on the premise that the frequency of  ion-ion collisions is always lower than the frequency of  electron-electron collisions owing to heavier mass of ions. A  recuperator has two electrodes mounted one at each end for  extraction of electric energy. The confining magnetic field is  the one between the electron lenses in the dragon. During the  recuperation process charged particles become quickly confined  in the mirror machines of the dragon and are drifting here in  crossed fields from the center of the dragon outward.  Recuperation requires that particles have more energy for l  longitudinal motion than for transverse motion, in which case  ``superbanana'' particles in the mirror machines become  converted into drift particles. These are then recuperated by  means of electrodes inserted into the locks of the mirror  machines, relocating the electrodes into these locks from locks  in the electron lenses having simplified the device and reduced  its size. The particularly important initial stage of the  recuperation process is analyzed on the basis of two equations,  one relating the rate of change of kinetic energy to the  electric potential gradient and one representing the law of  magnetic momentum conservation. Separately is considered  rotational conversion of energy and its effect on the  recuperation process, whereupon an approximate expression is  derived for the efficiency of recuperation in such a system.

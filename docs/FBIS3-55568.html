			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Russian Federation Defense Ministry Press and Information </F> Directorate announcement: "In Strict Accordance With the Law"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Defense Ministry has ceased  funding the activity of Russia's military courts as of 1 January  1994.    This decision fully conforms with the Russian Federation Law  "On the Status of Courts in the Russian Federation," regulating  both the status of courts under general jurisdiction and  military courts. The law, in particular, envisages that the  Russian Federation Ministry of Justice takes steps to create the  conditions needed for judicial activity and its cadre,  organizational, and resources support.    A 4 November 1993 decree of the Russian Federation Council  of  Ministers-Government ratified the statute on the Russian  Federation Ministry of Justice. This document also confirms  that military courts are part of the unified system of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Justice. One of the tasks  assigned to the said ministry, according to the statute, is to  fund the appropriate courts.    The said draft legislative acts were formulated directly by  organs of justice and were not coordinated in any way with the  Russian Defense Ministry.    [Signed] The Russian Federation Defense Ministry Information  and Press Directorate</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Mordecai Wertheimer: "Russia Returns to the </F> Middle East"]    [Text] Despite Yitzhaq Rabin's declaration in Washington  that his "shopping basket" during his current visit contains  only one item, "the pursuit of peace," it turns out that the  issue of Russia's return to the Middle East political arena took  up a considerable portion of the talks held by the prime  minister with the U.S. President and with Secretary of State  Warren Christopher. In a joint press conference held by Clinton  and Rabin at the conclusion of their talks, the President  referred to the issue of Russia's return to the Middle East and  noted, "We will be able to evaluate her intentions in the coming  days and weeks by her behavior." What that remark means is that  the American Government as well as the Government of Israel is  concerned by signs of active involvement on the part of Russia  in the peace process, a factor that has thus far not been taken  into consideration.    Last Friday the Security Council voted to pass a resolution  condemning what happened in Hebron on 25 February. The draft  resolution also contains a mention of Jerusalem as a part of  "the occupied territories," as was forcefully demanded by the  PLO. The United States conducted tireless negotiations over the  last three weeks with Yasir 'Arafat aimed at linking the passage  of this resolution with a PLO promise to resume negotiations  with Israel. Despite Yasir 'Arafat's refusal to bow to American  pleas on the issue of linkage between the UN resolution and the  resumption of the talks--and his contemptuous behavior toward  the American delegation headed by Dennis Ross, who came to  Tunis--the Americans agreed to bring the resolution up for  Security Council passage on Friday, in its original draft. It  turns out that one of the main reasons for the American  agreement stems from Russian pressure not to further delay the  passage of the resolution. The Russians even threatened that  they would act on the matter with or without U.S. agreement, and  they would not care if the United States were to "veto" the  resolution. From the Russian point of view, such a "veto" would  be helpful in their attempts to persuade the Arabs, and  especially the PLO, that they are returning to the Middle East  arena with the same mission that they performed in the past as  the principal supporter of the Arabs in the Arab-Israeli  conflict.  <H5>  U.S. Persuasion </H5>   At the end of the week, senior U.S. sources confirmed that  they had made a supreme effort to prevent Yasir 'Arafat from  contacts and negotiations with the Russians on the issue of the  "peace process" without prior coordination with the United  States. This was after it was made clear to the Americans that  the surprise visit of the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev to Jerusalem and Tunis and the invitation of Rabin and  Yasir 'Arafat to visit Moscow in the month of April were not  simply a "diplomatic gesture," but augured a Russian political  turnaround from her position over the last five years during  which she dealt mainly with her own internal affairs and was  only a figurehead on the issue of the peace process.    As usual, Yasir 'Arafat felt that this was another golden  opportunity for him to demand a "price" from the Americans for  his agreement to delay his cementing of closer ties with the  Russians. He accomplished that first and foremost with his  demand that the Security Council pass its resolution of  condemnation without obliging him to simultaneously announce the  resumption of talks with Israel. The fact that the United States  was forced to agree to this demand by 'Arafat clearly reflects  the renewal of the Russian presence in the Middle East--a  presence that, from here on out, will demand different table  rules from those that have prevailed thus far, while the United  States has been the dominant factor in the Middle East since the  convening of the Madrid conference at the end of 1991.    This Sunday Russia gave another sign of her new policy. When  delegations from Israel and the United States rushed to Tunis to  try to persuade Yasir 'Arafat to return to the negotiating  table, Russia announced that she was sending her representative  Victor Pozobulkov, the director of the Middle East department in  the Russian Foreign Ministry, to act as a counterbalance to  Dennis Ross, the senior American emissary.    From the American and Israeli reactions, it seems that this  change in Russian policy has caught both the United States and  Israel off guard. In some sense it might be said that their  reactions to the change proved that they were not only caught  off guard but that they have been left in a real funk. The fact  is that 80 members of the U.S. Senate appealed late last week to  President Clinton to "veto" the Security Council resolution  should it contain the paragraph calling Jerusalem a part of the  occupied territories. All of the Jewish organizations in the  United States, led by AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs  Committee], the Israeli lobby organization in Washington, were  also urgently called to Washington to clearly and firmly express  their demand that the United States "veto" the Security Council  resolution.    Steve Grossman, the president of AIPAC, met last week for  this purpose with President Clinton and let him know that U.S.  Jewry would consider passage of a resolution mentioning  Jerusalem as "occupied territory" to be a very serious matter.  Despite the appeals of Senate and House members and the Jewish  organizations, the U.S. representative at the Security Council  voted for the resolution while abstaining from two of its  paragraphs, the paragraph mentioning Jerusalem as occupied  territory and the paragraph implying that the Security Council  recognizes Palestinian sovereignty over Judea, Samaria, and  Gaza. The instruction by the White House to its representative  on the Security Council to vote as she did is more indicative of  confusion in this case than careful forethought.  <H5>  The Invitation to Moscow </H5>   When Yitzhaq Rabin, during his visit last week to  Washington,  was asked about his reaction to his invitation and 'Arafat's to  visit Moscow in the month of April, he answered that he really  did not expect it from the Russians, but he accepted the  invitation. On the matter of the U.N. Security Council  resolution, the prime minister stated that the inclusion of  Jerusalem as occupied territory is something Israel rejects,  "but if it is a matter of one item in the entire process, then  it is not so bad." Rabin thought that the Americans would insist  that their vote for the resolution would be conditioned on PLO  agreement to renew the talks and on implementation of the "Gaza  and Jericho First" plan. In fact it turned out that the Russian  pressure caused the U.S. President to change the stand he had  announced to the Israeli prime minister 48 hours earlier. And  the United States allowed the resolution to pass without  "vetoing" it, as she had threatened to do for three weeks.    When Shim'on Peres initiated his secret talks in Oslo a year  ago, containing his "big plan of deception" centered on an  agreement to "the declaration of principles" with the PLO, he  based it on the global state of affairs. In that view of things,  the world had undergone far-reaching changes over the last few  years. The Soviet Union had disappeared and the Russia that had  taken her place was not and would not be a superpower. He also  pointed out that the Berlin Wall had fallen, that the people of  Eastern Europe had been liberated from the Communist yoke, and  that from now on hegemony in the world would be exclusively  American. Since--according to this view of things on the part of  the Israeli prime minister--the period of conflicts in the world  was over and peace would soon prevail, Israel had to hurry to  join in the "new world order" by signing peace treaties with the  PLO and with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon at any price. Shim'on  Peres even loudly and publicly mocked the positions of the Likud  and his partner in the national unity government, Yitzhaq  Shamir, who he felt had closed their eyes to the changes that  had occurred in the global political order and were stubbornly  clinging to their position that Israel must not agree to any  accommodation that would deviate from the Camp David accords,  and certainly not conduct negotiations with the PLO terrorist  organization. Now the turnaround in the Russian position comes  as a slap in the face to the Israeli prime minister, proving his  "vision" faulty and demonstrating the entire structure he built  to be a house of cards about to collapse.  <H5>  The Changes in Russian Policy </H5>   The Russians did not announce the change in their foreign  policy indirectly or in a roundabout way. They did it in the  most direct and public fashion. Over the last two weeks the  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has distributed to the world's  newspapers lots of articles, in which he outlines the new  Russian foreign policy. There is no doubt that Kozyrev is not  doing this on his own initiative, but with the authorization and  encouragement of the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin. In  articles published in THE NEW YORK TIMES and THE WASHINGTON  TIMES last week, he sets down Russia's new foreign policy  principles. At the center of the Russian Government's plan is  the principle that Russia will no longer concede exclusive  American hegemony in the world. The Russians say that they were  and remain a "superpower" just as they were before the collapse  of the Soviet Union, and accordingly the Americans and the rest  of the world have to deal with Russia. Still, there is a  substantive change in the new Russian policy as opposed to that  of the "Cold War" period, and it is the Russian willingness to  establish "cooperation" between the two superpowers, the United  States and Russia. Such cooperation requires the Americans not  to make unilateral decisions on issues and in areas in which the  Russians have their own interests.    Andrey Kozyrev even lays out the strategic goals of the new  Russian policy and refers specifically to the present peace  process when he says, "In the Middle East, our efforts will be  focused on our continuing role as partners with the United  States in the peace process and in realizing the aspirations of  the Palestinian people. We will strive for extensive economic  cooperation with the Arab states with the aim of attracting  their financial resources for Russian economic development in  its modern era and for strengthening the Russian position in  world trade, including weapons trade." The wording of this  paragraph of the Russian plan shows that their strategic  decision is to return full force to the Middle East.  Furthermore, they stress their desire to return to active  involvement in the Middle East in all areas, so that the  possibility of the Russians returning to their function as Arab  "patron" is very real. If this Russian plan is, in fact,  implemented, there is no doubt that it will have many  implications for what is termed the "peace process."    If the Israeli Government indeed sees itself responsible for  the future and security of the State of Israel, it must quickly  come to grips with this turnaround in Russian policy in the  Middle East and change its strategy and tactics to meet the new  challenges that she is thereby faced with. The government's  running amok after the PLO and its desire to hand over control  of Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip as fast as possible to the  terrorist organization only shows that the government of the  left still has not come to understand the change that is taking  place in the international order in the Middle East as a result  of Russia's return to the region.</p>

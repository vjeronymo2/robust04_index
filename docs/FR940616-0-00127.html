			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary amends part 682 of title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 682_FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The authority citation for part 682 continues to read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  20 U.S.C. 1071 to 1087&hyph;2, unless otherwise noted.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. A new &sect;682.215 is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;682.215  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Stafford Loan forgiveness demonstration program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Federal Stafford Loan forgiveness demonstration program is intended to encourage individuals to enter the teaching and nursing professions and to perform national and community service. Under this demonstration program, the Secretary repays portions of unsubsidized, subsidized and nonsubsidized Federal Stafford obligations that were incurred by a borrower during the borrower's last two years of undergraduate education if that borrower worked in those professions or performed that service. For purposes of this section, an eligible borrower is a borrower who, as of October 1, 1989, had no outstanding debt under the FFEL programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Borrower eligibility; requirements for qualification. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A borrower may obtain loan forgiveness under this program if he or she was employed as a full-time teacher in certain elementary and secondary schools teaching certain subjects or as a full-time nurse in certain types of hospitals or health care centers, or was serving as a volunteer under the Peace Corps Act or under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, or was performing comparable service as a full-time employee of a tax exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For purposes of this section,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-time <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the standard used by a State or profession in defining full-time employment. For a borrower serving in more than one organization, the determination of ``full-time'' is based on the combination of all qualifying employment. A borrower who is in default on a FFEL loan and has not made satisfactory repayment arrangements is not eligible for forgiveness. However, if a borrower has made satisfactory repayment arrangements on the loan or loans in default, the forgiveness applies only to the loan or loans held by the holder that are not in default. Federal Stafford loans that have been rehabilitated are eligible for forgiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To qualify for the forgiveness program, an eligible borrower shall apply to the Secretary each year following a completed year of service, but no earlier than September 1 and no later than October 1 of a given year. The application must be in writing, on a form provided by the Secretary and according to procedures established by the Secretary. An eligible borrower must complete a year of service prior to filing a loan forgiveness application with the Secretary. Eligible borrowers are chosen on a first-come, first-served basis to participate and must receive forbearance upon request for each year of service for which forgiveness is requested. An eligible borrower must reapply each year to receive the forgiveness benefit. Incomplete or inaccurate applications are not considered in the first-come, first-served process. If a borrower initially submits an incomplete or inaccurate application, the borrower must provide a completed application to the Secretary or his designee prior to consideration in the selection process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limitation; Stafford forgiveness recipients. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The total amount of loans forgiven is limited to the amount of funds appropriated for the fiscal year for the demonstration program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Borrower eligibility; teaching forgiveness. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) To qualify for teaching loan forgiveness under this section, a borrower must have taught full-time for a year (as defined by the jurisdiction in which the borrower is employed) in a teacher shortage area as certified by the authorizing official.

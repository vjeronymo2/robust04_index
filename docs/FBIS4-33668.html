			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Walter Sotomayor] </F>   [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico reiterated here  today that it "automatically" rejects linking the topics of  democracy, stability, and security of the hemisphere. Mexico  also said it is pleased with the statements made in favor of  putting an end to Cuba's isolation.    "As the Inter-American community is called upon to help  democracy, it should promote the conditions that stimulate it,"  said Mexican Ambassador Jorge Pinto Mazal before the 24th OAS  General Assembly. The Mexican under secretary for Latin  America, cultural affairs, and cooperation, added that his  country's delegation is very pleased to hear the pronouncements  in favor of Cuba's participation in the inter-American system.  He pointed out that Mexico's foreign policy is noted for  favoring dialogue and agreement rather than exclusion and  isolation.    The ambassador added that the principles of Mexican foreign  policy were reinforced with a negotiated political solution to  the crisis in Haiti and the proposals for an end to the  isolation of Cuba which were presented by Canada and Brazil.  "We are obviously pleased to see that other countries share  this stand and do not want to see Cuba isolated," he said.  Pinto Mazal heads the Mexican delegation that is attending the  24th OAS General Assembly which will conclude on Friday in  Belem, Para State, some 2,000 km north of Brasilia.    Yesterday, Brazil and Canada proposed ending the isolation  of  Cuba as a mechanism for promoting the "democratic transition"  that "is already observed" on the Caribbean island. "We are all  hoping for a democratic evolution in Cuba, with which Brazil  maintains friendly relations," said Brazilian Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim to the participants in the regional meeting.    The foreign minister said they have observed positive  advances in the implementation of reforms in Cuba, which "should  be increased," but rejected that economic and political  isolation is the best way to contribute to the transition "that  is starting to emerge."    During her remarks, Christine Stewart, the Canadian  secretary  of state for Latin American affairs, maintained that her country  believes that "isolation, due to its nature, is not healthy;  especially during this important transition phase in Cuba."  Stewart added: "It is in our and the Cuban people's interest  that we support the process of change on the island, which is  positive and orderly."    On Wednesday, Pinto Meza underscored this, that experience  has shown the ineffectiveness of the use of force as an  instrument to resolve international conflicts. The lessons of  the Cold War should be a reference to avoid the mistakes made in  the past," he said.    He praised the work carried out for eight years by Brazilian  diplomat Joao Baena Soares as the OAS secretary general. "He  led the inter-American organization during particularly tense  bipolar moments and during the unique Cold War situation," Pinto  Meza added.    The Mexican diplomat also emphasized the importance that  Mexico places on the advances made by the countries in social  and economic development, the eradication of poverty, and  combating drug trafficking activities. He presented Mexico's  efforts toward commercial liberalization and economic  integration and cautioned about the problems faced by people who  look for jobs outside their place of origin.    Pinto Meza promised that his country would support all OAS  organization activities to defend human rights and briefed the  General Assembly on the establishment of impartial litigation in  his country.</p>

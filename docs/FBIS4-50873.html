			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo and Edward Chen] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- The Kaohsiung-based fishing  boats Chin Chuang Hsing and Chin Yuan Hsing were fishing  illegally in Argentine waters before the Argentine Navy attacked  and sank the Chin Yuan Hsing on Saturday [21 May], the Council  of Agriculture (COA) said Monday.    The two owners of the two vessels will be dealt with  according to ROC fishing laws which mandate punishment for  illegal operation in foreign economic zones, COA Fisheries  Department Director Li Chien-chuan said.    Li said that the fishing licenses for the ships may be  suspended or revoked.    The owners of the ships were not available for comment on  the  incident, in which an Argentine Navy corvette opened fire on the  Chin Yuan Hsing Saturday, forcing the crew to escape the sinking  vessel in lifeboats.    About 110 Taiwan fishing boats are reportedly fishing for  squid near Argentina and the Falkland Islands. Of this number,  Li said, sixty have signed fishing agreements with the Falkland  Islands and 13 with the Argentine Government which allow them to  fish in territorial waters.    The remaining 37 squid boats have not signed the accords and  can only fish on the high seas, he said. They are prohibited  from fishing in Argentine or Falkland Islands territorial waters.    The Argentine Navy has been strictly enforcing a ban on  illegal fishing and will continue to do so, Li added.    Meanwhile, a report from Buenos Aires said that the crew of  the Chin Yuan Hsing was rescued by the Chin Chuang Hsing, which  is still somewhere on the high seas.    The Chin Chuang Hsing was expected to return to Port  Stanley,  Falkland Islands on Saturday afternoon, but remained on the high  seas through late Sunday.    A medical team has been sent to the port to await the Chin  Chuang Hsing and treat any injured sailors, the report said.</p>

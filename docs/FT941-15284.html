			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The people you need to know in the City - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton offer names and addresses for savers and investors who need advice, information or help The world of personal finance is complicated and it can be difficult for individuals new to the subject to find out where to look for advice, where to find information if they want to go it alone, and where to complain if it all goes wrong. The financial services industry is always changing but the sources of information are more constant. We offer below a guide to the more common areas of personal finance. FINANCIAL ADVICE Independent financial advisers fall into two main categories: those who are remunerated by commission and those who charge fees. Finance and the Family has always recommended fee-based advice to ensure there is no conflict between an adviser's need to make a living and the quality of advice he gives to the client. Our sister publication Money Management keeps a list of fee-based advisers. The complete list costs Pounds 1,000 + VAT but if you simply want the names of advisers in your area, state you postcode and a shorter list will be sent to you free of charge. The Registry of Financial Planning is a list of IFAs, indicating which are fee-based and is available free. IFA Promotion, which was established in 1992, operates a consumer telephone line (0483-461461), and can send inquirers an information pack and the names of six local IFAs. However, most will be remunerated by commission. Money Management Fee-based Adviser Register, Financial Times Business Information, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND. Tel: 071-405-6969. Registry of Financial Planning at the Institute of Financial Planning, Hereford House, East Street, Hereford HR1 2LU. 0432-274-891. PERFORMANCE FIGURES If you have investments in unit or investment trusts, you can check on the unit or share price in the FT every day, but you may also want to find out how they compare with similar funds. Finance and the Family uses fund performance statistics from two agencies: Hardwick Stafford Wright and Micropal. They each produce a range of statistics every month, with separate packs on investment trusts, unit trusts, offshore funds, pension funds and so on. However, subscriptions are expensive for the private investor: HSW charges Pounds 150 a year per type of fund, for example. Most private investors would not need that amount of detail every month. HSW, London &amp; Manchester House, Park Green, Macclesfield, Cheshire, SK11 7NG. 0625-511311. Micropal has launched a monthly publication Investment Tracker, giving performance figures for unit and investment trusts, pension funds, popular share issues and stock market indices. The cost is Pounds 40 for a single copy or Pounds 380 pa. Micropal, Commonwealth House, 2 Chalkhill Rd, London W6 8DW. 081-741-4100. An alternative is the FT publication, Money Management, which is aimed mostly at professional financial advisers, but can be useful for the keen amateur. It runs surveys of financial products, is published monthly, and includes performance tables of unit and investment trusts, investment funds and sterling-converted offshore funds over different periods. A single issue costs Pounds 4.50. (For address, see Financial Advice, above.) Chase de Vere publishes an annual guide to Peps, costing Pounds 9.95, refundable if you buy a Pep through the firm. Half yearly performance guides cost Pounds 2. Chase de Vere, 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, WC2A 3JX. 071-404-5766. SAVINGS/MORTGAGE RATES Where do you look if you want to know who is offering the best mortgage deal, or where you can earn the highest interest rates on your savings? Moneyfacts is the source of the 'Highest rates for your money' table which we publish every week. It also publishes a highly detailed monthly guide to bank and building society accounts, mortgages, loans, credit cards, National Savings and so on. An annual subscription costs Pounds 38.50, but for a free sample copy, call 0692-500677. SHARE INFORMATION ProShare, the body which was set up with government funding to promote wider share ownership, has a Guide to Information Sources for the Private Investor. The list includes newspapers and reference books as well as telephone information lines (such as FT Cityline), investment analysis software and TV share-price information, such as Ceefax and Teletext. The Guide evaluates the source of information for simple language, value for money, ease of use and whether it is up-to-date. It is free to ProShare members but otherwise costs Pounds 4.95 + 50p p&amp;p. ProShare Association, Library Chambers, 13 &amp; 14 Basinghall Street, London EC2V 5BQ. 071-600-0984. The New Issue Register is a database which aims to give private investors privileged treatment in new share issues. Membership entitles you to a monthly newsletter and a telephone hotline which gives notice of forthcoming issues as well as information about the new issue market. Annual membership is Pounds 75 plus VAT. Butlers Wharf Business Centre, 45 Curlew Street, London SE1 2ND. 071-357-6608. STOCKBROKERS through personal recommendation, the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers has a free directory of private client stockbrokers which gives details of the services offered by its members. Apcims, 112 Middlesex St, London, E1 7HY. Call 0891-335521 for the directory. COMPLAINTS There are so many regulators and ombudsmen in the financial services industry that the difficulty of finding the right person to complain to can deter some people. The procedure for complaints is always to approach the company first, and only after that, the relevant self-regulatory body. The final stage is to take the matter to the ombudsman, if there is one. Keep photocopies of all correspondence. You can find out which body is responsible for the firm about which you wish to complain by calling the central register hotline of the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulatory body, on 071-929-3652. SIB also has a number of useful free pamphlets which include: Background to Investor Protection, How to Spot the Investment Cowboys, Investment Business: What to do if you need to complain, Compensation for Investors.

LOST INVESTMENTS certificates, insurance documents, building society passbooks or similar and want to know what they are worth, first write to the last known address for the company or organisation. If that produces nothing, write to the appropriate industry body (see above), to find out whether the company is still in business, or has changed name, merged or collapsed. After that, more detective work may be necessary, using back copies of yearbooks and newspapers. INDUSTRY BODIES These are associations for companies or institutions with a similar purpose. They often act as public spokesmen on general policy, and can also be a useful source of information on their industry and members, but are not the right destination for complaints. Most prefer communication in writing. Association of British Insurers: 51, Gresham Street, London EC2V 7HQ.

DEBT can be frightening and embarrassing. If you think debts are getting on top of you, first seek help at a Citizens Advice Bureau or Money Advice Centre (look in the phone book for your local office). Many CABs have specialist money advisers. The National Debtline, in Birmingham, is a telephone advice service which can talk you through problems, and also sends out information packs. It is staffed Mondays and Thursdays 10-4pm, and Tuesdays and Wednesdays 2-7pm. There is an answering machine at other times. Tel: 021-359-8501</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Markheath in reverse takeover Markheath, the heavily indebted property company, is to acquire Thomas Bailey Investments in a reverse takeover by the privately owned Welsh property developer. The conditional deal will mean that Markheath, which has had a standstill agreement with its bankers since last March, will change its name to TBI and move its headquarters from London to Cardiff. It will have a portfolio of commercial and retail properties and development sites in London, Stevenage and south Wales valued at Pounds 96.3m, yielding about 10 per cent. Of Markheath's bank borrowings of Pounds 67.7m, about Pounds 25m will be written off by banks led by Midland and ANZ, Pounds 22m will be refinanced by a new term loan from Barclays and the balance satisfied with the majority of the proceeds from a Pounds 24m share placing and open offer. The share placing and offer - on an 11-for-17 basis of 79m new ordinary shares at 33p - is underwritten by Charterhouse. The new shares will represent 64.7 per cent of the enlarged capital. Mr Stanley Thomas, a principal shareholder in Thomas Bailey, and Mrs SM Case, his sister, will subscribe for up to 22.7m of the shares. Mr Michael Rendle, non-executive chairman of Markheath since 1991, will become non-executive chairman of TBI and three Thomas Bailey directors will join the board. Mr Thomas and Mr Paul Bailey will be deputy chairman and executive director and Mr Paul Guy chief executive. The three new directors will receive a 30.3 per cent stake in the enlarged capital for selling their company to Markheath. Dealings in Markheath shares have been suspended at 6p pending shareholders' approval of the restructuring at an extraordinary meeting on March 24. Old shares will be consolidated on a 20-for-1 basis. Markheath incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.37m in the six months to September 30 last year with net liabilities of Pounds 14.8m, including bank borrowings of Pounds 67.7m. It ran into trouble with the downturn in the commercial property market and also made losses totalling Pounds 37m on the sale of investments in Frogmore Estates and Camford Engineering. Its property portfolio has been written down by Pounds 75m over the past two years and staff have been reduced from 150 to 10. Thomas Bailey made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 422,000 in the seven months to November 30 with net assets of Pounds 6.7m.</p>

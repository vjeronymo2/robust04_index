			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: EC leaders seek Ecu borrowing network THE European Commission is to suggest to EC governments and central banks that they inform each other more about their borrowing plans in Ecu, so as to avoid a repeat of the recent flood of Ecu paper by sovereign borrowers. At its weekly meeting, the 17-member EC executive body yesterday approved a communication to the EC Council of Ministers suggesting that sovereign issuers of Ecu bonds should establish an informal network, and more formal meetings once or twice a year, to put a little more order into the market. In the second two weeks of February there were 10 Ecu bond issues, totalling Ecu 8.75bn, or equivalent to one third of all borrowing done in the composite currency in the whole of 1990. The Commission notes that 90 per cent of these bonds, Ecu 7.9bn to be precise, were issued by EC member-states or Community institutions. The Commission felt itself somewhat caught in the Ecu rush when it found financial institutions temporarily reluctant to subscribe to the Ecu 1bn it raised earlier this year as a first loan tranche for Greece. EC officials say there is a group of government borrowers that occasionally meets under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). But its membership and scope of interest is too wide to focus on the Ecu, in which Brussels takes a particularly paternal interest as the future single money of the Community. 'It is surprising to learn that the people in the Bank of England borrowing Ecus for the UK Treasury don't know the names and telephone numbers of their counterparts in the Banque de France,' said one official. For rather different reasons, the committee of EC central bank governors, headed by Mr Karl Otto Pohl, has been studying why the Ecu has acquired a premium in the market over the collective value of its individual components. EC officials explain that while the premium may be small - still under 1 per cent - its existence is a source of particular concern to Germany, which opposes any parallel currency. 'The more the Ecu takes on a role independent of its own basket definition, the more it looks like a currency,' said one EC official. Mr Pohl is also head of the Bundesbank.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK property There was much excitement a while back when long gilts yields fell below property yields for the first time in a generation. That made property seem an especially attractive asset given its characteristics as a quasi-bond with a 25-year lease and a minimum fixed income stream once fully let. A surge of buying interest is now driving down property yields. But with bond yields backing up again, the two yield lines are rapidly converging. That may give some asset allocation committees pause for thought, which would be no bad thing. Buying has become almost frantic, with some properties changing hands at eye-watering yields. Property shares, too, appear temporarily to have run ahead of themselves. For example, Land Securities' share price has moved to a 41 per cent premium to its last stated net asset value of 504p per share. The value of Land's existing portfolio will have to rise at a thumping rate if its share price is to revert to the discount to net asset values which is traditional for property companies. Historically, however, there has been little correlation between long gilt and property yields. The property sector marches to its own tune and is still at the early stages of its cyclical upswing. The big hope now is that rental growth may resume in the latter part of this year. Any awakening of dormant inflation would hasten its arrival while blighting the attractions of gilts. Retail rents may recover first, followed by industrial property and high quality London offices. But, as ever, selectivity is critical.</p>

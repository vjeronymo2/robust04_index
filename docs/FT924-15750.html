			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Daikyo to restructure operations DAIKYO, a leading Japanese property developer, is to restructure its troubled operations, including its overseas resort business. A rationalisation plan announced yesterday includes the sale of assets to subsidiaries and lowering prices of unsold flats by as much as 20 per cent to accelerate sales. The plan confirmed investors' worries over Daikyo's outlook and sent the stock plunging by Y80 to Y700 yesterday. The company faces a squeeze in cash-flow as contract rates have fallen sharply and flat prices have plummeted. Jitters over Japan's property-related companies have shaken the Tokyo stock market. However, government plans to set up organisation to buy land held as collateral by banks, to revive the property market, had restored confidence. Daikyo will transfer property assets to affiliates and sell Y50bn (Dollars 4.02bn) worth of offices to a subsidiary.</p>

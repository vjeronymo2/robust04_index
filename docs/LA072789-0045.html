			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRANSIT PANEL VOTES TO FIGHT ROBBINS BILL  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission has voted to continue fighting  legislation that would force it to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro  Rail line underground through the east San Fernando Valley instead of building  a cheaper light-rail system.  </P> <P> Saying it interferes with local decision making, commissioners voted 8 to 2  Wednesday to oppose the bill by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana).  </P> <P> "I don't know why we need a commission if each route is going to be legislated  from Sacramento," said Commissioner Barna Szabo.  </P> <P> Acting on behalf of the commission's Government Relations and Finance  Committee, commission representatives in Sacramento have already testified  against the bill, which was reported out of the Assembly Transportation  Committee last week.  </P> <P> Under the bill, the line would run on the Southern Pacific railroad's  little-used Burbank branch that crosses the Valley from North Hollywood to  Warner Center parallel to Chandler and Victory boulevards and Oxnard and Topham  streets.  </P> <P> To satisfy homeowners, the line would be either underground or in a deep trench  in residential areas.  </P> <P> To cut costs, the line would end in the Sepulveda Basin. Travelers bound for  the West Valley would transfer to buses.  </P></p>

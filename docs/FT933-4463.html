			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (19): Volvo finds package to smooth takeover - Application / Consolidation of the manufacturing operations meant two incompatible computer systems had to be brought together VOLVO'S takeover of Leyland's bus manufacturing operations against a background of significant changes in the public transport market, inevitably posed a problem when it came to management information. The consolidation of the two companies' manufacturing operations meant that two incompatible computer systems had to be brought together. Volvo has IBM's AS/400 minicomputers and Leyland's systems were based on a McDonnell Douglas computer. But Volvo Bus, the UK marketing company, needed stop-gap information systems quickly, to cover the time it would take to integrate the two systems. Information systems manager Denny Wood wanted a software development tool which could work with the existing systems and deliver applications to users with the minimum of fuss: 'It was a means to an end at a time when we could not recruit programming expertise. Our corporate systems run IBM/AS/400 using the Synon package. But we needed something that was more productivity oriented,' says Wood. Although Wood and Gordon Scuffins, his systems manager, both have sound experience of information technology systems, neither had the required AS/400 programming expertise to build the applications users needed. Wood chose, therefore, to buy in a RAD package from Hoskyns called MRC-Productivity to help. Originating in the USA, MRC-productivity is described by Hoskyns as a tool for development late in the software cycle - that is for applications that build upon existing infrastructure systems. Hoskyns adds that, unlike the advanced tools used for building large systems, MRC-Productivity does not require a large training commitment from users staff. 'The only training I had was a demonstration and a two-day course,' says Scuffins. Specifically, the tool has been used to develop information systems for internal use in the area of reporting. 'We needed reports on such things as part sales analysed by dealer, geographical area and product type. This helped the production purchasing staff negotiate favourable deals on parts,' says Scuffins. 'The MRC tool has proved invaluable for these sorts of application because it means we are able to respond very quickly to user demands. In general terms I think we can say we respond in hours rather than weeks.' Wood concludes that Volvo's first experience with RAD 'has been a very successful investment' and he is convinced that the user demand for applications could not have been met without it.</p>

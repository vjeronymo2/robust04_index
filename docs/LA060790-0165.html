			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECEPTIVE PRACTICES ON '900' PHONE LINES HIT;  </P> <P> MARKETING: A CONSUMER GROUP SAYS CALLING THE NUMBERS OFTEN COSTS MORE AND  YIELDS LESS THAN EXPECTED.  </P> <P> Advertised pay-per-call "900" phone information numbers often employ deceptive  marketing tactics and ultimately cost consumers more than expected while  providing less information, according to a national survey of 144 such phone  lines to be released today.  </P> <P> Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based group sponsoring the study, has asked  telecommunications regulators to "stem the rip-offs" by enacting rules that  would allow consumers to block 900 services, create uniform standards for  advertising, require disclosure of costs and refunds, and develop enforcement  powers to protect individuals from fraudulent 900 lines.  </P> <P> "There are no consumer protections in place for out-of-state 900 calls," said  Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action. "Since there are going  to be more and more products delivered by the phone and billed by the phone,  the Federal Communications Commission and the Public Utilities Commission are  going to have to take responsibility to make sure consumers are not subjected  to fraud and deception."  </P> <P> The survey was the latest evidence of a growing public outcry over 900  services.  </P> <P> The pay-per-call industry was created in 1983 and now includes roughly 6,000  services, according to Larry Podell, publisher of the Audiotex Directory &amp;  Buyers Guide in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But fraudulent and deceptive practices are growing at an equally brisk pace,  according to consumer groups. The National Consumers League in Washington, for  example, ranked pay-per-call services as the top emerging telemarketing scam of  the 1990s.  </P> <P> "We have seen and heard from consumers on a number of issues," said Linda  Golodner, the league's executive director. Among the main complaints: excessive  costs, being put on hold and not disclosing costs up front.  </P> <P> Still, little has been done to combat the problems, industry experts said.  </P> <P> State and federal laws enacted in recent years provide at least limited  protections from dial-a-porn numbers. But the courts have often blocked  implementation of these laws, said Kathleen Flynn, a spokeswoman for Pacific  Bell in Los Angeles. Pacific Bell has been in the forefront of fighting  dial-a-porn and is seeking to block pornographic messages from its network  altogether.  </P> <P> Consumer Action said it had been "overwhelmed by the slime" in the pornographic  phone lines, but was much more concerned about marketing practices in the  business and financial category. These are 900 lines that promise to repair  credit, find jobs or provide "valuable" information about auctions, according  to McEldowney.  </P> <P> "You can't really criticize services like 'dial-a-joke' because some people  might think it's worth $2 a minute," said Stephen B. Texeira, staff researcher  at Consumer Action. "But when we started calling these (financial-oriented)  numbers, it became very clear. We'd be on the phone for 10 minutes and get no  information."  </P> <P> Indeed, the Consumer Action survey found a wide array of phone lines that  advertised services that were not provided or were only provided at an  additional cost. The consumer group compiled a list of a dozen such lines that  promised to provide everything from credit cards to jobs and loans.  </P> <P> In many cases, the phone lines advertised relatively low costs -- such as $1  per minute -- but sought to keep consumers on the line so long that the actual  cost amounted to much more.  </P> <P> One such line promised to help individuals find government jobs at a cost of $2  per minute. However, all the tape-recorded voice offered was dozens of local  phone numbers for government agencies that are "always hiring." By the time the  numbers were all slowly dispensed, the bill totaled $20, Texeira said. And,  incidentally, all the numbers provided are listed in the phone book.  </P> <P> Others promised credit cards to those with credit problems. But the credit  cards were either limited to buying products out of a single company's  catalogue, or they required consumers to guarantee repayment by depositing  amounts in excess of their credit limits into accounts held by the issuing card  company. And none of the cards was cheap. Nearly all required "processing fees"  that ranged from $30 to $55, not to mention annual fees and high interest  rates, Texeira said.  </P> <P> Additionally, Consumer Action said, services also often succumbed to a variety  of other deceptions. These techniques included repeating information over and  over; filling time with unnecessary chatter to keep callers on the phone  running up higher fees; putting callers on hold; hanging up in the middle of a  program so callers would call back; referring callers to another -- and often  more expensive -- 900 number to get the promised information, or only  advertising the fee for the first minute, thereby masking the total price.  </P> <P> Consumer Action has compiled a booklet on common abuses and consumer remedies.  It can be obtained by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to: 900 Fact  Sheet, c/o Consumer Action, 116 New Montgomery St., Suite 233, San Francisco,  Calif. 94105.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> SOME OF THE WORST 900 LINES*  </P> <P> Line: 1-900-988-1505  </P> <P> Claim: Credit for those with "no credit, bad credit.

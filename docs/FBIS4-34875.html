			<p>BFN     [Text] St. Lucia has been given a clean bill of health from  major international organizations, such as the International  Monetary Fund. This was revealed last evening by one of the  island's representatives at the just-concluded World Bank  meeting in Washington. Speaking on the discussion program  "One," broadcast on Helen Television System, government Senator  (Charmaine Gardner) painted a bright picture of St. Lucia:    [Begin (Gardner) recording] I happen to have been in  Washington last week, at the World Bank meetings, and we were  told there by both the World Bank, by the International Monetary  Fund, and by many other funding agencies who happen to have been  at that meeting that St. Lucia was one of the countries in the  eastern Caribbean, in fact, from Guyana all the way north to  Jamaica, more than the eastern Caribbean, in the entire  Caribbean region -- St. Lucia was one of the countries who were  doing very well.    St. Lucia had one of the best country reports given by both  the IMF and World Bank and many of the other funding agencies.  We were told that, in terms of our management, our economic  management, management of our fiscal policy, our annual growth  rate was between 4 and 5 percent; that the norm for countries  like the United States is something like 4.5 percent; that our  country's debt burden, in terms of its ratio to repayment, was  also good; and that we need to maintain our annual growth rate;  and that one of the ways in which we had arrived at the annual  growth rate of about just over 4 percent and one of the ways in  which we need to maintain that annual growth rate was that our  economy had, by and large, been private-sector driven and that  some of the greatest levels of import into the economy were by  not only the traditional private sector but by the tourism  industry and, in some sectors, by the agricultural industry,  where there were areas of privatization and agroindustry.

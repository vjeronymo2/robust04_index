			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Now for the hard part: Tony Blair, UK opposition leader, has done well, but has not yet proved Labour is ready to govern Mr Tony Blair has cause for satisfaction and for consternation. Labour has an unprecedented lead in opinion polls. His own ratings are higher than any achieved by the leader of the opposition in recent memory. But his party is unprepared: expert in the skills of opposition, so far it has offered only a shallow programme for government. Mr Blair's firmest policy commitment - to radical constitutional reform - is fraught with political dangers. Let's start, though, with the satisfaction. It would be churlish to deny Mr Blair his plaudits. He has led Labour for less than six months. In that short time he has transformed the mood. He has begun to reposition the party in the public's consciousness as value-based rather than class-based. He has shown an appreciation of strategy as well as tactics. He is a politician who means what he says. His admirers are not confined to friends among the Islington intelligentsia. Every opinion poll since his election in July has underlined the appeal of this 41-year-old former public schoolboy to the aspirant working classes who deserted Labour for Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. And the middle classes of southern England now have a leader of the opposition whom they can call One of Us. The electoral 'fear factor' which has haunted Labour since 1979 is dissipating. Mr Blair has performed well in the theatre of politics. During his twice-weekly duels with Mr John Major in the House of Commons, he has added a touch of gravitas to the boyish good looks. He has missed one or two opportunities, but has not made any serious mistakes. He has portrayed the Conservatives as terminally divided and out of touch. In so far as the government has needed assistance in persuading voters of the veracity of the charge, Mr Blair has provided it. It is not simply style and image, although Mr Blair is as conscious as any politician of his public relations. He has pointed Labour in a different direction. His embrace of the 'dynamic market economy' was unremarkable to those long acquainted with the realities of global competition. But within his own party it marked a decisive step forward, even from the 'modernist' policies presented at the 1992 general election. When Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, raised interest rates in September, Mr Blair eschewed the reflex, undiluted condemnation. Instead, he offered a more subtle message. Mr Clarke was right in his own terms to pre-empt an upsurge in inflation. But what an indictment of Tory policies, said Mr Blair, that the economy risked overheating with 2.5m people unemployed. Mr Blair's attitude towards the welfare state has revealed a similar shift. He did not endorse without qualification the report of the independent Social Justice Commission, established by his predecessor, the late Mr John Smith. But he embraced its central themes: that universal provision of benefits cannot be open-ended, that getting people back into work takes priority over handing out more in benefits. There have been other changes. Labour's policy towards Northern Ireland has caught up with the principle of majority consent for any political settlement. Even before the row over his choice of a grant-maintained school for his own son, Mr Blair had begun to detach Labour from the politically correct agenda of the teaching unions. But the political drama came with Mr Blair's announcement at Labour's autumn conference that the party must drop its most sacred shibboleth: Clause IV of its constitution, enshrining a commitment to common ownership of the means of production and distribution. The pledge has been irrelevant almost from the day it was penned by Sidney Webb in 1917. No Labour leader has ever suggested the state should run Britain's corner shops. But Clause IV has been the standard behind which the party's ideologues have marched for generations. Its replacement by a new statement of values should provide a potent symbol that Labour is serious about change. Mr Blair is convinced he will win the argument, in spite of campaigns by some grassroots activists to preserve Clause IV. The final decision will be taken by a special conference in April. One or two of the big trade unions, notably the TGWU general union, will cling to the past. So too will the cadres of constituency party purists. But most individual members and a majority of the unions will back the leader. The glue holding together the strands in Mr Blair's strategy is a return to first principles. His message is Labour must rediscover its ambitions, not fight about the means of delivering them. Fairness is more important than ownership, equality of opportunity more relevant than redistribution of wealth. Values should replace totems. To the derision of the traditionalist left, Mr Blair calls this New Labour. In fact what he is offering is Old Labour - a spruced-up version of the aspirational politics that guided the party in the immediate postwar period. The voters backed Labour then because it offered a ladder of opportunity. The ideological introspection of the party's activists took hold later. But now for the consternation. Acknowledging that Mr Blair has done well is not the same as describing Labour as a government-in-waiting. Even after 15 years in the wilderness, the forces of inertia run deep. So does the reflex suspicion of party activists that the leadership is set on betrayal. At Westminster - in the shadow cabinet as well as on the backbenches - there are many who want Mr Blair simply to wait for the Conservatives to deliver him victory. But there is no absolute guarantee that the Tories will not rediscover their senses, that the economic upturn will not translate into a political recovery. In any event, winning an election is not the same as being ready to govern. Mr Blair seems to understand that. So, in his own way, does Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist deputy leader of the Labour party, whose support so far for the process of modernisation has been vital. Many of their colleagues do not. The quality of the shadow cabinet is uneven. There is a handful of thinkers. They are counterbalanced by a group of indifferent, often lazy politicians who see their role as denouncing the government. Then there is a third group which tends to drift with the tide, offering grumbling assent to the leadership but little conviction and less action. Mr Blair has provided policy signposts: the party is no longer intent on increasing the tax burden, it is in favour of public/private sector partnerships, it is no longer hostile to allowing schools more independence. But signposts do not add up to a persuasive strategy. What is missing is not simply detail - at times Labour has been overly obsessed with the minutiae - but a sense that it has formulated policies across the range of issues which fit together as a coherent programme. There are contradictions also. Its economic strategy promises to eschew crude demand management and to maintain a target for low inflation. But it offers also a target for growth. It does not explain which economic levers it will use to meet the growth target, or how it will respond to the inevitable conflicts between the two objectives. It is the same with taxation. The increases imposed by the Conservatives are roundly condemned, not just because they represent broken promises but because of the additional burden on ordinary families. Yet any pre-election reversal of the increases has been condemned in advance as no more than a bribe. The voters will want to know if Mr Blair thinks the tax burden is too high, is about right or is too low. They might also ask whether his party agrees with its leader. Then there is Europe. Few doubt that Mr Blair, who wants to take his party into the social democrat mainstream of its Continental counterparts, is serious about a commitment to keeping Britain in the European Union's first division. But a reflex embrace for the social chapter and a hedged commitment to joining a single currency do not add up to a European policy. There is an exception to the general vagueness. In one policy area - constitutional reform - Mr Blair has given an irrevocable pledge to legislate immediately after the election for a parliament for Scotland and an assembly for Wales. The judgment of some allies in the senior ranks of the party who want much greater clarity elsewhere is that here the new leader has made a serious mistake. The Conservatives will make preservation of the union a central issue in the election campaign. English voters may see devolution in Scotland as the first step towards independence. That could cost Labour precious votes in Tory-held marginals in the Midlands and the north-west. And if Labour won the election, its first administration since 1979 could become bogged down from the outset in a bitter constitutional battle. Dozens of his own MPs might rebel. Those with longer memories than Mr Blair need no reminding that it was a battle over devolution that crippled the last Labour government. Mr Blair defends the commitment, arguing that greater democracy is essential to restore the electorate's faith in Britain's institutions and in its political leaders. The voters may be forgiven for wondering why devolution should take precedence over better health and education services, or action to shorten the dole queues. More generally, Mr Blair insists he is pacing himself ahead of an election that may not take place before mid-1997. His first six months were occupied with setting out the guiding principles for policy. The next few months will be taken up with winning the battle over Clause IV. Then will be the time to start formulating the 'flagship policies' on which Labour will base its programme for government. Mr Blair is fond of reminding those who doubt his determination that, since becoming leader, he has not given in on a single policy issue. He promises a simple statement of values to replace Clause IV which will cement the trust of the electorate in new Labour. He cannot afford to make compromises with his party's traditionalists. Nor can he afford to resist much longer the pressure to produce clear and practical policies to sit alongside the principles.</p>

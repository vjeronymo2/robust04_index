			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Technology: Back in business and up-to-date - Barclays Bank Trust has spent Pounds 32m to cut costs and improve customer services Three years ago, Barclays Bank Trust Company, a unit of Barclays Financial Services, was caught in a vicious spending circle. For every Pounds 100 of revenue, it was spending Pounds 90 on servicing its customers. Greater use of computers in the company would have cut costs, but such investment was not made because its earnings were thought to be too small. But times have changed. This month, the company will start to reap the full benefits of a restructuring programme. Its procedures have been redesigned, its operations centralised and new systems introduced. Now, only Pounds 55 of every Pounds 100 goes on customer servicing. The total cost to the business of this process re-engineering project, codenamed Meridian, was Pounds 32m, of which Pounds 8m went on information technology. Although its procedures were largely paper-based prior to the project, the company scored highly in customer satisfaction surveys. People liked the 'quill pen' image. David Johnson, head of project management services at Barclays Financial Services, part of Barclays Bank, said: 'It wasn't quite copper-plate handwriting, but Dickens would have felt at home there.' However, with the market for trust services (investment management, taxation, executorship and trustee business) becoming more competitive, Barclays had to act to maintain its position. 'Barclays was under pressure to improve efficiency or let building societies, accountants and solicitors cherry pick its most profitable customers,' says Johnson. 'The only way we could continue to offer the same level of customer service at a competitive price was to use IT. So we started looking for opportunities,' he says. The trust company, based in London, had eight branch offices and 22 regional offices, most located near Barclays Bank branches which referred business to them. Barclays Bank Trust realised it could lower costs if it took back-office administration away from these offices and based it in two or three centres. This marked the beginning of Meridian which comprised: redesigning business processes; deciding which jobs would be needed after the reorganisation; automating the redesigned processes; and selecting new locations. Planning took six months. One of the first tasks was to map the steps involved in Barclays Bank Trust's work processes and assess how they could be improved. A system from Digital Equipment called Stars was used to trace information flows. This depicted processes in different colours depending on whether they were paper-based or computerised. It showed the way the business was organised and identified bottlenecks. Based on the redesigned information flows and users' requirements, it was possible to define the number and type of jobs needed after relocation. Barclays Bank Trust then chose suppliers for the IT equipment, which included an investment management system. The company initially ran into problems, however, after spending Pounds 500,000 for a system that it said did not function properly - it is now in litigation. Barclays then chose a proven investment management package, Paladign, from DST/Clarke &amp; Tilley of the US. It has added other features in a bid to gain a competitive advantage. For example, staff can now perform 'what if?' scenarios on customers' share portfolios, to find out the most efficient way of handling their affairs. To the user, the extra features look as if they are part of Paladign because they are available through the same interface - Foss (front-end support system). There are two versions of Foss, one for investment management and one for executorship and trustee (with options for handling property, estate accounts, old master paintings and other types of business). Johnson believes that the combination of choosing a tried-and-tested package and the add-on features has helped the company meet the project's deadline of end-March 1994. 'If we had missed the deadline, a lot of employees who were relocating would have had their lives messed up,' he says. Paladign runs on an IBM AS/400 system based in Poole, Dorset. This sends data to computers in the new back-office centres in Peterborough Business Park (for investment management and taxation) and Northwich near Manchester (for executorship and trustee work). For Barclays Bank Trust clients, centralisation means that instead of calling a regional office they are assigned their own service representatives at the two new centres. If the contact is away, another administrator can call up the relevant details on a computer screen. The main back-office systems are linked electronically to Barclays Stockbrokers (in Glasgow) and to its own London brokers, BZW. So orders to buy or sell shares can be turned round more quickly. Automation has other benefits: Staff can find out the state of a customer's portfolio instantly and calculate capital gains liability quickly when an order to sell is received. Orders to sell shares can be carried out in three or four days instead of up to 14 or 15 and require one piece of paper rather than up to 19. Accuracy should increase because checks are built in to the software to ensure compliance with financial regulations. Sales and customer service in the regional offices could improve because although there are fewer staff (down from an average of 40 per office to an average of 10), they are freed from back-office processing. Administrators can handle 450 clients instead of 200. But for Barclays Bank Trust, the biggest benefit is the sharp improvement in the cost/income ratio. Savings will be made from the closure of eight branch offices and cutting the payroll from 1,200 to 750. Total cost savings have been put at Pounds 12m a year, giving a payback period of around two-and-a-half years.</p>

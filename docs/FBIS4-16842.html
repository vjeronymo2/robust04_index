			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova report: "Poverty Is a Threat to Civil </F> Peace"]    [Text] This warning [reference to headline] has been issued  in the State Duma by representatives of the "Russia's Choice"  and "Yabloko" democratic factions who are members of the  Committee on Labor and Social Support. In their opinion,  poverty in our country is escalating from a social problem into  a political one: The lumpenization of society and the growth in  irritation, dissatisfaction, and wounded dignity in a  considerable section of the population which only recently was  considered perfectly successful in terms of its standard of  living do not lead to democracy but create preconditions for a  new dictatorship.    Duma Deputy Ella Pamfilova, former minister of social  protection of the population, believes that the way out can be  found by creating a long-term federal program to combat poverty.  It must be based on the package of draft laws which specialists  have already worked out: Deputies intend to submit it soon for  examination by the State Duma. The first thing in this package  must be a law on the minimum living wage, which should include  criteria for assessing the standard of living and the minimum  per capita provision, below which the state cannot allow itself  to fall.    Deputy Petr Shchelishch ("Yabloko") is convinced that  poverty  is not only a problem of the poor but a problem of the moral  health of society. Since there are different paths to poverty  (nowadays they depend not only on the person himself), the means  of assisting the individual on the part of the state and society  must also be different: from direct poverty benefits for those  who cannot resolve this problem on their own to the creation of  a system to support those who are in a position to create the  basis of their prosperity by their own efforts (young families,  people who have lost their job, etc.). For this it is necessary  to reorient the state's system of priorities: Expenditure on  "bread and shelter" must be the top priority. Without this it  is impossible to transform society efficiently, since the growth  of the "nouveau pauvre" section narrows the base of economic and  political reforms.    Problems of poverty -- above all, the question of the  minimum  living wage -- will today be the subject of parliamentary  hearings in the State Duma organized on the initiative of the  Committee on Labor and Social Support and of parliament's  democratic factions. In their initiative the deputies of a  democratic orientation proceed from the premise that further  ignoring of social problems discredits not only the authorities  implementing the reform in the country but also the reforms  themselves.</p>

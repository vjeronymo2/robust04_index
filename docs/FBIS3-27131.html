			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xin Huaishi (6580 2037 2514)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 17 Feb (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry  spokesman Wu Jianmin today announced Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's  visit to Japan and Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei's visit to  four African nations, and fielded questions from reporters  concerning Sino-U.S. relations, Sino-Japanese relations, the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea's [DPRK] nuclear issue,  and Li Denghui's [Li Teng-hui] visit to Thailand.    At a press briefing this afternoon, the spokesman announced  that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji will pay an official goodwill visit  to Japan from 23 February to 3 March at the invitation of the  Japanese Government. He said: The main objective of the visit  is to exchange views with Japanese Government leaders and  personages from various circles of life there on the development  of bilateral relations. The visit aims to enhance mutual  understanding, deepen friendship, and promote the further  development of friendship and cooperation between the two  countries in various fields. During his visit to Japan, China  and Japan do not intend to sign any agreement.    The spokesman also announced that Vice Foreign Minister Tian  Zengpei will visit Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Namibia at the  invitation of these three countries' foreign ministries, and  will visit South Africa as a guest of the Center for South  Africa Studies of the Chinese Institute of International Studies  in Pretoria from 20 February to 2 March.    A reporter asked: The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of  the U.S. State Department for fiscal year 1994 has asserted that  on the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations  Act should supersede the Sino-U.S. Joint Communique issued on 17  August 1982. What is your comment on this?    The spokesman said: The essence of the revised Taiwan  Relations Act of the United States is to attempt to overrule the  17 August joint communique between China and the United States  and legalize U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. This is what the  Chinese Government and people stand firmly opposed to. The 17  August joint communique is an international agreement reached  between the two governments of China and the United States,  which the U.S. Government is obligated to strictly abide by in  the principle that international laws prevail over domestic  laws, and to take necessary measures to prevent the U.S.  Congress from making any remarks and taking any actions which  are in violation of this principle with a view to the  maintenance of Sino-U.S. relations.    Another reporter asked: A Japanese magazine has asserted  that China views Japan as a "major enemy in 20 years." Please  comment on this.    The spokesman said: This assertion is untenable and is  designed by a very small number of people to sow discord. It is  the common aspiration of the two peoples to carry on  Sino-Japanese friendly and cooperative relations from generation  to generation, and it is a basic policy of the Chinese  Government to develop friendly relations and cooperation with  Japan in a sustained and stable manner on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence. Long-standing friendship  and cooperation between China and Japan will not only benefit  the two countries, but also contribute to the stability and  prosperity of the region and the world at large.    A reporter asked the spokesman to comment on a report that  the DPRK has agreed to inspection of its nuclear facilities by  the International Atomic Energy Agency.    The spokesman said: "We welcome this development, which has  again shown that dialogue is the only correct way for solving  the DPRK's nuclear issue. We hope that the parties directly  concerned will continue to adopt a positive and constructive  attitude and seek an appropriate solution to this issue at an  early date through dialogue and consultation."    In response to a question about Li Denghui's visit to  Thailand, the spokesman said: "The Chinese Foreign Ministry has  made representations with Thailand and elucidated the solemn  position of China on this matter."</p>

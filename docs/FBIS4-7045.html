			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Comrade Hong Song-nam delivered a report to the  national meeting of functionaries of the coal industry. The  speaker stated that the national meeting of functionaries of the  coal industry began at an exciting time when all party members  and workers were accelerating an all-out march to implement the  party's revolutionary strategies in hearty response to the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address for this year  and the decision of the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party  Central Committee. He mentioned that the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il, who had always paid deep attention to the  development of the coal industry, expressed his confidence and  love by convening this meeting and sending a congratulatory  message signed by the party Central Committee to the meeting.    The speaker stressed that the history of our country's  socialist economic construction, which had been carried out  along the single road of self-reliance under the banner of the  chuche idea, started with the work of developing the coal  industry in the country and that it was a proud history of  victory and based on the achievements from this work we expanded  the scale of the people's economy, improved the structure of the  branches [pumungujo] of the people's economy, and built a  powerful self-reliant national economy in which coal is used as  a fuel and resource and a source of power.    He also said that when he was leading the work of building a  new fatherland after the liberation, the great leader described  the coal industry as a leading sector of the people's economy  and presented a creative idea of developing this industry ahead  of other sectors. [passage omitted]    The speaker also said that no force can stop our people who,  filled with confidence and optimism, were marching along the  single road of chuche while upholding the great leader and the  dear comrade leader on the vanguard of the revolution. He  stressed a need for all to achieve single-hearted unity around  the party and the leader [suryong], bring new turns in coal  production, and, thus, contribute to defending and maintaining  socialism of our own style and further glorifying it.    The meeting hall was filled with the participants' resolve  to  thoroughly implement the tasks presented by the great leader's  New Year's address for this year and the congratulatory message  of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee and, thus,  repay the party's trust and expectations with loyal deeds.  Then, a congratulatory group of the Korean Children's Union  came into the meeting hall and read a congratulatory message.    Following this, debates took place at the meeting. [passage  omitted]</p>

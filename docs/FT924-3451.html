			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television BBC radio looks interesting in the first half of the evening. Partners In Crime (7.20 Radio 4) is a 'File On 4' special about the Mafia which, it is said, controls 4m votes and dozens of MPs. Gerry Northam investigates the links between organised crime in Italy and the legal and political systems. Radio 2 offers Imagine John Lennon Was Dead, (9.00) which seeks to establish why David Chapman, a Beatles fan, wanted to kill Lennon. In Troubleshooter 2 (9.50 BBC2) Sir John Harvey-Jones considers Charles Letts, the company which published the world's first diary in 1812. Six generations later, the business is still a family firm. BBC1 shows the concluding part of its Omnibus profile of Western director John Ford (10.25), and BBC2 shows the second episode in its repeat run of Peter Watkins' remarkable portrait of the painter Edvard Munch (11.20). BBC1 has the original (1933) and much copied but never surpassed Hollywood version of King Kong with Fay Wray as the screaming heroine in the paw of the giant ape. Technical innovations for this film include large scale rear projection and the optical printer, to combine special effects and live action. (11.15).</p>

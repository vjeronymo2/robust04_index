			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Non-Stop Around the Clock" </F> column: "Rutskoy Faces a Poor Outlook in Israel"]    [Text] Recently a theoretical conference was organized at  the Central Travelers House entitled "The Ideology of State  Patriotism and the Struggle Against International Zionism."    The conference was initiated by the State Party [Derzhavnaya  Partiya] led by Terekhov, the Communist Party of Russia, the  Officers Union, and the Public Committee for Legality and  People's Power. Apart from politicians, the `struggle' class  was attended by AL-QUDS publisher Sha'ban, who rented the  Central Travelers House. Various points of view were aired at  the meeting but Dr. Sha'ban left everybody else behind. He  stated that he had personally recruited Russian guys to send to  Israel on a reconnaissance mission. And now he has  incontestable evidence that in the south of Israel there are  secret bases with chemical and bacteriological weapons.  Allegedly, tests on humans are also conducted there. Another  speaker explained to the audience that Rutskoy's mother is  Jewish. In Israel, therefore, he would never be elected even to  a lousy municipality, let alone the vice presidency.    Officers Union leader Stanislav Terekhov explained to  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS's correspondent that the aim of the  conference is to work out a political course and an ideological  program for the State Party. Terekhov does not intend to  affiliate with Rutskoy's State [Derzhava] political movement.  His decision is final and irrevocable.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIANS HOPE TO SWAY BUSH ON CUTS IN FEDERAL BUDGET  </P> <P> California congressmen and lobbyists on Tuesday asked President-elect Bush to  modify President Reagan's final budget, which they protested would slash  federal funds for numerous programs in the state, ranging from mass transit to  reparations for Japanese-Americans.  </P> <P> "California would lose critical monies, as would all other states," Rep. Don  Edwards (D-San Jose), chairman of the state's Democratic congressional  delegation, said in releasing a lengthy analysis of the budget's impact on  California programs.  </P> <P> Under Reagan's proposals, Los Angeles' fledgling Metrorail project would suffer  a possibly fatal $100-million cut in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1,  receiving only about $45 million to continue construction.  </P> <P> At the same time, Blythe, Merced and Crescent City probably would lose all  airline service under a plan to eliminate federal subsidies for flights to  small towns. And San Diego would take a particularly big hit if, as proposed,  California loses all $4.5 million in federal "impact aid" for cities that have  large military populations.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another Reagan proposal would make some of the 60,000 aging  Japanese-Americans, most of them Californians, wait as much as 60 years to  receive full reparations because of their internment in camps during World War  II. A law passed last year called for completing the $20,000 payments within 10  years, sponsors noted in denouncing the Reagan plan as "woefully inadequate,"  but at the rate proposed in the Administration budget it would take six times  as long to complete the payments.  </P> <P> Not all of the Reagan budget was bad news for the state, however. For example,  the University of California said that it would benefit from large proposed  increases for AIDS research and for Pell grants to low-income students.  </P> <P> Reviewing a string of proposed cuts, newly installed House Budget Committee  Chairman Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) declared that Reagan's spending plan  "continues to unravel the social safety net. . . . It is my hope that Mr. Bush  will come to Congress soon with specific proposals to reduce the deficit in a  fair, realistic way while addressing the critical priorities, such as child  care, Head Start and the environment, which he mentioned in his campaign."  </P> <P> While Bush may make some modifications, he is expected to follow Reagan's  general outlines when he presents his own budget proposals in coming weeks.  However, lobbyists for various California interests expressed hope that Bush  would show flexibility if the Democratic-run Congress moves, as it has in the  past, to reject many of Reagan's proposed trims.  </P> <P> "We are anxiously awaiting the release of President-elect Bush's spending  priorities in the hope that he will live up to his promise to become 'the  education President,' " said Jenifer Hartog, a Washington lobbyist for the  California Department of Education.  </P> <P> While the state's Democratic congressmen blasted the Reagan blueprint,  Republicans generally held their fire.  </P> <P> Sidestepping comment on how the plan would affect California, House Budget  Committee member William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield) said that "the Democrats  were never going to say they liked Ronald Reagan's last budget. What they'd  like to see is a Bush budget they can use as an opportunity to promote their  idea for a tax increase, which I oppose. The fact is the responsibility for  putting together the federal budget is now the Democrats'."  </P> <P> Identifying cuts that would hit California hard, California Democrats  complained in a statement that the Reagan budget "eliminates or phases out the  Coastal Zone Management program and sewage treatment grants. It decreases or  eliminates support to low-income families for energy assistance, job-training,  the Nutrition Education and Training Program, community service block grants  and urban development action grants. It significantly reduces federal  responsibility for refugees. . . . "  </P> <P> Transportation programs would take a number of blows. Besides cutbacks for  Metrorail and small-town airports, money for Amtrak would be eliminated,  particularly affecting the popular line between Los Angeles and San Diego.  </P> <P> "Metrorail is not getting excited," said James F. Seeley, a lobbyist for the  city of Los Angeles. "These proposals are pretty much retreads, which Congress  has never gone for."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Causing Concern  </P> <P> UC lobbyist James Savage said the proposed AIDS research hike, while welcomed  by some researchers, is causing concern that it will drain money from other  biomedical projects.  </P> <P> The proposed boost in NASA research would be a boon to the state's aerospace  industry, he noted.  </P> <P> Savage said that proposed Medicaid and Medicare cuts would be "particularly  burdensome" on five hospitals operated by UC because "we pick up the cost of  indigent care that other hospitals don't do."  </P> <P> He also contended that a proposed funding freeze for UC's agriculture extension  programs would hurt farmers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attacks Contract  </P> <P> In another development affecting the state, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez)  called on Bush to reverse a recent Interior Department decision to renew a  40-year California water contract that he said "ignores important environmental  and fiscal considerations."  </P> <P> Miller, a prominent critic of large federal irrigation subsidies to farms,  cities and industries, attacked the contract signed with the Friant Unit of the  Central Valley Project, which consists of 28 water districts and  municipalities.  </P> <P> "Simple renewal of the contract ignores the potential for water conservation  and would have a negative impact" on water quality in the San Francisco Bay  delta, he said.  </P></p>

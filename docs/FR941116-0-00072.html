			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission concludes that there is no need to adopt generic rules about constraints on the level or duration of market-based prices. This is a matter to be considered in individual cases in light of the circumstances there. The Commission does not consider the market-based rate approach for oil pipelines generically as experimental or in need of a trial or in need of generic safeguards, such as rate triggers. All such issues can be discussed in the context of an individual case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will be able to adequately monitor market-based rates through price changes because the oil pipeline must file its rates. In addition, the Commission can monitor the oil pipeline's aggregate earnings through its Form No. 6 filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. The Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is amending subchapter P of its regulations, Regulations Under the Interstate Commerce Act, by adding a new Part 348 to those regulations. Section 348.1(a) requires an oil pipeline to file a statement of position and supporting statements with its application. Section 348.1(b) provides that an oil pipeline's statement of position must include an executive summary of its statement of position and a statement of material facts. The latter must include citation to the supporting statements, exhibits, affidavits, and prepared testimony. In its statement of position, the oil pipeline would be expected to present its arguments in favor of its position that it lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. The Commission received no comments about the specifics of Sections 348.1(a) and (b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The argument that it is unfair to require the oil pipeline applicant to file a case-in-chief at the outset was discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 348.1(a) requires that an oil pipeline seeking a market power determination include with its application the information required by section 348.1(c). Under section 348.1(c) the oil pipeline must include certain designated information. The information required is mostly factual and is relevant to measuring the oil pipeline's ability to exercise market power in the relevant markets. That measurement will enable the Commission to determine whether the oil pipeline can exercise significant market power by profitably maintaining its prices significantly above competitive levels for a significant period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is requiring the oil pipelines to essentially file the same information as the Commission has analyzed in the past in oil pipeline proceedings with respect to market power determinations. In brief, the Commission is first requiring the oil pipeline to define the relevant markets to be analyzed. It must identify the geographic areas and the products to be analyzed to establish the relevant markets for which to determine market power. For example, the inquiry might be, does the oil pipeline possess significant market power over the transportation of crude oil into the Houston area? Further, the Commission is requiring the oil pipeline to identify the competitive transportation alternatives for its shippers, including potential competition, and other competition constraining its rates. Finally, the oil pipeline must compute the market concentration for the relevant markets (the HHI) and other market power measures based on the information provided about competition. The Commission will be able to analyze the oil pipeline's information and its measures of market concentration and power to determine if the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a record about a market has been established in an oil pipeline proceeding, another oil pipeline may make use of all or part of that record in satisfying its burden to present information to the extent the other record contains relevant public information which is not out-of-date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission turns to the specific supporting statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

Statement A_Geographic Market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Statement A, the Commission is requiring that the oil pipeline describe the geographic markets in which it seeks to make a showing that it lacks significant market power. The oil pipeline must explain why its method for selecting the geographic markets is appropriate. The Commission also is requiring the oil pipeline to include both relevant origin and destination markets in its evidentiary presentation. This will provide interested parties with complete information about competition at the supply and delivery ends of the pipeline system. The Commission is not requiring the oil pipeline to file a market analysis of each point-to-point corridor. The Commission concludes that, in light of the significant point-to-point traffic in the oil pipeline industry, this would be too onerous a requirement at the filing stage, that a point-to-point corridor analysis may exclude competitive alternatives to the relevant service and, in some instances, it could provide an inaccurate picture of market concentration. However, a protestant may, as part of its response to the oil pipeline's application, seek to prove that in the particular circumstances a point-to-point corridor approach should be used to determine the appropriate geographic market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is not requiring an oil pipeline to file pursuant to any particular geographic market definition. But the Commission expects that oil pipelines will propose to use BEAs as their geographic markets. In that event, the burden will be on the oil pipeline to explain why its use of BEAs or any other definition of the geographic market is appropriate. If a pipeline uses BEAs, it must show that each BEA represents an appropriate geographic market. Of course, the oil pipeline may choose to define its relevant geographic markets at a sub-BEA level, such as by a given radius around its terminals. As with BEAs, the oil pipeline must explain why this geographic market definition is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AOPL, ARCO, and Marathon maintain that the Commission should establish BEAs ``as the generally applicable means for determining relevant geographic markets'' or ``[a]lternatively the `explanation' that use of BEAs to define relevant geographic markets complies with Commission precedent should satisfy a pipeline's obligation to explain its chosen approach.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The AOPL refers to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Buckeye  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Williams  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as such precedents employing BEAs to define relevant geographic markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AOPL's comments at 41.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

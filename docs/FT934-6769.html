			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hoogovens plans Fl 373.5m share issue Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, is to bolster its balance sheet through a Fl 373.5m (Dollars 196.5m) issue of new shares, expanding the loss-making company's capital base by 37 per cent. The transaction involves a series of offers to Dutch and foreign institutions, retail investors and the Dutch state, which will take up nearly a third of the new shares. After the offers, lead-managed by ABN Amro and SG Warburg Securities, the state's stake will rise to around 17.1 per cent from 12.3 per cent. However, Mr Maarten van Veen, chairman, said this will bring ownership of Hoogovens by public authorities back to the level that prevailed until July, when the City of Amsterdam sold off its 5 per cent stake to domestic and foreign institutional investors.</p>

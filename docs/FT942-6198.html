			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Beckett attacks government's 'sweatshop' policy Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour leader, yesterday accused the government of seeking to turn Britain into the 'sweatshop of the world' as the focus of the European election campaign shifted to economic policy. Leading Labour politicians gave an enthusiastic, if qualified, reception to a report from the party's Social Justice Commission urging a 'Citizens' Service' programme to tackle youth unemployment. Mr Tony Blair, front-runner in the race for the Labour leadership, said the proposal to take unemployed people aged between 16 and 24 off the dole through paid but voluntary service schemes marked an 'excellent' contribution to his party's policymaking. His enthusiasm was echoed by several members of Labour's shadow cabinet, with Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, suggesting that up to 750,000 young people could benefit. The Liberal Democrats welcomed the proposal as 'a shift to our ground'. But Mr Malcolm Bruce, their trade and industry spokesman, warned that without a strong commitment to education or training, the scheme would merely 'plaster over the cracks'. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, rejected the idea and accused Labour of promot-ing a dependency culture. Mr Hunt, stressing the government's commitment to high-quality education and training, said: 'I don't want 16 and 17-year-olds going straight from school on to social security or weeding grass verges.' Mr Hunt was forced to acknowledge that nearly 80,000 school-leavers aged between 16 and 17 fall through the government's training and social security safety nets. This group - at the centre of the recent political row about begging on the streets - are denied benefit because they do not take up training places. His comments came as Mr John Major launched a Conservative defence of the government's decision to opt out of the European Union's social chapter. He said that Britain's lower social costs were a vital ingredient in its strong record of job creation over the past year and cited widespread support from business for the opt-out. Mrs Beckett used a keynote speech to attack the government's approach. She said the Tory future for Britain was a 'low-wage, low-skill economy where pay and living standards are driven down'. She said the first act of a Labour government would be to sign the social chapter in a commitment to high wages, high skills and job creation. Tec funding, Page 13</p>

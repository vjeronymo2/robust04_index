The new concept is aimed at enlarging Latvia's contacts with  the European Union, the West European Union and NATO, said  committee head Alexander Kirsteins.    Latvia should prepare a free trade treaty with the European  Union and to join the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly  as an associated member, Kirsteins said, commenting on the most  urgent diplomatic tasks.    Goodneighborly relations with Russia is another mainstream  of  Latvia's political activities.    Russia, as the legal heir of the collapsed Soviet Union,  should recognize that Latvia was forcefully incorporated into  the Soviet Union in 1940. This recognition could be regarded as  a landmark for building better relations between the two  countries, said Kirsteins.    Latvia must soon adopt a citizenship law and a document  regulating the rights of non-citizens, Kirsteins noted.    Kirsteins also praised President Boris Yeltsin's initiative  to draft a uniform human rights convention to ensure mutual  guarantees in the field of human rights preservation in Latvia  and Russia.    The Latvian prime minister plans to address a Saeima plenary  session with a more detailed version of his security report.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sedgwick advances to Pounds 63m - European and North American operations fuel first-half growth Buoyed by growth in its European and North American retail operations, Sedgwick, the insurance broker, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 63.4m for the first six months of 1994, compared with a restated Pounds 55.8m last time. The result was at the top end of market expectations, but was greeted without enthusiasm by investors, with the shares closing unchanged at 169p. Analysts were disappointed by a 4 per cent underlying decline in revenues at Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy acquired last year, as well as continued softness in the US insurance market from where the group obtains more than 30 per cent of its revenues. The interim dividend is held at 3p, while earnings per share were 7.3p (restated 7.6p). Brokerage and fee growth was particularly buoyant in retail operations, with growth exceeding 5 per cent in all geographical areas. However, the wholesale and specialist broking operations were affected by difficult trading conditions in the London market. On an underlying basis, excluding acquisitions, brokerage and fees increased by 2 per cent to Pounds 457.1m, compared with an underlying increase of 1 per cent in expenses to Pounds 409.2m. Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said that the results were 'in line with our plans. Revenue generation, together with tight expense control, continues to be our major objective.' Interest and investment income fell by 13 per cent in underlying terms to Pounds 20.1m, partially reflecting lower interest rates in the UK and continental Europe. Sedgwick also announced that together with Transamerica Corporation, with whom it shares ownership of River Thames Insurance, it is injecting Pounds 25m cash into the subsidiary. This brings the total capitalisation of River Thames, in which Sedgwick owns a 49 per cent stake, to over Pounds 50m. It will allow the company, which specialises in London market business, to take advantage of 'improved underwriting opportunities'. Sedgwick also intends to increase its stakes in two small overseas subsidiaries, Sedgwick Overseas Investment in Bermuda and Sedgwick Insurance Brokers in Botswana, from 50 per cent to 100 per cent and from 70 per cent to 95 per cent respectively. COMMENT Sedgwick's management seems to be doing the right things. Margins have been squeezed through tight expense control and the acquisition last year of Noble Lowndes makes sense from a strategic perspective, diversifying the group's revenue base and making it less dependent on sometimes volatile commission income. However, despite encouraging growth in retail insurance business, many of its markets are low growth. Nor does the US market provide much encouragement, with insurance rates disappointingly flat. The current weakness in the dollar is another unfavourable factor and Sedgwick could also find the going tough in the London market. Full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 95m for 1994 should be possible, giving earnings of about 10.7p and a prospective multiple of 15.8. But at the present price the shares appear to be fully valued.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Steetley attacks Redland in final missive to holders STEETLEY yesterday made a final appeal to shareholders to reject a Pounds 600m bid from Redland, its rival building materials group. Redland's increased offer of 87 shares for every 100 Steetley shares is due to close at 1pm next Thursday A cash alternative is pitched at 365p per share. Steetley, in a document sent yesterday to its shareholders, said that the offer was worth only approximately 11 times 1990 earnings. This was a fairer measure of the company's performance than 1991 earnings which had been hit by one of the worst downturns in UK construction for half a century. The offer was equivalent to an exit multiple of only 12 times average earnings of the last five years, according to Mr David Donne, Steetley's chairman. He said in a letter to shareholders: 'Redland is trying to buy your company in the trough of recession at a price which undervalues Steetley and ignores its recovery prospects.' The group estimates that about 18 institutions control about 55 per cent of its shares. It argues that Redland is trying to pick up, on the cheap, its strong market positions in French aggregates, British bricks and in aggregate and ready-mix concrete in the Madrid area. It says that its markets are poised to recover in the UK, where it has made substantial cost savings reducing its labour force by about 19 per cent since 1989. Brick sales In North America are expected to rise by about 18 per cent this year. Mr Robert Napier, Redland chairman, said Steetley's defence showed 'impudent optimism about future recovery'. 'Steetley is offering unrealistic hopes for UK recovery, delayed cost cutting and speculative future land-fill profits' he said. Redland's offer would provide Steetley shareholders with immediate capital and income uplifts, Mr Napier added.</p>

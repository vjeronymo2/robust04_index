			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Haden MacLellan gains from accounting changes HADEN MACLELLAN Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, said yesterday that new accounting rules were largely responsible for a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.3m for the year to December 31. The group, which reorganised its management last year following losses on its US operations, said operating profits - Pounds 7.4m, against Pounds 15.4m - were a better performance indicator. Operating losses on US operations fell to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.6m). The final dividend is being cut to 1p (5p) making a 2p (8p) total. Earnings per share emerged at 2.6p against restated losses of 1.1p. Group turnover from continuing activities declined from Pounds 319.9m to Pounds 276m. Operating profits on property and discontinued operations more than halved to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 15m). On process engineering and services they declined to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 8.1m) and on manufacturing and distribution they fell to Pounds 4m (Pounds 5.5m). The group adopted FRS 3, the new accounting standard, which means one-off gains and losses will normally be reflected in pre-tax profits. Under this formula figures for 1991 have been restated to take account of an Pounds 11.4m charge, including Pounds 8m in re-stated goodwill.</p>

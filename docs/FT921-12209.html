			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Chinese trade increases by 17.5% China's foreign trade in 1991 soared 17.5 per cent to Dollars 135.7bn (Pounds 74.9bn), the Chinese government announced yesterday, Kyodo reports from Beijing. The country's balance of trade in the year posted a surplus of Dollars 8.12bn with Dollars 71.91bn in exports against Dollars 63.79bn in imports. Exports were up 15.8 per cent and imports 19.5 per cent from the previous year. Beijing attributed the good showing mainly to last year's abolition of export subsidies aimed at making Chinese enterprises more competitive, and to the west's lifting of economic sanctions and the virtual ending of a strict domestic economic policy that brought on appreciable growth in imports. Hong Kong was China's top trade partner with Dollars 49.6bn while Japan was second with Dollars 20.3bn. Third was the US at Dollars 14.1bn and South Korea was fourth at Dollars 3.3bn.</p>

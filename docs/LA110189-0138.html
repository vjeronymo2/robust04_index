Donald Vine.  </P> <P> The driver, whose name was not immediately available, "wasn't really paying  attention and crashed into three parked cars," said Sheriff's Deputy Rick  McClung. At least two of the cars were demolished, and the bus caught fire. The  bus was southbound on Vermont Avenue, about 15 miles south of Los Angeles, when  the accident occurred shortly before 8 a.m.  </P></p>

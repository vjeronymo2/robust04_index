			<p>BFN     [Text] The Patent Office has begun to study revision of  the Patent Law to enable foreign individuals and corporations to  present their patent applications in English. So far, patent  applications have been allowed to be made only in Japanese.  This will make the expedited review of patent applications for  technology from overseas applicants possible.    The patents issue is an important item on the agenda of the  Japan-U.S. economic consultations, and the United States insists  that the requirement for applying in Japanese only has worked as  a trade barrier. The Patent Office has come to believe the  revision will lead to growth of not only applications from the  United States, but also of such English-speaking regions as  Europe and Oceania. The office plans to present the revision  bill to the Diet's extraordinary session in the Fall for  enactment from July 1995.    The current Patent Law does not accept applications in  English, which means overseas inventors can submit their  applications only after translating the contents of the invented  technology into Japanese. Moreover, at present, correction of  submitted translations is not allowed in principle.    Sometimes problems occur of misinterpretation as a result of  hasty translation done in order to submit applications as  quickly as possible and of inventors failing to get patents  approved as a result of this. For instance, when a U.S. company  applied for a patent on the technology of junctioning nickel  alloys, boron [hoso] was mistranslated as shuso [bromine], and  the company was unable to win the patent even though it brought  the matter to the Tokyo Appellate Court for review.    Under the revised law, the foreign applicants: 1) Will be  allowed to submit their patent applications in English on the  condition that Japanese translations will be submitted within  two months after submission of applications; and 2) will be  allowed to make corrections on mistranslations, if any, within  three months of the Patent Office announcement of "not approving  a patent" at the end of a review period.    Japan receives about 34,000 patent applications from foreign  nationals each year, and the number is close to 10 percent of  the total 370,000 applications received nationally. As for  types of inventions applied for, those which compete with  Japanese-pioneered technologies such as semiconductors are  growing. As such, the merits of making quick applications in  English without taking the time to translate them into Japanese  will be substantial. The Patent Office said: "This means  setting up a system wherein patent approval review will be done  on terms equal to those for Japanese inventions. It should  contribute to alleviating the trade surplus which the United  States charges is unfair.    In January 1994, the Japanese and U.S. Governments agreed to  revise the Patent Laws of the two nations in part toward the  goal of unifying their patent systems, and this revision of the  law will be the first action taken under the agreement. The  next step Japan wants to take is to ask the United States to  change its current system of basing its patent rights on who  "first invented" to one used by Japan and Europe of basing it on  who "first applied."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wang Nan: "U.S., Japan Seek Partial Trade </F> Accords"]    [Text] Washington, June 7 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. and Japan,  after another a year of wrangling over Washington's widening  trade gap with Tokyo, appeared ready to settle for partial and  less ambitious trade agreements.    The agreements, according to observers here, are expected to  be sealed in the areas of insurance and government procurement,  including telecommunications and medical equipment, in as soon  as a month.    Although they will do little to reverse the increasing U.S.  wealth flow to Japan, the agreements will surely be greeted with  relief by the group of seven leaders at their July meeting in  Naples, Italy.    This is despite the fact that no progress has been seen in  the areas of auto and auto parts, which represent two thirds of  the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, totaling 60 billion U.S.  dollars last year.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Undersecretary  of  Commerce Jeffrey Garten, speaking on Monday [6 June]  respectively in Paris and Tokyo, stressed that Washington was  ready for "realistic" trade agreements with Tokyo.    The U.S.-Japan trade framework talks, which began in July,  collapsed on February 11, when President Clinton, in his meeting  with then Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, refused to accept  partial agreements.    At that time, sources said, agreements on insurance and  telecommunications and medical equipment were already within  reach, despite the stalemate in auto and auto parts.    Soon after the failure, to the dismay of the recovering U.S.  economy, came turmoil in the U.S. currency and bond markets,  with the rise of U.S. dollar against Japanese yen and the  climbing of interest rates.    In Japan, support for the government's refusal to back up  and  to say "no" to Washington, for the first time in history as some  reports said, remained strong among the Japanese public and in  business circles.    To the other parts of Asia and the European Union, which  have  their own trade disputes with the U.S., Washington's tough stand  with Japan has been viewed negatively.    Inside the beltway, some of the Clinton advisers stressed  that the country should not let its trade disputes dominate its  economic relations with Japan, viewed as Washington's most  important tie in the post-Cold War era.    Instead, they said, Washington should try its utmost to make  Japan cut taxes and stimulate domestic consumption, and  therefore increase general imports.    In a compromise with Japan late May, Washington gave up its  insistence on using "numerical targets" to measure Japan's  market opening progress, and stressed that it never intended to  control trade.    "We are not going to wait to open up everything until we  make  deals in all sectors," Mickey Kantor told reporters on Monday.  "If you are ready to reach agreement on a particular sector, you  should go ahead and finalize that."    In Tokyo, Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten,  speaking  to reporters, cited "considerable hope" in the talks in the  areas of telecommunications, saying that solid progress has been  made over the weekend.</p>

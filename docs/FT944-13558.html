			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: Green groups hail hope of victory The report was enthusiastically welcomed by environmental groups, which saw it as potentially a breakthrough in their campaign for greener transport policies. Greenpeace described it as 'a watershed in the battle against subsidised pollution', and the Council for the Protection of Rural England said the report showed 'vision'. The report was also welcomed by campaigners for cleaner air and a reduction in asthma, now widely linked to transport pollution. After some notorious battles over new road schemes, the report's emphasis on the 'best practicable environmental option' will encourage green groups to take a more aggressive stance on future plans. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said that 160 sites of special scientific interest were directly at risk from the roads programme, and that wildlife was suffering from polluting emissions. The environmental lobby will be pressing for action to curb the roads programme; greater taxation to make road transport bear the full costs of the environmental damage it causes; and promotion of alternative means of transport, including new technology; and better facilities for cyclists and pedestrians.</p>

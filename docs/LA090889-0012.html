			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UNUSUALLY COOL SUMMER SLIDING INTO AUTUMN  </P> <P> Cool and crisp conditions, unusual for San Diego in September, will prevail  through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.  </P> <P> Sun seekers need not worry, however, as days will become "pretty perfect" after  the night-and-morning low clouds burn off, said forecaster Wilbur Shigehara.  Temperatures and humidity levels slightly below the seasonal norm are turning  peoples' thoughts to autumn, he said.  </P> <P> "This is the second to the last week of summer, and I'm talking to people who  are already planning their fall crops," Shigehara said. "We have all these low  pressures hanging around, making the weather what you might call perfect, but  it's still unusual for summer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cool Summers Continue  </P> <P> "Actually, this is the fourth year in a row we've had rather cool summers,"  Shigehara said. "This year, we were more than a whole degree below the norm for  all of August . . . We just had a couple of warm spurts here and there."  </P> <P> The recent low-pressure system originated in Canada and stalled over Southern  California Wednesday, bringing down the 80-degree-plus weather of the Labor Day  weekend sharply, Shigehara said. Also, as a result of this weather pattern,  only minor temperature fluctuations are expected through the middle of next  week, he said.  </P> <P> Beach highs through the weekend will be 67 to 71, Shigehara said. The water  temperature at Mission Beach is 61, and the surf is 2 feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low Clouds Expected  </P> <P> This broad low pressure trough is also responsible for the increase in  night-and-morning low clouds along the coast, but afternoons should be pleasant  and sunny, Shigehara said. Coastal highs are expected to range from 73 to 78  through Sunday, and overnight lows in the mid-60s.  </P> <P> Inland highs will hover in the low-80s. Lows will be from 55 to 62 tonight and  Saturday, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> There will be some gusty afternoon and evening winds in the mountains, whipping  up to 25 m.p.h. in places, but plenty of sunshine and clear nights are forecast  through Sunday. Highs will range from 76 to 82 degrees and overnight lows will  dip into the 40s.  </P> <P> Desert highs will be between 100 and 105. Lows will be in the mid-70s.  </P></p>

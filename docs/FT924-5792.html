			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Links with unions face fresh scrutiny PRESSURE is mounting from Labour's so-called 'moderniser' faction for wide-ranging revisions to an internal working party's proposals on how to update its traditional links with the unions. Leaked copies of the committee's outline final report reveal that it has stopped short of approving a one-member, one-vote system for the selection of MPs in spite of firm backing for the reform from Mr John Smith, the party leader. Instead, the committee is looking at creating a form of associate membership for union members who pay the political levy and also express support for Labour. These would carry voting rights. Advocates of such a change argue that it will maintain the broad base of the party among ordinary people and dilute the impact of activists, who are often unrepresentative of wider public opinion. They also claim it could lay the foundations for the creation of a mass party as associates are persuaded to upgrade to full membership. Opponents of the scheme say it is bureaucratic, costly, creates a divisive dual-status membership structure and might possibly be open to manipulation by undemocratic elements within the unions. They also point out that it might offer the Conservative government a pretext to change the law to insist that unionists opt in to paying the political levy rather than opt out of paying it - potentially crippling Labour's income. One member of the NEC said yesterday that the plan would be 'disastrous' in terms of presentation and was substantially worse than existing arrangements.</p>

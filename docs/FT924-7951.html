			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Hope for co-op boost to market - Housing HOUSING associations will be able to take at least 16,000 houses off the market, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said yesterday. In a statement, he said Pounds 580m of new money would be made available in 1992/93 to enable housing associations to purchase new, empty or repossessed homes to use for families in housing need. Taken together with the private loans which will support these purchases the total package of spending is expected to approach Pounds 1bn. The programme would be run by the Housing Corporation. He added: 'In addition Pounds 50m will be available this year in grants to help tenants of housing associations and local authorities to buy and move into homes in the private sector. This means that up to 3,500 first-time buyers will enter the housing market. Their homes will then become available for people in housing need. This new injection of capital funds will enable housing associations to take at least 16,000 houses off the market and, with the properties freed up by those taking advantage of grants to buy new homes, this will provide nearly 20,000 additional homes for social renting. This will generate an immediate and substantial boost to the housing market as well as bringing help to people in need of social housing, including those currently in bed and breakfast accommodation. It increases the total capital resources being spent through the Housing Corporation this year from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 2.3bn. Our existing programme of grants to help tenants into owner occupation has been very successful. Some 15,000 households have already taken advantage of these grants to move out of renting and to own the home of their choice. I hope that local authority and housing association tenants up and down the country who could afford to move into owner occupation will consider this an excellent opportunity to consider buying a home of their own now, without having to wait until they have saved the necessary deposit.' The Department of the Environment said Pounds 577m would be made available through the Housing Corporation for housing associations to buy 'off the shelf' new, repossessed and vacant properties in this financial year, for use to meet local housing needs. The funds will be channelled through a limited number of housing associations by the Housing Corporation to ensure that maximum value for money is achieved. The package is expected to deliver a higher leverage of private finance with lower rates of grant than the normal corporation programme.</p>

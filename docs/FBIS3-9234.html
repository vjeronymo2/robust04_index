According to a decision of the Serbian leaders of the  Prishtina commune, 50 construction sites will be given to  Serbians who will be settled in Kosova. The sites are located  in the "Dragogan" Quarter in Prishtina. The place is sufficient  to provide residence for 15,000 inhabitants, that is the same  number of Serbians are expected to live in this area.    In this context, 150 houses are foreseen to be constructed  near the Technical Faculty while 100 construction sites will be  granted at the "Tasligje" Quarter. All the sites will be given  to Serbians free of charge. The sale of the construction sites  is prohibited, leaving no possibilities for the Albanians to buy  them.    Such undertakings of colonization have existed before in  Kosova and will also continue in the future in other Kosova  zones.</p>

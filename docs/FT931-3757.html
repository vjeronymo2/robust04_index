If you are one of these, you may welcome a booklet published by Council Tax Services, which is a guide to the appeal procedure. It gives advice on how to prepare an appeal and details of the relevant law. Seven Points Publications has prepared a questionnaire for those who suspect they are in the wrong valuation band or want to know if they are eligible for relief. It will use the results to assess whether you have grounds for a case and what action you could take.

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Search begins for Italy's 51st postwar government ITALY'S 11th postwar parliament is due to open tomorrow, paving the way for formal talks on the creation of a new government. The political parties have so far made virtually no progress towards forming a government since the April 5 general elections, confining themselves to a ritualistic statement of positions. The first item on the agenda of the new parliament will be the election of leaders of the 630-seat chamber of deputies and the 315-seat senate. On Friday Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing prime minister, is due to submit his resignation. Parliamentary groups will then be formed, opening up formal consultations on a new government, which will be the 51st since the war  - though this is only the 11th parliament, because the frequent changes of government have not often necessitated fresh general elections. The most significant development has been the way in which the Christian Democrats have decided to close ranks after their vote fell below 30 per cent for the first time. Last week a special two-day congress rejected the resignation of Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the party secretary-general, which he tendered after the elections. By maintaining Mr Forlani in his post, which he is due to leave in the autumn, the Christian Democrat leadership indicated it was not prepared to contemplate a radical shake-up at this stage. This was despite calls from younger members for the ageing leadership to step down in recognition of the large protest vote directed against the long-ruling Christian Democrats. The Christian Democrats remain confident that as the country's largest party they will be the centre of any new government. They are also counting on the support of the Socialists and their other two minority party allies, the Liberals and the Social Democrats. Although this four-party coalition has a a majority in the chamber of deputies, it lacks the political credibility to act as a government to carry out the necessary institutional reforms and tough economic measures. This is why the Socialists have made tentative overtures to the former communists, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), who with 16 per cent of the vote are the second largest party. The latter are aware their participation in a government would provide the necessary credibility and cross-party support for reform. However, the PDS is playing hard-to-get and wants to make the point that the rules of the game have changed. President Francesco Cossiga has been carrying out preliminary consultations and over the weekend backed the idea of a government of 'technicians' - a proposal put forward by Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small centre-left Republican party. However, Mr Cossiga is profoundly mistrusted by most of the parties, and few would want to let him claim the kudos for knocking heads together to form a government. The choice of leaders of the two houses is important: these are prestigious posts, and the parties' behaviour in the nominations could indicate their attitude towards future government alliances. The easiest option would be to reconfirm Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the republican leader of the chamber, and Ms Nilde Iotte, the PDS leader of the Senate.</p>

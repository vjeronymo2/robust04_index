			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Arts: Handel's Messiah - Concert Exactly 250 years ago last Tuesday - March 23 1743 - Handel's Messiah had its British premiere, in the first Theatre Royal on the Covent Garden site. Naturally enough, the Royal Opera laid on a commemorative performance. Enterprisingly, it managed to be backward- and forward-looking at once, for the chosen conductor was John Eliot Gardiner, with his Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists: a guarantee that this Messiah would represent the most up-to-date findings from the back-to-the-1700s persuasion. For most of Part I, the Gardiner ensemble sounded alert, precise, speedy - and lightweight, to ears attuned to overweening Victorian forces. The choruses 'And He shall purify' and 'For unto us a Child is born', unaccustomedly fleet, added no ballast to the larger drama. As expected, the dry Royal Opera acoustic flattered nobody: neither John Aler's stylish, nor the flexible high bass of Rodney Gilfry (though the counter-tenor James Bowman made his brief mark, and after an appealingly rustic 'Pastoral Symphony' the boy-soprano Sam Pay too - true, plain and 'natural', ie blessedly innocent of King's College manners). With Part II, however, the lithe strengths of Gardiner's style began to make themselves felt. By then we had adjusted to the slimmed-down scale, and could appreciate the lucid diction it permitted. Without any dense, mournful instrumental cushion, the mezzo Catherine Robbin shaped a penetrating 'He was despised and rejected'; Aler found a note of vehement regret in both of his arias, and Gilfry spelled out 'Why do the nations so furiously rage together?' as a lofty moral rebuke. The Hallelujah Chorus began trippingly, with none of its 'traditional' heavy-duty thrust, but rose to a brighter, sharper kind of climax. Part III began with the soprano Sylvia McNair at her melting best in 'I know that my Redeemer liveth'. (But decidedly sexy, too, in the candid modern manner: could that possibly be right?) With a fine period-trumpet, Gilfry swung robustly through 'The trumpet shall sound'. On Gardiner's reading, the orthodox piety of the closing chorus was at once tender and provisional - no Victorian, muscular-Christian dragooning there, only a hopeful uplift. The whole performance was of a piece with that, humane and satisfying in its particular low-calorie way. Sponsored by the Observer, in support of the Thomas Coram Foundation</p>

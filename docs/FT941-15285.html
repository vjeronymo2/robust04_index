			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: If we do go back to basics . . . - London Politicians are not alone in finding it hard to shun instant gratification and get back to basics. With the siren song of falling interest rates fading in their ears, equity investors spent most of the week worrying that the stock market lacked the stimulus to keep up its robust performance. Any hopes of another base rate cut were deferred until the Spring by a clutch of good economic statistics: the unemployment rate is below 10 per cent for the first time in 18 months, consumer credit is highest and housing starts strongest in three years. Good news - 46,800 unemployed people back to work in December, earning money to spend and saving taxpayers the dole - temporarily became bad news. The FT-SE 100 lost 86 points in four days before strong corporate results and other fundamentals reasserted themselves on Friday and the index bounced 40.6 points to close at 3,400.6. While John Major might hanker for a simpler and semi-mythological 1950s lifestyle, economists and investors can at least quantify the good old days they believe are here again. 'Over the next three to four years, the performance of the UK economy could resemble the halcyon days of low inflation and sustained trend economic growth that characterised the period from the mid-1950s to the end of the 1960s,' said David Shaw, Legal &amp; General's director of investment strategy, this week. Trouble is, some of the market basics in such a scenario are very challenging. As the chart shows, the historic p/e ratio of industrial stocks is fast approaching the all-time record of 23.1 of January, 1969. Never mind the past, look to future earnings, is the response of many strategists. But even here the market is pushing the limits. The prospective p/e ratio is around 15.5, the highest, Warburg's points out, in 20 years of their record keeping. Moreover, the rise in equity valuation has been heavily underpinned by the decline in interest rates over the past four years. There is every chance of shaving interest rates by another half point or so this year but after that share prices are on their own. They will have to sustain themselves on rising earnings and dividends. But, even as stocks soared after last November's budget, analysts were scaling back their forecasts. In December alone, the consensus forecast for pre-exceptional earnings growth of the FT-SE 500 dropped from 14.3 per cent to 12.6 per cent. Perhaps this was the last gasp of pessimism and caution for analysts and companies after a protracted period of economic recovery hopes deferred. On balance, profit downgrades have out numbered upgrades for four years, says Paul Walton, Capel's market strategist. 'Analysts' profit forecasts are far too low,' he argues. Moreover, companies are being very timid with their turnover and profits predictions. Pre-tax profit growth of about 15 per cent this year (against 3 per cent in 1992 and 19 per cent last year) would consist of about seven percentage points of turnover growth, about three to four points from interest rate and currency effects and only four to five points from lower input costs. But with a more realistic view of turnover and costs, profit growth closer to 25 per cent is possible, he argues. Indeed, a Dun and Bradstreet survey this week found companies salivating at the prospect of raising prices. Similarly, there is plenty of scope or dividend per share growth to accelerate to 7-10 per cent this year from 6 per cent last year and zero in 1992. Thus, the upcoming corporate results season is even more important than usual for sustaining current market levels. Fortunately, first indications were highly encouraging. TSB, Tomkins, Rank Organisation and Securicor all reported much better than expected earnings and dividends. TSB was the most impressive with full year pre-tax profits jumping from Pounds 5m to Pounds 301m the dividend rising 20 per cent against forecasts of 9.5 per cent. Yes, profits soared thanks to a near-halving of bad debt provisions while operating profits were only ahead 11 per cent but it is clear TSB and other banks are heading for an embarrassment of riches. Tomkins turned in doubled interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 93.8m, about Pounds 5m better than forecast, and a reasonable dividend rise. The City remains, however, cool to its takeover of Rank Hovis McDougall, the foods group it acquired for Pounds 990.5m in December. Investors still see it as a baker of loss-leading white bread for supermarkets, a tag justified by the measly profits from baking. Rank Organisation also surprised the market with full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 276.6m, more than doubled the restated year earlier figures. Although consumers might be holding back a bit on their regular leisure spending Rank squeezed more operating profits out of bingo and casinos. Like Rank, First Leisure has had to work the crowds harder but at least its modest increase in profits reported this week helped allay market fears. Its shares, once buoyed by the notion First Leisure was defying recession, had fallen from 378p in March to 234p in November on fears its discos and bowling lanes were failing to hold their own. Shares are now trading on the more realistic multiple equal to the market's. In matters of market pricing, however, the prize of the week went to Eurotunnel. It came up with a top charge of Pounds 310 for whisking a car and its occupants through the tunnel on mid-summer weekends. Ferry operators breathed a sigh of relief and investors marked down the shares. Eurotunnel offers travel to an 'unlimited' number of passengers per car. So enterprising crammers could establish some remarkable passenger/excursion ratios. The bigger task lies with Eurotunnel. No other company will have to work so hard to justify its share price.</p>

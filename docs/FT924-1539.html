			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Philips to change accounting practice PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to switch to historical-cost accounting from its previous current-cost system with retroactive effect from January 1 1992. The move is part of wider changes in accounting policies designed to bring the company into line with most other big international companies. Philips also plans to use the US dollar as the 'functional' currency in highly inflationary South American countries such as Brazil instead of the local currency. This will enable Philips to simplify reporting by dropping the lines 'revaluation,' 'gearing adjustment' and 'monetary adjustment' for these local currencies from its annual financial reporting. If these changes had been implemented in 1991, Philips' net profit from normal business operations would have been around Fl 881m (Dollars 489m), Fl 100m lower than the published figure. The ratio of total liabilities to total capital employed would have been 75.8 per cent against 73.5 per cent. The changes, foreshadowed in the company's 1991 annual report, coincide with the appointment at the end of the month of a new Anglo-Saxon-trained finance director, Mr Dudley Eustace, the former finance director of British Aerospace. Mr Eustace, who joined Philips in mid-1992, will be taking over from Mr Henk Appelo, who is retiring. Philips also said it would adopt new US standards on post-retirement benefits such as healthcare and other non-pension benefits for its former employees around the world. On software, Philips is to apply the principle of capitalising the expenditure on software for certain products and then writing this off over the product's life. However, it said it would not be capitalising any expenditure this year 'in the interest of prudence'. The company will also move to a more international practice on goodwill payments by capitalising and amortising them. Dutch accounting rules allow a company to charge goodwill directly to shareholders' equity. In a recent interview with an in-house magazine, Mr Eustace said he planned to start up a high-profile programme of holding meetings with analysts and fund management to coincide with the release of quarterly figures, in line with Anglo-Saxon practice. He also said cutting the debt bill would be a priority. 'If there was just one thing I would like to achieve in the next five years, that would be to make this company healthy again by substantially reducing its debt,' he said.</p>

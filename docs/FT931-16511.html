			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Norwich Union announces cuts in bonuses NORWICH UNION, the mutual insurance group, yesterday announced cuts of 7.2 per cent in its pay-outs on short-term with-profits policies. This is the second year in succession that NU, traditionally seen as offering a lead to the life insurance industry, has made significant cuts in bonuses. On the standard industry assumption that policies are started by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month, pay-outs on 10 year endowments fell from Pounds 7,532 to Pounds 6,992, a fall of 7.2 per cent. In 1991, this figure would have been Pounds 8,241. NU said that business in 10 year policies was heavy during 1983, and it expects to pay some Pounds 100m in maturities for these policies this year, about double the figure for last year. Total maturities are expected to be Pounds 150m. Falls in 25-year endowment pay-outs, most often used as a mortgage repayment vehicle, fell by 3.1 per cent from Pounds 60,073 to Pounds 58,237. The 10 year self-employed pension plans saw a fall of 7.2 per cent in pay-outs. Mr Philip Scott, NU's investment manager, said the bonus cuts reflected the company's belief that investment returns and inflation will be lower during the 1990s than they were in the 1980s, and describes the pay-outs achieved between 1988 and 1992 as 'excessive'. He also pointed out that current endowment yields, of 13 per cent for 10 year policies and 12.9 per cent for 25 year policies, were ahead of inflation. NU predicts that its with-profits fund will average an annual real return of 7 per cent, and a nominal return of 11 per cent during the 1990s. This compares with figures for 1980-89 of 14 per cent and 21 per cent. Mr Scott added that the life fund's switch from equities and property into fixed interest securities, which saw its weighting in bonds rise from zero in 1989 to 20 per cent by the end of 1992, had already delivered an investment profit of Pounds 100,000. Three other mutual life offices announced cuts in bonuses. Using standard assumptions, Friends' Provident cut pay-outs on 25 year policies by 1.5 per cent, from Pounds 62,438 to Pounds 61,496 and 10 year pay-outs by 7.67 per cent, from Pounds 7,457 to Pounds 6,885. Scottish Life's pay-outs dropped 10.25 per cent from Pounds 6,926 to Pounds 6,216 for 10 year policies and by 4.9 per cent from Pounds 65,496 to Pounds 62,282 for 25 year policies. Clerical Medical cut bonuses, but for technical reasons this led to a slight rise in pay-outs for 25 year policies, from Pounds 61,283 to Pounds 61,419. Its 10 year pay-outs followed the trend.</p>

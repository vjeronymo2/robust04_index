			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Morrison tumbles Disappointing figures from food retailer Wm Morrison Supermarkets, seen as the glamour stock in its field, sent the company's shares tumbling and prompted a sharp retreat in the sector, subsequently the worst performing area of the FT-SE 350 Index. Interim profits at Pounds 38.2m were well below market forecasts. Analysts were particularly disappointed by the decline in margins from a company generally seen to improve margins even in difficult times. A cautious trading statement that seemed to signal further difficulties in the second half also played a part in damaging sentiment. The shares dropped 23 to 106p, as analysts downgraded full year figures. Robert Fleming reduced its forecast by Pounds 11m to Pounds 89m and warned: 'Those who need performance over the next 18 months will not find it in this sector.' Mr Tony MacNeary at Natwest Securities cut his current year estimate by Pounds 8m to Pounds 92 and said: 'Today's slump in the share price reflects the reality of the resurgence of stiff competition in the food market.' Figures from Morrison came two days after Tesco, one of the big three retailers, also produced disappointing numbers and revealed a decline in margins. Yesterday a wave of gloom swept over the sector as dealers reflected on both sets of figures. Tesco lost 11 to 198p, J. Sainsbury fell 20 to 420p, Kwik Save tumbled 20 to 686p and Asda shed 2 1/2 to 59 1/2 p. HSBC Holdings, a significant constituent of the Hong Kong stock market, rose 9 1/2 to 693 1/2 p on follow-through buying after optimism that the International Olympic Committee would choose Beijing to host the 2000 games pushed the Hang Seng index higher the previous night. Analysts said acceptance of a Beijing bid would be a sign that the West was prepared to forgive China on human rights issues. The Beijing argument spilled over to Cable and Wireless, which has a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecom. The shares also benefited from a big buy order in late trading and a bounce as the reaction to Vodafone's competitive attack on Mercury's one-2-one telephone service was considered overdone. Cable shares improved 8 to 861p while Vodafone eased 2 1/2 to 491 1/2 p. Sentiment from Guinness hit the rest of the brewing sector. Allied-Lyons fell 12 to 571p, while Grand Metropolitan, recommended yesterday by Lehman Brothers following a company visit, shed 6 1/2 to 407 1/2 p. The poor sentiment in Northern Foods that followed an analysts visit to the company earlier this week continued to drive the stock lower, losing 8 at 249p. Unigate retreated 12 to 385p in sympathy. Reports of problems at Thorn EMI's Rent-A-Center stores in the US sent the shares into retreat as many dealers in the stock turned cautious. Thorn weakened 33 to 944p on 4.5m shares dealt, with traders reporting the availability of large lines of stock. Sentiment was further damaged by a profits downgrade from BZW. The securities house trimmed its full year estimate for the year to March 1994 by Pounds 4m to Pounds 350m. Builders merchants were boosted by encouraging results from Travis Perkins, which announced interim profits of Pounds 9.3m, against Pounds 5.2m previously, and net operating margins of 5.4 per cent, up from 3.2 per cent. Travis jumped 30 to 275p, while Wolseley rose 15 to 645p and Wickes 10 to 112p. However, Pilkington fell 2 1/2 to 151p, with UBS turning seller, arguing that the company had a stretched balance sheet and offered limited yield and income growth. A profits downgrade from Smith New Court weakened Cookson Group, leaving the shares trailing 8 1/2 to 193 1/2 p. Smith reduced its full-year figure by Pounds 5m to Pounds 92m saying it was cautious on the company's European markets. Mirror Group Newspapers firmed a penny to 178p as shareholder approval of settlement of claims between the publishing group and private companies belonging to the late Robert Maxwell which paved the way for sale of the 54.8 per cent Maxwell stake in the company. After the market closed the administrator announced that the bidding for the stake sale via a book-building process would begin on Monday and all bids would be in by October 1. United Newspapers gained 7 to 556p as the company announced improved half-year profits and the proposed sale of its Extel financial service. Television group Anglia saw its shares rise 13 to 375p in spite of a sharp fall in first half profits to Pounds 2.12m from Pounds 5.17m. In the stores sector, a profits warning from Laura Ashley hit the shares, and they closed 22 lower at 87p. A firm US dollar helped a number of internationally traded stocks. RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, added 7 at 690p. However, Panmure Gordon believes the shares are expensive at that level and a short term sell. Shell Transport firmed 6 1/2 to 644 1/2 p ahead of the OPEC meeting at the weekend. Leather goods and clothing company Pittard slumped 12 to 47p. the biggest percentage fall in London stocks yesterday, in reaction to disappointing half year results. The first day of trading in Shield Diagnostics, the biotechnology company, saw the new shares open at a premium of 6 but ease 2 to close at 116p. Some 5.5m shares were placed with institutions at 112p a fortnight ago.</p>

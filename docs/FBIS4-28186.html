			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["South Korea, a U.S. Colony"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The United States  presents South Korea as an "independent state", but it is a  typical colony under the U.S. political domination, military  control and economic and cultural yoke, declares NODONG SINMUN  in a by-lined article today.    The article says:    South Korea is subordinate to the United States politically.  The U.S. Embassy in Seoul indicates the orientation of internal  and external policies to the puppet government, watches and  controls their execution, holding the right of political  domination over South Korea.    The flunkeyist nature of the South Korean puppet regime  without independence today is well illustrated by the fact that  it is running headlong along the road of confrontation and war  as a shock brigade in the nuclear row of its master to destroy  the fellow countrymen.    After the North-South agreement and the joint declaration on  denuclearisation were adopted and effectuated, the United States  forced the puppets to "shelve" their implementation, crying over  the "nuclear issue" of the North. Yielding to the pressure, the  puppets broke up all the dialogues and exchanges which had been  held from the period of the preceding "regimes", raising the  "nuclear issue" of the North as a precondition for dialogue, and  are now leaving the destiny of the nation to outside forces,  entreating the master for "sanctions" against fellow countrymen.    The United States does all thing as it pleases from working  out scinarios for framing up a "regime" and replacing it to  choosing the "president" and changing him in South Korea.    It was the United States that made Kim Yong-sam, a political  charlatan, "civilian president".    South Korea is totally dependent on the United States  militarily, too.    The U.S. Forces commander in South Korea, holding the  prerogative of supreme and operational command of the puppet  army and the U.S. Forces, uses them for a military lever against  the DPRK and other countries in Asia.    South Korea is thoroughly subjugated to the U.S.  imperialists  economically. The U.S. imperialists hold a full ideological and  cultural "control" on South Korea.    The U.S. economic domination over South Korea is maintained  by "economic aid", various "treaties" and "agreements",  predatory machines and investments of U.S. monopoly capital.    By the early 1980s the United States had robbed South Korea  of 120 billion dollars, or ten times the total "aid" granted to  it. Through the "agreement on the transfer of finance and  properties", the "agreement on economic and technical aid" and  other "economic agreements" signed with the South Korean  puppets, the United States took over the right to freely possess  properties interested and appendages including movables and  immovables in South Korea and seized unlimitted rights to  infiltraoe U.S. monopoly capital into South Korea and engage in  commerce, industry, banking and other profit-making activities.  It takes a hand in the shaping of economic policy and drafting  of the bugdet of the puppet government and supervises and  controls their execution through the "U.S. International  Development Agency" in South Korea.    Through the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. International  Communication Agency, the U.S. "cultural centres" and  "information centres" in South Korea and "agreements" on  ideological and cultural relations concluded with the puppets,  the United States controls education, the press, culture and art  and religion of South Korea for ideological and cultural backing  to the colonial enslavement policy toward South Korea.    It is a shame to the century and an intolerable stain on the  era that there still remains a colony like South Korea on the  earth when the 20th century is coming to an end.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Kazakh president's allies 'win big majority' The Kazakh government yesterday released figures showing that allies of the president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, won a large majority in Monday's parliamentary elections, and denied western claims the polls were unfair. Diplomats said Mr Nazarbayev controlled at least two-thirds of the new 177-member parliament and his opponents probably had fewer than 30 seats, or less than 15 per cent. The results raised new concerns about ethnic tension, as Kazakh candidates won 56 per cent of the seats, against 27 per cent for ethnic Russians. The Kazakhs comprise 43 per cent of the republic's population and the Russians 36 per cent. 'It looks like Nazarbayev got a landslide,' one diplomat said. The elections have been condemned as unfair by observers from the Council on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The delegation said the polls favoured supporters of Mr Nazarbayev by, among other factors, an apparent systematic effort to disqualify independent candidates. The elections were Kazakhstan's first since it gained independence in the Soviet break-up two years ago. The election results showed allies of Mr Nazarbayev belonging to political parties will comprise a 95-seat bloc of parliament, or 53 per cent. His supporters are also believed to make up a majority of the 60 successful candidates who ran with no party affiliation. Kazakhstan's foreign minister, Mr Tuligen Suleymenov, said the CSCE delegation had been 'ill-informed'. Mr Karatay Turisov, the republic's electoral commission chairman, released a point-by-point denial of their conclusions. 'It would be naive to believe we have the same democratic principles as western countries,' he said. 'It's impossible to change the psychology of people in a two-month campaign after 70 years of communism.'</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Gill hits back over Pounds 50,000 payment MR KEN GILL, who retired last week as general secretary of MSF, the general technical union, yesterday hit back at critics who accused him of hypocrisy by accepting a lump-sum leaving payment of more than Pounds 50,000 on top of his pension of two thirds of his final salary of Pounds 55,000. Several other union leaders have recently received even more generous pay-offs, sometimes related to leaving early, and usually as a result of generous clauses for officials in union merger agree-ments. Mr Gill, who was also a past chairman of the TUC's equal rights committee, said that the payment to him was based on a formula of 1.5 per cent of salary for every year's service which applied 'to all staff and officials of MSF'. When the union was formed out of the merger of ASTMS, the white-collar union and Tass the technical union, in 1988, all Tass staff - plus Mr Gill the general secretary - received the superior benefits enjoyed by ASTMS, includ-ing the leaving payment formula. Mr Gill is also keeping his Ford Scorpio car but says that he chose a second-hand one, saving the union Pounds 12,000. He believes that the news of his retirement terms have been leaked by his political enemies in the union which has now been taken over by Mr Roger Lyons, widely regarded as more of a pragmatist. Mr Gill said that if he had left a year or two early he could have picked up a payment much higher even than the Pounds 220,000 received by Mr Clive Jenkins, former leader of ASTMS, who left before official retirement. Other high payments in recent months include the Pounds 148,000 paid to Ms Brenda Dean, 49, who left the print union GPMU under a special agreement arising from the merger which produced GPMU from the two main print unions. Mr Roy Evans, leader of the ISTC steel union, also received a leaving payment of about Pounds 100,000. Although the health of trade union finances has recently improved slightly following a severe deterioration in the late 1980s, most unions have been forced to make painful cuts and increase member's subscriptions sharply. Six of the 10 biggest unions, including the MSF, performed better in 1991 than 1990 and all six produced a surplus.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPRESENTATION  </P> <P> Margaret Cralle's letter (Aug. 9), on the issue of statehood for Washington,  D.C., with a population of 650,000, makes a point seriously neglected  throughout our history. Her example of California's 26 million people having  two votes in the Senate, just as does Hawaii with its half-million population,  highlights the reality that our Senate, patterned after England's House of  Lords, is a gross contradiction of equitable, representative democracy.  </P> <P> The remedy, preserving the advantages of bicameral representation of  congressional districts and whole state populations, is simple. Its principle,  proportional representation, governs the vote count of all 12 nations of the  European Council with the exception of England.  </P> <P> We propose a constitutional amendment giving each U.S. senator a vote in the  Senate equal to one-half of the fraction of his/her state's population compared  to the total population of the United States as measured in the last census.  </P> <P> The same principle could be applied by the states to their bicameral  legislatures.  </P> <P> NICK and JO SEIDITA  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Vosper builds 13% advance - Order book worth Pounds 500m and prospects for new contracts good Vosper Thornycroft Holdings, the Southampton-based shipbuilding and engineering group, increased annual profits by 13 per cent and said yesterday its order book was worth Pounds 500m. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 19m to Pounds 21.5m in the year to March 31, while turnover increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 239m. Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said the policy of broadening the group's customer base continued. Businesses independent of Vosper winning warship contracts had risen to 15 per cent of group earnings - and would reach 20 per cent, following the acquisition last month of HSDE, a business which makes electronic con-trol systems for gas tur-bines. Vosper has bid against the GEC-Yarrow yard on the Clyde to build up to seven San-down class minehunters for the Royal Navy and said it hoped to hear the outcome in the next few months. The Southampton group has built the five existing Sandown vessels, which have fibreglass hulls. Mr Usher said: 'We have responded vigorously to this tender and were pleased to note that bids proposing foreign hulls will not be accepted on this occasion.' Vosper is competing with German and French shipyards for a patrol craft order for the Kuwait navy. It is also interested in a joint venture to build six mine-hunters for the Royal Australian Navy, which would be constructed in Australia, but using Vosper techno-logy. Mr Usher said that with good prospects of new orders from home and abroad, he had every expectation that the group could continue to report good results in the year ahead. Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 46.2p (41.3p). A final dividend of 12.7p gives a total 18p (15.8p), an increase of 14 per cent. COMMENT These results, slightly ahead of expectations, showed again that Vosper's focus on minehunters and patrol craft - selling mainly to the Middle East and east Asia - has insulated it from the downturn in spending by former cold warriors. A lack of recent orders has brought down the future order book from more than Pounds 700m last year to Pounds 500m, but the group seems well placed to win some of the work to be awarded soon. The Royal Navy minehunters order would be particularly welcome, as the proportion of work being done for the Ministry of Defence has slumped to only 2 per cent, with 95 per cent earmarked for export. Forecast profits of Pounds 24m put the shares, down 1p yesterday at 778p, on a prospective multiple of 15.2 - an 8 per cent premium to the market. The shares are tightly held and have had a good run, more than tripling in value since 1992, but they could advance further if the minehunter order comes through.</p>

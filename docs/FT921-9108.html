			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Tarmac-Steetley Yesterday's decision by the Brussels competition authorities to refer the Tarmac-Steetley joint venture back to London looks sensible enough. Bricks and clay tiles, after all, do not easily cross the Channel, so markets affected by the proposed deal will be exclusively regional ones. In addition, it was always logical that Redland's bid for Steetley - which raises similar competition issues, but is too small to come under EC merger regulations - should be dealt with by the same jurisdiction. It is doubtful, though, whether the market should look too hard for wider implications. It would certainly be wrong to see yesterday's concession to the UK as representing a change in Brussels' thinking. The Commission has already turned down two requests from the German government to be allowed to investigate largely domestic mergers, and will have made an exception yesterday only because the arguments were unusually clear cut. Any erosion of legal sovereignty sticks in the EC throat and will not be easily be repeated. Investors would also be unwise to assume that Sir Leon Brittan's apparently strong talk about dominant positions in yesterday's statement was an overt steer for the UK's Office of Fair Trading. An unconditional reference of both deals to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission remains a possibility, though the justification would be more political than commercial. Redland will certainly hope that Mr Lilley, the UK trade secretary, is prepared to accept undertakings which would remove the need for full scale investigations of both ventures.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (4): Ways of limiting the cost of a calamity - Business interruption In March 1993, a fire struck the plant of wallpaper manufacturer Gallery Home Fashions at Caerphilly in south Wales. Nearly half of the 42,000 square feet building was destroyed, including the stock areas and the office block. Some of the machinery was damaged beyond repair and everything else in the building was badly affected. As the company's chief executive, Martin Paterson, says: 'After the fire we were playing for very high stakes - our survival. Continuity of supply is vital in the wallpaper business. If we don't fill rack space in the shops, someone else will.' A Pounds 4.6m insurance settlement was negotiated with the assistance of Nicholas Balcombe, chief executive of loss assessors Balcombe Group. Rather than rebuild the factory, which would have led to production shutdown for a significant period, it was agreed that a new plant should be built nearby. In the meantime, with co-operation from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the building authorities, it was possible to repair the factory sufficiently to restart some production within two weeks, concentrating on the most profitable lines. Over the next nine months output was built up to around two-thirds of normal. From December 1993, production began to be transferred to the new plant, which was officially opened in early March 1994, a year after the fire. Mr Paterson emphasises the importance of the initial stages: 'The momentum we generated in the first fortnight after the fire carried us through the longer-term recovery.' This case shows that it is possible to successfully manage the consequences of a serious interruption to business, through co-operation between management, workforce, insurers, insurance brokers, loss assessors, loss adjusters and the relevant authorities. It also highlights that rebuilding plant is not always the best option. It is not only large fires that interrupt business. As Andrew Dunn, marketing manager of disaster recovery and restoration specialist Stralis, says: 'A fairly small material damage loss can have a phenomenal business interruption effect.' One example would be damage to a crucial high technology machine, on which the lead time for purchase of a replacement may be a year or more. Laurence Law, national services director of Alexander and Alexander (UK) Ltd, cites the case of a carpet-making machine which took three years to replace. Business interruption (b/i) insurance is one element in the management of risk. It covers, during a selected indemnity period, loss of gross profit and 'increase in cost of working', that is, costs incurred in minimising the gross profit loss, for example, sub-contracted production, overtime payment, temporary equipment hire, or purchase of replacement stock from alternative suppliers at higher price. Extensions to policies can cover interruption caused by damage at customers' or suppliers' premises, denial of access, and other b/i risks. Global figures for UK insurance companies (these exclude Lloyd's syndicates results) from the Association of British Insurers (ABI), put gross incurred b/i claims following fire at Pounds 100m in 1993, compared with Pounds 423m for commercial property damage claims following fire. However, insurance claims do not give the full picture. One leading insurer has written that 'the traditional problem of inadequate sums insured remains a feature of many b/i claims.' As Mr Balcombe says: 'Some companies manage to make good the damage and recover quickly, supported by payment in full of their insurance claims. Many others are not so fortunate - usually they have been under-insured.' Many b/i policies are purchased with an indemnity period of 12-18 months, whereas repair and rebuilding after some incidents can take much longer. Brian Toft, risk analyst in the Risk Services Division at Sedgwick (UK), says: 'In many cases a year is too short: it may take two or three years to get a business up and running after a major incident. By then the trained workforce may have disappeared, as well as customers.' The costs of loss of reputation, or long-term loss of customers due to inability to supply goods, are difficult to quantify. This, in addition to underinsurance, may disguise the fact that in some cases the real cost of business interruption can be greater than that of physical damage. Modern business practices can lead to increased interruption risks. Dependencies between customers and suppliers are rising. One instance is single sourcing of components, which has advantages in terms of cost and quality control, but can be a critical problem if the sole supplier suffers an incident disrupting supply. An extreme example of problems associated with concentrated sourcing is a fire in 1993 that destroyed a plant in western Japan which produced 60 per cent of the world's output of a resin used in semiconductor devices. Such problems can be compounded by business methods such as just-in-time, where raw material and finished goods stocks are kept to a minimum. High capacity plant gives advantages of economies of scale. Concentrating a higher volume of production into a more compact area also heightens the potential extent of damage and consequent interruption in the event of a disaster. Similarly, widespread reliance of many businesses on computer systems, increases the potential consequences of computer failure. There is a wealth of experience within the risk management profession to help businesses cope with these business interruption risks, both pre-loss prevention and post-loss mitigation. Roger Ricketts, technical manager of property services in Sun Alliance International's Risk Improvement and Survey Department, says the emphasis must be on prevention: 'Having b/i insurance does not guarantee you won't go out of business. An important part of our work is to give advice on contingency planning, and risk identification, assessment and control.' Also of significance are hidden costs - sometimes called 'iceberg' costs - associated with accidents in the workplace. These are not generally termed business interruption events, but looked at in the broad risk management context can have the same effect. For instance, if an accident occurs on a production line or individual machine, output might have to be shut down for a period. John Hurrell, managing director of Sedgwick Global, notes that other hidden costs can stem, for example, from management time spent in investigating an incident, difficulties in hiring skilled replacement workers, and less tangible elements such as the effect on morale or damage to reputation. As Barry Holt, manager of Liberty Risk Services, says: 'Our research, and that of bodies like the HSE, shows the value of addressing the top of the accident 'iceberg'. Our role is to identify and assess workplace risks, and then reduce or eliminate them, with the aim of preventing accidents from occurring in the first place.'</p>

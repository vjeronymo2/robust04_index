			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Lifeboat arranged for bondholders Fisons yesterday sent out a lifeboat to holders of its only public bond issue, a Pounds 100m offering of 10-year Eurobonds, by offering to buy back the bonds at Friday's closing level or to exchange them for a new issue of five-year bonds, writes Antonia Sharpe. Investment bankers at JP Morgan, who had spent the weekend hammering out the strategy, said that Fisons had taken this action because it wanted to maintain a presence in the bond market without placing investors at a disadvantage. News of Fisons' restructuring plans caused some embarrassment to JP Morgan as only two months ago it had arranged the company's first public bond offering since 1986. The deal had been seen as a feather in JP Morgan's cap in view of Fisons' lack of a credit rating and its poor performance in the stock market.</p>

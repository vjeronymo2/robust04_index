			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A BEASTLY LOOK AT THE MARQUIS DE SADE IN UCLA SERIES  </P> <P> Tonight at 8, the UCLA Film Archives will premiere "Marquis," by  writer-director Henri Xhonneux and co-writer-designer Roland Topor ("Fantastic  Planet"). This recent French film is all but indescribable -- at least in a  family newspaper. Let's try anyway.  </P> <P> Imagine a collaboration between Pier Palo Pasolini and the late Czech puppeteer  Jiri Trnkacq, who have decided to adapt, unbowdlerized, the works of the  Marquis de Sade, as interpreted by anthropomorphic animal-puppets, their faces  subtly humanized but their "bestial" natures now transparent. In this conceit,  "The Marquis" is a spaniel, his jailer a rat, Justine a cow, the prison  governor a rooster and the hypocritical Jesuit priest a dromedary. The film is  thoroughly lewd, bawdy, shocking, but often weirdly charming.  </P> <P> And, offensive or "sadistic" as some will find "Marquis," it's not really  pornographic, since the effect of the puppet-masks, high-style delivery and  fairy-tale settings renders the idea of sexual license as absurd as possible.  (One of the characters is the Marquis' organ, with which he has jocular and  philosophic conversations.) Obviously, Xhonneux/Topor's "Marquis" is both  exclusively for adults -- and unique.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 206-FILM.  </P> <P> This weekend, LACMA's Vincente Minnelli retrospective catches the director at a  bad moment -- the disastrously cut 1962 inside-Hollywood movie, "Two Weeks in  Another Town," and a career high point: 1958-59, the years of the  multiple-Oscar-winning "Gigi" and "The Reluctant Debutante" (Friday) and "Some  Came Running" (Saturday).  </P> <P> In all these films, especially "Gigi" -- with Leslie Caron as the most fetching  of Colette's gamins and Maurice Chevalier as the charmingly avuncular  boulevardier who watches her consort's progress -- Minnelli's craft is mellow  and assured, even when materials or cast (Sandra Dee as the debutante) don't  exactly suit him.  </P> <P> "Some Came Running," which began as an adaptation of James Jones'  writer-come-home novel and turned into the first and best of the "Rat Pack"  movies, is a particular tour de force. Frank Sinatra makes an alarmingly  plausible writer and his lowlife buddies top him. As gambler Bama, who never  removes his hat, Dean Martin has rarely been better. And, as Ginny, a  threadbare floozy with a skirt too tight and a smile too quick, Shirley  MacLaine gives one of the most moving and brilliant performances of her whole  career.  </P></p>

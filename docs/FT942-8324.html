			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Willis Corroon retreats The market's response to acutely disappointing first- quarter figures from Willis Corroon, the second largest UK insurance broker, was instantaneous as marketmakers chopped their opening quotations in an attempt to head off any large-scale selling pressure by institutions. However, the markdown in the share price failed to stem the selling pressure, which built up again following what was described by analysts as a sombre post-figures meeting. Willis's profits came in at Pounds 42.4m, against estimates which ranged up to Pounds 59m. Willis shares were eventually down 47 1/2 p, or 20 per cent, to 191 1/2 p after turnover of 17m, the heaviest recorded in the stock since the merger with Corroon &amp; Black in October 1990. Most analysts reduced their current year forecasts, previously around the Pounds 95m to Pounds 100m mark, to Pounds 70m. Mr Andrew Pitt, insurance broking specialist at BZW, and a long term bear of the stock, predicted further downside risk in the stock and said that 'a fair price for the shares is 180p'.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Denmark's fall mars its reputation for caution / Review of performance in Copenhagen The Danish share market has put up one of Europe's worst performances this year, with a fall in the CSE index to date of 24 per cent, as a reputation for financial propriety has been damaged by financial sector trauma elsewhere in the Nordic bloc, as well as by some problems at home. At the beginning of the year, almost everyone forecast a solid rise in Copenhagen share prices in 1992. The assumptions behind this forecast were that interest rates would fall and that recovery in the US economy would lift international demand. Both these conditions have been disappointed, and domestic factors have made matters worse. First, Danish voters injected a new element of uncertainty into the equation when they rejected the Maastricht treaty in the referendum on June 2. This has resulted in an increase in the yield gap between Danish and German bonds from about 80 basis points before the referendum to around 180 points now. The fall in share prices has actually been slightly less than is warranted by the rise in yields in bond markets, said one Copenhagen broker yesterday. The risk premium for investing in shares has therefore narrowed from about one per cent at the beginning of the year to about 0.5 per cent today. Secondly, the collapse of Hafnia Holding, parent company of the Hafnia insurance group, which went into payments suspension in August, has upset investors, especially foreigners. Although the problems in the Danish financial sector are not as severe as they are in the other Nordic countries, it is difficult for outsiders to see this, says a Copenhagen broker. The future of the market will also depend on interest rate movements. 'Prices should not fall much more,' says Mr Flemming Madsen, chief analyst at Danske Bors, the broking arm of Danske Bank, 'but they will remain very sensitive to interest rate changes.' Mr Madsen and other brokers point out that on earnings performance the bigger Danish industrials do not deserve the fall in share prices which they have seen this year. An average increase in earnings of 11 per cent is expected for this group in 1992, followed by a further improvement in 1993, meaning that prospective price/earnings ratios are now lower than at any time for three years. Stock prices for some of these companies, Novo Nordisk, Danisco, FLS Industries, Radiometer, and Sophus Berendsen among them, can be expected to bounce strongly once the market in general begins to recover, brokers say. On the other hand, shipping shares, banks and other financial institutions are not recommended by Danish brokers. The difficulties in the freight market were behind one of the more dramatic developments in the Danish market over the past month, when the East Asiatic Company's share price fell from a high of DKr92 to DKr52 after reporting a first-half loss of DKr181m. The loss arose mainly in the group's shipping operations, but investors lost confidence more especially as a result of criticism of the management. EAC had recovered to DKr66 last night. Mr Henning Sparso, the group's chairman for the past 10 years, resigned after a board meeting last Friday, and an outsider, Mr Jan Erlund, who is a lawyer, was named to succeed him after a meeting of shareholders has approved the appointment in October. Banks are not in such deep trouble as those in other Nordic countries and, so far, none of the larger banks has had trouble in meeting Denmark's exceptionally high 10 per cent capital adequacy ratio. Indeed, shares in the two big banks are still above par value, which contrasts with bank shares in the other Nordic countries, with Den Danske Bank's at DKr229 and Unidanmark's at DKr132 last night. They are, however, down 32 and 44 per cent respectively from their 1992 highs and, until interest rates fall and domestic demand picks up, they will continue to face a difficult period.</p>

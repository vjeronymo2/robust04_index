			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Gatwick Express makes surprise early profit Gatwick Express, the first British Rail service set for privatisation, carried more passengers than planned and made an unexpected profit in its first few months as an independent business. Mr Robert Mason, managing director, said the company, which runs non-stop trains between Gatwick Airport and London Victoria, had expected to break even, but better-than-expected passenger numbers boosted ticket revenues by Pounds 2m. Ticket revenues rose to Pounds 27m in the past 12 months with Gatwick Express operating as an independent 'shadow franchise' in the last six. The company had budgeted for ticket revenues of Pounds 25m. The management team plans to renew its entire train fleet at a cost of about Pounds 45m if it is successful in staging a buy-out. Gatwick Express's present locomotives are 28 years old and its coaches are 19 years old. It operates seven trains providing 134 daily services, but plans to buy eight sets of locomotives and coaches to allow for maintenance. Mr Mason said the company was 'very happy' with its Pounds 8m contract with Railtrack, the state-owned company set up to run BR's track and signalling after privatisation. This guarantees access to the track between Gatwick and London and to two reserved platforms at Gatwick. Managers in other British Rail divisions have complained that Railtrack's track charges are too high. Gatwick Express's one concern is that Railtrack should not allow Victoria station to be turned into a shopping mall, so marginalising train operations. Gatwick Express has acquired the lease to run Gatwick Airport station. As station operator it must treat all train companies using the station equally. This means it will reduce promotional advertising for its services at Gatwick and create a single ticket office for its own services and those of its two rivals, Network SouthEast and Thameslink. Gatwick Express plans improvements to its services to attract more passengers, including a coach service from Victoria for travellers staying in London hotels and an improved setting-down area for travellers arriving by car. It has also been marketing its service to the airlines serving Gatwick and to tour operators. It wants airlines to sell train tickets on aircraft and tour operators to include a train ticket in package holidays.</p>

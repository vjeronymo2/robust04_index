			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Dutch armada fights to keep freight system afloat: Skippers' 'barge bourses' are being skirted THE EASIEST way to spot a Dutch barge on the river Rhine is to look for the tell-tale signs of family life on board. Lace curtains hanging in front of the windows of the living quarters, geraniums adorning the skipper's bridge and children playing in fenced-in areas on the ship's deck are all clues to the barge's Dutch origins. More so than their counterparts in Germany, the river barges of the Netherlands are floating family businesses - as well as the ultimate in mobile homes. Over 80 per cent of Dutch barges are manned by husband-and-wife teams who live aboard and send their children to special boarding schools for barge families during the week. Like farms, the barges are handed down from generation to generation. Now, however, some members of the Dutch fleet of skipper-owned barges fear that their survival and their very way of life could be endangered, and they have gone on strike in protest. Their anger is aimed not only at looming liberalisation of Europe's inland waterway transport but also at the increased tendency of customers on the north-south route into Belgium and France to skirt the 'barge bourses' which allocate cargoes among skippers in rotation and which ensure that freight rates do not fall below a minimum floor. 'Eventually, there won't be an independent operator left on the rivers. They'll be driven out by shipping companies,' says Mr Jan Ardon, a skipper on the 'action committee' of strikers and protesters. For the past five weeks, protesters among the Netherlands' 4,500-strong skipper owners have blockaded locks, pelted their working colleagues with eggs and stones and generally attempted to disrupt traffic in a country that is criss-crossed by canals and rivers. On Wednesday, 60 protesters seized an ocean-going Cypriot cargo ship in the port of Rotterdam for nearly four hours to support their demand that the 'tourderole' system of cargo allocation for destinations in Belgium and France be declared mandatory by law. The increasingly bitter protests started in June after a Belgian company, Prayon, halted its previous practice of finding transport for its phosphate cargoes through the bourse and signed a fixed contract with a single shipping company instead. The change means that one customer's annual freight traffic worth Fl 3.5m (Pounds 1.2m) has been lost to the traditional tourderole system, raising fears that minimum freight rates will eventually be undercut and then scrapped altogether. Mr Barend Biesheuvel, a former prime minister appointed by the Dutch government to mediate in the dispute, made a significant concession to the protesters recently by offering to make cargo allocations between the Netherlands and Belgium mandatory until the EC has worked out its plans for inland waterways. But strikers rejected the plan because they fear customers will quickly sign up permanent shippers in the year it takes to get legislation through parliament. 'What's the use of saving the tourderole system if there's no business left to divide?' Mr Ardon asks. They also want the government to act forcefully to persuade the rest of Europe to get tourderole written into European law, despite EC opposition to horizontal price-fixing. The strikers say 1,500 barges support their actions by staying at their berths and refusing to take cargoes. The stoppages and disruption are directed at dry bulk cargoes such as animal feed and iron ore. Barge-borne traffic of containers and liquid cargoes already fall outside the scope of the 'skippers' bourses.' The Inland Waterways Transport Information Office, whose aim is to promote barge traffic, notes the dispute centres on only one route out of the Netherlands. Traffic down the Rhine into Germany, the main barge artery in Europe, is unaffected, as these cargoes are outside the tourderole system. Within the Netherlands, only 18 per cent of cargoes are allocated through the bourses, mainly grains, feeds, artificial fertilisers and some coal shipments. Other cargoes, such as sand and gravel, are left to market forces. However, skippers say the presence of tourderole provides a safety net for all barge owners in all segments of the market. Mr Ardon says skippers will continue protests for the rest of the summer if necessary. 'Around this time of the year it's normal to be idle for three to four weeks while waiting for the next cargo,' he notes. 'We can hold out perhaps two or three weeks longer before the financial problems begin.'</p>

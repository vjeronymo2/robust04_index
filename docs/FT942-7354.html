			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Indian Airlines settles pay dispute with engineers State-owned Indian Airlines said yesterday it had settled a pay dispute with engineers, ending their 10-day strike that had disrupted flights, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The Press Trust of India said the airline, which flies mainly domestic routes, agreed to a 45 per cent increase in the allowances of some 860 striking engineers. Indian Airlines officials said earlier they had invited the engineers for talks on a productivity-linked incentive scheme after they had rejected a 30 per cent wage increase. The engineers began a go-slow on May 16 to back demands for wage parity with their higher-paid counterparts in Air India, the country's international air carrier. Indian Airlines, in the red since private airlines were allowed to compete against it three years ago, said earlier it could not afford to pay what would have amounted to a 90 per cent wage rise. It lost more than Rs100m (Pounds 2.1m) in revenues during the go-slow.</p>

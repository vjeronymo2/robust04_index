			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Major says Bosnia war could spread Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said yesterday that a UN withdrawal from former Yugoslavia would have tragic consequences, including the probable spread of the conflict beyond the borders of Bosnia. At the same time, British officials accompanying the prime minister to the European security summit in Budapest said a pull-out might become inevitable within a few weeks' time, because of the worsening conditions in the war zone. 'There will a tragedy if the situation on the ground makes it impossible for Unprofor (the UN protection force) to carry out its mandate and forces it to withdraw,' Mr Major told fellow heads of government from more than 50 nations of Europe and North America. British officials said they took some comfort from the fact that the presidents of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia had all, over the past 48 hours, assured the UK of their continued support for the UN's presence in the conflict zone. The officials also reported signs of progress towards agreement on a Bosnia-wide ceasefire, seen as vitally necessary if a UN pull-out is to be averted. At present, the Bosnian Serbs are pressing for an indefinite ceasefire while the Moslem-led government prefers a time limit on any truce. US president Bill Clinton appealed to the Bosnian Serbs to desist from aggression and enter negotiations on the basis of the internationally agreed peace plan. 'Settle your differences at the negotiating table, not the battlefield,' he said in Budapest, reflecting Washington's new emphasis on a diplomatic approach to settling the Bosnian crisis. Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic struck a militant tone in his speech to the summit, denouncing the failure of all international organisations to deal with the conflict in his country and the Bosnian Serb assault on the northern enclave of Bihac. 'The whole of the international community, embodied in the UN and the mighty Nato, cannot save one endangered city,' he said. He said the situation in Bosnia reflected the 'hesitation, incompetence and sometimes ill will' of the west, and denounced Russia for supporting the Serbs at the UN. He said the result of the war would be a 'discredited UN, a ruined Nato and demoralised Europeans'. The Bosnian leader said Paris and London had been described as 'Serbia's protectors' because they had prevented all attempts to counter Serb aggression against his country. 'No one can force our 150,000 soldiers to hand over their weapons,' he added, calling the conflict a 'war of liberation' which would not be lost. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said the Bosnian leader had adopted a more conciliatory stance in private. 'I've just had the most constructive discussion I have ever had with President Izetbegovic,' he told BBC radio. Mr Hurd said he and his French counterpart, Mr Alain Juppe, had on Sunday 'rammed home' to Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic that he must do his utmost to ensure that the UN could continue to operate. 'Otherwise he will find that the UN will be forced to withdraw,' he added. See Editorial Comment</p>

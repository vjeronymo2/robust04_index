			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAPTIST GROUP TO LAUNCH CABLE TV PROGRAM ON BLACK LIFE, ACHIEVEMENTS  </P> <P> The National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc. plans to launch a cable TV news  magazine on black life and achievements, the denomination's president, the Rev.  T. J. Jemison, announced.  </P> <P> It will deal with "education, politics, civics -- not just religion -- all the  problems of the world," said Jemison, who was in Nashville for the  denomination's annual meeting and dedication of its new $10-million Baptist  World Center.  </P> <P> The denomination is the country's third largest Protestant body -- 7.5 million  members by its count -- after the Southern Baptists and United Methodists.  </P> <P> Jemison, a Baton Rouge, La., pastor, said the cable program, "The Black World  Today," will emphasize "good news regarding the black community" instead of  "reports of drugs, crime and violence on the nightly news."  </P> <P> The program is to be carried on the new Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, an  interdenominational cable network.  </P></p>

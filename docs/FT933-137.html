			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Alexon slides Pounds 10m into red ALEXON Group, the struggling women's wear retailer, yesterday sought to convey an up-beat message on its future in spite of deeper than expected pre-tax losses of Pounds 10m in the first half. Mr John Osborn, the chief executive appointed after shareholder pressure led to the departure of previous management in April, said Alexon had 'broken the back of the problem'. Gearing, which had been 'out in the stratosphere' even after the Pounds 16.4m rights issue in August, was now expected to be less than 50 per cent by the end of the year. Stocks were 13 per cent lower since January at Pounds 30m, and the cost reduction programme was well ahead of schedule. Alexon expected to have cut 'comfortably more' than the estimated Pounds 3m in costs this year, he said. An exceptional charge of Pounds 4.3m for ration-alisation was Pounds 300,000 higher than expected due to extra office closures and redundancies. The group increased sales by 14 per cent to Pounds 55.3m for the six months to July 31. The operating loss was Pounds 4.7m, against a profit of Pounds 2.8m. Some Pounds 2m of the swing was due to the decision to spread occupancy costs evenly across the year, instead of concen-trating them in the second half. Pre-tax losses of Pounds 10m compared with a profit of Pounds 2.1m last time. Mr Osborn said both the Alexon and Eastex ranges had increased sales in the first half, while Dash had incurred higher losses. The group intended to convert some 20 Dash shops to the new Ann Harvey size 16-plus concept next month and a further 20 in the spring. Mr Osborn said that due to the long lead times on the Alexon range, the new design team had not been able to make any material changes to the products. It was expected that the range would begin to see a return by the autumn of next year. The chief executive was optimistic about his company's chances of survival. 'We have a lot on our plate,' said Mr Osborn, 'but we are a hell of a lot healthier than we were.' The group, which paid a 3p interim dividend last year, is suspending the pay-out. Losses per share of 37.47p compared with a profit of 3.05p last time. COMMENT Mr Osborn is doing all the right things to encourage shareholders. The trends in stocks, gearing and working capital are all pointing the right way. Even though the losses were expected to be Pounds 8m, what's another Pounds 2m when investors are offered the hope of survival. From an investment point of view, things may be slightly different, however. It is early days yet. Estimates are being plucked out of the air and range from losses this year of Pounds 9m to Pounds 13m. For existing investors, there seems little to gain by pulling out and possibly much more benefit in holding on, although the risks remain. Potential new investors might want to wait until the company's attraction is less its new management and more its day-to-day business.</p>

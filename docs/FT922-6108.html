			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmer's Viewpoint - From farmyard to fuel tank / Agriculture could become a driving force for industry and transport AS LONG ago as 1912 the man who invented the 20th century's most economic motor engine, Rudolph Diesel, said: 'The use of vegetable oils (as fuel) may be negligible today but such products could very well become as important as mineral oil and coal tar products'. The concept of using farm crops as a source of motive power is therefore hardly new. Indeed in Mr Diesel's day, in spite of his inventions, most transport was based on genuine live horsepower and the animals derived their energy from hay and oats. So perhaps it was easier for him to conceive of a similar source of power for his engines than it is for the present generation more used to relying on non-renewable fossil fuels. The question is, why are we still using up precious reserves of crude oil when we could be running our tractors, lorries and cars on fuel derived from crops grown afresh every year on farms? Moreover, if we were using such low-carbon fuels the level of air pollution would be much reduced and both the environment and human health would benefit. The reason, of course, is the relative cost. As a rough rule of thumb it would be necessary for the price of oil to rise by a factor of three or, alternatively for the price of farm based fuels produced from EC-grown crops to come down by two thirds, for the relative costs of the two products to correspond. Clearly oil is too cheap and the cost of growing non food crops too high for the environmentally attractive idea to be viable. No one would wish to see the price of oil rise by the necessary amount for fear or provoking world recession, And farmers could not afford to grow the appropriate crops at such a reduced return. But times may be changing. Last week's Brussels agreement on reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy, for instance, will mean that the prices farmers get for crops like cereals, oil seed rape and in due course, sugar beet, will be much closer to world levels, in other words, lower. The fact that there will be compensation for the loss of income should be viewed separately. The relevant point is that it will be cheaper for industry, or whoever, to buy crops from farmers and this will narrow the gap between them and fossil fuels. A few weeks ago the EC proposed and the UK government accepted that a carbon tax, designed to encourage consumers to use the fuels that cause the least air pollution, should be imposed to raise the cost of the fossil fuels mainly responsible for the problem. The proposal has not yet been endorsed by community environment ministers, but the delay appears to be only technical and to do with drafting. Assuming that this is the case, while the speed of introduction and the initial extent of this tax remains to be determined, it is likely to become EC policy and over time will raise the price of fossil fuels. Meanwhile it has also been agreed that the levels of excise duty charged on so-called 'bio-fuels' , that is those derived from vegetable sources, should be limited across the community to 10 per cent of those charged on the fossil fuels they replace. Add all these measures together and it is clear that the cost gap which existed only weeks ago is now much smaller, always accepting of course that this is the result of political manipulation rather than market forces. It might not be too fanciful to believe, however, that the environment and green policies in general will continue to receive favourable treatment by governments for the foreseeable future. The community would not be treading a new path if it developed a bio-fuel industry. In fossil fuel-starved Austria for instance such an initiative is already well advanced. Farmers grow oil seed rape and sell it at government subsidised price to processors who convert it into fuel for tractors and lorries and then sell it back to them. The performance of the vegetable-powered vehicles is said to be only marginally lower than it would be with fossil-based diesel and the conversion from one to the other can be done in any farm workshop. How much the success of this venture relies on aid from the Austrian government is not immediately clear but lack of other sources of fuel was clearly the motivation and at least it has proved it can be done. Neither is diesel fuel the only one that can be replaced from farm based sources. In Brazil, another country without its own fossil fuel resources, many of the country's cars run on fuel derived from alcohol made from sugar cane. It can also be made from maize or wheat starch and during the 1970s oil crisis US fuel companies set up plants to manufacture what they called 'gasahol'. Now that the oil price has fallen it is seldom seen but the technology exists and given a favourable cost comparison could be reactivated. Moreover there are many other as yet unexploited industrial uses for farm crops. It is well known that it is possible to manufacture plastic from wheat starch. What is more the product is bio-degradable, making it environmentally desirable. Disposable nappies made from farm based starch are already being widely used in the US as are engine fuel filters and absorbent gels. They too have superior environmental properties compared with fossil based equivalents and after use need not be buried in landfill sites but can be composted and returned to the soil as an organic fertiliser. There is even a type of printer's ink made in the US from soya bean oil. Presumably it enables journalists to eat their words if the need arises. Could it be that non-food uses of farm crops is an idea whose time has come? Will the combination of global environmental concern and the realisation that reserves of fossil fuels are finite persuade governments to take the extra step, now shorter than ever before, to make such enterprises viable? Certainly it will have to happen sometime - when the oil runs out. It would be potentially disastrous if the present concern about surplus food production that prevails in the EC were to blind politicians to the opportunities that could be provided by efficient, cheap, renewable crop production.</p>

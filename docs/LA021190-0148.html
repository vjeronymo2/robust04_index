			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW YOUNGSTERS MAKING A BASKETBALL TOUR  </P> <P> Fourteen young basketball players from Moscow began a 12-day, five-game tour of  south Louisiana Friday, playing electronic games at a retail franchise,  checking out the clothes at a Western wear store and watching their friends  from St. Amant High play a game at Tara High in Baton Rouge.  </P> <P> The visit follows a December trip by the St. Amant basketball team to Moscow  for four games against Soviet prep teams. St. Amant was 3-1 against the  Russians.  </P> <P> St. Amant High raised about $50,000 to send its team to Moscow and another  $15,000 to defray expenses of the Soviet team here, most of the money from  corporate sponsorships, said St. Amant Coach Kent Schexnaydre.  </P> <P> From such simple beginnings, it is hoped, great bonds will be forged between  the world's two super powers.  </P> <P> "You know this is a wonderful opportunity our countries have. If we start doing  it at that level -- you know, small, 15 or 20 kids -- that's how you've got to  start," said David Young, owner of a Gonzales consulting firm who helped set up  the trip.  </P> <P> "And so I mean it's been a good project to me because of that. If we're going  to start building a bridge between our two countries, you've got to start at  that level."  </P> <P> The team's itinerary includes sightseeing throughout the bayou country of  southeast Louisiana and games games at St. Amant on Feb. 12, in New Orleans  against Archbishop Shaw on Feb. 14 and St. Augustine on Feb. 15, at East  Ascension High on Feb. 17 and at Catholic High of Baton Rouge on Feb. 18.  </P> <P> Between games, the team and six chaperones have a full itinerary of  sightseeing, including boat tours of the Mississippi River and Blind River, a  visit to an alligator farm, a tour of the Houmas House plantation, a rodeo at  Louisiana State, a visit to the French Quarter and a taste of pre-Mardi Gras  festivities in New Orleans.  </P> <P> Young said the exchange was unique in that it brought together teams  representing schools instead of national teams.  </P> <P> Young, who arranged Louisiana chef John Folse's culinary exhibition in Moscow  during the 1988 summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet President  Mikhail Gorbachev, said St. Amant coach Kent Schnexnaydre, a longtime friend,  approached him with the team exchange idea early last year.  </P> <P> Vladimir Gomelsky, a basketball commentator for Soviet national television  serving as a team interpreter, said he was elated when Young brought up the  idea.  </P> <P> "I had two thoughts in my mind when David explained to me about the exchange,"  Gomelsky said. "First, it will be very useful for the youth of both countries  to get acquainted to communicate with each other on the basketball court and  out.  </P> <P> "The other thing is that I am from a basketball family. My grandmother, my  mother, my father, all of them are coaches ... I like basketball so much that  any possibility to enlarge basketball contacts between our two countries is  good.  </P> <P> "On every age level, I would like to enlarge basketball contacts between the  United States and the USSR. That's why I liked the idea very much and tried my  best to make it possible."  </P> <P> Gomelsky's father, Alexander Gomelsky, is the president of the Soviet  Basketball Federation and coached the 1988 Soviet basketball team that won the  Olympic gold medal. He arranged the Soviet end of the exchange.  </P> <P> The dangers of capitalist distractions were not lost on some of the Soviet  players, however.  </P> <P> Slova Zeshienov, 15, was already sizing up the possibilities -- five minutes  off the plane.  </P> <P> "The people are very nice. They are very interesting," Zeshienov said. "And all  the television and everything is different and is fascinating. But I want to  try to concentrate on the games."  </P> <P> And just how confident was the teen-age good will ambassador from one of  Moscow's elite prep sports schools?  </P> <P> "All of them, obviously," Zeshinov said when asked for a prediction on how many  games his team would win in the United States.  </P> <P> Sergei Bezrodnov, 17, the oldest member of the Soviet team, said he hoped to  hone his skills against the Americans.  </P> <P> "I would like to see the American style of the game. I want to gain the  experience and become a better all-around basketball player," Bezrodnov said.  "Basically for me, the basketball experience will be -- speaking about my  future career as a basketball player -- more important, but I am still very  excited about all the other parts of our staying here."  </P> <P> And like the smart American athlete, Bezrodnov was a little more cautious in  assessing his team's chances in the series.  </P> <P> "We'll win one, for sure," he said.  </P></p>

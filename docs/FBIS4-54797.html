			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- "When President Kovac  asked me to take up my duties, I assumed that all the matters  concerning my appointment to the post of minister had been  cleared," Economy Minister Peter Magvasi commented today on the  speculation that he is the member of the government with  positive screening certificate. All the senior officials are  required to have a clean record regarding cooperation with the  communist secret police (StB).    "I am clean before myself," Magvasi told CTK, when asked  about this. Asked whether the accusation stems from forces  trying to "sidetrack" the SDL in Moravcik's cabinet, Magvasi  replied: "Maybe."    Magvasi said it was not accidental that his past is being  questioned shortly after he "pointed to the schedule of the  coupon privatization in Slovakia." He added that he did not  question this privatization technique, but he just intended  "that the citizen is not 'cheated' by the hectic and  unprofessional pace."    Premier Jozef Moravcik admitted there was tension between  Magvasi (Democratic Left Party, SDL) and Privatization Minister  Milan Janicina (National Democratic Party-New Alternative).  Magvasi favors standard privatization techniques, while  Janicina is considered to be an advocate of the former method.    The first wave of privatization ended in January 1993.  Ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's government did not favor  this method of privatization. The new government of Jozef  Moravcik has said the second wave could be launched in the  autumn.</p>

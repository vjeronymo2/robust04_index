			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Shop until you drop - US-style: Martin Dickson, complete with his 'I mega-shopped the mega-mall' T-shirt, examines the phenomenon of a mid-west shopping complex which has become a tourist attraction in its own right The Pepsi Ripsaw roller-coaster might not be among the world's most terrifying amusement park attractions. But it makes up for its relative lack of stomach-churning thrills with its bizarre location: in a fun-fair at the heart of the largest shopping mall in the United States. If your feet are killing you, refresh your spirits with a ride on the Ripsaw, careering for 2 1/2 minutes above indoor trees, roof tops and restaurants and through a miniature, artificial mountain. If the children are playing up, and refusing to accompany you inside yet more clothing shops, distract them with a ride on another of the fair's attractions, the Log Chute. This will carry them in a hollowed-out tree trunk through a mountain filled with animated figures - and drop them down a 40ft waterfall. The Mall of America, which lies on the outskirts of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and opened its doors two years ago this month, is a vast temple to consumerism - the ultimate statement of faith that the chief national pastime of the US is not baseball or fishing but shopping. (Actually, the main pastime could soon be gambling, for casinos are springing up like weeds across the land.) The 23-ride amusement park sits in the middle of a round, four-storey doughnut containing more than 400 shops, four large department stores, a 14-screen cinema and an 18-hole miniature golf course ('experience the challenge of its two waterfalls and seven streams'). There are bars and nightclubs where you can play pool, watch a televised football game, listen to a comedy routine or learn to dance, country-style. You can even get married. The Chapel of Love, located (fittingly) just across a walkway from an outlet promoting local casinos, can provide you with 'a decorated, 75-seat chapel, taped music selections, and the services of an officiate, all offered in 1 1/2 -hour packages starting at under Dollars 500'. You can have a country-and-western themed wedding, rock 'n' roll nuptials, or a Vegas-style affair. 'We can even get you Elvis,' says MaryAnne London Gears, the chapel's manager. In the Mall of America's alternative reality, the impossible becomes possible. This, after all, is a world where the temperature is always a perfect 70`F (21`C); where you can sit in the street 'outside' a perfectly reconstructed Italian country restaurant, yet still be indoors under the mall's vast glass canopy; and where you can indulge your fantasies of becoming a top model with a visit to Glamor Shots where staff will make up your face, banishing unsightly spots and pimples, dress you in fashionable clothes and capture the 'glamorous new you' on film. That is part of the hype, hoopla and kitsch. But in the real world of hard-nosed financial investment, the mall represents two big gambles: that a complex of such size can attract enough customers to make a decent return; and that, by mixing entertainment with its wares, it can compete successfully with rival forms of leisure and electronic shopping. John Wheeler, the Minnesota mall's general manager, says: 'We've recognised that people today want a good reason to leave their homes. We want to offer them a whole variety of reasons to come here, which includes not only the mall's goods and services but the experience of the whole. 'The whole concept of experience is very, very important to us.' If this 'experience' succeeds - and the jury is still out - it will set an example for mixed retailing and entertainment which the rest of the world could follow. But the company which manages the Minnesota mall is encouraged enough by early trading to be putting entertainment centres into several other malls being built, while some smaller US malls have begun offering rides on ferris wheels, dodgems and carousels. Minneapolis, a stolid city in the mid-western farm belt - an area from which author Garrison Keillor drew the inspiration for his laconic tales of the fictional Lake Wobegon - might seem an unlikely setting for this bread-and-circuses approach to selling. But it has played an important role in the 40-year history of the US mall, and for good reason: Minnesota's harsh winters and broiling, insect-infested summers make shopping in an enclosed, temperature-controlled building an extremely attractive proposition. America's first mall, the Southdale Centre, opened in 1956 only a few miles from what is now the Mall of America, and clones multiplied rapidly across the land in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. By the end of the last decade, though, the regional mall movement looked in danger of exhaustion. Americans were devoting less leisure time to shopping and, when they did venture out, they tended to patronise strip shopping centres near their homes or the growing new 'factory outlets' - stores offering slightly imperfect or end-of-line goods from well-known brand manufacturers at knock-down prices. At the same time, mall owners became aware of another potent threat: electronic shopping. The converging film, computer and telecommunications industries will eventually create mass-market, inter-active television that allows consumers to order an immense array of goods from home at the touch of a remote control button. This is unlikely to mean the end of shopping as we have known it; humans are social beings and, from time immemorial, have found pleasurable distraction in visiting bazaars. But all these forces are putting pressure on shops to make parting with money an entertaining experience. So, too, does the fact that people enjoying themselves in an entirely artificial world are more likely to cast their credit cards around with wild, impulsive abandon than those trudging from store front to store front in the rain. The Mall of America's official slogan ('There's a place for fun in your life') acknowledges these motives implicitly. Fun is, by definition, frivolous and guilt-free - and shopping should be the same. Yet, the first big test of shopping-as-entertainment actually took place in Canada, where, in 1985, a family of real estate developers, the Ghermezian brothers, built a mall near the city of Edmonton, Alberta, which incorporated an amusement park, hockey rink and artificial lake. It succeeded, generating substantially higher revenue per square foot than a conventional mall. The Ghermezians then joined up with one of America's largest mall developers, Indianapolis-based Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, to build the Minneapolis pleasure dome, with a US teachers' pension fund putting up the bulk of the equity. In the event, the most grandiose plans for the Mall of America - such as an aquarium and a monorail - were deferred because of the nation's 1990-1991 recession, and it ended up somewhat smaller than its Canadian cousin. Even so, when the mall opened in August 1992, many retailing analysts pronounced it a dangerous gamble out of step with Americans' desire to spend less time shopping. 'It's risky, very risky,' declared one New York consultant. 'Few people really see shopping as recreation any more. People are time-strapped.' Two years on, the arguments continue. Last year, though, 37m people visited the Mall of America - 7m more than Walt Disney World in Florida (although the figures are not directly comparable since the Minneapolis total would have been boosted by repeat visits from local residents). They spent Dollars 625m. Wheeler maintains these figures are in line with, or exceed, the project's financial and traffic projections. But critics point out that the mall is not yet fully occupied - at least 10 per cent of its space is vacant - and question whether its owners are anywhere near making a decent return on their real estate investment, particularly given the generous leases that had to be offered to attract its four big anchor department stores: Macy's, Sears, Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom. Wheeler will say only that rental rates have gone up since it became clear the mall had 'critical mass', making them comparable to other super-regional shopping centres in the area. Yet, there are persistent reports in Minneapolis that some of the department stores have had disappointing sales. This, however, is not the case at Nordstrom, which sells up-market clothes and is one of the fastest-growing retail groups in the US. Eric Nordstrom, who runs the outlet, says it has generated the largest first-year sales of any branch since the one in Chicago four years ago. He adds: 'I think it surprised everyone in our company.' But will it last, once the initial novelty has worn off? To succeed, Wheeler says the mall needs to generate 70 per cent of its traffic from Minneapolis and the mainly rural 150-mile radius around the city. It has now reached that point after some initial hostility from local residents. 'People are finding that you don't need to ride a roller-coaster to buy a pair of socks,' Nordstrom notes. The other 30 per cent of visitors - who account for half the dollars spent - come from more than 150 miles away and are striking evidence that the mall's publicity machine has succeeded in making the centre a big tourist attraction in its own right. Its very name, Mall of America, and its stars and stripes logo, play up the idea that this is a national asset. Many tourists come from the surrounding mid-western and Rocky Mountain states, lured by one-day 'shopper's special' air fares. Charter flights to the mall, which lies close to Minneapolis airport, have been organised from as far away as Britain and Japan. 'People are vacationing here from Florida,' says an incredulous Nordstrom. 'I don't understand it.' He adds, quickly: 'But you don't have to understand it.' What makes this popularity particularly surprising is that very few of the stores are unique. Most are simply outlets of large US chains; identical shops can be found in hundreds of malls across the nation. That, together with the mall's bland, characterless atmosphere, means some tourists will leave disappointed. At bottom, the centre is as soulless as . . . well, as a trip to a shopping mall. For millions more, though, its sheer size and entertainments will be justification enough for a visit. After all, it is not every shopping centre that can sell you a T-shirt emblazoned with the proud, guilt-free boast: 'I mega-shopped the mega-mall.'</p>

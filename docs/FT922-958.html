			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Leading Article: New direction in Israel To a world which was growing cynical at the prospect for progress in Middle East peace negotiations, the result of Tuesday's Israeli election marks a refreshing new departure. Not only has a party that promises to engage much more constructively in the peace process emerged as the overall winner. Labour has also won by a margin convincing enough to put it at the centre of a coalition government that can proceed rapidly to implement its full agenda, starting with a freeze on Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and interim autonomy arrangements for the Palestinians there. The west, and especially the US administration, whose tireless efforts to keep Israel and its Arab foes at the negotiating table had an important influence on the election campaign, has every interest in welcoming the new Israeli government and helping it to keep its promises - as well as prodding the Palestinians and Arab states to stick to theirs. The victory achieved by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the 70-year-old Labour leader, is the most decisive result produced by Israel's notoriously fissiparous electoral system in at least 15 years. It is also a humiliation for Mr Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, which has dominated the country's politics to increasingly baleful effect in the interim and which has blocked all worthwhile progress in the Middle East peace talks for the last six months. Above all, it is a sign that Israelis are tiring of the politics of isolation and are coming to understand that political intransigence carries a price, in deteriorating relations with the US and reduced access to American aid. Cautious pragmatist Labour's 45 seats, coupled with the 12 won by the Meretz party to its left and the usual handful for the Israeli Arab parties, mean that it is in control and has no need to strike onerous coalition deals with religious or right-wing rivals. Indeed, Mr Rabin, a cautious pragmatist who campaigned on a ticket giving 'security' at least as much weight as 'peace' and was widely assumed to be manoeuvring his way towards another national unity government with the Likud, may find his party's mandate uncomfortably strong as he comes under pressure from the newly-confident left to step up the pace. He will be as conscious as anyone of the dangers of confrontation with the right - and especially with Jewish settlers in the occupied territories - as Israel moves towards the difficult territorial decisions that it has avoided for the past 25 years. High expectations Even the first steps down this path will be far from easy. Settlers have the capacity to play havoc with an attempted freeze on new settlements and with the Palestinian elections that Mr Rabin will want to stage as a prelude to allowing limited self-government. Externally, there is a danger of the Labour victory generating excessively high expectations that will later be dashed - when, for example, Mr Rabin fails to talk directly to the Palestine Liberation Organisation or makes clear that his idea of exchanging territory for peace is much more limited than those of his enemies and even his allies. For the Labour leader, as for most Israelis, there is no question of handing back much more than the densely populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza, only extremely limited flexibility over Syria's demand for the return of the Golan Heights, and absolutely no question of giving up sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem. He has also consistently argued that there is no room for an independent Palestinian state. Israel's Arab negotiating partners - who will never have a better opportunity to advance their cause through talks than now  - would do well to bear these eventual obstacles in mind, and concentrate on transitional measures rather than demanding to know the shape of a final settlement in advance. For the time being, though, momentum is all. President Bush and Mr James Baker, his sec-retary of state, understand that and will want to encourage the new Israeli government to plunge now into intensive negotiations with the Palestinians. If Mr Rabin agrees, and if he can make a freeze on new settlements stick, then Israel can reap its reward in the form of the Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees that Washington has been withholding.</p>

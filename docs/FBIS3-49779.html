			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This evening, Romania's President Iliescu received  the chief of staff of the French Army Jacques Lanxade, who is  currently paying an official visit to our country.    Cooperation between Romania and France in the military area  and in other areas of joint interest were the major issues of  discussion.    After the meeting, Mr. Jacques Lanxade told the journalists  the following: Together with the president of the republic [as  heard], who did me the honor of receiving me, we first discussed  cooperation between France and Romania in the areas of security  and defense, and then we surveyed the situation in Europe in  general and in this region in particular. And finally, we  discussed the evolution of security structures in Europe after  the NATO summit in Brussels.    The French guest also said: I can say that the relations  between Romania and France in all spheres, and particularly in  the area of defense, are very dynamic, very warm, and are based  on history. We resumed these contacts more than two years ago  and we are expecting to develop them. I am very optimistic that  we will manage to accomplish durable things together.    Answering the question of what his opinions about Romania  are  currently, Jacque Lanxade said: I believe that Romania is  making efforts to restore a difficult economic situation, a  situation with which other countries are also currently  confronted, countries that have changed their situation in  recent years. Romania is seeking to make its actions felt in  the international community and is developing cooperation with  several countries. I believe that Romania is a country in which  much hope can be laid.    Asked whether he has visited Romania before, he answered: I  know Romania only a little, because I arrived only this morning  and will start visiting it tomorrow. But I arrived here mainly  to work.    Previously, the French Military delegation was also received  by Romania's national defense minister, Lieutenant General  Niculae Spiroiu. The latter briefed the guest about the actions  taken to restructure and modernize the Romanian Army and to  achieve the competitiveness of this army with the armies of the  countries that have a long democratic tradition. The sides  exchanged views on ways to ensure security and preserve  stability and peace in Europe and throughout the world.    The sides also revealed the joint wish to develop bilateral  relations in the interest of the two armies.    Tonight, the French military delegation was also received by  the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodor Melescanu.</p>

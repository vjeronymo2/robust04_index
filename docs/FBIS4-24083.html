			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament June 22 SAPA -- The Senate is to have 11  standing committees for government portfolios, with 11 senators  on each committee. This was decided on Wednesday [22 June] by  the senate rules committee.    President of the Senate, Mr Kobie Coetsee, asked the parties  to submit their members' names to the parliamentary secretariat  by noon on Thursday. He said experience would guide whether the  grouping of the portfolios needed to be changed in future.    Secretary to Parliament Mr Robin Douglas pointed out that  according to a press statement by the speaker, debate on  legislation was due to start next week.    The African National Congress is to have six senators on  each  committee, the National Party two and the Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP], Freedom Front and Democratic Party one each.    Three house committees are also to be formed to deal with  internal parliamentary arrangements, the library and catering  facilities.    Following complaints from Senator Naren Singh (IFP) about  "untenable" office accommodation for his party, the committee  resolved the matter would be addressed urgently by a delegation  led by ANC chief whip Senator Bulelani Ngcuka.    The committee concurred with a decision of the National  Assembly's rules committee earlier this week that France's  President Francois Mitterrand be formally invited to address a  joint meeting of both houses during his state visit to South  Africa next month.    The address is to take place on Monday, July 4, at 11.30AM.</p>

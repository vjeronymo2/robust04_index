			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREAT WESTERN EXPECTS LOSS OF $75 MILLION IN 4TH PERIOD  </P> <P> Great Western Financial, the nation's second-largest thrift and one of the  healthiest survivors of the nation's savings and loan mess, disclosed Tuesday  that it expects to post a $75-million loss in the fourth quarter stemming from  problem commercial and apartment loans.  </P> <P> Great Western said most of the loans were made outside of California, primarily  in Arizona, Texas and Florida. The bulk of them also were made before 1987,  when Great Western virtually stopped making such loans in favor of more  conservative single-family home loans and consumer loans.  </P> <P> Although securities analysts had expected Great Western to show some problems  with loans, they said the loss is surprising and shows an aggressive move by  Great Western to rid itself of its problem loans and properties.  </P> <P> "Great Western is one of the Rolls-Royces of the business. It's not a case  where you expect to see any engine trouble, or even any sputtering," said  Jonathan Gray, a thrift analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New  York.  </P> <P> Specifically, Great Western will devalue foreclosed real estate by $50 million,  set aside $50 million as a reserve for specific problem loans and set aside  another $100 million as a general reserve for unspecified loans that may become  a problem in the future. Taking the actions will free Great Western to sell its  problem properties for money that can then be invested in profitable loans.  </P> <P> Great Western Financial, the Beverly Hills-based parent of Great Western Bank,  is posting its first quarterly loss in seven years. Despite the large loss, the  company said, it expects to post a profit of more than $100 million for the  entire year, compared to $248 million in 1988. In the first nine months, Great  Western earned $177 million, compared to $188 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> James F. Montgomery, Great Western chief executive, said in an interview that  the announcement is not a sign of widespread problems in real estate lending  for Great Western. He said that the thrift's $25-billion portfolio of  single-family mortgages is in good shape and that Great Western decided to take  the large loss now to deal with its problems as it enters the 1990s.  </P> <P> "It's no fun to do this, but we want to get it behind us," Montgomery said.  </P> <P> The problems generally involve loans for developing office buildings, shopping  centers and apartment complexes.  </P> <P> Great Western is the latest of several financial institutions to show problems  in Arizona, which is suffering through a real estate recession caused mostly by  overbuilding and a slowdown in immigration. Other institutions with problems in  Arizona include First Interstate Bancorp, Great American Bank, Security Pacific  Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp.  </P> <P> Montgomery attributed the problems with the loans to two other general factors:  the continuing impact of the 1986 tax reforms that made investing in commercial  projects less desirable and an abundance of property being unloaded by troubled  thrifts.  </P> <P> Analyst Gray said that Great Western's problem is not that its troubled assets  have been increasing but that the size of its problem assets has remained  steady and is not declining.  </P> <P> Great Western said it that its non-performing assets -- made up of real estate  that it has foreclosed on and loans that are delinquent 90 days or more --  total $718 million, or about 2% of its total assets. Single-family mortgages,  considered among the safest of loans, now make up more than 80% of Great  Western's $30 billion in loans.  </P> <P> Separately, Great Western Financial disclosed that it plans to raise $300  million through a debt offering and that the money will be shifted to the  thrift to bolster its capital, which is the cushion financial institutions  maintain to protect against losses. Great Western said it should easily meet  new, tougher federal standards that go into effect within two weeks.  </P> <P> GREAT WESTERN FINANCIAL AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Beverly Hills-based holding company for Great Western Bank, the nation's  third-largest thrift.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.22IN:3.10IN:1.67IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year ended Dec. 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3.17  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3.97  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3.77  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Net income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 248  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 210  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 301  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Assets $32.8 billion  </P> <P> Loans $29.1 billion  </P> <P> Capitalization $9.5 billion  </P> <P> Shares outstanding 128.2 million  </P> <P> 12-month price range $14.25-$25.125  </P> <P> Tuesday close (NYSE) $19.25, unchanged  </P> <P> Source: Standard &amp; Poor's  </P></p>

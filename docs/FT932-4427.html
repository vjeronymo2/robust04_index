			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clive Smith attacks Butte Mining directors MR CLIVE SMITH, the Midland entrepreneur linked to several natural resource companies floated in the 1980s, yesterday accused directors of Butte Mining of not fulfilling their duties to shareholders. Acting as proxy for one of his daughters at yesterday's annual meeting, Mr Smith fired a series of questions regarding the company's decision to launch a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) lawsuit - in which he is one of 77 defendants - to chairman Mr David Lloyd Jacob. Butte is pursuing litigation in the US, claiming damages of more than Dollars 325m from more than 70 people, and is asking for these claims to be trebled under US anti-racketeering laws. Butte - which Mr Smith helped to float in 1987 - alleges fraud and misrepresentation on the part of various defendants, including the purchase of US assets. Past events at Butte, along with Richmond Oil &amp; Gas to which Mr Smith has also been connected, are under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Smith questioned the independence of advice being given to shareholders since both the chairman, finance director and Butte's US attorneys had a personal financial interest in the lawsuit. Mr Lloyd-Jacob said the board, which had approved the litigation, included three independent non-executives with no interest in the action. In a weighty collection of documents passed out to shareholders before the meeting, Mr Smith also questioned the sale of certain Australian assets.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (60): Top man aims to keep his word - Profile / Ernesto Zedillo Ernesto Zedillo, victorious candidate in Mexico's presidential election, takes office in December with a lot to live up to. Over the next six years, he has pledged to boost the country's lacklustre economic growth, provide around 1m new jobs a year, improve the country's highly unequal distribution of wealth - while maintaining low inflation and keeping public finances in order. A former central banker and budget minister, with an economics doctorate from Yale University, Mr Zedillo is more aware than most of the difficulties in keeping his word. Despite nearly a decade of economic reform, Mexico's economy is still suffering from a rapid trade opening and the government's tough anti-inflation policies, with many businesses struggling to compete internationally or survive in the domestic market. Mr Zedillo, though, will have much in his favour. The economy is much stronger than when President Carlos Salinas came to power six years ago. Inflation is expected this year to fall to between 6-7 per cent. The government's budget was in surplus last year, and is expected to be roughly in balance this year. The huge foreign debt that dominated economic policy throughout the 1980s has been cut: Mexico's public net debt to GDP ratio is now far lower than the average in the industrialised world. Perhaps most important, the economic restructuring that caused so much pain is finally beginning to bear fruit. Productivity in the manufacturing sector is rising by about 10 per cent a year, according to government figures. Foreign investment, drawn by the North American Free Trade Agreement, is increasing rapidly. All this is contributing to a strong increase in manufacturing exports, which in the first half of this year jumped by 20.9 per cent, and partly explains the modest recovery in economic growth of 2.2 per cent over the same period. Mr Zedillo's first task will be to establish macroeconomic policy - which he may do in conjunction with the administration if the so-called 'pacto' (the forum in which economic policy is made) is renewed. Mr Zedillo will have to choose between pushing for faster short-term growth (by loosening fiscal policy and permitting a more competitive exchange rate) or maintaining the fight against inflation (by leaving exchange rate policy unchanged, and keeping the budget in balance.) The Central Bank and Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, are widely believed to be among those advocating continuation of the fight against inflation, while Guillermo Ortiz, the influential deputy finance minister, is said to support policies more conducive to growth. Mr Zedillo's own position is unknown, but his campaign promises indicate that he is closer to Mr Ortiz. However, as a former central banker and orthodox budget minister, few believe that Mr Zedillo will want inflation to rise above present rates. The betting is that Mr Zedillo will seek some kind of middle ground, perhaps running a small budget deficit, raising the floor at which the peso can trade against the dollar from 3.056 to the present informal intervention limit of 3.25, and increasing moderately the maximum slide against the dollar from the current 40 centavos a day (about 5 per cent a year). With Mexico expected to run a current account deficit of between 6-7 per cent of GDP this year, Mr Zedillo may find it hard to loosen fiscal policy without permitting more flexibility in exchange rate policy. The impact of the 'pacto' on growth will depend in part on how domestic interest rates respond - influenced not just by exchange rate and fiscal policy, but by the domestic political situation and the international environment. The continuation of high real interest rates would likely slow credit growth, and restrain private investment. Once macroeconomic policy is established, Mr Zedillo is expected to move to boost competitiveness of the economy, essential if Mexico is to thrive under Nafta. To this end, he has pledged to spend heavily on improving infrastructure, by increasing government spending on public investment by 25 per cent, and setting up a special state fund for private infrastructure projects. Poor infrastructure was cited in a World Bank report as one of the five most serious constraints on private-sector development. The new administration has promised to encourage greater private financing of infrastructure, especially in railways, ports, and electricity, building on existing investment in telecommunications, water supply and roads. Investors will watch carefully for the choice of minister of communications and transport, who is sure to spearhead the drive to encourage private investment in sectors once dominated by the state. Elsewhere, Mr Zedillo is likely to favour further deregulation of the economy, especially at the state and municipal level, give tax breaks and subsidised credit to small and medium-sized businesses, and encourage development of more sophisticated financial markets, in particular in the area of mortgages and derivates. Mr Zedillo says he will mix his pro-market reforms with increased investment in education, training, and anti-poverty programmes to help those not benefiting from higher economic growth and to distribute wealth more evenly. But with already sharp income disparities having widened under the presidency of Carlos Salinas, who pursued much the same policies, many are sceptical that Mr Zedillo's programme will succeed in significantly reducing the gap between Mexico's rich and poor.</p>

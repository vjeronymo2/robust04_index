			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Firm bullion price picks Johannesburg up from lows Equities picked up from the session's lows, helped by the firmer gold bullion price. Foreign investors were reported as remaining reluctant to enter the market ahead of the budget on June 22 and before further clarification of economic policy. The overall index gained a net 3 at 5,586 and industrials 2 at 6,593, while golds lost 15 on balance at 1,995. The mining sector was mixed - Gencor put on 20 cents at R11.40 and Anglovaal slipped R5 to R130. Lonrho relinquished 10 cents to R9.90 in spite of higher first-half profits. De Beers shed 25 cents to R114.25, while Anglos added R1 at R232.50. Remgro bounced 25 cents to R28 following improved annual results, while Premier finished 5 cents firmer at R6.50, also following better earnings for the year. Oryx, the developing gold mine which is finalising refinancing plans, shed 15 cents to R4.50. Loraine, the marginal gold mine, receded 25 cents to R16. The Argus, threatened by strike action, dropped R3 to R45 after a strong rise on Wednesday ahead of the Argus Newspapers division's listing on June 13.</p>

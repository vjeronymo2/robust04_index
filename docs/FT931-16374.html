The Trouble with Medicine: Code of Silence (BBC2, 9.30) explores the ethical dilemmas raised by medical advances. Tonight the programme takes the old dilemma, what should doctors tell patients, which has been given a sharper edge by psychologists' claims that the success of a treatment is affected by patients' relationships with their doctors. The Sexual Imperative on C4 at 9.00 is the first of a six-part documentary on sociobiology. Even if the 'selfish gene' picture of life on earth no longer seems particularly novel, it is always useful to brush up answers to questions like, what is altruistic behaviour?

At 9.00, BBC 2 unwraps a new series about marital strife in a media household, Joking Apart. A new series of Dave Allen (ITV, 9.30) leads into Drop the Dead Donkey (C4, 10.00).</p>

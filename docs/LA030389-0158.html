			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> WEST NEWPORT OIL CO. WANTS TO BE MORE CONSIDERATE TO ITS NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> In the beginning -- which for purposes of development pretty much means the  1950s in Orange County -- nobody really cared where developers laid out  subdivisions or erected stores. There was plenty of room, traffic was not a  problem and most people thought all those new houses and stores and factories  were a good thing.  </P> <P> Now, however, putting a convenience store in some neighborhoods -- let alone an  office building -- can mean a pitched battle with the neighbors. After years of  growth, many of those neighborhoods are fighting back.  </P> <P> So the smarter developers are defusing the opposition by listening to neighbors  and, in some cases, compromising by scaling back their plans.  </P> <P> Now comes West Newport Oil Co., which wants to head off the controversy before  it gets started. West Newport, you see, owns a piece of land with a lot of  potential for controversy, a 500-acre coastal oil field between the western  edge of Newport Beach and the Santa Ana River. The oil company has been talking  to Orange County officials for a year about getting permission to build  something on the land once the oil is gone in the near future.  </P> <P> This week, in an unusual move, the company had its market research firm send  out 2,500 questionnaires to homes in nearby neighborhoods in Costa Mesa and  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "Be assured that your opinions, and those of your neighbors, will be considered  before any plan is proposed to the community," the questionnaire assures  readers.  </P> <P> The five-page questionnaire asks neighbors to rate how interested they are in  what happens to the land and also asks whether they would prefer offices, light  industrial, houses, condos, a shopping center, a park or -- in what seems like  the unlikeliest possibility of all -- restoration of the wetlands.  </P></p>

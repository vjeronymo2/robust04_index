			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Israeli troop pull-out may be delayed The US said yesterday it would not object to a slight slippage in next Monday's deadline for the beginning of an Israeli troop withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho if the Palestine Liberation Organisation agreed. The move came as Israel prepared to make symbolic gestures next Monday and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, sent reinforcements to the West Bank, bringing the number of Israeli troops in the occupied territories to 14,000 after an upsurge of Arab-Jewish bloodshed. An extremist faction of the PLO claimed responsibility for shooting and wounding an Israeli settler in Bethlehem which it said it carried out to mark the sixth anniversary of the Palestinian uprising and to confirm the continued armed struggle against the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said in Cairo yesterday the US would accept a delay in implementing the peace agreement if both sides agreed but he urged Israel and the Palestinians to press ahead as quickly as possible. 'The sooner that they can begin the actual implementation, the more progress that will be made and the less the likelihood of violence,' he said after meeting President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Israel and the PLO exchanged draft protocols in Cairo yesterday but have yet to agree vital issues like the size of the Jericho area, who should control border crossings and whether there will be a customs union between Israel and the Palestinian economy. Despite the failure to reach a final agreement Israeli officials said they would take important symbolic measures next Monday including some troop deployment out of Palestinian areas in Gaza and the release of up to 2,000 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners. Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Rabin are expected to agree on the measures at a meeting in Cairo on Sunday. In a move to calm increasingly violent and vocal settlers, Mr Rabin yesterday revealed the details of Israel's military presence in the occupied territories - normally a closely guarded secret. Mr Rabin described the deployment as tremendous and said there were four times as many soldiers in the territories than on the Lebanese border. But in a warning to both Israeli and Palestinian extremists seeking to disrupt the peace process, Mr Rabin said: 'Nothing will deter the government and me from our determination to continue along the path we opened to implement the agreement.' In Bonn, Mr Arafat urged German industrialists to invest in infrastructure development in the Palestinian economy. Mr Arafat, who has been on a two-day visit to Germany, is due to fly to Spain today where he will meet Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister. Both men, together with Mr Rabin, were yesterday nominated for the 1994 Nobel Peace prize by German parliamentarians.</p>

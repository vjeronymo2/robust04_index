			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Safeway after-tax profits advance strongly to Dollars 26m SAFEWAY, the US food retailer which was taken private via a Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1986, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 26.7m in the three months to March 23. This compares with Dollars 15m in the same period in 1990. However, operating profits improved by a smaller percentage - up 10 per cent, at Dollars 122.8m - while sales were less than 2 per cent higher at Dollars 3.4bn (Dollars 3.34bn). Operating margin advanced from 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent. Part of the gain in net profits came from Vons, a supermarket chain in California, in which Safeway has a 35 per cent equity investment. Safeway records income from the Vons investment on a one-quarter delay basis, and said that increased profits from this source lay behind a near-doubling of 'other income' in its own results last quarter, from Dollars 8.2m to Dollars 15m. Interest charges in the three-month period increased slightly, from Dollars 83.8m to Dollars 86.5m. Safeway, which takes in over 1,100 outlets in the US and Canada, said that, despite the 'soft sales' recorded in the first quarter, it viewed the results as 'excellent'. The company, still highly-leveraged, earlier this month increased the size of an international share offering from 2m to 3.5m shares, following demand from UK institutions. The international tranche was part of a 17.5m share offering, representing 18 per cent of the company's enlarged share capital.</p>

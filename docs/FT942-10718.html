			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (7): Garments industry leads - Exports Monno Khan enjoys the irony of selling plates to Staffordshire, the home of British pottery. The UK was his company's first overseas buyer. Today, Monno Ceramic Industries, Bangladesh's biggest producer of porcelain tableware, sells to 51 countries. Monno, like Bangladesh as a whole, is looking to exports for growth. 'We should go for exports in any form, whether porcelain or other products, to give employment to our millions of people,' says Mr Khan, chairman and managing director. Monno's exports have risen more than five-fold in the past five years. Total sales are expected to rise to about Tk440m this year, with exports - mainly to the European Union and the US - taking an increasing share. Ceramics represents only a tiny portion of the country's exports - 0.24 per cent last year - but the sector is one of a few that in recent years has shown dynamic growth and expanding overseas markets. Bangladesh's total sales abroad last year rose by 19.5 per cent to Tk2.4bn, covering almost 60 per cent of the country's import bill, and the government is predicting a further 18 per cent increase this year. The garments industry is the country's biggest exporter and one of its best hopes - along with a clutch of smaller growth industries including frozen foods, leather and ceramics - for providing jobs and underpinning export-led growth. The sector has grown rapidly in the past 15 years, helped by economic liberalisation, fiscal incentives, low wages and a relatively disciplined workforce. It is the country's biggest industrial employer, with about 800,000 workers. Last year, exports of ready-made garments rose nearly 19 per cent to Tk48.2bn - some 52 per cent of total exports. The US market accounted for 52 per cent of Bangladeshi garment exports last year, and the European Union 40 per cent. But growth in recent years has failed to match the rapid expansion of the 1980s as new players have entered the market and the developed world has languished in recession. With its principal markets recovering, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association says its main concern now is the industry's dependence on imported raw materials and fabric. Less than 2 per cent of fabric used in the garments industry is produced locally. 'Last year, we could not reach our growth target because of a fabric shortage caused by poor cotton harvests,' says Mr Redwan Ahmed, the association's president and a Bangladeshi National Party MP. 'Some of our orders were cancelled because prices went too high. It is our duty to invite foreign investors or sunset industries in developed countries to relocate their factories here,' says Mr Ahmed. Fortuna garments has just moved into a new factory in Dhaka, where it has capacity to make 5,000 garments a day, mainly shirts and trousers for the US market. Fortuna says its shirts cost about Dollars 1 each to produce. They sell wholesale at Dollars 4-Dollars 5 and retail in the US at about Dollars 40-Dollars 50. Fortuna, like other large manufacturers, wants to increase value-added work and to reduce its dependence on imported fabrics. 'We aim to be fully integrated and will start by weaving next year,' says Mr Mohammad Abu Taher, managing director. 'Then we will go on to dyeing and finishing, perhaps with a foreign partner.' Mr Akmal Hossain, director-general of the Export Promotion Bureau, concedes that the future for garments lies in full integration, and says the government is ready to support the industry. 'In garments, backward linkage is one of the most important areas. It will be hard for us to survive in competition with others when import quotas are phased out under the new Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement. We must go for a whole industry.' The wider push for exports, drawn up under World Bank guidance, prompted the government last year to open a second Export Processing Zone, a duty-free area for companies selling 100 per cent of their output abroad. The EPZs, one in Chittagong and the second in Dhaka, aim to draw in foreign capital; to widen the country's economic base by fostering new and developing industries; and to generate jobs, particularly in more advanced technological sectors. But the rate of arrivals has been slow and Bangladesh continues to lag behind its Asian neighbours in attracting foreign capital or the transfer of technology. Much of Chittagong's EPZ stands vacant, and only light industry has moved in. While some foreign investors applaud improvements in incentives, others complain of an overbearing bureaucracy. Only 44 foreign companies - among them Japanese, South Korean, US and Hong Kong companies - have set up in Chittagong since the EPZ opened in 1983. Of these, 13 are joint ventures with local companies. A further nine are Bangladeshi. Total investment at the site is barely Dollars 140m, providing about 25,000 jobs. If foreign investment from the developed world is slow in coming, the industry's best hope may be with India, says Mr Jamal Ahmad, a former senior minister in the Bangladeshi government. He says it is easier and more profitable for Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to smuggle fabric from India than to invest at home because of a porous border and the taka's relative strength against the rupee. India should be allowed free access to the Bangladeshi market, he says, encouraging it to buy more from Bangladesh and to enter into joint ventures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Zheng Wei (6774 5588) and </F> correspondent Zheng Jianping (6774 1696 1627): "Healthy  Practices and Quality Services Reign in Shanghai Post and  Telecommunications Administration -- Wei Jianxing Affirms These  Achievements During Inspection Tour of Shanghai; Post and  Telecommunications Ministry Decides To Promote the  Administration's Experience in Relevant Departments Throughout  the Country"]    [Text] During his recent inspection tour of Shanghai, Wei  Jianxing, secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission, noted: The Shanghai Post and Telecommunications  Administration's experience deserves to be summed up and can be  used as a reference for remedying sector-wide unhealthy  practices across the nation. The Post and Telecommunications  Ministry's leading party group recently decided to promote the  administration's experience and practices in providing quality  services to the public and its customers in post and  telecommunications departments throughout the country with a  view to further promoting bureau-specific healthy practices in  the nation's post and telecommunications sector. This was  disclosed by Chang Yan, head of the discipline inspection group  sent by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission to work at  the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, at a news briefing  held by the ministry's leading party group in Shanghai yesterday.    In recent years, the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications  Administration has provided quality services as part of its  intensive efforts to remedy unhealthy practices. It has taken  the initiative in serving the telecommunications market, tried  its best to satisfy the public's needs, and pulled ahead of its  counterparts in other parts of the country in redressing  sector-wide unhealthy practices, in improving bureau-specific  practices, and in providing quality services.    While energetically developing postal and telecommunications  services, the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications  Administration has earnestly provided quality services and  promoted industrious and honest practices. Since 1992, the  administration has carried out activities to promote quality  services "aimed at satisfying market demand and guaranteeing  satisfaction to customers." It has provided services to solve  problems of concern to the general public. To improve telephone  services, for example, it has increased the number of public  telephones, set up nighttime emergency and public telephone  offices, made private telephones available for public use, and  extended service hours, thus effectively relieving inadequate  telephone services for local residents. It has provided special  services for the old, weak, sick, and disabled; 355,000 people  falling under this category are now enjoying these special  services. Moreover, the administration has provided newspapers  and mail home delivery services for more than 2,500 childless  and widowed senior citizens in Shanghai. It has also provided  "integrated" services, handled telephone and telecommunications  services on behalf of other departments, and instituted measures  such as those "creating a single window for receiving documents  and introducing a single official seal for use in dealings with  its customers."    The Shanghai Post and Telecommunications Administration has  set up a sound and effective administrative system, thereby  institutionally suppressing the sources of unhealthy practices.  For instance, the municipal telephone office has placed  telephone numbers and telephone lines under centralized and  unified management. It has also stepped up management,  supervision, and control over work units, thereby effectively  halting the unhealthy practice of abusing telephone numbers and  telephone lines. Additionally, the administration has recruited  2,768 superintendents from among the public, carried out  year-round education on occupational ethics, and selected  advanced models on a timely basis. It has also incorporated  service indicators, such as "user complaint and satisfaction  rates," in unit- and job-based responsibility systems, and  strictly meted out rewards and punishments. In the municipal  telephone office alone, six people have been dismissed for  violations of disciplinary rules.</p>

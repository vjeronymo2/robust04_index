			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Broking new ground across Europe - The rapid expansion of Willis Corroon WILLIS CORROON, the world's second biggest insurance broker, is close to completing a network of European subsidiaries and associates - following the acquisition this week of a 20 per cent stake in a medium-sized German insurance broker, C Wuppesahl &amp; Co Assekuranzmakler. The deal is the latest in a series effected by Willis since the October 1990 merger between Willis Faber of the UK and Corroon &amp; Black of the US. Over the past 18 months, at a total cost of some Pounds 25m, Willis has bought 50 per cent stakes in operations in Italy and the Netherlands and a 40 per cent stake of an operation in Spain. New ventures have been begun in France, Sweden, Hungary, Russia, Denmark and Czechoslovakia. Wuppesahl, which handled premiums of more than DM300m in 1990, earning brokerage revenue of DM30m, has offices in seven German cities, and also brings Zurich representation in Switzerland and Austria. Negotiations are afoot with a Belgian partner. A deal here would complete the network. The speed with which Willis has assembled its network is symptomatic of the interest in the rapidly-growing European market of the world's biggest insurance brokers, which provide insurance and risk management services for the world's largest companies. Increasingly brokers are also interested in the business of medium-sized companies which, following the approval of key planks of the European Commission's liberalisation programme, are now more likely to buy their insurance from companies located outside their home territories. Brokers, which in many European countries have handled only a small percentage of commercial insurance business - as little as 15 per cent in Germany and Italy for example - see rising demand here as another source of growth. Keen to take advantage of this opportunity, many brokers have begun building European operations. Recent developments include: In February Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest broker, spent Dollars 105m acquiring control of Faugere et Jutheau, the French family-owned broker. Europe has generated faster growth for Marsh than any other territory. The completion of a continent-wide network has been a priority. The Marsh network in Europe - which covers 16 countries - also includes the Lloyd's broker, CT Bowring, in London and Germany's largest broker, Gradmann Holler, which was acquired in 1989. In August last year Rollins Burdick Hunter, the US broker which is part of Aon Corporation, paid more than Dollars 200m to acquire Holland's leading broker, Hudig-Langeveldt. In the past five years both Sedgwick - which links London's Sedgwick with Fred S James - and Alexander &amp; Alexander - formed when A&amp;A took over Alexander Howden of London in 1982 - have strengthened their European networks. A&amp;A was represented in 60 European cities as early as 1989. But Willis's recent drive has been particularly urgent because of the way the October 1990 merger affected its European links. The link-up with Corroon &amp; Black ended a century-old relationship with the US broker, Johnson and Higgins, and a loose alliance of international brokerage connections, which included Mees Zoonen of Holland, Gras Savoye of France and Gil &amp; Carvajal of Spain. Without the funds for big acquisitions, Willis has opted to link with small and medium-sized brokers or back existing teams of brokers in new ventures. Willis's strategy means it lacks the weight in some European markets enjoyed by some of its rivals - especially after the recent acquisitions. Critics also suggest that its control may be limited in some cases. Nevertheless there are also advantages. In particular by leaving local owners and managers with substantial stakes of each subsidiary, Willis feels it is likely to encourage a more dynamic development. 'By leaving substantial shareholdings with local managers and owners we have created incentives for people to develop the business nationally,' says Mr Adrian Gregory, the group director responsible for Europe. Mr Gregory says the main emphasis has been in building links with brokers who can help service the group's multinational business. Willis's lower profile approach will also allow it to develop its existing relationships with the continent's large reinsurers more sensitively. 'The network doesn't disturb our existing business connections in reinsurance,' adds Mr Gregory.</p>

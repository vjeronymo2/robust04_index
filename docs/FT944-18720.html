			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / German seeks new cartel body for EU European anti-trust decisions should be made by an independent authority instead of the European Commission in order to reduce political interference, the head of the German cartel office has told the Financial Times. Mr Dieter Wolf said he hopes Germany will place such a proposal on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Meeting scheduled for 1996. Mr Wolf, a staunch advocate of reducing political influence in mergers and anti-trust decisions, said the current decision-making structures in Brussels were not transparent enough and were often susceptible to 'political lobbies'. 'I am not blaming the Commissioners for this. But it is a consequence of the structure of decision-making. Every commissioner has different tasks to fulfil. But he is also a politician. His understanding of the task is also a political one,' said Mr Wolf. What concerns the cartel office, which has often been criticised for not taking a more robust attitude towards mergers within Germany, especially in the retailing and media sectors, is that there are too many interest groups in Brussels lobbying behind the scenes on anti-trust decisions. 'It is sometimes unclear why some merger decisions are made,' he said, adding that 'Brussels wants to keep the monopoly of granting exemptions from (individual) cartel prohibitions'. 'Merger decisions contain sharp interventions from the state into the market. Take the case of capital allocation,' he said. 'If there is a proposal for a merger between a French and a German company it is clear (the decision) has direct repercussions on where the investments will take place. It involves getting influence on the flow of capital. Maybe this is very attractive and seductive for politics. But that is why it makes it all the more necessary for an independent body to decide on the basis of law.' Mr Wolf, however, denied suggestions that the independent body would be modelled on Germany's own cartel office, which he claimed was 'completely independent from political interference'. Instead, as a first step he proposed that it be controlled by the European Court in Luxembourg.</p>

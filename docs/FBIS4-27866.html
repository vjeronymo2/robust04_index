			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] held a party caucus at the  National Assembly building this morning and adopted a resolution  urging North Korea to stop the nuclear fuel rod replacement  operation immediately, ensure the nuclear transparency, and  return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT].    In the resolution, the DP noted that the present situation  surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue is very grave and  stressed that North Korea should fully allow the special  inspection of the undeclared sites by the International Atomic  Energy Agency. The DP also urged the government to make  independent efforts in close cooperation with the United Nations  and the four neighboring major powers, including the United  States, to prevent war on the Korean peninsula. The DP also  called on the United States and the United Nations to do their  best to maintain dialogue for the peaceful settlement rather  than resorting to the measures that could result in war.</p>

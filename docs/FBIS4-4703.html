			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 4 Apr (AKP) -- Prince Kromkhun Norodom  Sirivut, deputy prime minister of the Royal Government of  Cambodia and minister of foreign affairs and international  cooperation, has stressed that Cambodia still needs urgent food  aid because of food shortages in some provinces.    During a 30 March meeting with Mr. Jens Schulthes, regional  director of the World Food Program (WFP) for Asia and the  Pacific, the prince thanked this humanitarian organization for  its food aid to Cambodia.    Cambodia's chief diplomat also informed his guest of the new  structure of the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and  expressed his hope that this will facilitate relations between  the international organizations operating in Cambodia and the  various ministries.    In his reply, Jens Schulthes thanked the Cambodian  Government  for creating conditions favorable to the WFP mission in  Cambodia. He also announced a new aid project for Cambodia. He  recalled that from 1979 to 1993, this international organization  supplied Cambodia with 1.7 million tonnes of foodstuffs worth  $600 million.    Mr. Jens Schulthes visited Cambodia from 26 March to 1  April.  During his stay, he went to Siem Reap and Kandal Provinces,  where the WFP has provided aid for the construction of roads and  fish ponds and for demining operations.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Portillo pledges 'firm grip': Chief secretary to the Treasury's first Commons speech on public expenditure SPENDING ministers were warned to expect hard bargaining when negotiating their budgets for 1993-94 by Mr Michael Portillo in his first speech in the Commons yesterday as chief secretary to the Treasury. With Treasury officials expected to begin bilateral discussions next week, he promised to keep the 'firmest grip' over the total of public expenditure when MPs resumed the debate on the Queen's Speech. Mr Portillo, who was frequently reminded of his Thatcherite credentials, said that the government's determination to control public spending and to conduct its business prudently did not simply arise from a desire for efficiency and sound economic policy. To Conservative cheers, the chief secretary stressed: 'Unlike the Labour party, we do not believe in the inexorable growth of reach and size of the state. Nor do we believe that the state can and should try to solve all our problems.' He angered the opposition benches by taunting Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary, who hopes to become Labour's deputy leader, over her role in steering the party to its fourth successive election defeat by framing a shadow budget requiring a Pounds 7bn tax increase. Responding to a challenge from Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover), the chief secretary said he had 'no reason to change' forecasts that the public-sector borrowing requirement for the current financial year would total Pounds 28bn. Mr Portillo said the government had been returned to power because it had gained the voters' trust by showing that it could reduce public borrowing, end the inexorable rise in public expenditure's share of national income, and bring about a massive reduction in personal taxation. Lower tax and a smaller role for the state fostered an environment in which business could flourish, industry prosper and the economy grow. Mr Portillo looked to resumed economic growth to 'enable the government to increase public expenditure on key areas, cut direct taxes and reduce public borrowing'. He underlined the government's commitment to reducing the share of the national income which was taken by the state and to balancing the budget over the medium term. Mr Portillo said medium-term policy would be designed to ensure that the convergence criteria agreed at the Maastricht summit were met. Taxes would be reduced 'when it is prudent to do so'. Mrs Beckett recalled that Mr Portillo had championed the poll tax and said he had 'absolutely no conscience' to preside over a steady stream of cuts affecting the poorest members of society. She renewed Labour's election charge that the government had caused a 'home grown' recession, and contended that the size of the public-sector borrowing requirement  - 'Pounds 28bn and rising'  - and the deficit on the balance of payments reflected the underlying weakness of the economy.</p>

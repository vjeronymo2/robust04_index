			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Treasury cuts savings bond rate THE GOVERNMENT acted last night to head off a widespread rise in the cost of home loans by cutting the interest rate offered on its highly successful new National Savings product, the First Option Bond. The move follows an aggressive campaign by building societies, which have been complaining that the bond has been syphoning off their deposits. The gross interest rate paid on the bond has been reduced from 10.34 per cent to 9.67 per cent in a move described by a National Savings official as 'highly unusual'. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester - the society which raised its rates in response to the bond - said: 'It is good news and we are delighted. We need to get into the office tomorrow to look at the effect of the reduction . . . before we make a cut in our mortgage rate,' he said. At Leeds Permanent, Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, said he was impressed with the government's speed of movement. 'It looks as though they are committed to seeing a lower interest rate', he said. The Woolwich welcomed the Treasury move, saying it made a mortgage rate increase 'most unlikely'. Mr Longhurst also disclosed that he met Treasury ministers on Friday to explain why his society, the sixth biggest, had increased its mortgage rate that day. 'They were understanding and sympathetic.' Building societies had said that to retain their deposits they were being forced they were being forced to raise savings rates, which put them under pressure to lift mortgage rates as well. The threat of a widespread mortgage rate rise, which would lead to further delays in recovery of the housing market and the economy, has contributed to sharp falls in share prices. National Savings said that sales of the bond in the first two weeks had been higher than expected. The First (or fixed interest rate savings tax-paid) bond, which carried a net interest rate of 7.75 per cent, attracted Pounds 112m during the nine days since becoming available on July 7, a large amount for a new savings product. Only once before, in 1984, has National Savings taken steps to reduce sales of one of its products. In that case, it withdrew a new issue after just five weeks. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: 'It is now clear that the new bond will remain attractive and meet the government's needs (to help finance its borrowing requirement) with a lower interest rate.' The rate on the First Option Bond will be reduced from noon today. Those who have sent an application by post will only benefit if the form arrives before then. National Savings ran a big publicity campaign at the weekend to sell the bond. Woolwich tax battle, Page 6 Background, Page 7 Lex, Page 16</p>

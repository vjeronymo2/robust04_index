			<p>BFN     [Text] PHNOM PENH, May 26 (AFP) -- More than 200 Khmer  Rouge rebels were killed in fighting in northwest Cambodia as  government forces pushed their way down the road from Battambang  to the rebel base at Pailin, a government official said Thursday.    Between 200 and 250 guerrillas died in the fighting  Wednesday  and three government soldiers were killed and another 27 wounded  by land mines as they advanced down National Route 10,  Battambang deputy governor Serey Kosal told AFP by telephone.    The governor said most of the guerrillas had been found  strewn alongside the highway, killed by artillery fire, and that  some 50 others appeared to have been executed by bullet shots in  the back of the head. He said the 50 dead rebels had been  executed by their commander for trying to retreat as government  forces advanced to Phum Svay Sar, 10 kilometers (six miles) from  Treng, which the government said it captured two days ago.  Ammunition and weapons had also been left behind, he added. No  independent confirmation was available.    Serey Kosal said that he would go to the highway Thursday  and  take photographs of the Khmer Rouge dead as evidence.    Treng was the government's frontline prior to an offensive  that led to the capture of Pailin in March, one month before it  was retaken by the rebels, who surged forward and pushed  government forces back to within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of  Battambang.</p>

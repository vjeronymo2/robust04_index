			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Expansion widens British Bio loss British Bio-technology Group, the UK's leading biotechnology company, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 21.5m for the year to April 30 - which was within forecast. The result compared with losses of Pounds 13.1m last time. Mr James Noble, finance director, said the increased losses were primarily caused by a rise in expenditure, which increased from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 25.5m, mostly linked to additional research and development. 'At the beginning of the year there were less than 100 people who had taken our drugs, now there are more than 1,000,' he said. The result was also affected by a fall in net interest received from Pounds 4.21m to Pounds 1.66m. Turnover totalled Pounds 3.99m (Pounds 7.85m) of which Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 5.33m) related to British Bio-technology Products which was sold in July 1993. Of the continuing operations' figure of Pounds 2.3m about Pounds 1m was from government grants, and most of the rest from research agreements with Techne of the US and Glaxo. The company has set up a commercial department and US office which cost acombined Pounds 1m. The group had net cash of Pounds 28.6m at the end of the financial year. Net proceeds from the rights issue in May this year were Pounds 45.8m. Dr Keith McCullagh, chief executive, said no further funding should be required until after the exercise of Pounds 47.6m of warrants in January 1996. These are priced at 525p per share. Yesterday, the shares closed unchanged at 365p. Mr Noble said the available funding was sufficient for the company to develop its lead compound, Batimastat, an anti-cancer drug, and submit it to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in 1996. The drug is presently in phase II trials to evaluate its effectiveness. Mr Noble said the company would market Batimastat itself. He believed the group could reach the specialist oncology market with a salesforce of only 110 in Europe and 80 in the US. The company said it was looking for partners to help it develop products outside the cancer area in an effort to keep down costs. The company already has an agreement with Glaxo for an asthma compound.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Judy Maltz] </F>   [Excerpts] Israel might ask the U.S. Administration to  lift some of the restrictions imposed on the use of the loan  guarantees because they make it difficult for Jerusalem to use  the funds. Jerusalem is considering asking the Americans to  increase the amount that can be included in the state budget to  be used for investments in infrastructure and to fund the  internal debt.    Within the framework of the loan guarantees agreement,  Israel  can use only $600 million annually for those purposes -- less  than one third of the annual quota. The Americans imposed  restrictions on the use of the loan guarantees in order to make  sure that they are not invested in the territories and do not  fund current expenditures and a rise in the standard of living.  [passage omitted]    The request to change the clauses in the agreement will most  likely be raised in the next session of the Israeli-U.S. Joint  Economic Development Group (JEDG) in Washington in March.  Sources in the Treasury said that U.S. officials are aware of  the problem created by the restrictions imposed on the use of  the funds and even support amending the agreement. [passage  omitted]    Another option being considered is to ask the Americans to  be  able to use some of the loan guarantees to convert short-term  foreign debts with long-term debts thereby improving Israel's  foreign debt situation.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Jose Soares] </F>   [Text] Belem -- Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said  yesterday at the 24th OAS General Assembly that Brazil supports  a peaceful solution to ending the military dictatorship of  Haiti. Amorim suggested intensifying the economic boycott  against Haiti, including the prohibition of flights: "Although  Brazil cannot tolerate the military coup that overthrew  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, it recommends a peaceful  solution in favor of democracy, and in keeping with the  principle of nonintervention."    Argentina asked for an immediate military intervention in  Haiti, arguing that it no longer believes in the positive  effects of the sanctions against Haiti. The Brazilian foreign  minister believes that if the boycott is intensified, the  coupist Haitian military officers will not be able to resist for  long: "After President Aristide, who obtained 70 percent of the  votes, is reinstated in power, Brazil would find it advisable  for the United Nations to send a peace force to that country to  safeguard democracy, but not a military intervention."    The Brazilian foreign minister believes that firmer action  against the Haitian coupists has not been possible so far, but  that favorable conditions are now arising. Amorim defended the  readmission of Cuba to the OAS, saying that the situation there  is different from that in Haiti: "Now that the era and  consequences of the Cold War are over, there is no reason to  isolate Cuba given that an evolution toward freedom can now be  observed there, even though it is not taking place at the  desired pace. The situation in Haiti is different: Human  rights are brazenly violated there."</p>

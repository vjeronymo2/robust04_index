			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CLEARED ON 2 MEETING LAW CHARGES  </P> <P> The district attorney's office has cleared members of the Oxnard City Council  of allegations that they violated state law by holding secret meetings twice in  the last five months.  </P> <P> However, special Assistant Dist. Atty. Donald D. Coleman said he is still  investigating allegations that the entire council violated state open meeting  laws on a third occasion in August.  </P> <P> After interviewing city officials about the allegations, Coleman said he was  unable to find enough evidence to prove there were violations of the Brown Act,  the state's open meeting law.  </P> <P> The first allegation that Coleman cleared was filed in May by council candidate  Eleanor Branthoover, president of the city's Inter-Neighborhood Council. She  asked the district attorney to investigate a possible violation by three  council members during a meeting to discuss a 77-acre development near Oxnard  Boulevard and Gonzales Road.  </P> <P> Branthoover told the district attorney that she suspected the council members  discussed the matter in a private conference room during a recess because the  council was unable to reach consensus until after it returned from the recess.  </P> <P> The second alleged violation that Coleman cleared was filed last month by Scott  Bollinger, a mayoral candidate in the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Bollinger asked the district attorney to investigate campaign literature  distributed by Mayor Nao Takasugi, which suggested that three council members  had been holding illegal secret meetings.  </P> <P> Coleman said he interviewed Takasugi and his campaign consultant, John Davies,  and found that neither could provide substantial evidence to prove the  allegations.  </P> <P> Coleman said he is still investigating whether the City Council violated the  Brown Act when it met in closed session to modify a development agreement it  adopted in 1988.  </P> <P> City Atty. Gary Gillig has said he approved the meeting and that it did not  violate the Brown Act.  </P> <P> He suggested that he and the district attorney interpret the law differently.  HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

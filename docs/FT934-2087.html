			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Closure threat removed from Dutch zinc smelter The threat of closure hanging over the Budel smelter in the Netherlands, which produces about 5 per cent of the western world's zinc, was removed yesterday, only days before the year-end deadline. Budel, which employs 610 directly and provides a living for at least 600 more people, was under threat because it was running out of space to store cadmium-containing hazardous waste called jarosite - a product of electrolytic zinc production. But yesterday it reached agreement with both the national and the local provincial governments for storage permits to be issued. It also revealed that it is studying the viability of using zinc concentrate (an intermediate material) with a very low iron content from a recently-discovered ore body in Australia (believed to be a CRA deposit in Queensland), which would eliminate jarosite from smelter waste. Technical and economic studies about this project should be completed in 1995 and the new concentrate could be used from 1998 onwards - in line with the Netherlands government's policy of having no chemical waste disposal after the year 2000. Mr Wim de Graaf, Budel's general manager, said that by the end of this year Fl300m (about USDollars 160m) of provisions will have been provided by the smelter's joint owners - Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, and Pasminco, the Australian resources company - and this should cover all the costs of storage and after-care. During the past 20 years Budel, 2km from the Belgian border, which has a capcity of 215,000 tonnes a year, has generated nearly 2m tonnes of jarosite and continues to produce about 100,000 tonnes a year. Previously the Noord-Brabant regional government said this could not continue - the three artificial ponds in which the waste is stored cover 50 hectares. By working flat-out since 1985 Budel, in co-operation with Outokumpu, the Finnish metals group, developed a method of smelting (or burning) jarosite to turn it into an inert material that could be used for construction and road building. But this technology would raise the smelter's costs by 25 to 30 per cent and leave it unable to compete with other zinc smelters world-wide. Mr de Graaf said the governments were now convinced that permanent storage of jarosite in ponds with after-care was just as environmentally acceptable and much less costly than reprocessing. The last-minute nature of the decision can be judged by the fact that Budel will start filling a fourth pond - already built but which it was previously forbidden to use - in the first quarter of next year. Ironically, European zinc producers are at present negotiating a smelter 'shut-down' agreement where the industry as a whole would pay the cost of closing one or two smelters. Mr de Graaf said: 'We are glad to disappoint them. It would have been ridiculous to close Budel, which is one of the two best zinc plants in the world'.</p>

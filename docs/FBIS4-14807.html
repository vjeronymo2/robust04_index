			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vadim Brykin and Yuriy </F> Tyssovskiy]    [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- U.N. Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali has described as constructive and positive his  talks with Russian Defence Minister General Pavel Grachev. He  thanked Russia for its contribution to the U.N. peace-keeping  efforts in various parts of the world and expressed hope for the  continuation of that cooperation in the interests of peace.    In his turn, Pavel Grachev thanked the U.N.  secretary-general  for that high appreciation and pointed out that it was  especially important today, when Russia is being accused of some  "imperial aspiration" by some forces. According to Grachev,  Butrus-Ghali came up with proposals on Russia's participation in  a number of peace-keeping operations from the point of view of  their engineering, rear and technical support. "We agreed to  those proposals, and shall prepare corresponding units," the  Russian minister said.    Responding to the question of ITAR-TASS whether the granting  of a U.N. status to our peace-keeping force was discussed at the  talks, Grachev said that such suggestions were made to  Butrus-Ghali, and he is going to examine them. He stressed that  a positive settlement of those problems is connected with the  problem of financing U.N. peace-keeping operations. The U.N.  budget envisages two to three such operations a year, while at  present 17 peace-keeping operations are under way.    The Russian side suggested as well the renovation and  upgrading of the collective security mechanism. Russia  suggested to the U.N. to bear part of the expenses on the  transportation and deployment of peace-keeping forces. It is  also important for us that the armaments and military hardware,  used by peace-keeping forces, should not be taken into account  during the calculation of the maximum level of armaments under  the treaty on the limitation of conventional armaments in  Europe, Grachev said.</p>

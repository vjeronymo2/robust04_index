			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bollore disposes of plastics unit Bollore Technologies, the diversified French industrial group, is selling a plastics company for FFr1.2bn (Dollars 233m) and plans a further FFr2bn in asset sales over the next year to bolster the group's financial position. Mr Vincent Bollore, the group's head, said the sale of Frans-Bonhomme, France's leading supplier of plastic tubes and joints, and that of a stake in a Normandy energy distribution company, would together bring in FFr1.4bn. However, Mr Bollore said that the group's restructuring was not over. Debt had been reduced to FFr5.6bn by the end of September, from FFr8.3bn in mid-1993, but this was still FFr1.6bn more than shareholders' capital, Mr Bollore complained. 'Our debts must be brought back to the level of our own funds,' he said. He indicated that the group's remaining energy and paper activities might be for sale, saying that the group planned to refocus on its three core areas of plastic film, cigarettes and shipping transport between Europe and Africa. Bollore is thought likely to be the main bidder for Seita, the French state's tobacco-making monopoly, when the latter comes up for privatisation. But Mr Bollore made clear that, for the moment, retrenchment still took precedence over acquisitions and alliances. He predicted that pre-tax operating profits in the second half would be similar to the FFr193m recorded in the first half of this year.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Scholey's final cut The assumption by many investors at the time of British Steel's dividend warning last November was that, if it did come to a cut, the new payout level would at least be sustainable. The message from yesterday's results - which may also be relevant to other recession-bound companies whose dividends are vulnerable - is that even this may turn out to be an illusion. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 55m was considerably better than worst expectations, but the damage was contained only by cost cutting and careful cash management. Volume was flat, and much of the 9 per cent fall in turnover was the consequence of lower prices. Only if its market recovers can British Steel feel confident about its dividend. The company says a 5 per cent increase in prices would produce enough earnings to cover the reduced payout twice. The trouble is that there is little on the horizon to stop prices continuing to fall. The US recovery is weak and protectionist pressures are growing. There is a question mark over Japan. Western Europe faces the twin problems of excess capacity and cheap imports from the former East bloc. British Steel thus has to fall back on its ability to cut costs, and the forlorn hope that its European competitors will finally take an axe to their own surplus capacity. There may be room for more savings, but there is a cash cost to restructuring and the company has already pruned capital spending to a minimum. Ultimately it risks jeopardising its chances of exploiting recovery when it eventually comes. Against this backdrop, its joint venture in stainless steels with Sweden's Avesta is at least a sensible strategy. It will deconsolidate a loss-making division, as well as taking future capital spending and restructuring charges off British Steel's own balance sheet. The venture will have a viable share of the European market and eventually earn more than British Steel could make from stainless steel on its own. But the benefits will not be sufficient to solve the problems of the group as a whole. Even after yesterday's 9 per cent fall, the shares are hardly a bargain.</p>

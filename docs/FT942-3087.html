			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Unsugared pill What do the Football Association and the watchdogs of Britain's retail financial services industry have in common? Answer: an uncanny ability to penalise the wrong people. Consider the case of Tottenham Hotspur. The FA has just imposed a swingeing Pounds 600,000 fine on the north London soccer club, excluded it from the FA Cup for a year and knocked 12 points from its total next season, which will make relegation difficult to avoid. The offences in question had nothing to do with controversial loan arrangements and transfer payments undertaken by its former manager Mr Terry Venables. They concerned the less weighty matter of irregular loans made to players in the 1980s. That was before the arrival of the club's present chairman and controlling shareholder, Mr Alan Sugar of Amstrad. Mr Sugar is the kind of hard-nosed entrepreneur for whom hearts do not readily bleed. But it is difficult to see why he, who rescued the club with a cash injection in 1991, should bear the brunt of the FA's disciplinary action; or, again, why players and fans who were not involved in the irregularities should live under the cloud of a 12-point handicap. Mr Venables, meantime, has never fully answered his critics, but has been rewarded by the FA with the job of England's coach. This would not seem to fit any recognisable definition of natural justice. But it might well appear familiar to the policyholders and shareholders of those life assurance companies that have recently been fined for sharp sales practice. The misdemeanours were perpetrated by the directors, managers and salesmen of the companies. Yet the fines fall chiefly on the policyholders - including victims of mis-selling - and to a lesser extent on shareholders in proprietary companies. This no doubt creates an impression of regulatory activity. But it is not a kind of regulation worth having. Still less does it constitute justice. The FA should sharpen up its act, but may need a little bruising legal assistance from Mr Sugar to do so. The new Personal Investment Authority should be encouraged to require individual registration and fines for insurance company directors. As long as sanctions are manifestly indiscriminate, regulation degenerates into farce.</p>

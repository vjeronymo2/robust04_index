			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BETTER WEATHER COOLS FILMING  </P> <P> An early spring has forced Bruce Willis' "Die Hard II" production crew out of  town and north to Kinross in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  </P> <P> Twentieth Century Fox sent Willis, and most of the production crew, back to Los  Angeles over the weekend when unseasonably warm weather melted the snow in  Alpena needed for the winter action movie.  </P> <P> Location manager Greg Lazzaro said producers shot only about half of the  planned winter blizzard scenes at the Alpena County Regional Airport before the  snow stopped.  </P> <P> Today, "Die Hard II" stunt doubles and a secondary crew will work out of the  old Kincheloe Air Force Base in Kinross.  </P> <P> The weather in Alpena turned fast. Temperatures dropped as low as minus-5 last  Tuesday, the first night of shooting in Alpena. It was in the 60s four days  later.  </P> <P> Alpena itself was a substitute location for Moses Lake, Wash., where warm  weather last month plagued producers.  </P></p>

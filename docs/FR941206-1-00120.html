			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (bb) Section 201&hyph;21.603 is amended to delete the agency reporting requirement and to add a requirement that agencies that do public service monitoring provide an oral notice or beep tone at the beginning of a call. This section currently prohibits agencies listening-in to or recording telephone conversations, on a GSA-provided telephone system, any telephone system acquired under a delegation of GSA procurement authority, or any telecommunications system approved in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, except under certain circumstances. Agencies that listen-in or record conversations for public safety, public service monitoring or to assist individuals with disabilities must notify GSA in writing at least 30 days before the operational date. This notification provision is being removed because it places an unnecessary burden on agencies. GSA does not have any affirmative enforcement or other function with regard to listening-in that would make this reporting requirement necessary. Such responsibilities rest solely with the reporting agency. Accordingly, in line with placing authority and responsibility at the appropriate level, this reporting requirement will be removed as will the provision that GSA will periodically review agency listening-in activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 201&hyph;603 paragraph (d)(4)(ii) requires that agencies that perform public service monitoring provide for continuous positive action to inform the public of that monitoring. Some agencies have interpreted this to mean that including a statement in agency publications that calls to the agency may be monitored meets this requirements. After careful review, GSA has determined that since all callers may not see such publications, additional notification is required. Accordingly, we propose adding a provision that requires agencies to provide an upfront announcement or beep tone at the beginning of a call to advise callers of potential monitoring. Since such an announcement may increase communications costs, we request that agencies provide us detailed information about any negative impact implementation of this provision may have on them. We will carefully review this information before reaching a decision on whether to include this provision in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (cc) Section 201&hyph;21.604, requires agencies to forward to GSA copies of each order for toll free telephone service. Documentation submitted is to include estimates of monthly costs and usage, and cite the relevant statute, Executive Order, or other regulation directing the toll free service. This provision is being removed because the use of toll-free telephone services are sufficiently routine that close supervision by GSA is no longer needed. Removal of this provision reduces costly and burdensome over-regulation and places authority and responsibility with the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (dd) Section 201&hyph;22.303 is revised to expand the scope of the subpart. Currently, this provision requires agencies to review the use of equipment that is already outdated and to determine if continued use is economical. This provision is revised also to expand the scope of the review to include equipment that may be obsolescent. This change is made to encourage agencies to ensure that their FIP equipment always remains economical and efficient. Guidelines are provided to assist agencies in identifying obsolescent equipment. Agencies are encouraged to replace their obsolescent equipment if the cost of continued use exceeds the cost of acquiring and operating newer technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ee) Section 201&hyph;39.1001&hyph;1 is amended by removing the words ``OMB Bulletin 88&hyph;16'' in paragraph (i) and adding in their place ``OMB Bulletin 90&hyph;08''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ff) Sections 201&hyph;39.1402&hyph;2 paragraph (c) and 201&hyph;39.1501&hyph;2 paragraph (c) are revised to increase the thresholds below which certain factors need not be considered in determing the lowest bid or total proposed cost, respectively. In determining the lowest bid in a sealed bidding acquisition, &sect;201&hyph;39.1402&hyph;1 requires agencies to factor in costs pertaining to life cycle support and conversion. In determing the total cost of a proposal in a negotiated acquisition, &sect;201&hyph;39.1501&hyph;1 requires agencies to factor in costs pertaining to life cycle support and conversion. These thresholds are increased from $300,000 to $1,000,000 in order to give agencies greater discretion in managing their acquisitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

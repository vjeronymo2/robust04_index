			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Sun Princess to be built by Italy's Fincantieri yeard Britain's Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company yesterday announced that its largest cruise ship yet, the Sun Princess (illustrated above), will be built by Italy's Fincantieri yard in Monfalcone at a cost of Dollars 300m (Pounds 197.3m), Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent, writes. The Sun Princess, weighing 77,000 gross tonnes, will carry 1,950 passengers and 900 crew. It is expected to enter service at the end of 1995 with Princess Cruises, P&amp;O's Los Angeles-based subsidiary, a leader in the North American premium cruise market. The vessel is the third in a row to be built for P&amp;O by Fincantieri. The others were Crown Princess, delivered in 1990, and Regal Princess, delivered in 1991. This month Fincantieri won a Dollars 400m-plus order to build the world's biggest cruise liner for Carnival Cruises of the US. P&amp;O said the dollar's recent strength and favourable Italian currency rates had enabled the price of Dollars 300m to be achieved, of which 20 per cent would be paid during construction and the remainder on delivery. P&amp;O's worldwide cruise fleet currently comprises 14 ships operating in North America, Europe and the western Pacific. Architectural designer of the latest addition is Mr Njal Eide of Norway, also responsible for the design of P&amp;O's Royal Princess introduced in 1984. Mr Tim Harris, P&amp;O Cruises chairman, said the design and technical specification of the latest addition to the fleet would set a new industry standard taking the company well into the 21st century. 'The Royal Princess was in many ways the 1980s' classic cruise ship; we believe Sun Princess will be the classic cruise ship of the 1990s.'</p>

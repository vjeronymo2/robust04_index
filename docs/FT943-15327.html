			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A question of character - Great British Eating / Nicholas Lander meets a couple who have won their first Michelin star Throughout the world the restaurant industry attracts more than its fair share of personalities - men, and increasingly women, who are prepared to put up with the anti-social hours and unpredictable financial reward to feed their fellows. In Britain we feel that most of these characters exist outside our shores. The typical, unforgettable chef or restaurateur is French, Italian or Spanish. In fact, the British restaurant industry is replete with characters. And, in many respects, their achievements are even more admirable because few have inherited renowned family restaurants and many have had to labour for years to convince the local population that the best-prepared meals come neither instantly nor cheaply. Around Britain a roll call of such individuals would include: Joyce Molyneux at the Carved Angel, Dartmouth, Devon; Tessa Bramley at The Old Vicarage, Ridgeway, Derbyshire; Rick Stein in Padstow, Cornwall; the McCoy brothers at The Tontine, Staddle Bridge, North Yorkshire; Barry and Dorothea Phillips at The White Horse Inn, Chilgrove, West Sussex and, in Scotland, David and Patricia Wilson at the Peat Inn, St Andrews and Betty and Graeme Allen at the Airds Hotel, Port Appin, Strathclyde. And for a good food and comedy double act, Melvyn Popham and Dennis Hawkes at Pophams, Winkleigh, Devon. Any such list should also mention Harry and Caroline Hallam. Harry, from Lincolnshire, spent the first 20 years of his working life as a baker. He has spent the last six climbing the culinary league tables winning his first Michelin star earlier this year. His wife, Caroline, has played an equally important role in Harry's Place, their restaurant and home, opposite a pub and social club in Great Gonerby, just outside Grantham, Lincolnshire. It seats no more than 10 diners and is dedicated to quality. So why do they do it and does it pay? Harry, 47, says: 'We do it because we want to create the kind of restaurant we would love to go and eat in ourselves. Unfortunately, because we don't employ anyone else, we can't. But for me, as a self-taught chef, the big thing is that in this profession I never stop learning. That makes up for the lack of money. We don't actually pay ourselves a wage. Everything is for the business. We pay our bills and what's left over is for us.' The pleasure of enjoying Harry's cooking and Caroline's service is enhanced by the attention to detail: lilies, pot pourri and ivy on the tables; lace table mats; bone handled knives from a canteen that belonged to Harry's grandmother; and comfortable bergere chairs that would last no more than a week in a more hectic setting. Our lunchtime menu choice was taken from: fish soup with an anchovy rouille; a pastry case filled with a poached egg gratineed with hollandaise; fillet of sea trout with sorrel; Lincolnshire pigeon breasts with lentils; cheese; hot apricot and cognac souffle; and caramel mousse brulee. The bread, a malted wholemeal which Hallam bakes twice a day, and the ameuse geule, emphasise Hallam's talents. An essential factor in their early survival, the Hallams admit, was an understanding bank manager. 'He was the most wonderful man who believed in us and wanted us to succeed. After he retired he used to come in here and help us with the washing up, unpaid of course. Later, when he was in hospital we used to smuggle in Harry's lemon tart to him.' They add, regretfully, that the new manager has yet to go and eat there. 'Although we had always dreamt of our own restaurant we didn't want to do it until our daughters were in their teens. Looking after customers and small children must be just too demanding. But now every week we get letters from customers who say how much they have enjoyed coming here and talking to us. They usually end by saying that they do hope they haven't kept us up too late,' says Caroline. After six years in Great Gonerby, the Hallam character and style are beginning to be appreciated. One customer told me: 'I ate here on the day it opened and I must have eaten here 70 or 80 times since. I have eaten all over France and I reckon Harry is the equal of the best of them.' Praise indeed. Harry's Place, 17 High Street, Great Gonerby, Lincolnshire, NG31 8JS. Tel: 0476-61780. Open Tues-Sat, lunch and dinner. Reservations only. Pounds 35 per head, excluding wine.</p>

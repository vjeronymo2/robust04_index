			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Observer: Votes for women First Zulema, now Susana; this new wave of democracy in Latin America has clearly taken firm hold. Zulema Menem, whose estrangement from husband Carlos - Argentina's president - has gripped Buenos Aires' media for years, might be advised to join forces with Peru's first lady, Susana Higuchi. La Higuchi has criticised her husband, president Alberto Fujimori, for having an authoritarian manner and neglecting Peru's poor. She gives him high marks for tackling two big problems - terrorism and inflation  - but says he accentuates the positive while she sees 'millions of people living in absolute misery'. Both Menem and Fujimori are likely to stand for re-election in 1995. Never mind trade agreements - Zulema and Susana should be getting on the phone to Hillary Clinton to evolve a co-ordinated pan-American plan to lay siege to various presidencies.</p>

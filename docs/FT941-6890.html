			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / PLO sets tough terms for talks The Palestine Liberation Organisation is expected to refuse to rejoin peace talks with Israel this week unless Israel takes stronger action to disarm Jewish settlers and assure the protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories. But despite tough conditions for its participation being set by the PLO, the US is still hoping to bring negotiators from the two sides to Washington. Senior PLO officials gathered late last night at the villa of Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, for an emergency meeting. Before the deliberations began, Mr Arafat dismissed as 'empty' and 'hollow' the Israeli cabinet's decision to disarm the most extremist groups among the settlers. PLO officials also said they considered the 'goodwill gesture' of offering the release of 800-1,000 Palestinian prisoners to be insufficient. The officials said they expected the PLO to refuse to accept a US invitation to resume peace negotiations in Washington on Wednesday without tougher action from Israel. Mr Nabil Shaath, the PLO's chief negotiator in detailed talks on an eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, said before last night's meeting that the PLO had accepted the invitation only in principle. He said: 'There are requirements for continuation of the talks - mainly the protection of the Palestinians from the settlers.' PLO officials said they expected a statement from the Tunis meeting to include questions on exactly which and how many Jewish settlers Israel intended to disarm. However, Mr Shaath explicitly refused to call such requirements 'preconditions', suggesting that however bitter the reaction to the massacre in Hebron on Friday of more than 40 Palestinians, many in the PLO feel it cannot be allowed to jeopardise the talks altogether. In Washington, President Bill Clinton telephoned Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Saturday evening in an effort to keep the peace talks moving in the wake of Friday's massacre in a Hebron mosque. 'Mubarak said he would do everything he could with Arafat and Rabin to keep the process going and that he was confident the talks could be kept on track,' a White House official said. US officials said emotions were clearly running high after Friday's attack, but the best way of meeting Palestinian demands for better security guarantees in the West Bank was to complete the peace process. 'If in fact we can move as quickly as possible to an agreement and implementation, that's the best way to change the realities on the ground in a way that will also discredit those who are determined to try to do it (the peace process) in,' a senior administration official said.</p>

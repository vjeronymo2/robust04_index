This was said by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, who was speaking to journalists after a  wreathe-laying ceremony at Yuriy Gagarin's tomb by the Kremlin  Wall.    In Boris Yeltsin's words, the idea of concluding a civic  accord memorandum has been backed by the State Duma, the  Federation Council, the government, and by many parliamentary  groups.    Boris Yeltsin said: "At 1000 hours tomorrow, I summon heads  of organizations to agree on the drafting of the text itself."    Boris Yeltsin noted the need for "all the strata of our  society to take part" in drawing up the memorandum, "so that it  really is a civic accord." "And after that, we are going to sign  it," the president said.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Operating loss posted by Black &amp; Decker BLACK &amp; Decker, the US household equipment maker, yesterday posted a fourth- quarter operating loss of Dollars 26.2m, partly reflecting continuing pressure on profits in European markets. A year ago, the company had operating income of Dollars 134m. during the quarter. The results were distorted by an after-tax charge of Dollars 134.7m to reorganise its Dynapert business and to reduce overcapacity in consumer and commercial businesses, mainly in Europe. The balance sheet was also muddied by the adoption of new accounting standards, including charges of Dollars 250m for the implementation of FAS 106. Including one-time items, the company suffered a fourth quarter net loss of Dollars 122.8m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, against net income of Dollars 31.9m, or 47 cents. Stripping special items, Black &amp; Decker said it earned 34 cents a share in the latest quarter. Revenues in the three months to December 31 rose 3 per cent to Dollars 1.39bn from Dollars 1.35bn. On Wall Street, Black &amp; Decker stock edged Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 17 7/8 . The shares were trading at around Dollars 20 in September, before the company warned investors of disappointing third-quarter earnings. At that time, the company blamed its unsatisfactory outlook on deteriorating European economies. For the full year, Black &amp; Decker recorded a net deficit of Dollars 333.6m, or Dollars 4.52 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 53m, or 81 cents, in 1991. Revenues rose to Dollars 4.78bn from Dollars 4.64bn. Excluding special items and accounting changes, the company said net income rose 25 per cent in 1992 to Dollars 66.4m from Dollars 53m. Earnings per share fell to 72 cents from 81 cents, reflecting an increase in shares outstanding. The company also filed a shelf registration to issue up to Dollars 1bn of debt securities. Proceeds will be used to to refinance existing debt. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, assigned a preliminary rating of triple B-minus to the shelf registration and affirmed its ratings of other Black &amp; Decker debt.</p>

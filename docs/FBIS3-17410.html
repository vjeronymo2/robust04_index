Speaking at a news conference in Moscow Thursday, Shokhin  pointed out that his appointment would be followed by a  reshuffle in the government. His consultations with Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin within the next few days will focus  on such spheres as economics, finances and external economic  relations, including those with former Soviet republics.    Shokhin added that no one had relieved him of his duties as  Russia's representative at the International Monetary Fund and  the World Bank and that he would supervise these issues in  future. He also said that until he was appointed as vice prime  minister it was the prime minister who directly supervised the  financial and economic spheres. However, Chernomyrdin had come  to the conclusion that this was too difficult considering the  huge number of other problems, he said.    Shokhin said that reformists who had left the government,  such as Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, did not believe that the  government would convince the IMF to grant Russia the second  part of the systematic reconstruction credit worth $1.5 Bn.  Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin had succeeded, Shokhin said.    Shokhin pointed out that strict credit and financial  policies  consistent with IMF requirements required the annulment or  suspension of a number of social programs with consent by the  parliament. The programs, worth a total of Rbs [rubles ] 90 Tn,  grant privileges and subsidies to enterprises, regions and some  social groups.    Shokhin said that the groups included residents of Russia's  northernmost areas, servicemen and policemen. He put special  emphasis on the fact that it was necessary to involve social and  political mechanisms to smooth the effects of this measure as  much as possible in the form of a social accord treaty to  implement the decision.</p>

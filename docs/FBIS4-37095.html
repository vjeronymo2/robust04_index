			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Europe correspondent Nitzan Horowitz] </F>   [Text] Madrid -- Representatives of the EU and Japan, who  yesterday opened the multilateral conference on economic affairs  in Rabat, reported about contacts with Syria regarding proposals  for projects initiated in the multilateral working group.  Syria, which boycotts the multilateral talks, has evinced  interest in the various proposals being discussed by experts in  workshops and in regional meetings.    A senior Israeli source said that Syria's interest in the  economic aspect of the multilateral talks is very great. He  said the Syrians have evinced great interest in the proceedings  of the work groups and are interested in being updated on this  issue. The source assessed that "the economic sphere could be  Syria's entrance gate into the multilateral process."    All the participants in the Rabat conference expressed the  hope that Syria and Lebanon will join the economic work group.  Some even said there is a feeling that a development in that  direction may take place soon. It is assessed that Syria has  reached the conclusion that the economic forum is the most  practical forum in the multilateral process and that it could  lead to rather tempting infrastructure and development projects.  Consequently, as the Israeli source said, "the Syrians do not  want to miss the train."    Economic sources claim that Syria is very well aware of the  fact that the projects being discussed in the conference have  far-reaching economic significance and harbor great potential  for large-scale international financing and investments which  Syria stands no chance of obtaining otherwise.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0400 GMT on 16 June  carries a recorded interview with Professor Ya'aqov Frenkel, the  Bank of Israel Governor who co-heads the Israeli delegation to  Rabat, in which Frenkel is asked about the Syrian interest in  the proceedings. Frenkel is recorded as saying: "Today we have  heard some reports by some delegations indicating that indeed  from their impression of their bilateral dealings with the  Syrians they gained the impression that indeed there might be  some growing interest and a somewhat more positive attitude  toward the committee. But I would emphasize very strongly that  this was not part of any formal report, nor is there hard  evidence. One talks about nuances and feelings, and that's  basically where we are."]    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 16 June carries  an interview with Uri Savir, director general of the Foreign  Ministry and the other co-head of the Israeli delegation to  Rabat, in which, referring to the same issue, Savir is recorded  as saying: "Based on various reports by the EU and Japan, it  looks as though Syria is evincing some interest in this  conference. Visits were paid to Syria by various elements,  especially the EC, which has organized this conference. Syria  is showing interest in the regional economic cooperation talks,  which is perhaps the most significant work group in the  multilateral talks. At this point, however, Syria has made no  commitment to join the talks; this is reserved for a later  stage."    [Asked about progress on the Israeli-Syrian track, Savir  says: "It is hard for me to say, because it is difficult to  guess exactly what stands behind this Syrian curiosity. Perhaps  they believe that progress will be achieved in their bilateral  talks with us, a thing they consider as a condition for joining  the multilateral talks. It is also possible that there is  something else here, namely, the more projects are being planned  between us and the Arab countries the more difficult it becomes  for any country to be left out of the picture." Savir adds: "I  assume Syria realizes that joining this framework will not  contribute to the peace process only, but to the Syrian economy  as well."]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "DVU Does Not Want To Run"] </F>   [Text] The right-wing extremist German People's Union  (DVU) of Munich publisher Gerhard Frey, 61, does not want to run  on its own ticket in the European and Bundestag elections. When  the DVU did not manage to get into the local parliament at the  elections in Hamburg, it renounced participation in the Landtag  elections in Lower Saxony. Now the party is calling for an  "agreement" with the Republikaner. Republikaner Chairman Franz  Schoenhuber, however, rejects any cooperation.</p>

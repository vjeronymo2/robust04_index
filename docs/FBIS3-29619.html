			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Rice traders expressed  concern Monday [21 February] about the delay in Japan's  emergency imports of rice from the United States and China for  March.    The Food Agency says there is no need to worry about the  pace  of shipments of foreign rice, but traders say the agency is too  optimistic.    "It might be difficult to secure necessary amounts of U.S.  and Chinese rice next month, so domestic and Thai rice will be  used to make up for them," one rice trader said.    The agency has said it plans to import 70 percent of total  rice consumption for table use for the March-June period -- 20  percent each from Thailand, China and the U.S., and 10 percent  from Australia.    Japan's monthly rice consumption for table use is some  500,000 tons, meaning that the agency has to import 350,000 tons  of rice a month.    But Japan has imported only 200,000 tons so far for March  supply, making it necessary to import 150,000 tons by the end of  this month as it usually takes at least a month to place rice  for sale on shelves after importation.    "The pace of rice imports (from China and the U.S.) has been  picking up since the second half of February, so there is no  concern," a Food Agency official said.    But rice traders said both the U.S. and China face problems  exporting rice smoothly.    "A ship must often wait a long time at a (Chinese) port for  rice to be loaded, in part because they have no experience in  exporting and importing rice," said an official at one rice  importer.    As for Californian rice, traders pointed to time-consuming  sanitary inspections at U.S. ports.    "It will be necessary to raise the portion of domestic and  long- grain Thai rice which has been imported smoothly," said an  official at Beikoku Data Bank, a rice market research agency.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Farmers seek new path to market: Deborah Hargreaves hears why the potato board is under fire Mr Graham Solari, a West Midlands farmer, lavishes tender loving care on the 3,000 tonnes of early potatoes he grows each year to ensure they attain high standards. He takes equal pride in knowing what his customers want. 'We've spent two years talking to our customers: they want white potatoes that look nice, are fresh and are the right shape,' he says. Mr Solari describes his tubers as 'canting' potatoes, an old Black Country expression. 'It means you can put the potatoes on to boil, hang out your washing and cant to the neighbour for an hour, and when you're back the potato is still boiling away and hasn't disintegrated.' He is proud of his own marketing skills and is adamant he needs no centralised body to do the job for him. He is one of at least 400 producers who have signed a petition calling for an immediate end to Britain's Potato Marketing Board. Changes to the potato board, which has controlled production for 60 years, were announced in November by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister. She said the board would be phased out over three years, but in the meantime it would act as a central research and marketing agency. But a growing number of farmers want the board abolished now. 'There's nothing the board does for me that I can't do better myself,' says Mr Solari, who pays Pounds 5,000 a year for membership out of his Pounds 320,000 turnover on potatoes. The rebel growers have collected enough names in opposition to the board to force it to hold a national poll on its future. They hope this will be held within weeks. Mr Solari thinks farmers should become closer to consumers themselves rather than relying on a central agency to do it for them. He says: 'There are a lot of smaller producers who think that, in some magical way, the potato board will rescue them if they're inefficient. That's just not going to happen.' Mr Solari has this year's seed potatoes sitting in plastic trays in insulated buildings on his 150 acres. Each stage of their growth is carefully monitored. Mr Solari uses 13 workers and a potato harvester to grade, sort and pack the potatoes, en route, in the hope they remain as fresh as possible when they arrive in the shops. Last year he made a good profit but the drive for quality came after a loss in 1992 when the market was oversupplied. 'We cut back our production by 1,000 tonnes to make sure we could concentrate more on quality,' he says.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dowty shares dip below cash offer TI GROUP, the specialist engineer, yesterday appeared to lose some of the momentum it has build up in its hostile Pounds 495m bid for Dowty Group, the aerospace company, after its target's share price fell in the market. Dowty's shares fell 5p to 173p, below the 175p value of a cash alternative that TI has offered shareholders. Coming just seven days before TI's final offer closes, it was the first time that Dowty's share price had fallen below the cash alternative. Arguably it is the first time that Dowty has looked as if it stands a serious chance of escaping from the confident TI's clutches. 'There are plenty of things that can happen in the next week', said a Dowty adviser. 'But the word I get from the market is that people are nothing like as certain that TI is going to win.' TI said that trading in the shares was thin and dismissed the price fall as the result of one small sale followed by brokers marking down the shares. One option, as yet unused, is for TI to buy shares in the market. It is allowed to buy up to 29 per cent of Dowty at prices up to the 175p cash alternative or up to 10 per cent of Dowty's shares up to the value of the four-for-15 share offer. The share offer was worth 182.4p after TI closed yester-day at 342p after a share split. As the two sides traded interpretations of Dowty's share price move, the war of words continued over Dowty's estimated Pounds 29m pre-tax profit figure for 1992. Responding to Dowty's confirmation that it will add a further Pounds 3m to this figure - from a cancelled Ministry of Defence contract - when it publishes preliminary figures on Friday, TI again attacked the quality of its target's earnings. 'Dowty has attempted to bolster its profits with one-off receipts and credits and has yet to provide a convincing explanation for a higher than expected profits estimate,' TI said. Before Dowty announced its Pounds 29m estimate, but after TI had declared its offer final, the market had been expecting profits of about Pounds 22m. Mr Roy Roberts, Dowty chairman, wrote to shareholders saying TI's bid was 'running out of wind'. 'Your board sees little or no premium in the level of the TI offers,' he said.</p>

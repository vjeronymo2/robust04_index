			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROOM TOO DARK AND DREARY? THE SOLUTION MAY LIE OVERHEAD;  </P> <P> SKYLIGHTS: A HOLE IN THE ROOF CAN PROVIDE A SENSE OF OPENNESS AND LIGHT TO LIFT  THE SPIRITS. INSTALLATION CAN BE RELATIVELY PAINLESS.  </P> <P> Paul and Marta Sheffield were so sure about what they wanted in a house they  could sum it up in three word: openness and light.  </P> <P> "When we started house-hunting a year and a half ago, we told the realtor we  only wanted to see houses with cathedral ceilings," Paul says.  </P> <P> When she first walked into the house they eventually bought in Huntington  Beach, Marta was so discouraged she wanted to turn around and walk right back  out.  </P> <P> Even with a huge, open cathedral ceiling in the living room, "It was so dark  you couldn't believe it," Marta says.  </P> <P> "But it had so much potential," Paul says.  </P> <P> The house was right in every other way, so they bought it, moved in, and  ordered skylights for that dark living room.  </P> <P> "When the installers opened up the roof, the sun came pouring in, and it was  just like walking into heaven," Paul says.  </P> <P> The Sheffields chose two skylights in the most popular size, 2 by 4 feet, made  of opaque white acrylic, which maximizes the light while protecting carpets,  curtains and furniture from the fading that direct sunlight can cause.  </P> <P> "The living room now behaves as an atrium during the day," Paul says.  </P> <P> "The light is so uplifting. It changes your whole emotions," he says.  </P> <P> Marta says she appreciates the skylights most when she gets up in the morning.  "I leave the house every day by 5:30 in the morning. Now when I walk through  the living room, I can see light. It doesn't seem quite so early. And it's  still light when I come home too.  </P> <P> "Darkness really depresses both of us," says Marta.  </P> <P> Marta's potted palms have benefited from the increased light too. "They're  growing like crazy," she says.  </P> <P> "Skylights are an easy way to make a change in the way a house feels," says  Judy Weston of Skylights by Weston in Fountain Valley, installers of the  Sheffields' skylights.  </P> <P> And Paul says the installation was relatively painless. "It only took a day."  </P> <P> One reason it went so quickly, Weston says, is that cathedral ceiling  installations are the simplest and least expensive. If there is an attic, a  light shaft must be constructed as well. And in some cases, electrical and heat  connections must be rerouted, which also adds to the cost.  </P> <P> Roof type is also a factor, Weston says. Composition roofs are the easiest to  cut into, while wood shake and concrete tile roof make the job somewhat more  difficult. But skylights can be installed in any kind of roof.  </P> <P> Fixed skylights are less expensive than openable panels, and glass costs  slightly less than acrylic, according to Dan Gomes of Bristolite Skylights in  Santa Ana, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of skylights.  </P> <P> Because each installation is different, costs vary, but Weston says a 2-by-4  skylight could range anywhere from $600 to $1,800.  </P> <P> Aside from cost, Weston says the most common question she hears is, "Will it  leak?"  </P> <P> "And I say, yes, it will if it's not installed properly. During the winter, we  get calls all the time from people who had skylights installed by  handyman-types or who did it themselves. We spend a lot of time repairing other  people's leaks," she says.  </P> <P> With skylights, as with other home improvements, it's important to make sure  you're dealing with a licensed, bonded contractor. "Ask for references. Ask if  they carry liability insurance," says Cherie Patch, also of Skylights by  Weston.  </P> <P> It is possible to install a skylight yourself, Gomes says. Bristolite sells to  individual homeowners as well as professional installers, and also provides  installation instructions.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, he says, too many people follow the wrong sequence. "A lot of  people go ahead and cut the opening in the roof and then hope it's a standard  size." If it isn't, they need a custom skylight, which costs more, he says.  </P> <P> "The best application for the do-it-yourselfer is a self-flashing unit on a  composite roof," Gomes says. "You peel the roofing back, place the skylight on  the actual tongue-in-groove or plywood, put the roofing material back over it  and apply sealants." The other most common installation, a curb mount with a  frame supporting the skylight, is most often used on tile or wood shake roofs.  </P> <P> Before you decide what type of skylight to install, Gomes and Weston recommend  thinking about how much light you want to let in. Opaque white, such as what  the Sheffields chose, transmits more light than a clear skylight, while bronze  or gray tinted skylights let in a more subdued light. Bristolite offers three  different whites, with different levels of opacity. White skylights also block  ultraviolet light, which can attack drapes, carpets or whatever is below.  </P> <P> Ultraviolet blocking was another reason the Sheffields chose white skylights.  They wanted more light on the paintings in their living room, but they didn't  want to risk damaging them.  </P> <P> "The actual objective can differ," Gomes says. "Think about whether you're  trying to access light or see out of the skylight."  </P> <P> Patch chose a bronze skylight for her bedroom, which lets in muted light during  the day but allows her to see the stars on clear nights.  </P> <P> Glass skylights are becoming more popular, Gomes says. "Architects are  specifying glass more and more," he says. "It costs less because of the amount  of labor involved in manufacturing the unit, and it's easier to keep clean." It  is less sensitive to scratching than acrylic, and can be tinted any color.  </P> <P> Another choice that is becoming more popular is the roof window, which fits  closer to the roof and is installed between the rafters rather than above them.  "They've been used more on the East Coast, and have just been introduced here,"  Gomes says. "Aesthetically, roof windows are better looking. They have a low  profile."  </P> <P> Even a small skylight can make a big difference, Weston says. "Since we started  in 1977, we've installed skylights just about everywhere. Some people want them  in closets. We've put little 2 by 2 skylights in small bathrooms in (Seal  Beach) Leisure World. They were just like caves before we put in the lights."  </P> <P> Skylights do have some disadvantages. If they are fixed and uninsulated, they  can bring up indoor temperatures on a warm day. And on a bright day, there can  sometimes be too much light. "We were watching the World Cup soccer matches and  I was teasing my wife that we needed sun visors to block the glare," Paul  Sheffield says. "But it really isn't a problem. We can just use the TV in the  bedroom if we want to watch during the day."  </P> <P> Sunlight shades can help with both glare and heat problems, Weston says. "We  thought about getting shades," says Paul, "But for now, we just want to let in  as much light as possible."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- Formations of  overseas-based pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical takeoff  and landing] assault planes of the U.S. Marines on April 1  launched surprise attack exercises on strategic objects in the  northern half of Korea in the skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang,  Oeyon islet and Chungju, South Korea, in coordination with  flying corps of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the  puppet Air Force, according to military sources.    Meanwhile, tank groups and armed bandits of the puppet Army  fired scores of tank guns and hundreds of large-calibre machine  gun bullets in the area of Paju County.    These show that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets are recklessly rushing ahead toward a war against the  North.</p>

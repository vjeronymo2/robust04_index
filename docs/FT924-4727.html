			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Competition regulation THE GOVERNMENT wants to tighten up competition policy in ways consistent with EC legislation. Yesterday, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, published a green paper with proposals to outlaw abuses of market power, such as predatory pricing and other anti-competitive practices. Such abuses are currently investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, whose remit, unlike that of the EC, covers action against complex monopolies, where several companies with at least 25 per cent of a market behave in anti-competitive ways. British rules also provide a wide range of remedies, including voluntary undertakings to desist from anti-competitive behaviour, price controls and the divestment of a business. The EC regime is different in that it involves a simpler, one-stage process; where guilt is established, fines can be levied and the offenders sued. Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome prohibits abuse of dominant position - in practice where a company has more than 40 per cent of a market - affecting trade between EC member states. The EC Commission also has greater powers than the MMC to pursue complaints. The main advantage of the EC approach is its greater deterrent value. Yesterday's green paper offers three options for strengthening the UK system in the light of EC practice. The first involves beefing up the current approach with additional investigation powers and perhaps creating liability for damages. This, however, would do little to increase the deterrent effect. The second option would be to switch entirely to the EC approach, prohibiting abuse of dominant position. This would have the advantage of making the UK system congruent with the EC's, with offenders facing fines and the risk of damages. However, anxious not to lose the flexibility and range of the UK approach, the green paper suggests that the new rules might apply where market share exceeds 25 rather than 40 per cent. And the wider range of remedies in UK law, such as divestment and price controls, would be retained. Option three combines both approaches: an Article 86-type prohibition on abuse of dominant power and retention of the UK powers to investigate complex monopolies. In theory, this looks the most attractive option: it combines the flexibility of the UK system with EC-style deterrence. The obvious disadvantage is that business would have to deal with two systems in parallel, something which sounds ominously complex. As Mr Heseltine pointed out, however, it is not only consumers that benefit from tighter competition policy - business also flourishes where abuse of market power is curbed. If UK business feels that any attempt to secure the best of both worlds would involve too much regulation, now is the time to say so.</p>

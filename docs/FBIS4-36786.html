			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Isam 'Abd-al-Jawad] </F>   [Text] The security forces in Asyut have foiled a  terrorist plan in Sidfa led by a number of illiterate peasants.  The security forces foiled another plan in al-Badari last  week. This is the first time that the security forces have  uncovered a terrorist organization that was planning to carry  out terrorist operations in Sidfa and outside that did not  involve university- and school-educated people. The security  forces arrested 19 people, including 14 of the leaders of the  military organization in Sidfa that was involved in the  implementation of terrorist operations in Sidfa and Abu Tij.  Four members of the same organization were killed in Tima in an  exchange of fire with the security forces.    ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Sidfa organization was  more accurate in the implementation of its operations and the  selection of its members, whose identity was difficult to  uncover. It planned its operations from a cave in Tima, in  Suhaj Governorate, which was difficult to reach. The  organization members established training camps for their  operations in the Tima desert.    A security source in Asyut has said that the new  organization  was dangerous because all its members were illiterate peasants  who are not so easy to uncover. The organization was led by  Anwar Hashim Muhammad, 23, who is accused of involvement in more  than one murder case.    The source added that the security forces have arrested 14  members of the military organization without any resistance.  But four members escaped to Tima, in Suhaj, to prepare for new  terrorist operations. The security forces, in conjunction with  the state security in Suhaj, discovered their whereabouts and  killed them following an exchange of fire.    The security forces, accompanied by armored vehicles  equipped  with Goryunov machine guns, cordoned off the eastern areas from  al-Badari to the border of the Suhaj Governorate in one of the  largest combing operations in the area to find other members of  the military organization in al-Badari. Large forces were also  combing the mountainous areas of Sidfa and Abu Tij from the west.    The security authorities in Suhaj are deploying large forces  at the northern entry and exit points of Asyut and are combing  areas in Tima and Juhaynah that are close to Asyut in a pincers  operation.    A security source denied a claim by the popular  organizations  in Asyut that they can deliver Rif'at Zaydan [not further  identified] within two months. The security source affirmed  that the popular organizations know nothing about Zaydan because  he frequently changes his identity and hideouts, and this claim  is a new attempt by these organizations to win over public  opinion. Only the security forces are able to identify his  location and arrest him, and this is expected to take place  within days.</p>

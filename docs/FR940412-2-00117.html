			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen on Proposed Consent Agreement With Martin Marietta Corp. File No. 941&hyph;0038 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent Martin Marietta Corporation manufactures satellites, which are launched into orbit by expendable launch vehicles, some of which it also manufactures. It proposes to acquire the Space Systems Division of General Dynamics Corporation, which manufactures Atlas-class expendable launch vehicles. The theory of the complaint is that if this acquisition is consummated, Martin Marietta's launch vehicle division will gain access to trade secrets concerning the products of other satellite manufacturers, and will transfer such information to Martin Marietta's satellite division, which will use it to injure its competitors. The Commission's order would enjoin Martin Marietta from misusing its rivals' confidential information in this manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vertical integration, and combinations designed to achieve the efficiencies of such integration, are common phenomena, particularly in the aerospace industry. Accordingly, it would seem that there are already ample opportunities for the sort of abusive information-sharing which concerns the Commission. However, equally common are contractual obligations between vertically integrated companies, and firms that do business with one of their divisions, to prevent the sharing of those firms' confidential business information with other parts of the conglomerate with which they compete. The question then is whether such contracts are sufficient to avoid any competitive problem, or whether government-imposed requirements are necessary; if there exists a significant number of substantiated incidents of such activity, then private agreements would not seem adequate. However, the opposite appears to be the case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While various Commission personnel have, in recent years, exhorted the business community to be sensitive to antitrust concerns stemming from the sharing of business information, Commission enforcement actions in this area have been rare, and no case has involved the strategic misuse of proprietary information so as to injure a competitor. Furthermore, Martin Marietta currently manufactures both satellites and launch vehicles, and is already privy to competitively significant information from other satellite manufacturers, yet I am unaware of any instance where it has been alleged that proprietary information has been used for exclusionary purposes by Martin Marietta, or indeed by any other aerospace manufacturer. As a result, it seems fair to conclude that contractual obligations prohibiting such behavior, coupled with the threat of business tort and treble-damage antitrust suits, are sufficient deterrents. Moreover, as the amount of available business in the aerospace industry continues to dwindle, it is hard to imagine that developing a reputation for abusing confidential information would enhance any company's competitiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's proposed consent is somewhat puzzling in its coverage. If the theory of the complaint is correct_that Martin Marietta's dominant power in the launch vehicle market would facilitate anticompetitive information-sharing in the satellite market_why would the company stop there? The theory would seem to support as well allegations of other exclusionary and tying practices, yet these are not included. The Commission, correctly I believe, concluded that there was no evidence to support such charges; I therefore find it strange that it chose to go forward on the equally speculative information-sharing allegations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, I do not believe that the evidence supports the theory behind the Commission's complaint, nor that a Commission order would be superior to privately negotiated confidentiality agreements for protecting the trade secrets of satellite manufacturers. I dissent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8743 Filed 4&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6750&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS;  </P> <P> HAVING ALREADY COME A LONG WAY, WOMEN DECIDE TO CHANGE SPONSOR  </P> <P> Women's professional tennis will enter the next decade with a new sponsor . . .  sort of. There will be a change from Virginia Slims to General Foods -- or from  cigarettes to cereal. Although both are Philip Morris companies, 1990 will be  the first year since 1970 that Virginia Slims has not sponsored the women's  tour.  </P> <P> Along the way, General Foods' five-year, $28-million contract with the Women's  International Professional Tennis Council (WIPTC) to serve as the worldwide  sponsor of the women's game may have elevated politics to a new level in the  most political of pro sports.  </P> <P> General Foods won the right to sponsor women's tennis over Procter &amp;  Gamble, which withdrew its four-year, $31-million bid from consideration when  it sensed a lack of support from the players.  </P> <P> As soon as Merrett Stierheim became the chief executive officer of the Women's  International Tennis Assn. (WITA) in 1985, he began pressing for a change in  sponsors, partly because of the image drawn between cigarettes and women  athletes. For years, there had been a growing uneasiness that women's tennis  was sponsored by a product that is believed to be a cause of lung cancer.  However, there was also a feeling of loyalty to Philip Morris and this was  especially keen in the veteran players.  </P> <P> "When we first started out, Virginia Slims was the only people that would help  us out," said Martina Navratilova of the WITA executive board. "They really put  women's tennis on the map. But now, it's time to diversify."  </P> <P> As a result of the agreement, General Foods, will become the overall series  sponsor, and Virginia Slims will keep its season-ending Virginia Slims  Championships, the bonus pool and title sponsorship of an undetermined number  of events.  </P> <P> Ellen Merlo, vice president of marketing services at Philip Morris, said that  Virginia Slims will announce, just before Wimbledon, details and format of its  named events in 1990. Merlo said she is confident that the female players  welcomed the continued involvement of Philip Morris.  </P> <P> As president of the WITA, Chris Evert said she was part of discussions with  Philip Morris as long as two years ago when the corporation was told that the  women's players did not want a cigarette company as an umbrella sponsor.  </P> <P> "The general feeling is to try to gradually get away from the cigarette  sponsorship, to put it bluntly," she said. "There has been a lot of negative  press about athletes being associated (with cigarettes). But quite honestly,  they're the only ones that really have been able to put up a lot of money for  these sports. It's like, 'Hey, where are the other sponsors knocking on the  door?' " she said.  </P> <P> WITA Vice President Pam Shriver said the public may notice the change in  sponsorship and it will "take a little bit of the controversial sting off the  cigarette focus."  </P> <P> She said there are many who believe that women's tennis should not have any  involvement with a tobacco product, but she does not agree.  </P> <P> "I am not a smoking advocate in any way, but I am an advocate of people's  Constitutional rights to advertise and to promote a product that's a legal  product," she said. "It's not like there's a lack of information about it.  People make decisions on whether or not they're going to do things that aren't  necessarily good for the body.  </P> <P> "You could do a bunch of things," Shriver said. "You could over-eat yourself to  death. That's the way I'm going to go."  </P> <P> Spurned suitor Procter &amp; Gamble got in the last word anyway. The company  recently withdrew its $500,000 sponsorship of the WITA, saying the program  didn't mean much without the overall sponsorship of the women's tour.  </P> <P> Evert is top seeded for the $250,000 Virginia Slims of Indian Wells begining  Monday at Hyatt Grand Champions. She has a first-round bye, then plays the  winner of Hana Mandlikova's match against a qualifier.  </P> <P> Evert will be playing her first tournament as the No. 4 ranked player in the  world, which she became last week when Gabriela Sabatini moved up to No. 3.  </P> <P> Also receiving first-round byes are second-seeded Helena Sukova, third-seeded  Shriver and fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva. Lori McNeil, seeded fifth, plays  Terry Phelps in a first-round match.  </P> <P> Tracy Austin, playing her first tournament singles in five years, meets  seventh-seeded Nicole Provis in the first round. Austin and Kathy Rinaldi are  wild-card entries. Maleeva got into the 28-player draw as a special exemption  when Amy Frazier, who earned a straight entry into the draw after winning the  Virginia Slims of Kansas, decided not to use it.  </P> <P> Claudia Kohde-Kilsch withdrew from singles because of an injury. Patty Fendick  also withdrew from singles but will play doubles.  </P> <P> It was bound to happen: The International Tennis Federation, reigning monolith  of world tennis, is at odds with the Assn. of Tennis Professionals, who want to  govern themselves in 1990.  </P> <P> The ITF, which had sole responsibility for setting the men's tour calendar  until the ATP announced its own 1990 tour schedule, is challenging the ATP  about when the Davis Cup should be played in 1990. This move by the IFF is  regarded as the first serious test of the ATP's plan to run its own tour.  </P> <P> In January, the ATP said its 1990 calendar showed that the first round of  world-group Davis Cup matches would be scheduled the week starting Jan. 29, the  week immediately after the Australian Open. However, the ITF has said that 1990  Davis Cup competition will begin the week of Feb. 5 so players have time to  adjust to travel.  </P> <P> If the Davis Cup is actually played the week of Feb. 5 as the ITF wants it to  be, then it would be in direct conflict with three ATP tournaments: a $600,000  event at Milan, a $250,000 event at San Francisco and a $150,000 event at  Guaruja, Brazil.  </P> <P> Hamilton Jordan, chief executive officer of the ATP, said the ATP tour board  would not find the ITF's decision acceptable.  </P> <P> However, the ITF remains the governing body responsible for overseeing the  Davis Cup.  </P> <P> Consider Swedish player Jonas Svensson. Would you buy a used car from this man?  How about a new one?  </P> <P> In a unique promotional agreement with Svensson, Volvo Motors of Sweden has  signed Svensson to sell cars at each city where he plays a Grand Prix event.  </P> <P> As expected, Stefan Edberg has signed ProServ to represent him. Edberg, the  23-year-old reigning Wimbledon champion, recently sued Advantage International,  which was his management company for six years.  </P> <P> Last week, Advantage countersued Edberg for breach of contract and is seeking  $7.5 million in damages.  </P> <P> According to Advantage, the dispute started when the Inland Revenue, the United  Kingdom's version of the Internal Revenue Service, audited Edberg, who  maintains a residence in London.  </P> <P> Edberg sued Advantage alleging breach of contract, demanding that Advantage pay  his English taxes. He also asked that his contract with the Washington-based  company, which has three years to run, be terminated.  </P> <P> According to Advantage, after Edberg filed suit, the tax issue was settled in  his favor. Advantage decided to sue.  </P> <P> Charlie Pasarell, tournament director of the Newsweek Champions Cup , said he  would like to have John McEnroe as one of his five wild cards, but McEnroe has  played three straight weeks and has said he needs time off to prepare for the  Davis Cup, April 7-9, at San Diego.  </P> <P> Pasarell's biggest star, Boris Becker, withdrew from the WCT Finals in Dallas  because of the flu and Andre Agassi, his second-biggest star, withdrew from the  same event after he pulled a muscle. Both are expected to play in the Newsweek  event.  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> There's a new book out by Donald Dell, founder and chairman of ProServ and one  of the most powerful men in tennis: "Minding Other People's Business,"  published by Villard Books. . . . Ivan Lendl, top-ranked player in the world,  will play Jimmy Connors in the continuing Michelin Challenge exhibition series  at 7:30 p.m. April 12 at the Forum.  </P> <P> ProServ, which represents Connors, said he withdrew from the WCT Finals because  of injury. Connors is entered at Scottsdale this week and also in the Newsweek  Champions Cup. . . . Since Pam Shriver is not playing the French Open, her  usual Grand Slam doubles partner, Martina Navratilova, will be teaming with  Hana Mandlikova. Navratilova is also going to have a different doubles partner  at Rome: Chris Evert.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO SUSPECTS IN SLAYING OF 2  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said Thursday they have no suspect or motive in the slaying  of a young Wilmington woman and her son who were found stabbed to death Sunday  morning in their new home in the 1000 block of M Street.  </P> <P> The bodies of Marilyn Galloway, 27, and her son, Jose Morales, 12, were  discovered about 10 a.m. by a neighbor, according to police.  </P> <P> Homicide Detective Larry Kallestad said the discovery came several days after  Galloway last reported to work at a local fast-food restaurant.  </P> <P> The victims, Kallestad said, had moved to the house in Wilmington within the  last month.  </P> <P> Though police have not identified any suspect, Kallestad said they believe the  killer was known to the victims because there were no signs of forced entry.  Likewise, Kallestad said it was suspected that Galloway's son was slain because  he could have identified his mother's killer.  </P> <P> "Those are only suppositions at this point, but they are viable suppositions,"  said Kallestad.  </P> <P> "Right now, we are hoping for some significant leads to develop from our  analysis of physical evidence," Kallestad added. The evidence includes what  authorities believe to be the murder weapon, he said.  </P></p>

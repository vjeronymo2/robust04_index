			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Tasks for the mobile manager IBM IS apparently about to choose a consumer products boss as its new chief executive. Barclays is looking worldwide for a 'change agent' who could come from outside banking. Ilva, Italy's state-owned steelmaker, hopes for rescue from a newly recruited Japanese manager. Volkswagen, in hiring GM's procurement supremo, has also taken his sidekicks. With 'back to basics' and 'sticking to your knitting' the business cliches of the hour, you might think the mobile manager would be out of favour. Instead, top executives skip from group to group like soccer managers; and shareholders call for fresh management 'from outside' whenever problems appear intractable. Two factors contribute to this trend. First is the one Sir Denys Henderson, who is heading the search for Barclays' new boss, alluded to when he talked of the need for a 'change agent'. The 1960s belief in generalised management skills has dropped out of favour - to be replaced with a belief in a generalised talent for instigating change. Thus Mr Louis Gerstner, favourite for the job at IBM, is in demand because he has brought about change at American Express and RJR Nabisco. Now he can apply those skills to changing what was once America's mightiest corporation. The second factor, though less overt, is surely more potent. This is a general crisis of the corporation, the organisational structure created by such companies as the Pennsylvania Railroad and Du Pont a century ago. Obsolete model Global competition, the revolutionary impact of information technology, the ever-vaguer boundaries between a company and its suppliers and customers - together these are making the traditional corporate model obsolete. When new managers are sought, the underlying belief is that they will resolve the crisis - or perhaps merely make it go away. In such circumstances, an incoming executive's success depends only in part on those characteristics of will-power and moral certainty that headhunters call 'leadership qualities'. More decisive, in the long run, is the nature of the business, the seriousness of its day-to-day problems, and the extent to which the board really wishes to address the questions posed by the crisis of the corporation. The most celebrated change manager of recent US experience, Mr Jack Welch of GE, started to address his company's hidden structural crisis before it began to be reflected in operating results. He had the time, therefore, to think and persuade. A manager brought in from outside to rescue a sick company has no such luxury. At the same time as trying to bring about long-term, far-reaching change, the new boss must also cope with each day's fresh diet of crisis and despair. The task is made the harder if the new leader must also learn an industry, a culture, a language from scratch. Valuable insights Yet an outside manager has one enormous advantage over even the most competent insider. The most difficult aspect of the crisis of the corporation is the need for companies to redraw their boundaries - to cope with changing global competition by taking a fresh look at what they make, as opposed to what they buy, and how they relate to suppliers and customers. On this issue, above all, an outside manager can offer insights that insiders miss. Significantly, most of the big companies currently looking far afield for management talent have this sort of problem. IBM must decide just which of its huge range of computer activities are its core business; VW must shift from internal to outside sourcing of components; and once its immediate bad debt problems are past, Barclays must resolve the tension between a domestic retail financial services operation and an internationally minded wholesale banking and securities business. Perhaps there is, after all, no contradiction between the back-to-basics mood and the desire to find top managers from outside. Companies must decide just what their knitting is, before setting about the task of sticking to it. For those who find that difficult, an outside manager who can help is worth all the fees and bad publicity that a public search entails.</p>

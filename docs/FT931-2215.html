			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nikon fears first deficit for 34 years NIKON, the camera and precision instruments manufacturer, expects to post a pre-tax loss in the year ending in March - its first loss in 34 years. The company had expected to break even, but now warns of a pre-tax loss of Y2.2bn (Dollars 18.8m) on revenues of Y205bn, down from an earlier forecast of Y210bn. A weaker-than-expected market for cameras and semiconductor manufacturing equipment was responsible for the revised figures, Nikon said. Although overall camera sales were steady and the division had made a profit, the level of sales had been much lower than the company had expected. Demand for single-lens reflex cameras and lenses was particularly weak, although compact cameras sold well. The weakness of the semiconductor market had also been a factor behind Nikon's downturn. Sales were down 30 per cent on the previous year. The company believes that the first half of next year will remain difficult. A return to profit depends largely on the extent of the expected economic recovery in the second half, the company said. Victor of Japan (JVC) plans to take half-finished digital compact cassette players from its majority shareholder Matsushita Electric Industrial in order to save production costs, Reuter reports from Tokyo.</p>

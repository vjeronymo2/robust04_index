			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Business failures rise by 48% in north-west RECEIVERSHIPS in north-west England were 48 per cent higher in the first 11 months of this year than in the same period last year and are likely to pass 550 by the end of December, according to Latham Crossley Davis, a firm of accountants based in Chorley, Lancashire. Construction, tourism, leisure, property, building materials and furniture were the sectors hardest hit. The rate of increase, however, has been declining during the year. The month-on-month rise was 286 per cent last January, while the increase for the first half-year was 63 per cent. The rate dropped back to 31 per cent for the five months from July to November. There were fewer receiverships last month than in November 1991. The firm has also been questioning 500 business leaders since July and has found a slight rise in confidence. On a scale of 1 to 10, confidence averaged 5.5 between July and December, but had risen to 6.5 in November.</p>

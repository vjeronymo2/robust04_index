			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Hot air on Africa In Cape Town in 1960 Harold Macmillan warned white South Africans of the 'wind of change' sweeping through Africa. His words captured the mood of the continent at a critical moment. Three disastrous decades later, ravaged by mismanagement and misfortune, Africa is once again at a watershed, beset by problems which can only be overcome with external help. Once again this week a British prime minister, leader of a nation with unrivalled historical and commercial links throughout the continent, stood before the South African parliament, now at last multiracial. He was marvellously placed to launch the fresh international initiative Africa so badly needs. Instead he delivered little more than hot air. Had he risen to the occasion, John Major would have begun by making clear the depth of Africa's crisis. Instead, he neglected the fact that most Africans are getting poorer, and took comfort from economic and political reforms under way which have yet to launch a sustained recovery. Having spelt out the gravity of the situation, the prime minister could then have set out an agenda for action. Instead of contenting himself with a brief self-congratulatory reference to the Trinidad terms on government-to-government debt, he could have acknowledged the need for radical action in this area, including relief for countries such as Uganda which are hobbled with debt service payments to multilateral institutions. Also on his agenda should have been the need for better co-ordinated aid programmes, with a lower proportion of tied aid, a higher proportion allocated to social services, and new conditionalities including ceilings on military spending. He might also have done more to spell out the circumstances in which humanitarian obligations to avert genocide and relieve starvation must take precedence over state sovereignty, and should not have avoided addressing the damaging dispute between the World Bank and other development agencies over the merits of structural adjustment. As it was, Mr Major's only substantial proposal was a call for 'preventive diplomacy' with regional peacekeeping units, which will be pursued at the UN. As Mr Major said, energies have been consumed in trying to limit trouble after it has started. It would be far better and less costly to pre-empt it. Would that Britain were prepared to apply this precept in Nigeria. Africa's most populous nation, and second biggest economy, is heading for disaster. Yet despite close ties, no foreign office minister has visited Nigeria this year, whereas Baroness Chalker has been twice to Rwanda. And while refusing visas to members of the Nigerian regime, the UK has not suspended a contract to equip its army with British tanks. Mr Macmillan's words resonated around the world and have entered the history books. Mr Major's are unlikely to make even a footnote.</p>

Domestic automobile producers shipped 140,702 vehicles to  North America last year, down 8.7 percent from 1992.    The fall was attributed to the shutdown of Hyundai Motor's  plant in Quebec, Canada, a temporary sales vacuum caused by Kia  Motors' export car model change, and Daewoo's separation with  General Motors (GM), which put an end to exports of its LeMan  model.    According to MOTIE officials, exports to North America will  see growth this year but the growth rate will not be substantial.    As reasons, the officials cited the continued closure of  Hyundai's Quebec plant, which is undergoing an overhaul of  production lines, and the brake put on Daewoo's exports of the  LeMans.    The Hyundai plant in Quebec was originally supposed to  resume  operations in September 1995 but a delay is expected because of  problems concerning the planned equity capital increase by  Hyundai for its Canadian subsidiary, according to the officials.    Following its separation with GM, Daewoo has been banned  from  shipping the LeMan model, which was developed by its former  partner, to North America.    This year, Daewoo will produce the Legend model under a  license agreement with Japan's Nissan. But this model is not  likely to offset the vacuum caused by the ban on Daewoo's LeMans.    In contrast, Kia is expected to see a sharp increase in  exports to the world's largest market. Starting from the second  half of last year, it has been shipping the new Aspire model,  instead of Festivas, to Ford under an OEM (original equipment  manufacturing) agreement.    At the same time, it is building up its own sales network in  North America to sell Sephias and Sportages under its own brand  name.    According to MOTIE officials, Korean automakers are expected  to suffer setbacks in exports to China this year as the  neighboring country has strengthened control on imports of  consumer products including foreign vehicles.    Last year, vehicle shipments from Korea to China are  believed  to have totaled over 50,000 units. This year, the figure is  likely to be drastically slashed.    To other parts of the world, Korean car exports will enjoy  continued growth. Overall, automobile shipments are expected to  shoot up by 20 percent to around 800,000 units this year,  according to MOTIE officials.</p>

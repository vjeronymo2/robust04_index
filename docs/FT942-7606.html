			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Companies asked to join China fight Human Rights Watch, a worldwide organisation, has for the past five months been holding 'quiet conversations' with dozens of multinational companies in the US, Europe and Asia with the aim of developing a set of principles which they could voluntarily employ to improve human rights in China. The effort began in January as the US administration was warning Beijing it must make efforts to improve its human rights record or risk losing its Most Favoured Nation status. China mostly ignored the warning, and President Bill Clinton has until June 3 to decide what action to take. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, told the president on Monday China had complied with only some of the conditions, but he recommended very limited sanctions. Human Rights Watch's Asia arm said there had been a 'significant overall deterioration' of human rights in China where the government has 'opted for a policy of conspicuous crackdown . . . and wide-ranging repressions'. Mr Richard Dicker, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch, said: 'It now appears likely that some approach to the corporate community to take voluntary measures will figure into the Clinton administration's MFN resolution package. The issue is how in a discreet low-key, effective way (companies) can use their presence and influence for the betterment of human rights, which is clearly in their long-term interest.' Human Rights Watch has developed five proposed measures: Prevention of the inadvertent use of prison products or forced labour products in their production process. Prohibition of mandatory political indoctrination sessions on company premises. Adoption of an employment policy which bars discrimination on the basis of political beliefs. Protection of employees' rights to free expression and association. Conveying concerns about human rights violations to relevant authorities. Many businesses have been cool to proposals for a code like the Sullivan Principles which were employed in South Africa. Mr Cal Cohen, one of the leading Washington lobbyists for renewal of MFN, said in the case of South Africa, the effort was a global one; in the case of China, only the US is interested in human rights. 'If we as a government ask companies to convey political sentiments, we will be seen as government representatives rather than business. We might then accomplish less,' he said.</p>

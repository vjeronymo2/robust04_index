			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: ABF Associated British Foods, the UK's biggest manufacturer of daily bread, must be praying for a miracle to deliver it from the evil of price competition. Yet, if anything, the market is about to deteriorate some more. Following J. Sainsbury's price offensive last week, Kwik Save has sliced the price of bread again. Although retailers are mainly absorbing the pain, such competitive pressures will prevent bakers from raising the price of branded breads. With continuing over-capacity and flour and wage costs pressing upwards, the industry's margins can only suffer more. ABF's cast iron balance sheet will allow it to endure the misery better than the likes of Tomkins. Nevertheless, ABF's prospects look decidedly dull, especially considering the declining income on its Pounds 500m cash pile. Perhaps the only way to stimulate a re-rating would be to spend this cash. Despite his oft-professed dislike for wheeling and dealing, Mr Garry Weston has proved a dab hand at acquisitions and disposals. Comfort can be drawn from the cautious way Mr Weston treats ABF's money as his own - which is perhaps not surprising since he remains the company's biggest shareholder. If only he could repeat his trick of selling the Fine Fare grocery chain and recycling the funds into British Sugar - which has just lifted profits 17 per cent - shareholders would be best pleased.</p>

At about 1300, a small group of them came down  to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] personnel carriers situated  some 350 meters from the hospital. With UNPROFOR approval, the  chetniks are continuing settling their civilians inside the 3 km  zone. This is what is happening in Zubcici, south of the town.  This is what is happening east of the town, in the suburbs of  (?Fazagici) and (?Pubjeri).    One should also say that all these three villages are  villages that were populated exclusively by Muslims before the  war. A (?similar) situation is in Kopaci, which is more than 3  km from the city center. The chetniks are also settling people  there. Looting on the entire occupied territory is drawing to  an end. According to the information of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in Gorazde, artillery weapons have not been  removed from the majority of the strongholds between Cajnice and  Foca. Of course, in some cases, they were only redeployed to  new positions, close to [words indistinct] This refers to  (?Nekopi), Zebina Suma, [word indistinct], Djakovici, and many  other locations.    This is Fahrudin Becic reporting for the Radio and  Television  of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

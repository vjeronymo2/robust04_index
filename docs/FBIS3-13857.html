Our political correspondent  Gadi Sukenik has learned that the two are 'Oded 'Eran, assistant  director general in charge of economics, and Rafi Baraq, the  head of the Foreign Ministry director general's bureau. They  will return home in less than 24 hours. The Foreign Ministry  refused to confirm or deny the report.</p>

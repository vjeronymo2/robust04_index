			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECHO PARK LIBRARY SITE TO BE DISCUSSED  </P> <P> A community meeting to discuss sites for the new Echo Park Library is scheduled  for 2 p.m. Saturday at the library, 515 N. Levita Terrace.  </P> <P> Members of the Friends of the Echo Park Library, the meeting's sponsor, want  the new facility to be at a fire station soon to be vacated by the Los Angeles  Fire Department, said spokeswoman Karen Jaeger.  </P> <P> However, library officials are not considering the station at 534 E. Edgeware  Road as a possible site. Jaeger said the meeting is being held in an attempt to  find alternate sites for the building.  </P> <P> The library has occupied a temporary site on Levita Terrace since 1971. About  $5.5 million was allocated for a new branch last spring after voters approved a  citywide library bond issue.  </P> <P> Jaeger said city officials have been invited to the meeting. The library serves  more than 5,000 people, she said.  </P></p>

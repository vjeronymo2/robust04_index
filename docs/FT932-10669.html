			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Managers buy Benjamin Priest BENJAMIN PRIEST, the engineering components group, has been bought by its management from International Marine Holdings, the US group which won control in December 1990 after paying Pounds 59.3m to settle a contested takeover. Mr John Ainsworth, the managing director and leader of the management buy-out team, refused to disclose the purchase price but said the buy-out was on a similar scale to that of the Leyland Daf van plant last month. This transaction, which included Pounds 8m of public sector finance, drew in funding of about Pounds 45m. The Priest deal excludes Lewmar, the marine equipment company which was the original target for International Marine. The US group made clear in 1990 that it would dispose of the engineering companies and a decision to that effect was made nine months ago. KPMG Corporate Finance put together the finance for the buy-out. This is split roughly equally between equity, with the main shareholders being 3i and NatWest Ventures, and borrowing from Lloyds Corporate Banking. There are 12 engineering companies in the Priest group. Although investment during the recession has been maintained above depreciation levels, their operations have been slimmed down. The companies employ 1,085 people. In the 1992 year the companies subject to the buy-out produced combined turnover of Pounds 60m and made profits of Pounds 3m before tax, interest charges and fees to International Marine.</p>

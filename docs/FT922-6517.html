			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Embarrassing problem for Lloyds WHILE THE takeover battle for Midland rages between Lloyds Bank and Hongkong Bank in the UK, in Canada Lloyds is paying Hongkong Bank to solve its bad debt problems in an embarrassing aftermath to its venture into the Canadian banking market. When Hongkong Bank bought Lloyds Bank Canada, a loss-making operation, in May 1990 for CDollars 190m (Pounds 89.6m), it structured the deal so that it would be sheltered from bad debts in LBC's portfolio. Lloyds agreed to set up a CDollars 300m pool of revolving funding into which its bad debts would be placed. Once there they are managed by Hongkong Bank on a straightforward commercial basis. The bad debts, mostly to the medium-sized corporate market, were accumulated in the second half of the 1980s when Lloyds Bank still hoped to expand its banking business in north America. Management fees and interest charges cost Lloyds around CDollars 25m each year for the services of the Hongkong Bank's team of problem debt managers. Two staff of Lloyds Bank are seconded full-time to the debt management operation in Toronto to see that fair play is maintained. The terms of the deal were also structured to ensure that Hongkong Bank does not allow bad debts to remain in the funding pool longer than absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, two years after the sale of the Canadian bank around CDollars 223m of bad debts are still in the pool and there is no sign that the slate will be wiped clean before August 1995 when the pool is due to be liquidated. Under the terms of the agreement, Lloyds Bank will then have to pay up to CDollars 100m of any further losses. Since its purchase of the former Lloyds Bank Canada network, Hongkong Bank claims to have pushed operation back into the black by cutting operating costs and sharply reducing the number of management staff. On Thursday, Hongkong Bank of Canada announced improved first quarter profits of Dollars C14.2m, up from Dollars C11.3m in the same period last year.</p>

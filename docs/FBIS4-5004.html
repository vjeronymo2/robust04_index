			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ryoichi Hatta, Industrial News Department, </F> second in the series: "Field Report on Market Opening"; this  one entitled: "Flat-Glass: Wholesaling and Engineering Form Two  Major Barriers"]    [Text] "I represent the controversial Guardian Industries."    "What do you really want?"  <H5>  Reaction to Political Pressure </H5>   President Iwao Matsumoto of Matsumoto Avante (head office in  Toshima Ward, Tokyo), a major primary wholesaler of flat glass,  could not help raising his voice when talking to the Japanese  representative of the U.S. glassmaker, Guardian Industries.  According to Matsumoto, the Guardian representative, in an  effort to enter into new deals with Matsumoto Avante, started  with a long lecture on the closed nature of the Japanese market.  Arguments and counterarguments were exchanged with Matsumoto,  and in the end, "we did not even talk business."    Matsumoto Avante does not reject transactions with foreign  manufacturers. Two years ago it started importing products from  major U.S. company PPG through PPG-CI (head office in Minato  Ward, Tokyo), a glass marketing joint venture between PPG and  Itochu Corporation.    However, Matsumoto is very critical of the Guardian method  of  taking advantage of political pressure. Guardian Industries,  whose vice president Ralph Gerson clamored for "the opening of  the closed Japanese market," is quite notorious among glass  dealers. However, surprisingly few wholesalers have actually  had any contact with Guardian until recently.    The president of a leading dealer said: "We have known about  that company for years, but it was only last January that a  salesman actually came."    The share of foreign makers in the Japanese flat-glass  market  is 4 percent. The U.S. Government has consistently charged that  Asahi Glass Company, Ltd., Nippon Flat Glass Company Ltd., and  Central Glass Company Ltd. have organized the nearly 400 glass  wholesalers throughout Japan into their respective "keiretsu,"  and that this forms the greatest barrier to foreign  participation.    However, Yu Maeyoshi, president of PPG-CI, who operates in  the marketing front line, claims: "There are practically no  physical barriers. Psychological barriers may exist, the result  of many years of business ties."    The delivery systems of foreign companies are also  inadequate.    A glass dealer said: "Japanese makers take no more than two  days to deliver, but foreign products take as long as 40 days."  In Japan, where small lot deliveries are the norm, the smallest  lot dealers are able to order is one ton; but some foreign  companies still insist on a minimum delivery of two tons.    As a matter of fact, it is true that tangible and intangible  "pressure" restraining the business transactions of glass  wholesalers did exist, as Asahi Glass managing director Yasuhiko  Furukawa admits.    He said: "About four years ago, a situation like the one the  United States complains of did exist."  <H5>  Limits of the Cozy, Symbiotic Relationship </H5>   We obtained a copy of a document distributed to members of  the National Federation of Flat-Glass Engineering Companies in  March 1987.    The federation is a group of glass engineering contractors  that buy glass from wholesalers and to use in subcontract work  for general contractors. The title of the document is: "How To  Deal With Requests From Clients To Use Imported Materials."  This is a "manual" on "excluding foreign products" which cites  11 reasons for refusing to use foreign glass products -- such  as: 1) there is little variety in imported products, and it is  difficult to complete an entire engineering project using  imported products only; and 2) using imported materials  simultaneously with Japanese products may undermine the  relationship with Japanese makers.    Five years later, the federation distributed another notice  negating the contents of the "manual." Meanwhile, Asahi Glass  and other domestic makers have brought their manuals into line  with the Antimonopoly Law.    Decision To Use Foreign Glass Not Implemented in the  Field    The truth is, the Japanese system was not the object of U.S.  criticism alone; Japanese makers themselves were also beginning  to feel the limits of the traditional marketing method of  relying on longstanding symbiotic relationships and presiding  over a network of exclusive distributors. In the past, the  accepted procedure had been to decide prices not when orders  were placed, but after the general contractors had used the  products in the maker-wholesaler-engineering firm-general  contractor sequence of material flow. According to Asahi Glass,  there were cases where a request for substantial discount would  be made after the merchandise was delivered, resulting in "many  instances of deficits." They decided last year, therefore, to  fix prices at the time the merchandise is delivered to the  customer. This is, of course, the norm in Western countries.    The makers have also lost the ability to spare manpower or  money for the sake of maintaining a stable relationship with the  wholesalers. The glass divisions of the big three Japanese  makers are all suffering from a deficit. Rumors -- such as,  "Company X is able to take care of only four of its 30 exclusive  distributors in Tokyo" -- are rife among glass dealers.    Dealers who are outside the "keiretsu" organization are now  seeking to build a relationship with foreign companies. The  Ministry of International Trade and Industry recently published  the results of its survey of more than 380 wholesalers.  Compared to a similar survey conducted a year before, 11  percent of dealers are now handling foreign glass products,  which is twice the percentage in the previous poll.    Mitsubishi Corporation, which started doing business in  foreign glass products last year in cooperation with major glass  engineering and processing firm Yamada Shoten (head office in  Minato Ward, Tokyo; president, Ryuichi Yamada), often receives  telephone inquiries from wholesalers feeling insecure [about the  existing marketing system] saying: "We would also like to deal  in foreign glass products."    However, it would be premature to predict a rapid increase  in  foreign participation in proportion to ongoing changes. Even if  the "keiretsu" formed by glass makers and wholesalers  disintegrate, the solid relationship between general contractors  and engineering firms remains intact.    In one case, Mitsubishi succeeded in obtaining the client's  agreement to buy imported flat glass. However, the decision was  overturned at the last minute. Apparently, the head of the  general contractor's local office had to heed a request from the  subcontracting engineering firm, with which he had a  longstanding, friendly relationship. While the head offices of  all the general contractors are saying, "we would very much like  to use foreign products," this does not seem to apply in the  field.    Even if all the barriers between the makers and wholesalers  are removed, other barriers to foreign participation still  exist. The debate between Guardian and Iwao Matsumoto may  continue for some time.</p>

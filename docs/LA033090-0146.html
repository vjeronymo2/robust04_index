			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> ADDITION SUBTRACTED FOR LACK OF PERMITS  </P> <P> Resident Harold Caswell has been ordered by the City Council to demolish the  nearly completed second-story addition to his home because he didn't get the  necessary permits and approvals before he began construction.  </P> <P> After a complaint was filed by a disgruntled neighbor, who said the addition  intruded on his privacy, building officials inspected the property. They found  that the patio, on top of which the addition was built, is only five feet from  the rear property line, not 10 as required by the city's zoning ordinance.  </P> <P> "It's a monstrosity that sits there almost in my kitchen window," said Richard  Verdugo, who lives in back of Caswell.  </P> <P> Building official Tony Elmo said that a preliminary, external inspection of the  premises revealed several other code violations, including faulty electrical  wiring locations and potential structural concerns.  </P> <P> Officials also discovered that Caswell had failed to get permits on at least  two other construction projects, including the patio on which the addition was  built.  </P> <P> Caswell admitted that the work had been completed without permits. However, he  consented to have the building officials tear down walls and ceiling materials  in order for complete inspections to take place. Building officials held off on  those inspections, pending the council decision.  </P> <P> "They are all up to code," insisted Caswell, who has lived at his home on  Cardiff Drive for 22 years. He said he spent about $10,000 on the addition.  </P> <P> Instead of granting a variance, which would have permitted the inspections, the  City Council decided that Caswell could not complete the project.  </P> <P> "With the applicant standing before us saying that he knowingly operated  without permits, I can't see how we could possibly allow him to continue," said  Councilwoman Margaret Arnold.  </P> <P> Elmo said that Caswell will have at least 60 days to tear down the second-story  room. He may come before the council and ask for permission to keep the patio  at a latter date, he added. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

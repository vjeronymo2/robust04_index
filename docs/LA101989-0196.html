			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG NAMES  </P> <P> I love it! Finally an honest name for a drug -- Croak ("Potent Form of Speed  Could Be Drug of '90s," Oct. 8). I lost a lot of friends many years ago through  drug use. I used to wonder why people give drugs cutesy names, like Blue Cheer  and Orange Sunshine for LSD. And what's so cheerful about being in the psych  ward at Metropolitan State Mental Hospital? Sunshine is something you don't see  much of behind bars.  </P> <P> Let's dump these cute names.  </P> <P> FRED J. HERMON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

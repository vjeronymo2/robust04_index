			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The black hole of Calcutt IT APPEARS that the most draconian proposal in Sir David Calcutt's review of press self-regulation, a statutory press tribunal, has already been dismissed by the government. This, at least, may be unreservedly welcomed. The idea that the correct response to the shortcomings of Britain's press is to establish a government-appointed inquisitor, with the power to fine newspapers and prevent publication of articles which violate its standards, is one of the most ill-judged to have reached the public policy agenda for many years. It would have led to a form of official censorship unknown in peacetime Britain since the 17th century. So what of the rest of Calcutt Two? It has three main components: a review of the Press Complaints Commission, a self-regulatory body set up after the first Calcutt committee report in 1990; and a reconsideration of two specific matters raised in Calcutt One, namely the laws on privacy and telephone interceptions. The bulk of the report concerns the PCC, about which Sir David has two grievances: that it was not established entirely along the lines recommended in his first report and that it has failed to command public confidence. On the first point, Sir David is right, but he then hurries without presenting serious evidence to the second and his draconian conclusion. This precipitate reasoning undermines one his best points: that the commission would have a better chance of establishing its credentials if it had more non-press members. It follows that a more balanced commission would also have more authority to consider revisions to the press code of conduct, a number of which Sir David canvasses. These are points the commission should entertain when it responds to the report. When it comes to privacy, Sir David argues that 'it cannot be said that there has been a serious breakdown of the system which has been put in place'. He then proposes a criminal law on the subject, adding that a remedy in civil law might be an acceptable second best. This is a complex matter of deep concern, since the freedom of ordinary people to live quietly is to be valued not much less than the freedom to publish. But Sir David's proposal to create a criminal offence of entering private property without consent with a view to obtaining information for publication is fraught with difficulty. How, in practice, would courts interpret the proposed journalist's defence of pursuing 'seriously anti-social conduct' or 'matters directly affecting the discharge of any public function of the individual concerned?' Where does the behaviour of Mr David Mellor fit into these definitions, or indeed that of some members of the royal family? Similar difficulties attend the idea of a tort of privacy, along with a further one: only the rich would be able to use it, given the state of the legal aid system. The most fundamental objection to Sir David's approach, however, is that he in effect proposes laws only to stop journalists snooping. What about the credit rating agencies, debt collectors, local government people and immigration officers? The only sound basis for press law is to require that journalists obey the law of the land - without privilege and without discrimination. Recent events suggest that the laws on trespass and telephone bugging contain serious gaps. The government would do well to focus on plugging them.</p>

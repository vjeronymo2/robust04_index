			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The upper house budget  committee on Thursday approved a long-delayed state budget for  fiscal 1994, which started on April 1, which will go for passage  at the house's plenary session later in the day. The approval  of the 73.1 trillion yen state budget at the House of  Councillors committee followed passage at the House of  Representatives on June 8, 70 days overdue and three months  after its was tabled in the Diet.    Diet debate on the budget, which was submitted to parliament  on March 4, became snarled in a political squabble over former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's personal financial affairs.  Hosokawa stepped down in April because of the turmoil.    The nation's full spending budget includes 5.5 trillion yen  for cuts in income and residential taxes to stimulate the  economy.    Despite tight fiscal conditions, expenditures for public  works projects were increased by 29.8 percent from the previous  year to 11.1 trillion yen. Public works spending accounts for  15.2 percent of the 40.9 trillion yen general operating  expenditures, the core part of the budget that includes most  outlays other than debt-servicing costs and tax allocations to  local governments. Defense spending, in contrast, was raised by  a scant 0.9 percent to 4.7 trillion yen.</p>

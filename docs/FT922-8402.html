			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Vauxhall to resist EC VAUXHALL, with second-biggest sales of new cars in the UK, has told dealers it sees no reason to adjust prices in the wake of last week's critical report from the European Commission. The study of car prices found large differentials between countries for some models at certain times between January 1988 and January last year. According to the EC report five carmakers - Ford, Honda, Citroen, Mazda and Audi - had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per cent in one of the five time periods selected. Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, said it had 'serious reservations' about the validity of some of the EC analysis. Mr David Wallis, Vauxhall director of business planning, said it was 'hard to accept the EC report, or to reconcile its detailed findings with the alleged 'high-price' character of the UK car market'.</p>

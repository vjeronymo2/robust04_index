			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Correspondent Aleksandr Shashkov] Today the  Russian president and the chairman of the Federation Council  discussed the work of Parliament's upper chamber, on whose  deputies the country's future budget depends so much.    Vladimir Shumeyko made public his views on the budget, which  has already been adopted by the State Duma, at a meeting with  the correspondent.    [Shumeyko] In my view the budget is like porridge plastered  on a plate.    [Shashkov] Instead of being aimed at, say, the  reconstruction  of the economy or support for the military industrial complex,  the budget, in the opinion of the Federation Council chairman,  is just a record of the government's expenditure.    [Shumeyko] The Federation Council naturally will not agree  to  such a budget; at least I personally do not agree to it.    [Shashkov] From Vladimir Shumeyko's viewpoint, the  difference  in approach to the budget between the two chambers of parliament  comes down to the fact that the upper chamber represents the  state, while the lower chamber does not.    [Shumeyko] I have the impression that the Duma, thanks to  the  fact that it has a political set up and not a state one, by  adopting this budget shows -- or so I think -- the worse the  better, we'll change the authorities more quickly. But this is  not a matter of replacing the authorities, it is a matter of  strengthening the state.    [Shashkov] A few minutes earlier, Shumeyko shared his  impressions on his visit to the strategic missile troops. Here,  this was not a matter of strengthening the state. It seems that  strategic missiles...    [Shumeyko, interrupting] ...Give us confidence that, while  we  have them and are occupied here with political wars and other  business to ensure the collapse of the state, but not construct  it, we can at least be sure that no one is going to touch us for  the time being.

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: PRETTY SOON, THIS COLUMN MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO YOU BY . . .  </P> <P> Two relatively new phenomena, which seem to be related, are starting to get on  my nerves.  </P> <P> You saw one during the National Football League playoffs: "This kickoff is  brought to you by Budweiser."  </P> <P> I imagine a Clydesdale could kick a football a long way, given the proper  training, but I never saw one on the screen. It always seemed that the kickoff  was being brought about by a kicker.  </P> <P> This, of course, is the phenomenon that seems to indicate that eventually every  aspect of every game will be bought and sponsored.  </P> <P> You have probably guessed by now that unwieldly names are my other gripe,  particularly those with blatant commercial overtones.  </P> <P> Upcoming in February, for example, is the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, which  was recently trimmed a bit from the Shearson Lehman Hutton Andy Williams Open.  I'm not sure why Andy Williams became disassociated with the tournament, unless  maybe he was tired of being asked for tips on the stock market.  </P> <P> Just last week, a release arrived trumpeting a new name for San Diego's LPGA  tournament. It did not cut back. It expanded from Kyocera Inamori Classic to  Red Robin Kyocera Inamori Classic, a change that plays into the fact that I  think such titles are all for the birds.  </P> <P> Neither the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open nor the Red Robin Kyocera Inamori  Classic suggests in title where in the world these tournaments are being held,  which could be Tallahassee or Corpus Christi as far as the fan in Peoria knows.  </P> <P> Thank heaven that Mutual of New York is willing to settle for MONY in front of  Tournament of Champions.  </P> <P> The Holiday Bowl has been the Sea World Holiday Bowl, but the latest word is  that Sea World is willing to bow out to a buyout from a sponsor willing and  able to kick in bigger bucks. This, of course, could lead to the game being  called the Holiday Inn Holiday Bowl . . . or maybe the Holiday on Ice Judy  Holliday Holiday Bowl.  </P> <P> San Diego State offers corporate sponsorships of both specific programs and  individual games within those programs.  </P> <P> In basketball, for example, I suppose it costs more to sponsor a game with the  Robert Redford Sundance Brigham Young University Cougars or American Tobacco  Company University of North Carolina Tars and Nicotines than it would to  sponsor a game with the Log Cabin Maple Syrup University of Vermont Catamounts.  </P> <P> Obviously, the world is changing.  </P> <P> This plague has even reached the high school level, where an athletic director  called to plead that a corporate sponsor should be included in the name of one  of the traditional basketball tournaments hereabouts. And teams are no longer  the champions of the CIF San Diego Section Playoffs, but rather the Reebok CIF  San Diego Section Playoffs.  </P> <P> Where to from here?  </P> <P> I can imagine the headlines, news stories and broadcasts of the future.  </P> <P> Let's super-impose the present on the future . . .  </P> <P>  News Story  </P> <P>  CARLSBAD, brought to you by Car Country -- A Miller Genuine Draft Haircut  Store Miller Barber Chip won the Mutual of New York Tournament of Champions on  a Sunday afternoon sponsored by Sunkist at the Mitsubishi Sanyo La Costa Resort  and Country Club.  </P> <P>  Headline  </P> <P>  Great American Sponsorship  </P> <P> Brings Walsh to Chargers  </P> <P>  Broadcast  </P> <P>  Jerry Coleman: "The Padres are getting into a bit of trouble here, but Mark  Davis is throwing up in the Rolaids bullpen."  </P> <P> Rick Monday: "Yes, and this malaprop was brought to you by Berlitz School of  Language."  </P> <P>  Headline  </P> <P>  SDG&amp;E Buys Rights  </P> <P> to Jack Clark's At-Bats;  </P> <P> Link With Power Said Key  </P> <P>  Telecast  </P> <P>  "Schroeder is back to pass . . . he's being chased . . . look out for Lee  Williams . . . Schroeder tries to scramble . . . he can't get away . . .  Williams drags him down for a loss of 13 yards . . . Wow!!! What a play!! As  you can see on your screen, this sack was brought to you by Vons."  </P> <P>  News Story  </P> <P>  Trader Jack McKeon and the Padres obtained Dale Murphy from Atlanta and Mike  Pagliarulo from the New York Yankees in a 3-way, 7-player deal, sponsored by  Kobey's Swap Meet and the Pennysaver.  </P> <P>  Broadcast  </P> <P>  "The Aztecs are setting up for the extra point try, which will be sponsored by  . . . wait a minute. This sponsorship is still available. For details, call . .  . "  </P> <P> Some of these things may seem ridiculous, but think about it. Look what we  already have.  </P></p>

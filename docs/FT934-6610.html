			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Management: Agents move into the driving seat - Legislation coming into effect on January 1 will strengthen their position Many British companies are waking up to realise that they have precious little time left to reorganise advantageously their agency arrangements in European Union countries. New legislation comes into effect on January 1 that will generally strengthen the position of agents as opposed to principals (companies). One of the provisions in the new directive stipulates that proper notice should be given to terminate contracts. At the moment many British concerns have very loose arrangements with their agents. Mike Reynell is marketing director of Flomerics, a software company specialising in computational fluid dynamics, used for cooling in electronics products. He says: 'It was only when we read reports in the newspapers that we realised we could face difficulties with our agents in Europe. At the moment, the agreements are very informal, based only on a letter. We could have difficulties.' The UK and Ireland will join the rest of the EU in applying far more detailed rules governing companies and their agents. The new rules borrow heavily from legislation in Germany, where agents have been able to use their contracts as security for loans and compensation is available if an agreement is terminated. The new rules mean that either party must give written notice of not less than one month for the first year, two months after two years and three months for the third and subsequent years if a contract is terminated. Other rules stipulate that principals will no longer be able to delay paying their agents simply because they have not been paid. Provided the agent has not breached the terms of his contract, companies become liable to pay compensation to their agent to cover losses and costs resulting from the termination of the contract. Compensation must take into account the commission the agent might have earned and costs and expenses he has not been able to recover. Rebecca Attree, an inter-national solicitor working in the international department of the London office of Laytons, says: 'The new regulations mean substantial changes to companies' agency arrangements. We are advising our clients to review all current agency arrangements, and establish whether they are actually agency agreements. If they are, the companies should consider the costs and benefits of terminating any existing agreements.' One company concerned about the new arrangements is Hampshire-based Apollo Fire Detectors. Neil Quinn, managing director, says: 'We realised there could have been losses involved in termination of contracts when the new rules came in.' The company's answer to the problem was to set up distributorships in most EU markets, which are outside the regulations. In Germany, Apollo set up a subsidiary company. Flomerics, however, is not keen on the idea of distributors. The company, which was set up in 1989, now has a turnover of Pounds 2m, most of which is exported. The largest market is the US, but Europe is growing rapidly. Reynell says: 'Distributors do not really suit us; we are not selling a commodity which can be stored and sold on. We like to know who the end customer is, and we tend to have a few large customers. There are a lot of intellectual property rights wrapped up in our products and we like to keep the customers in view.' While favouring agents, the company does admit to a satisfactory arrangement in one EU country. Reynell says: 'We will have to change our arrangements - certainly in one EU country and possibly more. I am seeing our lawyers about it imminently.'</p>

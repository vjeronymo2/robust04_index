			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (12): Salmon, not sewage - Case study / The cleansing of Teesside Not so many years ago, talk of the lower reaches of the River Tees welcoming migratory salmon would have seemed laughable. Teesside's rapid industrial and urban expansion throughout the 19th century and much of the 20th had foully polluted the river as it neared the North Sea. Industrial and sewage discharges combined to create a quality of water which bred little except protest demonstrations by environmental activists. Some of the environmental campaigners' wrath was directed at the National Rivers Authority, the UK's river watchdog, for not imposing immediate draconian cuts in ICI's effluent discharges from its Teesside plants, the group's largest concentration of manufacturing assets in the world. The NRA countered by arguing that it must give industry achievable targets, imposing phased reductions on the levels of permitted discharges in order to work progressively towards its goal of the passage of migratory fish along the Tees. In line with this philosophy, the Tees has been the focus of one of the UK's biggest estuary clean-ups. ICI alone has spent Pounds 100m since 1990 on environmental improvements on Teesside, mostly river related. While its corporate aim, announced in 1990, for its sites worldwide is to cut waste by 50 per cent by 1995, its Teesside operations are working to a higher target of 68 per cent. Total waste produced from its manufacturing activities on Teesside has fallen so far by 57 per cent, from 521,000 tonnes in 1991 to 226,000 tonnes in 1993. The major contributor to this reduction has been the end of the disposal of acidic ammonium sulphate at sea by ICI's Acrylics business, following the opening of the Pounds 66m sulphuric acid recovery plant at Billingham, part of the Pounds 110m Monomer 8 complex. Now, ICI and Northumbrian Water are working together on a Pounds 100m effluent treatment works project which should further the NRA's aim of restoring a thriving salmon fishery to the Tees. Last month, Northumbrian Water submitted to Cleveland County Council a planning application for the proposed treatment works, to be sited on a disused ICI waste disposal site on the south bank of the Tees. The purpose of the plant is to deal with sewage from 400,000 Teesside residents and discharges from ICI's Wilton petrochemicals complex. The eventual Pounds 100m cost of the two-phase project will be borne by Northumbrian Water, with ICI paying fees for each tonne of waste treated. Northumbrian Water has also held discussions with seven chemical companies at Seal Sands, on the north bank of the river, about the possibility of their using the plant too. The Pounds 50m first stage of the project includes construction of a Pounds 35m underground transfer sewer along the Tees' south bank, so sewage is taken from existing treatment plants for discharge downstream nearer the river mouth. In its first phase, the treatment works will deal with ICI's pure terephthalic acid (pta) discharges from Wilton. The second phase will involve treatment of more ICI effluents, and also a higher standard of treatment of the sewage before discharge to the river, to meet the European Urban Waste Water Directive, at present due to come into effect in 2001. Currently ICI's Wilton site has a biochemical oxygen demand - a measure of river oxygen depletion due to pollution - of 80 tonnes a day, but the NRA has said this must be reduced to 50 tonnes by 1996. ICI expects the treatment of pta discharge at the new plant to bring a net reduction of 19 tonnes. Treatment of more discharges by the plant's second phase should help ICI meet its own target of a Wilton BOD of 25 tonnes a day by the year 2,000. In the early 1970s, Wilton's BOD was 400 tonnes. 'We've got it down to a fifth of what it was 20 years ago,' says ICI. 'Dealing with the remaining fifth is more difficult and more expensive.' ICI and Northumbrian Water, both involved in improvement work on the Tees since the 1970s, believe it makes sense to pool their expertise and resources in this way, in anticipation of future tighter standards. They hope the effluent treatment works, which requires consent from the boards of Northumbrian Water and ICI Chemicals and Polymers, will be approved by Cleveland county council before the end of 1994, so its first phase can be commissioned in mid-1996. Northumbrian Water's general manager of projects Mr Doug Shearer says the plant does not involve incineration or the import of waste, both of which are highly contentious issues on Teesside. The council, mindful of the delicacy of environmental issues in its heavily industrialised area, has pledged full consultation. 'Obviously we haven't been happy about discharges into the river and sea,' says Mr David Walsh, chairman of the council's environment, development and transportation committee. 'We want to study the implications of this approach.'</p>

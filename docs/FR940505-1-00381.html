			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Determination of efficiency of emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The efficiency of the collection device of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission control system as specified in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section shall be determined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA method described at &sect;52.741(a)(4)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The efficiency of the control device, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined by the EPA method described at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;52.741(a)(4)(iv). The VOC content measured and calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as carbon in the control device exhaust gases shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by EPA Method 25 or 25A (40 CFR part 60,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Transfer Efficiency. The transfer efficiency for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other coating application methods as defined in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)(3)(iii)(G) of this section, shall be determined in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test method for determining transfer efficiency entitled ``Spray  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Equipment Transfer Efficiency Test Procedure for Equipment User,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 24, 1989.'' This transfer efficiency method is approved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the limited purpose of comparing alternative application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies under controlled conditions. The results of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests are not transferable to a production setting. The test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method is not acceptable for determining transfer efficiency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish VOC emission reduction credits to allow the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher VOC coatings, or to establish VOC credits for trading or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commercial bakeries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Applicability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section, this section is applicable to bakery ovens which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bake yeast-leavened products. For the purposes of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the affected area is the Sacramento Metro Area for ozone as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described at 40 CFR 81.305.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of paragraph (f) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section, the following definitions shall apply. All terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in &sect;52.2950.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bakery oven  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a convection oven which bakes yeast-leavened products, including but not limited to breads, buns, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rolls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fermentation time  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the elapsed time between adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yeast to dough or sponge and placing the dough or sponge into an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oven, expressed in hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Yeast percentage  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the pounds of yeast added to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundred pounds of total flour in the recipe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) On and after January 1, 1997, no person shall operate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a bakery oven subject to this section, unless VOC emissions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled using an air pollution control system which:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Has been installed in accordance with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authority to Construct issued by the applicable local air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution control district or air quality management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> district; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Includes an emission collection system(s) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ducts the exhaust gases from all stacks and/or vents on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ovens to a VOC emission control device(s). Such ducting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be maintained so as to be free of visible holes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breaks, openings or separations between adjoining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components from which fugitive VOCs would be emitted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmosphere; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Has one or more VOC emission control devices,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each with a destruction or removal efficiency of at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 95 percent by weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For an oven which commences construction on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1995, owners and operators shall be in compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section by the date of commencement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of oven operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The provisions of this section shall not apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bakery ovens which are located at a facility where the combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rated heat input capacity of all ovens is less than 2 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> British Thermal Units (BTUs) per hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The provisions of this section shall not apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ovens used exclusively for the baking of products leavened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemically without yeast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The provisions of paragraph (f)(3) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall not apply to bakery ovens which are located at a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the uncontrolled actual emissions of VOCs from all ovens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined is less than 6.5 tons per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Reporting and Recordkeeping. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A person operating a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bakery oven subject to this section shall maintain records in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kota Kinabalu correspondent Mohamed Nor Samad] </F>   [Text] Sabah politics are getting more and more  interesting to watch. One event takes place after another just  a chess game. The problem is who ends the game.    The climax of Sabah politics is seen in the verdict passed  on  Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan's corruption case. The court found  him guilty of corruption but he was still allowed to run in the  state elections and he did not have to quit his post of chief  minister. The reason is that he was fined 1,800 ringgit and this  saved him from Article 17 (1)(e) of the Sabah state Constitution  and Article 48 (e) of the federal Constitution, which would have  fined him 2,000 ringgit or put him in jail for one year. This  would have disqualified him from running in the elections.    What is interesting is that not only the Sabah people, but  also PBS [Sabah United Party] leaders and members are  speculating that Pairin will quit the party chairman post at the  end of his trial. Therefore, rumors have it that several PBS  senior leaders, including Datuk Ariyah Tengku Ahmad, Datuk  Bernard Dompok, and Datuk Joseph Kurup have been mentioned as  potential successors of Pairin as PBS leader.    On the day of Pairin's court verdict, a banner saying:  "Moyog State Constituency Wants Datuk Bernard as New Sabah  Chief Minister" was unfurled on Karamunsing Road. With the  sighting of the banner, people had reason to believe that a  power struggle within PBS has begun, but this was quickly denied  by PBS leaders. Bernard Dompok was assemblyman for the said  constituency.    Datuk Clarence Bongkos Malakun, PBS deputy leader, who  recently became more outspoken in releasing his frustations,  disclosed that the party, established in 1985, is being split  into two factions. As he spoke in his capacity as deputy leader,  his remarks definitely should not be taken for granted. Bongkos  said one faction was trying to befriend the federal government  or the ruling National Front, while the other faction is opposed  to it.    What is interesting is Bongkos' assertion that Pairin was  actually not the person who masterminded the PBS's decision to  leave the National Front in 1990, resulting in the strained  relations between PBS and the National Front. Even though  Bongkos' remarks may have ulterior motives, what is important is  that PBS seems to have an internal rift.    However, both the National Front and UMNO [United Malays  National Organization] should not be overconfident about the PBS  alleged split because it can serve as a trap to make them lower  their guard. If they are negligent and enjoy discussing the PBS  internal rift, they may have to wait another five years to  recapture Sabah.    If we look at the issue carefully, we can see that the main  cause of the rift is that the majority of PBS leaders want to  join the National Front. These leaders have realized that  without joining the National Front, the PBS will get nowhere.  The proof is easily visible. Ruled by the PBS in the past nine  years, Sabah is the poorest state with the highest unemployment  rate in Malaysia. Other states in peninsular Malaysia as well  as Sarawak have made rapid progress in development.    The decision to leave the National Front may be beneficial  in the short-term, but the PBS and Sabah people have now begun  to realize that this is not true for the long-term. This shows  that the decision to leave the National Front just a few days  before the general elections in 1990, described by the National  Front as a stab in the back, is a very risky political gamble.  But now, on the eve of state elections on 18-19 February,  rumors are rife that PBS wants to rejoin the National Front and  set up a coalition government after the elections.    Being aware of the danger of such rumors, UMNO leaders  quickly dismissed them. UMNO leaders, including Tan Sri Mohamed  Taib and Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as well as Tan Sri Abdul Rahim  expressed doubts as to how the PBS can possibly join the  National Front when the party has not yet submitted a formal  application for such a purpose. Muhyiddin described the rumors  as a dirty tactic launched by the PBS to gain sympathy votes.  At the same time, Sabah UMNO expressed confidence that it will  be able to set up its own state government without having to set  up a coalition government with the PBS.    Political observers noted that when the PBS is cornered, the  party will do anything possible to maintain power in the state.    The Chinese community in Sabah is also believed to have  realized that under the PBS, they have been put into a  disadvantageous position. They said they will follow the winds  of change and vote for the National Front, whose leadership  style is already proven. There are also talks that Chinese  leaders in the PBS are being discriminated against. The fruits  of development carried out by the PBS have benefitted one ethnic  group only. An undeniable fact is that Sabah has now lagged  behind other states in development.    To cope with the increasingly exciting Sabah political  situation, Sabah UMNO must be united and act in a coordinated  way. To play political chess against the PBS, one must be  skillful and capable of anticipating its next move.    There are times when the PBS looks as if it is losing, but  at  the critical moment it shows its real strategy and strength and  eventually wins the battle. This has happened three times in  elections since the PBS has ruled Sabah, namely on 21 April  1985, 6-7 May 1986, and 16-17 July 1990. Therefore, the  National Front and Sabah UMNO must be doubly careful and must  not allow the PBS to exploit any election issue. The most  important mission is that they must hoist the National Front  flag on top of Kinabalu Mountain.    The National Front must seek ways to win the hearts of the  Sabah people and explain the government policies to them so they  will not fall victim to PBS propaganda.    Everyone knows that the Sabah people themselves will  determine what kind of government they want to elect, but those  who live in remote and isolated areas must at least get adequate  information to enable them to decide what is most beneficial for  them. This is the heavy task the National Front currently has  to face.    Amidst the uncertain and confused political scenario, the  National Front must pay attention to the following issues:    A. If the PBS is indeed accepted into the National Front on  the eve of state elections, will the Sabah UMNO accept the fact?  Political observers predict that prominent PBS leaders may not  run in the elections so that the PBS will be allowed to join the  National Front again.    B. Is the PBS going to exploit the issue of Tun Datuk  Mustapha Harun, the Sabah Father of Independence, in case he  decides to run in the elections, or is the PBS going to nominate  his sons against him if he decides to run?    C. Are the National Front and UMNO ready to cope with the  Sabah tradition of party members changing their political  loyalty?    D. If Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, currently under  restricted detention in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, is allowed to  run in the elections, are the National Front and UMNO ready for  it?</p>

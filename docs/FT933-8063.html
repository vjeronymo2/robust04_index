			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Leasing trade seeks car register A CHANGE in the law to weaken the right of finance companies to reclaim cars bought innocently when they are still subject to hire purchase or leasing agreements is being sought by the finance and leasing industry itself. Its trade organisation, the Finance and Leasing Association, has presented proposals for the government to set up a vehicle ownership register, which would be complementary to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at Swansea. The register would be based on the manufacturer's vehicle identification number, which the association insists is a much more reliable identifier than the registration number. Any finance company which did not register its interest in a vehicle would lose its ownership right to it in the event of a subsequent unauthorised sale to an unsuspecting third party. On the register would be details of ownership, mileage records, reports of theft and insurance write-offs. The proposals coincide with publication of an association survey of members in the motor finance sector indicating a total of 7,500 cases of theft and fraud related to such vehicles over the past year. Mr John Brown, association chairman, said it was likely that the reported figures 'are just the tip of the iceberg'. Under the association's scheme potential purchasers would be able to gain access to information on any car by phoning the register and on payment of a small fee. The association also wants the law changed to require manufacturers to register all new cars under the same system. The proposals received support from the Retail Motor Industry Federation, which represents the retail motor trade. It said that such changes to the law 'are long overdue and will do a great deal to reduce road vehicle-related fraud'.</p>

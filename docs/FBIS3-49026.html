			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In presenting the draft of a new  copyright law to the Sejm on 18 November, Polish Minister of  Culture Kazimierz Dejmek argued that the existing 1952 law is  outdated and that the new law takes into account current  technologies and economic realities. KRONIKA SEJMOWA of 24  November reported Dejmek's remarks to the effect that the draft  contained improvements over the previous version, which he said  had been revised to make Polish law more compatible with  European and world standards. This, Dejmak predicted, will make  participation in international copyright agreements possible and  "will enable Poland to fulfill obligations resulting from  previous accords, in particular those resulting from the trade  treaties with the U.S."    Dejmek said, according to the KRONIKA SEJMOWA report, that  the law was designed to provide equal protection to authors and  artists, as well as to the producers and distributors of  cultural products. He also noted that the law delegates  oversight responsibilities to professional organizations of  authors, artists, performers, and producers, while at the same  time exercising control over them by licensing requirements. To  mitigate the negative impact of the illicit copying of cultural  products, the law provides that losses due to such pirated  production will be compensated by fees on blank tapes and  videocassettes.    Zdzislaw Podkanski, a spokesman for one of the parties in  the  governing coalition, the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), said that  the copyright law would bring economic as well as cultural  benefits. According to Podkanski, the new law both "meets the  expectations of the artistic associations and satisfies the  requirements of international pacts and treaties." He also  endorsed the law's criminal penalties, which he said should  serve to deter "pirating" of copyrighted materials.    Jerzy Zdrada of the opposition Democratic Union described  the  existing Polish copyright law as "anachronistic" because it  "does not reflect the standard legal practice of the European  Union and the United States." The failure to change the old law  until now, he charged, has impeded domestic scientific,  technological, and cultural activities and hampered  international trade relations. He said that the new law, which  is based on West European models, should rectify this situation.    Speaking for the opposition Confederation for an Independent  Poland (KPN), Deputy Janusz Koza regretted that the copyright  law had not been passed earlier because "every day of delay  causes great losses for the state treasury, businesses, and  individuals." He complained that, currently, the illegal  production of tapes, videocassettes, and computer software is  encouraged by "the impunity of pirates." These pirates, he said,  penetrate not only the domestic market but also "markets of  neighboring countries." They pay "neither taxes nor duties" and,  selling their products at much lower prices, "they ruin  legitimate businesses."</p>

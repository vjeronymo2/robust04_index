			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTER PILOTS PUT GOODWILL INTO GAMES;  </P> <P> SOVIET ARRIVAL: U.S. AIR FORCE SCRAMBLES WHEN GUEST PLANES SHOW UP A DAY  EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.  </P> <P> Three Soviet planes have arrived in Seattle for the Goodwill Games, but not  before surprising the U.S. Air Force, which was expecting them a day later and  had to scramble jets to intercept them over Alaska.  </P> <P> An Ilyushin-62 passenger plane carrying Goodwill Games visitors and alternative  Soviet art, accompanied by two SU-27 military jet fighters, left the Soviet  Union Friday.  </P> <P> The planes had been delayed leaving Moscow for a day, then delayed again when  they stopped to refuel in the Soviet Far East.  </P> <P> "We were afraid that they would close the border for us, so we left today, the  day before we were scheduled to take off," said Nina Walsh, the Soviet-born  wife of Bob Walsh, president of the Seattle Organizing Committee for the  Olympic-style games and a passenger on the airliner.  </P> <P> The Ilyushin had been cleared to leave Wednesday, but its two escorts had  permission for Friday, Walsh said.  </P> <P> The pilots took a chance and all three planes left the Soviet Union, crossing  over at a remote strategic point where communications are poor, she said.  </P> <P> The problem was, when they crossed the international date line, they dropped  back to Thursday -- the day before they had been permitted entry to the United  States.  </P> <P> U.S. fighter planes intercepted them about 100 miles northwest of Nome, Alaska,  and escorted them to Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage.  </P> <P> "It was unbelievable," Walsh said of the four aircraft -- two Soviet, two  American -- flying next to the Ilyushin.  </P> <P> The planes flew close and changed positions around the passenger aircraft, she  said. "We took hundreds of pictures. The escort pilots weren't supposed to talk  to each other, but we could tell they were understanding each other."  </P> <P> "We had picked them up on long-range radar as unknown tracks. We knew what they  were when we went up to get them," Capt. Monica Aloisio, spokeswoman for the  Air Force, said of the Soviet planes. "But we were expecting them tomorrow."  </P> <P> The planes stayed at Elmendorf until late Thursday, unable to get State  Department permission to proceed to Seattle. Bob Walsh called Andy Card,  special assistant to President Bush, and Card called the Defense Department.  </P> <P> The Soviet and American pilots and their families mingled at an Air Force  luncheon while they waited.  </P> <P> Escorted by two U.S. F-15 fighter planes, the three planes finally arrived in  Seattle Thursday night.  </P></p>

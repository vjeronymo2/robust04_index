			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Saudi airline 'agrees to buy Dollars 6bn US aircraft': Fears that premature announcement may threaten deal US AIRCRAFT manufacturers are hoping a premature announcement that they have clinched the sale of commercial aircraft worth as much as Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) to the government of Saudi Arabia will not sour the deal, Lisa Bransten writes from Washington. Senator Patty Murray this week told the Seattle Times that President Bill Clinton convinced the Saudis to buy the aircraft for state-owned Saudia airlines from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The Saudi government has not confirmed any such deal, but its expected purchase is by far the biggest contract now on offer in the big civil aircraft market. Industry analysts speculate that Airbus Industrie, a European consortium, lost a contract earlier this year to supply a large number of aircraft to Saudia because a French official announced the sale before the Saudi government. Both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have refused comment on the deal. 'It's just good business sense to wait for the customer to make the announcement,' said Mr Paul Binder for Boeing. Mr Bob Saling, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman, said his company had no official notification from the Saudis that they would buy the aircraft. 'Any time there's speculation in the press about something that is not final, top management gets nervous,' he said. The purchase could be a boon for the troubled McDonnell, in particular. It runs a distant third to Boeing and Airbus in sales of commercial aircraft, with no big purchase for at least the past two years and 6,000 workers laid off this year.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / The generals' big business offensive: Simon Holberton and Tony Walker examine the increasingly powerful commercial role of China's armed services On the west coast of Hainan, the large Chinese island next to to Vietnam, a mini-Hong Kong is taking shape. In 30 sq km, two private companies are building container docks, warehouses, offices, flats and hotels for a HKDollars 18bn free port development. One of the companies, Kumagai Gumi, is an associate of the Japanese construction company of the same name and well known among international investors. The other, China Poly Group, is relatively unknown, but is on the way to becoming one of China's biggest conglomerates. Headquartered in Beijing, China Poly is led by a major-general of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and 'owned' by the PLA General Staff. It is perhaps the most aggressive investor, at home and abroad, among increasingly assertive business groups controlled by China's sprawling military-industrial complex. This thickening web of manufacturers, and investment and trading companies, falls into two categories: one headed by businesses such as Poly Group and under direct PLA control; the other involving defence industries turned to civilian production under the control of China's State Council, or cabinet. They are prime examples of what Mr John Frankenstein, senior lecturer at the University of Hong Kong's business school and an expert on China's military business, calls 'Chinese bureaucratic entrepreneurialism' - the involvement by government officials, including increasingly the military, in free-wheeling business ventures. This phenomenon has left members of China's military-industrial complex poised to play a greater role not only at home, but internationally. A role-model which China's military businesses may try to emulate is that of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic), one of the country's first experiments in western-style corporate capitalism. Citic's Hong Kong subsidiary, Citic Pacific, now vies with the likes of Jardine Matheson and the Swire group for the title of Hong Kong's leading business conglomerate. Citic Pacific's parent in Beijing owns international assets from aluminium smelting in Australia to steel and pulp paper operations in north America. Trading houses such as Poly Group and the Xinxing Group, which is owned by the PLA's General Logistics Department, may come in time to rival big Japanese trading companies. Indeed, China's new conglomerates already resemble Japanese trading houses in one important respect: after the second world war the Japanese companies numbered many former military officers among their staff and were run along military lines. The military's involvement in business is one of the most striking by-products of 15 years of economic reform. This transformation started in 1978, the year China began opening to the world. Since then sectors such as electronics and shipbuilding have forged ahead. According to Mr Wu Zhao, chairman of the Association for the Peaceful Use of Military Industrial Technology, formed in 1987 to spur defence conversion, some 76 per cent of production on average in defence factories is now for civilian use. The decision to beat swords into ploughshares among China's estimated 600-700 defence factories has made China's former arms industries dominant in some consumer products areas such as motor-cycles, washing machines and electric fans. The six main defence industries - nuclear, space, aviation, ordinance, electronics and shipbuilding - account for 20 per cent of China's machine industry output, by value. At the same time, general purpose trading, manufacturing and investment companies have mushroomed under the umbrella of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the apex organisation of the PLA and fount of political power and patronage. Experts in Hong Kong on the Chinese military have no doubt that the emergence of companies such as Poly Group and Xinxing Corporation is only the beginning. 'I think they will develop into small kingdoms, given their autonomy and independence from other PLA authorities,' says Mr K P Ng, a research director at the Hong Kong Chinese University. Military industries under the State Council have also made a surprisingly quick transformation from secretive offshoots of the old military-industrial complex to serious corporate players. Among the more successful are organisations such as China Electronics Industry Corporation (Chinatron), China Shipbuilding Trading company (CSTC), China North Industries Corporation (Norinco), China Great Wall Industry Corporation (GWIC), which is involved in building satellite launch vehicles, and China National Aero-Technology Import-Export Corporation (CATIC). Apart from Poly Group, the most active among companies under the direct control of the PLA are Huitong, a general purpose trading and investment company; Xinxing, and its sister corporation Sanjiu, or the 999 Group, which produce pharmaceuticals among many other activities; and Jingan, which is owned by the People's Armed Police and produces security equipment. Adding immeasurably to the weight of these corporations-in-the-making is the leading role in their management of the so-called 'princelings' - sons and daughters of China's political elite. Well-connected Chinese are deeply involved in some of the most prominent companies which include: China Poly Group, founded in 1984 to compete with Norinco in external arms sales, partly out of envy over the profits being made by Norinco. The company's name in Chinese, Baoli, means to 'keep the profits'. The president of China Poly is major-general He Ping, director of the Equipment Department of the PLA General Staff which is responsible for overseeing PLA businesses and liaison with the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (COSTIND) - the lynchpin body in China's efforts to modernise its military hardware by applying high technology. Perhaps more important, Major-Gen He is also the son-in-law of Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, and his wife, Deng Rong, is Deng's 'favourite' daughter and the author of last year's top-selling biography of the Chinese leader. Other top figures associated with China Poly include Mr Wang Jun, son of the late Wang Zhen, a former Long March veteran and Deng associate. In addition to his duties as chairman of China Poly, Mr Wang jr is also president of Citic. The range of China Poly's businesses is vast. In addition to the Hainan port development its activities include shipping, finance, property, electronics and telecommunications. It also control two companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange ' Poly Investments and Continental Mariner, a shipping company. Norinco has achieved the highest profile among new defence entities with some 157 factories under its control in a network that extends across China but whose stronghold is in the heavily-industrialised north-east. Norinco grew out of the Fifth Ministry of Machine-Building industry, a secretive organisation responsible for China's conventional weapons manufacture. Norinco is involved in a broad range of activities, including arms sales, trading, construction, real estate, finance and car manufacturing. A sign of its clout is that it is one of few Chinese organisations authorised to raise capital abroad. Last month it raised Dollars 185m for its China North Industry Investment trust, listed in Dublin and Singapore. Xinxing Corporation has spread its tentacles across China with a branch at virtually every leading logistics depot. Among Xinxing's main businesses is pharmaceuticals through Sanjiu which has plants in southern China. Xinxing has also established offices abroad, including one in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has become increasingly important as a venue for an evolving relationship between representatives of the PLA and defence industry businesses and powerful overseas Chinese entrepreneurs. This relationship is likely to prove mutually beneficial to the broader ambitions of companies such as China Poly and Xinxing, no less than it will to the designs on the mainland of Chinese billionaires such as Mr Li Ka-shing. The partnership is increasingly likely to take the form of joint ventures in areas such as property and possibly infrastructure development in China. When Xinxing opened its Hong Kong office with great fanfare in December 1992 on hand to greet Lt Gen Zhang Bin, deputy director of the General Logistics Department, were a clutch of Hong Kong tycoons, including Mr Li, and Mr T T Tsui, the Hong Kong and London bus operator with long-standing PLA connections. While China's military leaders have looked askance on the money-making of sections of the PLA, involvement in business now seems so deeply embedded that it would be impossible to imagine the military withdrawing from its lucrative sideline activities. There is also a practical reason for this involvement in business. China's nominal defence budget for this year stands at Yn52bn, but this vastly understates the cost of maintaining the Chinese military. Western military experts believe the actual cost is two or even three times this amount. Additional funding from business has thus become critical to maintaining a functioning military at a time when defence has been the poor relation among China's 'four modernisations'. However, the PLA high command has become concerned that it may lose control over these business empires and worried about the widespread perception that many of those engaged in business have profited personally. In 1992 the CMC set up an audit commission in an attempt to restrain some of the excesses. The CMC has also sought to prevent the continued proliferation of PLA enterprise by consolidating its management at group army level. China has some 24 group armies, each of which commands about 50,000 troops. Worries about the 'commercialisation' of the PLA have been expressed by no lesser figures than generals Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, vice chairmen of the CMC. The two Long March veterans warned last year that 'all sorts of unhealthy attitudes and negative phenomena' were endangering the development of a professional military. Their warnings have come too late, however, to prevent soldiers' business or bingshan becoming big business.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 CHINA'S MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General Staff     General Logistics     General Political    People's  department           department            department     Armed police China Poly Group   Xinxing Corporation   Kalli Coporation  Jingan Equip- (Arms trading,     (Clothing, food,     (Communications    ment Import infrastructure      construction,          equipment)        &amp; Export property, elec-     materials, fuel,                       Corporation tronics, shipping,     vehicles)                          (Police equip- trading)                                                     ment) Ping He Electronics (military technology) China Electronic Systems Zhihua Corporation (communications)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              COMMISSION ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY &amp; INDUSTRY                     FOR NATIONAL DEFENCE (COSTIND)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ziaofeng Technology &amp; Equipment Corporation (Computers, robotics &amp; advertised technology)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             STATE COUNCIL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ministry of                China National            China North Electronics Industry      Nuclear Industry            Industries                             Corporation                 Norinco Chian National             China National            China General Electronic               Nuclear Corporation     Industrial Materials Import &amp; Export                                       &amp; equipment Corporation                                           Corporation China Electronics          China Nuclear             China Yanxing Industry Corporation     Instrumentation &amp;             National                        Equipment Corporation          Corporation                            China Nuclear              China North                             Equipment &amp;           Optics &amp; Equipment                        Materials Corporation          Corporation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aviation Industries       China Aerospace              China State of China                    Corporation                shipbuilding                                                        Corporation China National            China Great Wall          China shipbuilding Aero-Technology         Industry Corporation              Trading Import &amp; Export Corporation                           China Precision                              Machinery                           Import &amp; Export                             Corporation                        China Academy of Launch                      Vehicle Technology or, Beijing                      Wan Yuan Industry Corporation                           China Academy of                           space technology  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Anger as bill for disabled fails A BILL to establish a powerful disablement commission failed in the Commons yesterday, in spite of support from MPs of all parties. The Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, piloted by Mr Alf Morris, MP for Wythenshawe and a former Labour minister for the disabled, failed to win a second reading when the debate ran out of time after an hour and 55 minutes when the House finished for business. A closure vote, necessary to move the bill on, was turned down as the debate had lasted less than two hours. A vote on whether to give the bill a second reading could not be taken automatically as an MP - Mr Robert Hayward, Tory member for Kingswood - was still speaking. Furious opposition MPs rounded on Mr Hayward, charging him with dishonourable conduct. He had said he would not talk the bill out. The bill's effective death knell had been sounded earlier when Mr Nicholas Scott, social security minister, withheld government backing, saying he remained 'benevolently neutral'. Mr Paul Boateng, Labour MP for Brent South, said the government's neutrality amounted to 'the kiss of death'. A bill permitting nurses, midwives and health visitors to prescribe certain drugs without doctors' approval won a second reading yesterday.</p>

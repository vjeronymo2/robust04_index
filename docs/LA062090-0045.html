			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A group of current and former UC San Diego employees filed suit Tuesday against  the university, alleging that they were demoted or fired from their jobs on  racial grounds.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, claims that the workers' civil  rights were violated and that they were discriminated against because they are  black, Latino and Filipino.  </P> <P> It also alleges that the university misled the workers into thinking they would  be eligible for pay raises and promotions.  </P> <P> The suit, which lawyers say has the potential to become a class-action claim on  behalf of "numerous" workers, was filed on behalf of nine employees at  university administrative facilities, classrooms and hospitals.  </P> <P> The nine held jobs such as X-ray file clerk, painter and custodian, according  to the suit.  </P> <P> The amount of damages sought was not disclosed.  </P></p>

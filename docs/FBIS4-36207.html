			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the Foreign Policy Desk: "The United States, Saudi </F> Arabia, and the Policy of Fomenting Tension in the Region"]    [Text] Every once in a while, U.S. officials address issues  concerning the important Persian Gulf region and express the  stances of their government on the political and security  aspects of the issues. Even though these utterances may be  projected as logical and popular, a deeper and precise  examination will assist us to perceiving the ill-intentioned  U.S. objectives.    In this regard, the presidential adviser for national  security affairs, Anthony Lake, spoke recently on the Persian  Gulf region and explained his country's stance. In his remarks,  in order to capitalize further on the resources of the Arabs of  the region, he once more waxed eloquent on the defeated policy  of dual containment of Iraq and Iran and stressed the dangers  from both these countries to the regional countries.    Even though one should admit that Washington's plan for dual  containment of Iran and Iraq stems from a lack of understanding  of the realities and how the needs of the region relate to U.S.  foreign policy, by making such claims the United States is  paving the way for a greater presence in the region.    In his remarks, Anthony Lake spoke in general terms of  "extremism." Dividing it into religious and national extremism,  he claimed that both were dangerous for the United States and  the region. Extremism is one of those expressions frequently  used by Americans, but they have never clearly defined what they  actually mean by this term.    Even though extremism is even denounced in the religion of  Islam, the U.S. hierarchy and, naturally, the regional Gulf  officials have a different concept of extremism as compared with  the usual concept.    From Washington's point of view, the term "extremism"  applies  to any individual or government not willing to officially  recognize the illegitimate U.S. interests in various countries  around the world. The Americans freely label anyone who does not  succumb to their domination as an extremist, even though they  have not yet presented any specific definition of this term.    For example, they refer to the Lebanese Hizballah as a  conspicuous example of extremism. Have the Hizballah carried  out any action other than armed resistance--which is the last  resort of resistance--in the face of usurpation? Unfortunately,  in today's world all kinds of freedom-seekers are suppressed by  false accusations and even by force at sword point; and the  subsequent struggle is labeled extremism.    Lake also rejected the notion of a war between the West and  Islam after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and communism.  While his own country is engaged in a multifaceted war against  Islam in various parts of the world, Lake claims that the United  States is strongly opposed to the view that the United States  should go to war against Islam in the aftermath of the failure  of communism.    Lake claimed that his country has no intentions of  dominating  the Middle East. Addressing these countries, he said that  progress in the peace process will give the Middle Eastern  countries an opportunity to embark on improving their economy  and the lives of their people instead of squandering their  resources purchasing weapons.    The realities in the region however belie his allegations.  The establishment of military, air, and naval bases in Bahrain,  Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are outstanding examples  of this fact. The White House adviser on national security  affairs made these claims at a time when the region has been  stockpiling destructive and complex American weapons, whose use  is unclear even to the Arab shaykhs.    In the opinion of experts, the United States--by supporting  the Zionist regime's existence and by generating tension between  that regime and the Arab governments--intends to open up a new  front of hostility and tension among the regional Muslim nations.    The prolonged visit by the U.S. assistant secretary of state  to the Persian Gulf region, his provocative remarks regarding  the so-called dangers from Iran, his resurrecting of the claims  of the Untied Arab Emirates, all were part of the U.S. policy of  generating tension in the region.    Some countries' endorsement of such claims against Iran is  part of the overt U.S. policy of fomenting tension in the  region. Unfortunately, some of these countries have fallen into  the traps laid by the colonialists, and they are following  precisely the same lines that the Americans have formulated to  raise tension.    In this regard, in his speech yesterday, Saudi Arabian King  Fahd called on Iran to abide by international norms and alluded  to the UAE's territorial claims against Iran, calling for the  handing over of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf to the  UAE.    These remarks can only result in raising tension in the  region, and will result in greater backwardness and misfortune  for the region, with more domination and profit making by the  United States. The Saudi king has thus taken a new step toward  disrupting the sensitive situation in the Persian Gulf region.</p>

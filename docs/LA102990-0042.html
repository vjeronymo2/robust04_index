			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> GROWTH MEASURES GIVE RISE TO PERPLEXING CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> Growth management, a staple of San Diego politics that, under the best of  circumstances, is a thorny, complex subject, will be before voters again next  month in an election that seems destined to raise the normal confusion  surrounding it to new levels.  </P> <P> In a scenario dubbed the "stealth campaign" by one slow-growth advocate, the  building industry spent several hundred thousand dollars qualifying two growth  initiatives for the city and county ballots, then backed away from the  measures.  </P> <P> Adding to the murkiness, while no one is actively campaigning for Propositions  D and M, many builders decline to say whether they support or oppose the  measures. Typifying most developers' attitude, one construction industry  spokesman said simply: "It would be nice if they just dropped off the ballot."  </P> <P> Skeptical opponents, meanwhile, have accused developers of cleverly trying to  pass the initiatives by distancing themselves from the two propositions, known  as the Traffic Control and Comprehensive Growth Management Initiatives.  Moreover, with the campaign attracting little public attention, opponents worry  that the measures may pass on Nov. 6 simply because of their appealing titles.  </P> <P> "Our biggest fear is that a lot of voters who know nothing about (the  propositions) will be swayed just by their nice-sounding names," said Peter  Navarro, chairman of the slow-growth group Prevent Los Angelization Now, or  PLAN. "The builders' best chance for passing these things is to become  invisible. They realize they're the kiss of death for any proposition they  publicly support."  </P> <P> Although overshadowed by Proposition M and its companion measure dealing with  county lands, Proposition D, two other growth and open space measures also  appear on the city's ballot. Proposition E asks voters to authorize a  $100-million bond for the acquisition or improvement of parks and open space,  while Proposition L would amend San Diego's charter to require public approval  of the sale of 80 acres or more of city-owned land.  </P> <P> In the absence of strong opposition to the open-space bond measure and with  Proposition L seen as having limited application, the low-profile campaign on  Propositions D and M has become this year's version of San Diego's almost  annual electoral debate over growth management.  </P> <P> Originally envisioned by developers as a safeguard against potentially tougher  growth restrictions, the two measures left the construction industry in a  peculiar position when those more stringent possibilities failed to materialize  either on the ballot or at City Hall.  </P> <P> Indeed, after PLAN decided not to place an initiative on the ballot and the  City Council diluted its own growth plan this fall, many developers were  chagrined to realize that the two propositions created to protect their  interests conceivably could raise, not lower, development expenses.  </P> <P> In particular, builders strongly oppose the propositions' major component: a  so-called transportation impact fee designed to make new development help pay  for new major roads, freeways and expansion of the San Diego Trolley. Over the  next two decades, the fee -- which would be levied on developments both in the  city of San Diego and the county's unincorporated areas -- would raise an  estimated $643 million.  </P> <P> Under the propositions, those fees would be capped at $200 per "average daily  trip" produced by new development, or $2,000 per single-family home. In a  paradox that neatly underlines the polarity of San Diego's growth-management  battles, slow-growth advocates dismiss those limits as unrealistically low even  as builders lament that they are too high.  </P> <P> The proposed fees, critics complain, would raise only about one-third of the  money needed to pay the public costs associated with growth. Builders, though,  hasten to note that the fees are almost twice as high as the $1,100-per-home  first-year ceiling tentatively approved by the City Council -- a cost that  could be reduced or even postponed when the city's growth plan returns to the  council for further action next month.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt the industry could be hurt if D and M pass, because they  establish fees that would not be in place otherwise," said Mike Madigan, senior  vice president of Pardee Construction Co., who helped draft the measures that  he now opposes.  </P> <P> To Gary London, a spokesman for the San Diego 2000 Committee, the group that  sponsored the two ballot measures, that too low-too high dichotomy is proof  that the propositions represent more of a compromise than a one-sided,  pro-development plan.  </P> <P> "When neither side is entirely happy, maybe that means you've found a pretty  good middle ground," said London, an economist who jokingly bills himself as  the "one-man campaign" behind the propositions, whose ranks of public  supporters have thinned almost weekly.  </P> <P> The measures' major attributes, London argues, are that they approach  growth-management on a regional basis, establish comprehensive planning  guidelines in areas ranging from air and water quality to recycling and  day-care centers, and require annual reports from public agencies on their  progress in meeting those goals.  </P> <P> But opponents, who include environmentalists, the entire county Board of  Supervisors and most San Diego City Council members, complain that the  propositions do little to strengthen -- and could even weaken -- the city's and  county's existing growth-management programs.  </P> <P> Furthermore, critics note that, in most cases, the propositions do not mandate  stricter air, water reclamation, recycling or traffic-reduction standards, but  rather simply establish goals.  </P> <P> "Basically, this just calls for reports, not implementation, on a lot of apple  pie and motherhood issues like air and water quality," said Supervisor Susan  Golding. "The last thing we need is more reports gathering dust. Besides, the  initiatives call for less than we're doing now."  </P> <P> While conceding that the propositions partly overlap existing programs,  supporters argue that their passage could expedite the regional approach to  growth management called for in an advisory 1988 ballot proposition. Despite  professing support for that concept, local lawmakers have been reluctant to  give up their autonomy over development within their individual jurisdictions.  </P> <P> "This would give a good kick in the pants to the city and county, which have  done a lot of talking about that but not much else," said San Marcos Mayor Lee  Thibadeau.  </P> <P> Beyond imposing the transportation impact fee, the propositions also would  require that public facilities such as fire stations, parks and libraries be in  place as new development occurs. But those provisions, too, are riddled with  loopholes, thanks to the calculated vagueness of phrases such as "timely  construction" and "where feasible" that appear in the propositions' ballot  language.  </P> <P> PLAN's Navarro, who derisively refers to the propositions' letter designations  as standing for "Deceit" and "Manipulation," argues that more than 80% of  development already proposed would be exempt from the initiatives.  </P> <P> "This is not even an inch forward, but two giant steps backward," Navarro said.  "To call this growth management is one of the bigger frauds we've ever seen  foisted on the public."  </P> <P> Reiterating a theme from past growth-management campaigns, opponents also argue  that ballot initiatives are a poor mechanism for establishing major growth  policy. The defects of one initiative can only be corrected by public approval  of another initiative -- a costly and time-consuming procedure that severely  limits legislative bodies' flexibility.  </P> <P> "We should place the responsibility for resolving these issues where it belongs  -- squarely in the laps of those we have elected to represent us," said  University City activist Harry Mathis, another original supporter of the two  propositions who now urges their rejection.  </P> <P> Backers of the propositions, however, emphasize that the Board of Supervisors  or City Council could modify the measures by a two-thirds vote. "It doesn't  take away legislative latitude," Thibadeau explained.  </P> <P> In the growth-control plan that it adopted earlier this month, the San Diego  City Council scaled back some tougher proposals by, among other things,  rejecting a controversial plan to limit future development by linking building  permits to strict standards for traffic congestion. The council also agreed to  phase in the new citywide impact fees, with the estimated cost per  single-family home rising from $1,100 this year to $4,400 by late 1993.  </P> <P> That action was interpreted by some builders as evidence of the council's  heightened sensitivity to how the nationwide economic downturn already is  acting as a brake on development. Combined with the fact that the propositions'  fees ultimately could exceed those set by the council, that helps explain why  many developers have backed away from the measures.  </P> <P> "It's a case where time and circumstance have overrun the original intent of  the propositions," said Frank Panarisi, president of the Construction Industry  Federation, whose organization has remained officially neutral in the campaign.  </P> <P> Still suspicious of developers' motives, Navarro argues that builders'  "now-we-support-it, now-we-don't" stance is ample reason for rejecting  Propositions D and M.  </P> <P> "There was no reason to trust them when they put these things on the ballot,  and there's no reason to believe them now when they say they've changed their  minds," Navarro said.  </P> <P> There is considerably less disagreement over Proposition E, the proposed  $100-million bond issue that, if passed, would enable the city to purchase and  improve parks and open space.  </P> <P> Called "an investment in San Diego's future" by City Councilman Ron Roberts,  Proposition E is intended to replenish a $65-million open-space fund that the  city's voters approved in 1978. That now-depleted fund, used to acquire  hundreds of acres of open space throughout the city over the past decade, was  repaid through franchise fees paid by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.  customers.  </P> <P> In contrast, Proposition E, whose supporters have adopted the slogan "Leave  Something Green," would impose a surcharge of $16 per $100,000 of assessed  valuation on property taxes for up to 30 years, with the fee gradually  declining as the city's tax base expands.  </P> <P> Of the $100 million raised by the tax, $15 million would be used to acquire  land in the San Dieguito River Valley for a planned regional park, and another  $15 million would be earmarked for land purchases in the Otay and Tijuana river  valleys.  </P> <P> The remaining $70 million would finance park projects throughout the city,  particularly in older neighborhoods with limited recreational facilities. A  14-page list of recommendations specifying how the money might be spent  includes projects in virtually every community, including property purchases,  funds for playground equipment, restrooms and game rooms, and plans to turf  over asphalt school fields in communities where open space is lacking.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty modest request for a pretty important priority," Roberts said.  "If we delay, all that will happen is that costs will rise and more open space  will disappear."  </P> <P> A diverse cross-section of business and interest groups has endorsed  Proposition E, including the Sierra Club, various community councils, the San  Diego Assn. of Realtors, the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce and the San  Diego County Taxpayers' Assn.  </P> <P> The limited criticism of the measure has come largely from members of the San  Diego Libertarian Party, who argue that the city should not be assuming a new  debt for parks at a time when it cannot afford to hire enough police or meet  other higher priorities.  </P> <P> Critics also view the proposed creation of a citywide park assessment district  as a means of circumventing Proposition 13's requirement of a two-thirds public  vote for approval of new taxes. In addition, they dismiss the "Santa Claus"  list of recommendations as a disingenuous strategic gambit intended simply to  attract votes, arguing that it would cost nearly $3 billion to complete all of  the projects mentioned.  </P> <P> "It's the same old story of elected officials coming up with new schemes to get  around Prop. 13," said Libertarian Dick Rider. "Our only hope is that voters  don't get snookered by this phony shopping list."  </P> <P> The major concern of Proposition E's proponents, meanwhile, is that the more  than dozen state tax proposals and bond measures on the ballot will leave  voters in no mood for even a modest local tax increase, particularly in light  of the uncertain state of the economy.  </P> <P> "Our biggest worry is that voters might be so angry that they say 'no' to  everything," Roberts said.  </P> <P> The remaining growth-related matter on the ballot, Proposition L, would require  public approval of any City Council plan to sell or exchange 80-acres-plus  parcels of city property. One exception would be the sale of city land to  another governmental agency for public use.  </P> <P> Because such sales occur infrequently, the proposal has generated little debate  and no organized opposition. Even council members, who often view such  proposals as an infringement of their legislative prerogatives, support the  proposition, viewing it as protection against ill-advised sales of scarce city  property.  </P> <P> "It's a good check against poor short-range decisions," Roberts said. "If a  sale is such a good thing, voters will approve it. Sometimes it helps to have  someone looking over your shoulder."  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Twins who generate success - Bernice Cohen explains her investment guidelines BEING a committed Do-It-Myself Investor (DIMI) I soon discovered the importance of good timing coupled with share selection. These twins can generate that happy outcome: investment success. Capital growth, for a DIMI, has a high priority in portfolio planning. During the expansionary 1980s, sharp share price rises occurred for companies such as Glaxo, Guinness, Sainsbury and Rentokil. So I remain optimistic of finding shares with great potential. My search began with the writings of several investment writers. Jim Slater* offers sound advice: start with the basics, find and adopt a good system, then work on it to improve results. Peter Lynch** warns: 'Invest in stocks to make money, not to preserve capital.' For discovering small company shares with exceptional potential, William O'Neil*** uses a mnemonic 'CAN SLIM'. My version of this covers extra points. 'GAINS ARE FAST', outlined below, is my research detector for unearthing mini-stocks with big prospects. G: growth in earnings per share over the long term - at least a doubling over five years. A: annual earnings per share. The latest results should show growth of over 20 per cent. I: institutional support. This helps to improve trading liquidity. N: new products, management or a new high in the share price: niche markets which confer strong growth advantages. S: supply/demand for the shares. Small capitalisation plus demand encourages a rising share price. A: ambitious owner/managers. They are eager for success. R: Rich in cash. Companies which have no debt and handle cash generating products which fund growth without diluting earnings. E: efficient management. It builds leading, not lagging, companies. F: fundamental facts. They inform on the present and prospective share price. A: act if growth falters. I bale out rapidly on profit warnings, setbacks or if a chart falls below its uptrend. S: stock market direction. Few shares prosper in falling markets. T: technical analysis. What does the share price chart imply? Charts give guidance on buying and selling decisions and to assess the potential for a share price rise. Investment is a subjective, imprecise art. 'GAINS ARE FAST' incorporates a belt and braces approach. Airtours, a star 1991 performer - this week it bid for Owners Abroad - illustrates the formula in action. Annual results in 1990 showed 'G' (growth in earnings per share) of 220 per cent from 1986 to 1990, a rise from 8.5p to 27.2p. One could also see 'A' (current annual earnings) growing by 31 per cent and 'I' (institutional interest) rising through 1991 as Airtours' improving prospects were recognised. In March, the new element 'N' occurred, when Intasun, the UK's second largest tour operator collapsed, boosting Airtours' market share. The market capitalisation at the time was Pounds 23.7m with the share price at 148p. This small 'S' (supply) - of 16.01m shares was further limited by the large holding of chief executive/owner, David Crossland. He is a typical example of 'A' (an ambitious owner) building his own success. In December 1990 Airtours was also 'R' (rich in cash) with net cash of Pounds 26m exceeding market capitalisation of Pounds 23.7m. When Intasun collapsed, management quality enabled Airtours to harvest bumper 1991 profits. It was 'E' (efficiently managed) to exploit this unexpected advantage. The 90,000 bookings taken during the next week represented more than Pounds 1m in profits. In December 1990, the 'F' (fundamentals) were favourable. The dividend yield was high (7.4 per cent) and the price earnings ratio (P/E) modest at 5. At 148p, five years' earnings would pay for the share. Knowing 1990s earnings growth was 31 per cent, I can value a share by dividing what I get (earnings growth) by what it costs (current P/E). John Neff, a famous investor, devised this clever ratio. For good value, growth divided by P/E must be higher than 2. For Airtours, 1990 earnings growth divided by P/E gives a rating of 6.2, a sizeable under-valuation. To judge the possible rise, I assumed continuing growth, while remaining alert for setbacks. If 1991 earnings per share had risen 30 per cent to 35.4p, and the P/E rose to 10, the share price would reach 354p. A P/E rise to 20 would have implied a share price of 708p. To judge if this was feasible meant 'A' (actively monitoring) Airtours' progress. News items in the summer hinted that analysts were under-estimating its performance. January is often a good month for equities. When the Gulf War began on Jan 16, 'S' (stock market direction) improved dramatically. From a closing low of 2054.8 that day, the FTSE-100 reached 2459.1 on March 8, when Intasun collapsed, and then reached a September 6 peak of 2667.4, providing a bullish background. Finally, 'T' (technical analysis). Was there guidance in the share's chart in December 1990? From 148p, the price fell to a February 1991 low of 135p. Then, a steady climb reached 184p by early March. This move created a classic 'shallow dip' before the huge take-off. By September, channel lines drawn to connect the rising highs implied a Pounds 12 target by spring 1992. This exceeded my 'guesstimates' but underestimated the final outcome. The price sustained several bursts, peaking in March 1992, at the equivalent of Pounds 13.50, (ignoring the January 1992 scrip issue). The sell signal came in May 1992, when the price fell through the lower channel line. Clearly, Airtours had an exceptional 1991. While searching for another such investment I try to resist diversifying into possibilities that fail some 'GAINS ARE FAST' rules. A King Penguin approach focuses me on one giant egg (while earning interest on other cash assets). Unearthing spectacular growth stocks is an exciting treasure hunt. William O'Neil exhorts: 'Don't dabble in stocks. Dig in and do some real detective work.' * Article in Analyst September 1990. ** One Up On Wall Street, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1989. *** How to make money in stocks, McGraw Hill, 1991 edition.</p>

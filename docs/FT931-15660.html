			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Warning on funds for elderly FUNDING problems in providing residential care for the elderly are likely to become 'significantly worse' when the government's community care reforms are introduced in April, the charity Methodist Homes for the Aged said yesterday. Methodist Homes, one of Britain's biggest charitable providers of residential care, warned that 'both the quality and the availability of appropriate care may be under threat' from lack of funding. Funding through social security payments to accommodate elderly people in residential homes has risen from Pounds 10m in 1979 to about Pounds 2.5bn. Methodist Homes says government support has nevertheless not kept pace with actual care costs. The charity spends Pounds 400,000 a year subsidising social-security-funded residents in its homes. Methodist Homes said the problem was likely to worsen after April, when councils become responsible for assessing individuals' care needs. There will be greater emphasis on providing domiciliary rather than residential care. 'Some local authorities have indicated that charges for residential care should be in line with income support levels, despite the fact that residential care in the future is likely to be reserved for more dependent elderly people who will need a higher level of care,' said Mr David Wigley, chief executive of Methodist Homes. 'Other local authorities are indicating that they will be prepared to pay higher charges, but still short of the true cost of providing care for very dependent people.' Methodist Homes says it will not drop its standards of care but fears private sector providers may be forced to. The charity says the need to continue subsidising residents means it will abandon plans to build new facilities unless it can raise an additional Pounds 3m over the next three years. homes in</p>

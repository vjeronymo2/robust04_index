			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NEWPORT SEX CONVICT SAYS THE LAW DID HIM WRONG  </P> <P> As a yacht broker, Daniel DeHaven had a reputation for honesty. He has raised  four children and bought as many homes.  </P> <P> His only scrape with the law was 48 years ago when, as a teen-ager, he went for  a joy ride in a neighbor's car. Longtime friends say they have never known him  to be violent or sexually aggressive.  </P> <P> But in May, 1989, DeHaven was convicted of armed robbery, sexual battery and  the attempted rape of a young woman in a dim Newport Beach parking garage. He  served about six months in Huntington Beach City Jail and was released in  August. But he has not walked away.  </P> <P> With the help of friends, family and a veteran investigator from the Orange  County public defender's office, DeHaven has launched a legal offensive to  clear his name in a case with virtually no evidence against him except that  based on the victim's word.  </P> <P> "I'll never forget the day the jury came back," DeHaven recalled. "I stood  facing them and I told my lawyer they look grim. 'They sure do,' he said. The  verdict was unanimous. I said over and over, 'How could they do this to me?' "  </P> <P> Allegations of misconduct by Newport Beach police, including the planting of  evidence and the improper influencing of the victim, have been lodged with the  Orange County Grand Jury. Although grand jurors will neither confirm nor deny  they have opened a case, John K. Depko, the public defender's investigator  working with DeHaven, said he was told by the panel's secretary, Mary L.  Hennessy, that the matter was pending as of last week.  </P> <P> DeHaven is also seeking a new trial before the 4th District Court of Appeal,  alleging a host of problems with the case. In March, the Orange County district  attorney's office was presented with a detailed report. A lawsuit seeking $15  million in damages for alleged civil rights violations is being prepared.  </P> <P> The question is whether DeHaven, now 65, was mistakenly identified by the  25-year-old victim, who tearfully testified during a day and a half on the  witness stand that he accosted her at knifepoint almost two years ago.  </P> <P> Police and prosecutors steadfastly maintain that the retired yacht broker is  guilty of the crime. Although they admit that mistakes were made by an officer  assigned to the case, they say that investigators did a thorough job.  </P> <P> Above all, the victim's "credibility was phenomenal," said Deputy Dist. Atty.  John Anderson.  </P> <P> "She was sure about it. It's twisted the way the defense is now trying to  portray the inconsistencies in this case. They argued all this and the jurors  listened to them and judged them. They simply said, 'We don't believe you.' "  </P> <P> The evidence against DeHaven, then 62, was based almost solely on the  statements of the victim, a Greek immigrant whom investigators noted had  difficulty speaking English.  </P> <P> She was attacked about 12:30 p.m. on Jan. 5, 1988, as she sat in her 1978 BMW  320i in the dimly lighted parking garage of the South Oakwood Apartments.  </P> <P> To this day, she remains sure that DeHaven was her attacker.  </P> <P> "Absolutely, he is the one," she said in a telephone interview Saturday. "I  have stayed locked in my house. I am afraid to go out sometime. I hear  something behind me, I look over my shoulder. I saw him and what he did to me.  He was in my car. I'm sure."  </P> <P> But DeHaven has said from the beginning that he is innocent, and at his trial,  two witnesses testified that they were having lunch with him at the time of the  attack.  </P> <P> He and Depko maintain that he was convicted in part because police ignored  their own policies and sound investigative techniques in making the case.  </P> <P> Among their claims:  </P> <P> * Police used questionable methods to attempt to link DeHaven to a home  burglary that occurred shortly after the sexual assault. Depko said he found  evidence of "repeated and calculated violations of normal police procedure" in  what he believes was an attempt to discredit DeHaven.  </P> <P> * An adequate fingerprint check of the vehicle in which the sexual attack  occurred was never made.  </P> <P> * Identification by a photograph of DeHaven in the sexual assault case was  obtained in apparent violation of department procedure.  </P> <P> * Investigators allegedly ignored contradictions between the victim's  description of physical evidence and items obtained from DeHaven.  </P> <P> "I have worked on 2,000 cases in my career and this is the only one where I  feel the defendant is innocent," Depko said.  </P> <P> The controversy about the case first surfaced in the middle of DeHaven's trial.  </P> <P> Papers from a burglarized apartment were found inside a gray jacket presented  in court as evidence. According to police records, no such documents were ever  reported to be inside DeHaven's jacket at the time of his arrest on Jan. 18,  1988.  </P> <P> The records were a health insurance identification card, a credit card receipt  and a temporary Texas driver's license belonging to Carey Lynn Baker, whose  Newport Beach apartment was burglarized 10 days after the armed robbery and  attempted rape.  </P> <P> Two months before DeHaven's trial, Depko said, he thoroughly searched the  jacket in the presence of police. According to his report, he did not find any  documents belonging to Baker and was assured by police there was no more  evidence.  </P> <P> Depko said his suspicions of police misconduct were reinforced by Baker's  description of the way police questioned her about the burglary. She told Depko  that police tried to influence what she said and wanted her to pick out a  picture of a suspect that clearly did not match the description of the man she  saw in her apartment.  </P> <P> According to Depko's report, Baker said all the men police showed her in a  photo folder, including DeHaven's picture, were too old. When she was told to  pick one anyway, she chose someone other than DeHaven. Baker recalled that  police then told her she had picked the wrong man.  </P> <P> "In my 15 years in the criminal justice system, (the officer's) handling of  this photo-lineup with Baker is the worst example of blatant attempts by police  to change a witness's testimony," Depko wrote. "Had he succeeded in twisting  Baker's memory, he may well have obtained the false identification of an  innocent man."  </P> <P> Depko contends that if Baker's documents were found during DeHaven's arrest, he  should have been booked for investigation of burglary or possession of stolen  property at the least. DeHaven was accused of neither.  </P> <P> Newport Beach Lt. Tim Newman, a police spokesman, said the Baker documents were  in the jacket at the time of the arrest but not recorded because the papers  were taken out to be photographed and then mistakenly placed in a separate  evidence locker. Some time before DeHaven's trial, the documents were found and  put back in the jacket.  </P> <P> According to police, the officer involved was disciplined for the error.  </P> <P> "Our employee made a mistake and did not thoroughly describe all the evidence  that was located," Newman said. "It was an error. We screwed up. . . . Steps  were taken to make sure it doesn't happen again."  </P> <P> Newman said that it was logical and proper for police to question Baker about  DeHaven after his arrest because he lived in the area and there might have been  some similarities with the suspect's description. He denied any impropriety.  </P> <P> Police also have told the Orange County district attorney's office that Depko  missed the documents in the jacket during his search and that DeHaven was  questioned about the papers after his arrest.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley, who talked to the police and reviewed Depko's  detailed report, concluded that the prospect of planting evidence was remote.  ". . . Mistakes were made, but no deliberate wrongdoing occurred," Conley said.  </P> <P> But Depko, DeHaven and his supporters contend that violations of Newport Beach  police policies and indications of incompetence extend well beyond the Baker  documents and into the heart of the criminal charges -- the victim's  recollection.  </P> <P> "Obviously, it is very disturbing. When I read the case it caused a natural  uneasiness," said Jack Earley, a private defense attorney who represented  DeHaven for a while. "It is a very weak ID and he has about as strong an alibi  as you can see. Wrong IDs can cause horrible injustices."  </P> <P> Depko has raised questions about aspects of how DeHaven was identified --  procedures used when the victim spotted him in a shopping mall and the way she  was subsequently shown a photograph of DeHaven at police headquarters.  </P> <P> Records indicate that after the attack, Newport police received four reports  from patrol officers, the victim and one of the victim's co-workers who thought  they had spotted the suspect. One of them was a man with a "balding spot" and  tan jacket. The victim, who became "very upset," was "positive" it was her  assailant. DeHaven has no balding spot or tan jacket.  </P> <P> DeHaven officially came into the picture while the victim was working at Atrium  Court in Fashion Island on Jan. 18, 1988. Police were already in the shopping  center, responding to the sighting of the man with the balding spot.  </P> <P> While talking to a detective, the victim looked up, pointed out DeHaven on the  second floor more than 100 feet away, and said, "My God, he's back! There he  is!" According to a police report, she became visibly upset.  </P> <P> DeHaven was arrested, but never taken any closer to the victim for inspection,  Depko said, noting that proper field identifications are usually done from a  few feet away.  </P> <P> Later, the victim was shown only a photograph of DeHaven, which she identified  as a picture of her attacker.  </P> <P> The use of one photo is contrary to Newport Beach Police Department policies  designed to prevent victims and witnesses from making biased and unreliable  selections of suspects. Among other things, at least six photographs must be  presented and they have to show similar-looking people, department rules state.  </P> <P> "If they (police) would have shown her a full photo lineup, she probably would  not have identified him," Depko said. "With only eyewitness testimony, you must  be extremely scrupulous, but they ignored key contradictions."  </P> <P> But Lt. Newman defends the procedure used by police by saying that there may  not have been any need to show the victim a full photo lineup because she  seemed certain about her attacker.  </P> <P> "This was not an inappropriate police investigation. It was a good  investigation and he was convicted," Newman said. "A person incarcerated for a  crime they did not commit is a bad thing, but a woman assaulted in a parking  lot is a bad thing too."  </P> <P> However, Depko said other incongruities spring from the details of the case.  </P> <P> Police records and court testimony indicate there are some similarities and  differences between DeHaven and the assailant. DeHaven is the about the same  size and has a mustache, as did the attacker, but did not have four to five  days' growth of beard at the time of the attack. His jacket is the same light  gray color as the victim originally said the attacker wore, but has black  zippers on the sleeves and a different kind of cuff.  </P> <P> Then there is the difference between the knife the victim originally described  being used in the attack and the one DeHaven was carrying the day he was  arrested.  </P> <P> The victim first described the weapon as a kitchen-type knife with a dark  handle about 6 inches long. DeHaven, a yachtsman, carried a Buck pocketknife,  which is about 7 inches long unfolded and has a handle of dark wood with brass  fittings at each end and a piece of green tape around it. But when shown  DeHaven's knife at the Police Department, investigators said, the victim  identified it.  </P> <P> According to police reports, the victim had "no doubt" about DeHaven's jacket  and identified the knife when police showed it to her. Later, during a  preliminary hearing, she said she remembered the knife exactly and recounted  the tape, the brass fittings and that it folded. Her original description never  included those details.  </P> <P> Depko also noted in his review of the case that although the victim said the  attacker touched the inside and outside of her car, police testified that they  dusted only the outside of the vehicle for fingerprints and did not find any.  Had the inside been checked, he said, DeHaven might have been eliminated as a  suspect.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office contends that all of the defense concerns were  addressed at the trial during what the prosecutor described as "very thorough  cross-examination."  </P> <P> "You can't explain away all the coincidences. It is nonsense to isolate one  piece of the evidence. It is the combined effect that can't be ignored,"  Anderson said. "It's the cleanest trial you can have -- plain old witness  credibility. This victim will go to her grave 100% convinced that this guy  attacked her."  </P> <P> DeHaven's state-appointed attorney, Lawrence F. Salisbury, contends in his  appeal, however, that the jury was improperly denied the testimony of 10  character witnesses that when combined with other testimony would provide  enough evidence to support an acquittal.  </P></p>

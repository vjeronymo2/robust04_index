			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: A costly policy from Lloyd's FT-SE Index: 2,537.1 (+20.8) Companies do not survive for long with a cost structure 43 per cent above what is needed to offer shareholders an acceptable return. That is perhaps the most fundamental reason why the Lloyd's insurance market will be forced to act quickly on the many sensible recommendations put forward yesterday in the report led by Mr David Rowland. Given his reputation for knocking Sedgwick into shape, Mr Rowland is a credible taskmaster. Even his apparently savage target expense ratios, though, could prove optimistic. They assume, for example, that underwriting results and investment income at Lloyd's will return to the average levels of the period 1979-1988, years which apart from the final one were highly profitable. It could be that worldwide capacity reductions and hardening premium rates in some areas like marine and aviation herald a sharp turnround in the insurance industry's fortunes. It would be unwise to count on it. The main surprise yesterday was the report's proposal that the divestment rules in the 1982 act should be reversed. It is possible to argue that tighter regulation today takes care of the conflict of interest problem, and that ownership of underwriting agencies by the brokers will encourage stability. Quoted agencies tend to be poorly understood by investors and follow a different cycle. That apart, the unspoken message of the report is that Lloyd's needs its brokers more than the other way round.</p>

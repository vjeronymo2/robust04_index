			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> $2,587,260 RAISED FOR DEFEATED MEASURE M  </P> <P> Proponents of Measure M, the half-cent transportation sales tax defeated last  November, raised a record-breaking $2,587,260 in their unsuccessful campaign,  finance reports showed Monday.  </P> <P> Citizens for Yes on M surpassed the previous record of $2,522,527 set by  Citizens for Traffic Solutions, the group that successfully opposed a June,  1988, slow-growth and traffic initiative.  </P> <P> Virtually the same major donors -- builders, developers, real estate firms and  construction companies -- funded both efforts.  </P> <P> Although final campaign finance reports were not immediately available for all  of the committees that successfully opposed Measure M last November, their  receipts and expenditures were not expected to exceed a combined total of  $30,000.  </P> <P> Measure M, which may be placed before voters again this fall, would have raised  an estimated $3.1 billion for new freeway lanes, car-pool lanes, so-called  super streets, local street repairs, and several commuter rail and high-tech  transit projects.  </P> <P> Political experts attributed its defeat to a low voter turnout (22%) in which  primarily older, more conservative county residents went to the polls.  </P> <P> Critics of Measure M, however, said that some voters were probably offended by  the huge amount of money being spent on the campaign.  </P> <P> "It's obscene," said Jerry Yudelson, who campaigned against Measure M. "It was  a political consultants' full employment act." But former county supervisor  Bruce Nestande, who headed the pro-M campaign said: "It's nice to be part of a  record-breaking operation. We knew that it was going to be a very expensive  campaign going in."  </P> <P> The Measure M finance report showed that Nestande's committee spent $2,403,902,  which is below the $2,525,506 in expenditures reported a year ago in the effort  against the slow-growth initiative.  </P> <P> The biggest cash contributions were $146,932 from the Irvine Co., $104,099 from  Rancho Santa Margarita, $61,599 from the Koll Co. and $50,000 from the Lincoln  Club of Orange County, an influential Republican volunteer organization.

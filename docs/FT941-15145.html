			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Meistersinger school is now outdated I confess that I was once a card-carrying member of the Meistersinger school of training. I used to admire the strict German apprenticeship system which has its roots in the medieval guild society depicted in Wagner's famous opera. Like much of the UK economics establishment, I fervently believed that a laisser faire approach to vocational training accounted for many of British industry's failings. Modern mastersingers do not claim that apprenticeships are needed in every sector. But they do believe strongly in a formal system of vocational qualifications, with minimum periods of study and strict examinations. They are convinced that training cannot be left to the free market. Some collective mechanism - either the government or quasi public entities such as chambers of commerce - is deemed essential if workers are not to be shortchanged. Interventionists will be comforted to learn that top Clinton administration officials such as Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, are greatly impressed by continental European training methods. Time and money permitting they will expand the role of the federal government. Yet I have to say that my enthusiasm for public intervention on training is waning. No country could flout the mastersinger rules more defiantly than America. The educational system is unquestionably biased towards academic studies. There is no national system of vocational standards such as Britain is struggling to create. Companies are left largely to their own devices. A ragbag of ineffectual public-sector training schemes is directed mainly at the disadvantaged. The US thus ought to be in a terrible mess. If the mastersinger school's arguments were sound, the US would be bedevilled by shoddy workmanship and poor service. Yet neither anecdotal evidence nor economic statistics bear out these worries. The service in US restaurants, hotels and department stores is generally attentive and friendly even if employees lack formal vocational qualifications. Plumbing and central heating systems are not constantly breaking down. There is little evidence of blue-collar incompetence. The macroeconomic figures are even more impressive. Contrary to some claims, Germany and Japan remain less efficient than the US. Throughout this century, the US has enjoyed much higher levels of manufacturing productivity than any of its rivals. Most studies - including those by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - indicate that it has extended its productivity lead in the past decade. Its share of world export markets is rising and it is doing particularly well in sectors such as capital goods that require high levels of technical expertise. The mastersingers must find the US's success baffling. According to their theories, private-sector training efforts must be blighted by a serious 'market failure'. In free markets, companies will always spend too little on training because they do not own their workers and so cannot prevent poaching by free-riding competitors. Companies that save money by not training, it is said, can afford to pay the slightly higher wages needed to bid away workers from those that do. At root, this is the argument used to justify a host of interventions, from publicly financed training schemes to mandatory training levies. Now it would be foolish to deny that fear of poaching does not sometimes deter useful training. But the market failure is surely far less severe than usually claimed. Provided markets are competitive, companies can make profits only if they use all their resources efficiently. In most cases, labour is the single most important resource. Are we to believe that the efficient use of labour does not involve training? Are we to believe that fear of poaching is more potent than fear of bankruptcy which is the only long-term prospect for a company that fails to train its workers adequately? And consider matters from an employee's point of view. Suppose I work for a company that invests heavily in training. Am I going to be lured by the prospect of more pay in the short run from a fly-by-night operator that offers no training? What kind of long-run prospect would I have at a company that does nothing to improve the skills of its workforce? Of course, in any sector some companies will not provide sufficient training. But this is tantamount to saying that some companies will always be poorly managed: some companies will fail to use any of their resources efficiently. Rather than becoming obsessed with training per se, the challenge for policy makers is surely to sharpen corporate performance generally. The lesson from the US is that lowering barriers to competition is usually by far the most potent spur. Consider the motor industry. Do even the mastersingers believe that training levies or federal programmes to upgrade worker skills could have raised the productivity of US car makers significantly in the 1980s? Surely it is obvious to everybody that nothing could have had a more beneficial impact on Detroit than competition from Japan. In a Wagnerian guild economy, authoritarian training systems are essential. Everybody needs to know their place and to possess the right paper credentials. The state or a collective employer body must supervise training. But in a market economy, the efficient level of training will be determined automatically by the changing pattern of consumer demands. If you find this conclusion unacceptably Panglossian, then please explain the US's industrial record. The country that leaves training almost entirely to the market has the highest level of productivity. End of argument.</p>

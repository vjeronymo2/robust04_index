			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Scots urge curb on Norwegian salmon SALMON farmers in Scotland and the Irish Republic want their governments this week to persuade the European Commission to take action against Norway to stem a flood of Norwegian salmon on to the EC market. In the past three weeks the price of salmon in EC countries has fallen sharply. Salmon farmers in Scotland mainly blame an influx of Norwegian salmon caused by unexpectedly high production in Norway. The crisis is a re-emergence of the problem caused by Norway's dominant position in European salmon production. The issue is complicated by the fact that Norway is not a member of the EC, but has applied to join. In 1991 the EC temporarily imposed a minimum price on salmon imports from Norway. Norwegian salmon output was cut by measures to take surplus fish off the EC market and reduce production. Many Norwegian salmon farmers went bankrupt. Norwegian output this year may reach 180,000 tonnes, according to the Scottish Salmon Growers Association, compared with original predictions of 120,000 tonnes. About 35,000 tonnes of Norwegian salmon have come on to the EC market recently, pushing prices down from Pounds 3.80 per kilogramme - at which salmon farming is very profitable - to less than Pounds 2.50. Scottish salmon output is also expected to rise this year to 45,000 tonnes compared with last year's 38,000 tonnes. The Scottish and Irish salmon producers are urging their governments to persuade the European Commission to limit the tonnage of salmon that can be imported into the EC from Norway. British and Irish officials are expected to meet the commission on Thursday. The collapse in salmon prices is also causing concern in Norway because of the threat it poses to fish farmers.</p>

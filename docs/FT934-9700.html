			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (9): In the front line - Mining WHILE Australia's politicians have been haggling about taxation on Chardonnay wine, the din has all but drowned out an issue of far greater national significance, writes Bruce Jacques. The index of commodity prices to Australian producers, measured in Special Drawing Rights terms, fell to its lowest level for at least seven years, dragging the Australian currency briefly to its lowest point for six years. The commodities slump, now entering its second half decade, has further highlighted the vulnerability of the Australian economy to external forces. As a world export leader in many key commodities including coal, iron ore, gold, alumina, copper, lead and zinc, Australia has sensitive antennae to world recession. Yet the mining industry has again comfortably held its place as the country's largest export earner. It has done so, however, only by producing more for less, thus playing a big part in chasing world prices down. The pattern was clearly indicated in a recent analysis from ABARE, the Australian Government's commodity analysis body. ABARE calculated that the weighted basket of Australia's commodity prices fell by 8 per cent in 1992-93 and predicted a further 3 per cent fall in the current year. Yet the agency is also predicting that the value of Australian commodity exports will rise by about 3 per cent to ADollars 49bn in the current year. This is forecast to reflect a 2 per cent fall in rural exports, easily offset by a 7 per cent lift to ADollars 31.8bn in mineral exports. Australia's export growth in mining goes against all the world's leading economic trends. Its counter-cyclical nature is perhaps most strikingly demonstrated in relation to steel, still the pivotal metal for economic growth. ABARE forecasts that, in spite of the lower steel production in leading economies, Australia's two best export performers this year will be in steel's key raw materials, coal and iron ore. Coal exports are forecast to rise 3.5 per cent to almost 133m tonnes, with revenue up 4 per cent to ADollars 7.8bn. Iron ore exports are predicted to rise 2 per cent to 110m tonnes, but earnings would fall 3 per cent to ADollars 2.9bn. The incongruity of this export position has been the catalyst for a lively debate on Australia's economic direction. The Federal Government is championing a push to increase exports of manufactured products where world prices are less influenced by consumer countries. Recent growth has been impressive, especially in technology related areas. According to figures from the Bureau of Industry Economics, manufactured exports grew at an average annual rate of 12.5 per cent in the decade to 1992, or from ADollars 10.3bn to ADollars 33.4bn. This slightly exceeded average annual growth in mining exports of 11.5 per cent and dwarfed agricultural export growth of just 2.8 per cent. Even with manufactured exports growing quickly, Australia will continue to be a price taker for a large part of its total exports, but there are two strong pluses to the scenario. The first is the country's fortunate geographic location, affording natural access to some of the world's big growth economies in Asia. Emerging Asian economies account for the bulk of growth projected for Australian mining products this decade. The second, perhaps paradoxically, is the corrective effect of the world commodity price slump on the value of the Australian currency. After averaging around ADollars 1.43 against its US counterpart for 1992-93, the Australian dollar was trading in late October at ADollars 1.50 against the US dollar. While this devaluation is causing problems in some areas of the economy, it has been a handy cushion for Australian mining company earnings. Although performances were mixed, and often marred by hefty write-offs, 1992-93 was a year of overall recovery in Australian mining results. But much of it came through cost-cutting. Having thus battled hard to weather the commodity recession, Australian mining companies moved towards 1994 facing another challenge. The industry is in the thick of the controversy over native title brought on by the High Court decision in mid-1992 in the so-called Mabo case. As a major user of non-urban regions, the mining industry stands to be heavily affected by Mabo, which could give Australia's Aboriginal people title to large tracts of land. Confusion ruled late in 1993 on the likely full effects of the Mabo decision as Federal and State governments moved to pass competing legislation. The main fallout for the mining industry is a new wave of uncertainty on access to exploration and extractive sites. Some companies have reacted by taking a hard line, few harder than the CRA subsidiary, Comalco. Late in 1993, the company threatened to ditch almost ADollars 2bn worth of expansion if an Aboriginal claim over its bauxite leases at Weipa in northern Queensland was not quickly settled. The immediate impasse was resolved through Federal Government intervention to validate Comalco's leases. But the piecemeal nature of the resolution to what is a pervasive national problem has given mining companies little reason for confidence.</p>

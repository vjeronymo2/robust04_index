			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Phone codes may cost industry Pounds 3bn: Telecom managers association urges Oftel to delay for at least two years proposals on extra digit for numbers CHANGES planned for telephone codes may cost industry more than Pounds 3bn, according to an organisation representing large telephone users. The Telecommunications Managers Association (TMA) has urged Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, to shelve proposals to introduce new codes in spring 1994 for at least two years. Oftel announced last September that all codes would have the digit '1' inserted after the initial '0' to cope with a shortage of telephone numbers, caused by growing competition in telephone services and increased demand for numbers. For example, Birmingham's 021 code would become 0121 while London's 071 and 081 would become 0171 and 0181. Its Pounds 3bn estimate of the cost takes into account modifying - or even scrapping - equipment, reprinting stationery and advertising the change. The TMA's objections have already stopped Oftel from giving final approval for the code change - Oftel's internal estimates put the cost at only Pounds 200m. A national campaign to alert customers, due to have started at the beginning of this month, was postponed at short notice. The delay is worrying parts of the industry. BT, Britain's largest telecommunications group, and the Telecommunications Users' Association, another user group, believe any further delay will give customers even less time to prepare for the change. In addition to the high cost of the planned change, the TMA has told Oftel that it would not even meet the difficulty of a shortage of numbers and that, in a few years, there would be further number changes and yet more disruption. Instead of a wholesale change to codes, it has proposed a stopgap scheme to buy time while Oftel examines whether there is a better long-term solution. The TMA's idea would involve taking codes from rural communities, where there are few users, and reallocating them to the areas with a shortage. Its fears of further disruption are confirmed by the fact that BT has recently put a proposal to Oftel that would involve more than a million customers in five cities changing both their codes and numbers. Numbers in Leeds, Nottingham, Bristol, Sheffield and Leicester would change from six digits to seven, while their current codes would be replaced with prefixes from the series '0111', '0112', '0113'.</p>

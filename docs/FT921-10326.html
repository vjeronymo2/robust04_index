			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / ICI to be salt seller in Pounds 40m mine deal IMPERIAL Chemical Industries abandoned another part of its history in pursuit of modern profit yesterday when it announced the sale of Britain's only salt mine. The mine, at Winsford, Cheshire, dates from 1844. It is being sold to an investor group led by US-based D. George Harris &amp; Associates which is also buying ICI's salt plant at Weston Point, Cheshire. The operations are to be named Salt Union but the new owners hope to avoid the fate of the first Salt Union founded on the site in 1888 with the aim of creating a salt cartel. The first Salt Union flopped, despite raising Pounds 3.7m in what was then the City's largest rights issue. It paid only one ordinary dividend - in 1896 - and after 1898 had an unfortunate habit of passing the preference dividend. It was acquired by ICI in 1937. Told about the chequered history of the Salt Union, Mr William Sichko, vice-president of human resources of the US operations of D. George Harris &amp; Associates, said: 'We'll certainly be aiming to improve on their results. We picked the name, not the legacy.' Although the new company is the largest salt business in the UK, Mr Sichko said there was no intention to emulate the old cartel. The acquisition, which the groups hope to complete by the spring, is not subject to regulatory approval. The modern businesses, unlike their predecessor, are profitable, according to ICI, which will receive Pounds 40m from the US buyer. The operations have an average annual turnover of Pounds 45m. ICI said the salt businesses, which employ about 200 people, fall outside the group's long-term strategy of developing operations in which it has strong global positions. The rock salt mine at Winsford is about 150 feet deep and covers 1,255 acres served by 100 miles of underground roadways. It fulfils two-thirds of the demand for road de-icing salt in the UK. The Weston Point operations supply some white salt for human consumption but most of its output is used by the chemical industry. ICI is acquiring Dow Chemical's brake fluid business in Europe, Africa and the Middle East for an unspecified sum. Dow is buying ICI's coolant businesses in the same regions.</p>

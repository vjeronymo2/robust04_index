			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bog, rk": "Peter Weiss: Coalition and Hungarian </F> Parties Must Consider Whether To Throw the Country's Political  Stability Overboard Because of Emotions"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--Following parliament's failure to  approve the government-sponsored bill on so-called bilingual  signposts, we asked representatives of the government coalition  and a representative of the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement [MKDH] how they assess the nonpassage of the bill and  whether this failure of the government coalition will not affect  the stability of Moravcik's Cabinet.    Peter Weiss, [chairman of the] Party of the Democratic  Left [SDL]: It has become apparent that extremists on both  sides are incapable of reaching a compromise. In its final  form, the bill was in conformity with the most important  objections to the original draft that had come from the  opposition, while, at the same time, respecting the  recommendations of the Council of Europe. After the elections,  the bill will have to be passed anyway in approximately the same  form in which it is now. Preference was given to preelection  tactics because the opposition wants to use the signposts as one  of the main themes in its election campaign. A single vote was  missing for the bill to be passed. The ability to strike a  compromise and to realistically assess the situation should have  been demonstrated also on the part of the Hungarian parties. It  depends on the political judgment of members of the coalition  and also of the MKDH and Coexistence representatives whether  political stability in the country will be thrown overboard  because of the wave of emotions that has artificially arisen in  connection with this law.    Pal Csaky, MKDH: I assess the outcome of the vote  as nonobservance of coalition agreements. Independent Deputy  Kaliska, who is supposed to be a member of the government  coalition, put forward proposals for changes that made the  bill's passage problematic. Even deputies representing the  government parties voted for these changes. The MKDH deputies  all voted in favor of the bill's passage, while three  Coexistence deputies did not endorse it because of the two  proposals for changes made by Mrs. Kaliska. We are going to  raise this problem at a meeting of the Coalition Council, and it  could very well happen that this will be the last meeting of the  Coalition Council for us. It is still premature to say whether  we will continue supporting the government. However, the  nonpassage of the bill will have serious political consequences.    Ludovit Cernak, National Democratic Party:  Personally, I supported the bill because it seemed to be a  compromise and also because Deputy Kaliska's proposals passed,  which prevented the possible defamation [dehonestacia] of the  names of communities named after Slovak national revivalists.  The failure of some deputies of the Hungarian coalition to  support the bill surprised me. Thereby, they actually deprived  themselves of the argument for the Council of Europe that there  was insufficient will in the National Council of the Slovak  Republic to adopt this law.    Jan Carnogursky, Christian Democratic Movement:  The nonpassage of the bill is unfortunate because it has only  made matters even more complicated. Slovakia will have to deal  with it again. Apparently, this will happen only after the  elections. The reason for the failure to pass the bill was, in  my opinion, the exclusion of communities named after Slovak  historical personalities from the bilingual regime. Three  Hungarian deputies did not vote for the bill because of this.  However, some coalition deputies did not vote for it, either.  This will not directly influence the functioning of the  coalition, but it will complicate the government's position.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Management: Change brings results Change management is often viewed sceptically by shareholders, media commentators and employees. But a new survey* of senior American and European executives suggests those at the top are still confident of producing positive results. Roughly two thirds of the 160 or so companies responding to the poll claimed they had made significant progress in getting employees to focus on quality issues, while half reported big strides in boosting productivity and increasing employee awareness of customer needs. Other results, though, were more mixed. Just over half reported an improved share price and better profitability, but only 30 per cent said they had made significant gains in market share. Only one third believed they had been successful in winning employee commitment and in increasing workers' adaptability to change. The survey, by the business organisation The Conference Board, found that most companies began their current round of change management in 1989. More than half said they had made marked changes in their organisation structure, business strategy, and the size and composition of their workforces, while at least half had overhauled their leadership style and company culture. At least 40 per cent had also changed their use of information technology, decision-making styles, basic work processes and reward systems. The difficulty of implementing a new culture and values was cited by 40 per cent of respondents. 'Vision and values now serve as the glue that holds the decentralised organisation together', says the report. *Change management: an overview of current initiatives.

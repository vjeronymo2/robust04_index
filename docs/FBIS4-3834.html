			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Aimed at curbing the  increasingly worsening smuggling activities using fake customs  certificates, seals, and customs officers' signatures since the  beginning of the year, the General Administration of Customs  recently issued a circular calling on customs departments  nationwide to begin cracking down severely on smuggling  activities using the "three fakes."    Since the beginning of the year, customs departments  nationwide have uncovered over 20 major smuggling cases using  the "three fakes." The value of these cases was some 90 million  yuan, or about 35 percent of the total value of cases uncovered  during the same period. Of these, automobiles have become the  main target for smuggling using the "three fakes," as 90  smuggled automobiles were uncovered by customs officials in the  first quarter alone. On 2 March this year, disguised under the  names of three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises, as well as using fake customs' tax reduction and  exemption certificates and seals, illegal elements smuggled into  the country 11 automobiles but were uncovered by Jinan customs  officials in one stroke. Besides automobiles, other goods  uncovered were motorcycles, color television sets, steel  products, and polyester fibers.    It has been learned that gangs who specialize in producing  fake certificates and seals for use in reselling goods for  profits have been uncovered in the society. In smuggling cases  using the "three fakes" uncovered by customs officials in  various localities, illegal elements applied unscrupulous means  to produce various fake customs seals and certificates. A  certain company produced 17 fake copies of "Customs Certificates  for Imported Goods" to obtain the tax-free status by cheating on  32 items, including motorcycles, for resale, and was uncovered  by the Shenyang Customs Department; and a certain company  employee teamed up with others to illegally make two customs  seals as well as 29 books of registration certificates for ship  crews and their goods for resale activities, and was discovered  by the Dalian Customs Department. Further, in the middle of  March, the Kowloon Customs Department discovered the activities  of producing fake customs penalty and confiscation certificates  as well as covering up the illegal sources of goods.    As smuggling activities using the "three fakes" have  seriously sabotaged the normal order of import and export trade,  causing great damages to the country, it is necessary to  severely crack down on such activities. It is understood that  the General Administration of Customs has made specific  arrangements on organization and leadership, key task areas, and  plans of action for local customs officials to severely crack  down on the "three fakes" smuggling activities.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Stanbic unveils rights issue to raise R650m STANDARD Bank Investment Corporation (Stanbic), South Africa's largest banking group by market capitalisation, is raising about R650m (Dollars 232m) through a rights issue which will enlarge the bank's capital base by 10 per cent. Shareholders will be offered 10 new ordinary shares for every 100, at R60 each. The shares closed at R70.50 on Friday, R6.50 off their May peak. Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said that although the group was adequately capitalised for existing regulations, it had always enjoyed excess capital. This had recently dropped due to expenses incurred in setting up a London office and paying Pounds 10m (Dollars 17m) in May for British merchant bank Brown Shipley Holdings. Mr Theron said it was better to go to the market now than be forced to go when circumstances were less favourable. There were no immediate plans for using the cash. He said that in spite of recent turbulence on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange - down 22 per cent from its June peak - there was still investor-appetite for quality equity paper. Stanbic is the most highly-rated of South Africa's main banking groups. It is trading on a price/earnings ratio of 13.7, and with a market capitalisation of R7.5bn is the country's largest bank on this measure. Shareholders holding more than 70 per cent of the issued share capital have said they would follow their rights. Liberty Life will underwrite the balance of the offer. The group is also negotiating to buy the African interests of ANZ Grindlays.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Labour plan for details on pollution A LABOUR government would require industry to give full details of all pollution it emits, Ms Ann Taylor, the party's environment spokesman said yesterday. The flow of information on the environment would also be improved by the setting up of a national inventory of toxic waste emissions. Other proposals included the ending of international trade in toxic waste. Ms Taylor said it was wrong that Britain should be 'a dustbin for other countries'.</p>

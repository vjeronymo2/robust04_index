			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sven Lunsche] </F>   [Text] Capital outflow from South Africa is taking on  mega-proportions. The Reserve Bank discloses in its Quarterly  Bulletin that the net outflow of capital exploded to  R16.3-billion [rand] last year from R3.7-billion in 1992. The  cumulative net outflow since 1985 is now R49-billion.    The bank warns that the outflow could hurt the revival of  economic activity and the attainment of financial stability. It  ascribes the outflows to "political uncertainty, the ongoing  internal unrest, pressure on the rand and the high cost of  borrowing overseas."    The outflow also caused the net gold and foreign exchange  reserves to plunge by R10.3-billion last year, forcing the bank  to seek foreign loans. Figures in the bulletin show that SA  [South Africa] made drawings of R7.1-billion on foreign credit  facilities last year, including the R2.8-billion International  Monetary Fund loan.    On a more positive note, the bank notes that the current  account of the balance of payments improved from R3.9-billion in  1992 to R5.9-billion last year and that foreigners were net  buyers of JSE [Johannesburg Stock Exchange] shares worth  R4.2-billion in 1993.</p>

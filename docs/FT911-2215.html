The London Daily Price for raws was down Dollars 16.50 to Dollars 194 a tonne. In New York raw sugar futures were also sharply down from the start. The May contract, approaching expiry yesterday afternoon, hit a new low of 7.30 cents a lb after midday. Mr Chris Pack, analyst with Czarnikow, the London trade house, said the market was again talking about rumours that Mexico had sold a block of 500,000 tonnes of whites to China over three years.

Yesterday  afternoon, Rose said that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  inquiry could not determine from where the mortar shell  originated. According to Minister Claes, that is not really  relevant. "Obviously I have nothing against an extra inquiry  into who was responsible. But to my mind it no longer has  anything to do with Saturday's incident. Last Friday 10 people  died in a mortar attack for which the Serbs were clearly  responsible. This is a matter of principle: The strangulation  of Sarajevo must be brought to an end. The Serbs must disappear  from the hills around Sarajevo." Foreign Minister Claes's plea  for air strikes against Serbian positions was by far the most  resolute of those heard yesterday. American Defense Secretary  William Perry, who after two days in his new job has already  been forced to make statements about the thorny Bosnia issue,  recalled a few of America's earlier positions. "Air strikes  will certainly be considered," said Perry in Munich, where he  attended a two-day conference on security in Europe. "President  Clinton said that we should not allow Sarajevo to be strangled.  If Saturday's action were to be considered as the strangulation  of Sarajevo, and if we could not do anything about it, then we  would certainly consider firm action, including air strikes."  Claes no longer believes in U.S. declarations. "This is no  longer a purely political problem, but an ethical and moral  problem. The mass murder must stop. Either the Serbs adopt  another attitude, or air forces will have to be sent in. This  is a question of making those guys disappear from the hills. If  they do not want to hear that, then they should feel it. Then  the people in Belgrade might think twice."    According to Claes, the criticism that air strikes will  endanger UN troops on the ground is no reason not to make plans  for air strikes. "Naturally, at the same time measures will  have to be taken to guarantee the safety of UN troops."  Military plans have been drawn up to this effect." Claes  stressed that his viewpoint is nothing new, and the Belgian  Government had already pleaded, before the start of the NATO  summit on 10 January, for air strikes if the warring factions  could not reach a settlement. "I myself have always belonged to  a moderate wing," said Claes. "I am one of those who can be  extremely patient. However, in history there are times when  moral values take priority. There are limits below which people  must not drop, and over the past week we have dropped below  these limits." When the foreign ministers of the Twelve meet  today in Brussels, Sarajevo will undoubtedly be on the agenda.  Minister Claes will not fail to advocate a strong European  position on air strikes. "Following numerous contacts, I am  hopeful that the European Union (EU) will take a vigorous  position," said Claes. "Hopefully it will be of such a nature to  make our NATO partners and the United Nations see the light. In  the meantime, I will support my decision where I can." In this  connection, Claes wanted to urge those EU member states that are  also members of the Security Council to take a European  initiative. "Today again I will try to contact my counterparts  Alain Juppe, Douglas Hurd, and Javier Solana and urge them to  take initiatives in New York in order to convince Butrus  Butrus-Ghali that there is no time left to lose."</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA MAY HIRE CONSULTANT TO LOBBY FOR HOMELESS  </P> <P> Santa Monica, which already spends a third of its social service budget on the  homeless, declines to prosecute them for nonviolent crimes and has entertained  a proposal by one city councilman to let them camp on the City Hall lawn, will  soon make another bid to take a leading role in rallying California cities to  fight homelessness.  </P> <P> At the urging of Mayor Dennis Zane, the city has authorized spending $30,000 to  retain a consultant to organize local governments' support for action at the  state and federal levels.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $30,000 Set Aside  </P> <P> "We don't know that all of this is achievable because we don't know if other  communities, other mayors for example, will be interested in participating,"  said Zane, "but we can find out."  </P> <P> Zane proposed the action Aug. 1 after Gov. George Deukmejian in July vetoed  $116 million in funding for state mental health clinics. Local health officials  said the veto could force eight clinics in Los Angeles County to close. Health  experts, noting that at least 30% of the homeless have a diagnosable mental  disorder, say a shutdown of the clinics would hit the homeless especially hard.  </P> <P> With little debate, the city council set aside $30,000 to hire a lobbyist to  work at the state and national levels to increase funding for homeless-related  programs. But Zane's request was vaguely worded and left details to be worked  out by City Manager John Jalili.  </P> <P> Discussion between the two makes it clear that the mayor envisioned a  homelessness consultant with a much broader role, akin to that of a political  activist. Zane, who helped lead the movement for renters' rights in Santa  Monica, said he proposes "an organizer skilled in bringing people together to  put presure on higher government," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suggestion 'Anecdotal'  </P> <P> "It's politics, not electoral politics, but still politics," the mayor said.  "Cities need to organize politically" to ensure action.  </P> <P> Other council members backed the mayor's plan in general but disagreed over  some details.  </P> <P> "I'm strongly in favor of it, but what I'm not able to say is where you draw  the line between political lobbying and building expertise," said Councilman  David Finkel. Finkel, an ally of the mayor, said he hoped the city could keep  the issue of homelessness apolitical while gathering enough experience to  redirect state priorities toward the issue.  </P> <P> For example, although Zane has suggested that an organizer might coordinate  state mayoral delegations to the governor's office or to Washington to pressure  lawmakers, Finkel called such suggestions "anecdotal" and said the consultant's  principal focus should be on day-to-day functions such as negotiating with Los  Angeles County on coordinating services.  </P> <P> Councilman Herb Katz, who differs with Zane on many issues, voted for the  measure but said lobbying should be a small part of the effort and should be  conducted just at the state level for local concerns.  </P> <P> "I would rather spend the money more at a local level to feed the homeless than  just throw it at a consultant," said Katz. "I'm not sure it's going to make a  dent in Sacramento."  </P> <P> Social-service providers from other nearby communities applauded the Santa  Monica commitment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'An Excellent Idea'  </P> <P> "I think it's an excellent idea," said Jodi Curlee, West Hollywood social  services administrator. "It can only further the goals for regional  coordination."  </P> <P> But an official with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, who  asked not to be named, was skeptical that the consultant could be very  effective with lobbying as the main duty. "It just seems much to me (to expect  that) a full-time person doing nothing but lobbying for the homeless" will  succeed, given the scope of the problem and the extent of work already being  done, he said.  </P> <P> A 1988 survey by the Southern California Assn. of Governments (SCAG) counted  45,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County. Zane has said repeatedly that  homelessness ranked with drug-related crime among concerns at a National  Conference of Mayors meeting in June.  </P> <P> Officials with the California League of Cities, SCAG and Los Angeles County all  said the Santa Monica proposal was, as far as they could determine, unique in  the state.  </P> <P> "There is a critical need today to provide a better solution to the homeless  problem than we've been doing," said Joe Carreras, senior planner for SCAG,  "and if you don't have any leadership, you don't get the darn thing started."  </P></p>

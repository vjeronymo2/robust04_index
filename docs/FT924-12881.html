			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Tax raids add to Bombay stock exchange confusion CONFUSION reigned in scandal-hit Bombay financial markets over the weekend, following income tax raids on leading stockbrokers. Trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange halted on Friday when 250 tax investigators entered 50 brokers' offices, and it was unclear if it would re-open today. Bombay stock market officials said the governing body would meet at 10am to decide. The market was due to be closed today for a regular fortnightly settlement day, but in view of Friday's exceptional closure, some officials felt it would be wrong to have trading suspended for four days in succession. Many brokers believe that, if the tax raids continue, trading will be impracticable. The investigations follow official inquiries into the securities market scandal which erupted in April, causing trading to be suspended for a month. The raids will hit efforts by the government of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to encourage foreign investment in India's financial markets. Tax officials have not publicly explained the raids, but their targets included several brokers alleged to have been implicated in the securities market scandal and one leading Bombay financier. The searches were launched on settlement day, when brokers' offices are full of share documents. Mr MR Mayya, the Bombay Stock Exchange's executive director, said trading would probably not resume today. The raids could undermine investors' confidence for some time. Share prices have been falling steadily as the investigation has dragged on and confidence has waned in the government's ability to carry out promised economic reforms. The Bombay stock market index of leading shares stood at 3,086.45 at Thursday's close, against 3,300 in mid-September. The scandal's political impact could widen amid opposition calls for the resignation of Mr B. Shankaranand, oil and gas minister, who is also chairman of the Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB), a state-owned corporation. According to evidence to a parliamentary committee, the OIDB placed money with banks for investment in the securities markets, in defiance of a government ban on state-owned corporations doing so.</p>

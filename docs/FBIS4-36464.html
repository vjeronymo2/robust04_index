			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under  secretary and director of the President's Office for Political  Affairs, has stated that Egypt is closely watching the situation  in fraternal Yemen out of its concern for the Yemeni people's  interests and the Arab nation's interests in this strategic part  of the Arab homeland. He said that Egypt hopes fighting among  the sons of fraternal Yemen will stop as soon as possible. It  also hopes that the Arab League and UN efforts on this regard  will succeed.    Al-Baz made this statement after receiving Lakhdar Ibrahimi,  envoy of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who later  departed for Sanaa.</p>

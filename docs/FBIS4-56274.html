			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Pro-Venezuela Association [Asociacion  Pro-Venezuela] Board of Directors expressed its full support  today for the executive branch regarding implementation of the  economic and social readjustment plan. The board of directors of  the Pro-Venezuela Association, a Venezuelan nationalistic  organization presided over by former Presidency Secretary Ramon  Espinoza, expressed its solidarity during a visit to President  Rafael Caldera at Miraflores Palace.    In statements to reporter Vicente Briceno, Espinoza said  cited the adopted measures will resolve the economic crisis.    [Begin Espinoza recording] Regarding these policies, we  simply suggested it was convenient to pay part of the internal  debt with the private sector and certain public entities, other  than the Central Bank, with funds from privatization; this would  free up 40 percent of the budget appropriation destined to make  interest payments on the debt. In monetary terms, this  represents approximately 140 billion bolivares, which could be  earmarked for social spending in 1995, and to fill the gap left  over by the tax on bank debits, which will cease to exist on 30  December 1994.    We are calling for the need to revise monetary and financial  policy, particularly regarding interest rates. It is impossible  to reactivate the production sector and bring new investments  with such high interest rates.    We also suggested it is convenient to redirect the problem  of  foreign currency to purchase capital and intermediate goods and  [words indistinct] for production, so we can reactivate the  production apparatus. If we are unable to reactivate the  production apparatus, it would be difficult for banks in general  and the financial sector to recover their capacity for  intermediation and recover their condition as strong  institutions to finance significant projects.

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Spain vetoes KIO charges A MADRID court yesterday refused an application by Grupo Torras, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office, to bring criminal charges against seven former senior executives who had masterminded the KIO's now troubled investment drive in Spain. Judge Miguel Moreiras of Madrid's senior monetary court ruled that the action did not contain 'a single indication' that fiscal crimes had been committed. The judge's decision constituted a sharp reversal for a new Kuwaiti team, headed by Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, which took over the management of both the KIO and Torras midway through last year. In a series of controversial decisions the new management cut off funds to Torras companies and put the holding's big chemical conglomerate, Ercros, into receivership last July. Accusing the former management of an 'apparent misappropriation' of funds, the new team put Torras itself into receivership last month citing losses of Dollars 4bn. Torras lawyers had filed a criminal lawsuit two weeks ago alleging a series of irregularities, including fraud, tax evasion, falsifying public deeds and price manipulation. The lawsuit accused Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the KIO's former chairman and a cousin of the Emir of Kuwait, as well as Mr Fouad Jaffar, the KIO's former general manager, Mr Javier de la Rosa, former deputy chairman of Torras, and four other former senior managers of causing 'fraudulent losses for the company well in excess of Pta100bn (Pounds 577m)'. The judge said that Sheik Fahad, as chairman of the KIO, had express authority from Kuwait's Finance Ministry to manage the office's investments abroad as he saw fit and that the office's Spanish executives had at all times informed the KIO, 'up to the last detail', of investments and disposals conducted by Torras. The ruling seemingly upheld the claims of Mr de la Rosa and others included in the lawsuit that the new KIO management was seeking to settle political scores rather than run the assets under its control.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Dollars 75m investment trust floated to specialise in Brazilian shares THE FIRST investment trust to specialise in Brazilian shares is being floated on the London main market via a placing. The appropriately named Brazilian Investment Trust is trying to raise Dollars 75m (Pounds 42.3m) from institutional investors. Up to 75m shares are on offer in the form of 15m units of five shares with one warrant attached. Each unit is priced at Dollars 5. The trust is being managed by Latin American Securities, which also manages Latin American Investment Trust, the top performing trust of 1991. Latin American Securities is a subsidiary of Foreign &amp; Colonial and it is hoped that the Brazilian trust will be available via F&amp;C's regular savings plan in six to nine months' time. Shares in Latin America surged in 1991 as economic reforms and democratisation swept the continent. Brazil has lagged slightly behind in this process and the economy is expected to show negligible growth in 1992. Nevertheless, its market rose 151 per cent, in dollar terms, last year. Thew trust intends to invest in small and medium sized Brazilian companies, which are expected to benefit as the economy recovers.</p>

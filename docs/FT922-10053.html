			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Nationwide miners' strike urged over closure of pit BRITISH COAL is to close Markham Main, the South Yorkshire pit troubled by an industrial dispute, the corporation said yesterday. The announcement came after a two-month dispute between British Coal and the National Union of Mineworkers over the future of the pit at Armthorpe near Doncaster, which employs 700 men. Mr Arthur Scargill, union president, called yesterday for a national miners' strike in protest at the planned closure. 'I think it's an appalling decision, but not a surprising one,' he said on BBC radio. The dispute started in March after British Coal announced plans to employ private contractors at the mine. Miners at the pit resisted the move and last month won backing from the Yorkshire area of the NUM, which voted by a narrow majority to stage selective strikes in protest at the introduction of contractors. Using contractors was part of a plan to improve profitability at Markham Main, which has lost Pounds 30m over the past five years. British Coal said the pit had lost a further Pounds 1.8m since the dispute began. British Coal argued that only specialised contractors could do the tunnelling work required to switch from the traditional mining methods to a more advanced system. The Yorkshire area of the NUM condemned British Coal's decision, and was angered by the fact that the corporation's representatives walked out of a meeting with unions immediately after announcing the closure. 'The entire meeting, with all its grave consequences for the workforce at Armthorpe, lasted no more than four minutes,' said Mr Ken Homer, general secretary of the Yorkshire area. The closure will leave the Yorkshire area with just 21 pits compared with the 50 it once had. Markham Main will be the first pit to close this financial year, while 15 closed in 1991-92.</p>

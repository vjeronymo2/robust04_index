			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Philips plans Japanese expansion PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group and one of the world's biggest producers of light bulbs, plans to acquire a 70 per cent stake in Kondo Sylvania, the Japanese lighting company, from GTE Sylvania of the US, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The Dutch company, which declined to disclose financial details, said it had already reached agreement with both GTE Sylvania and Kondo Sylvania's minority shareholders. The deal is expected to be completed soon. The purchase will add about Dollars 40m in sales to Philips' annual lighting turnover of Fl 7.4bn (Dollars 4.6bn). It marks the first time Philips will manufacture lighting products in Japan. Until now, the company's Japanese sales comprised exports from Philips factories elsewhere. Kondo Sylvania employs 300 people and specialises in developing, making and marketing halogen lamps, particularly those with professional photo and projection applications such as for film projectors and studio lighting. Philips, a relative latecomer to the fast-growing field of halogen lighting, has succeeded in building its market share in halogen lights for cars, the home and a variety of professional uses. It said Kondo Sylvania's presence in professional photo lighting was a 'very welcome addition' to its product range.</p>

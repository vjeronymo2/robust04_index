			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television In tonight's episode of Cracker (ITV, 9.00), we see Fitz (Robbie Coltrane) taking on hard nut Tina Brien (Susan Lynch), one of the more compelling female roles on television at present. Brilliant acting all round and interesting drama. The Thatcherfest continues this week. In The Incredible Shrinking Politicians (BBC2, 8.30), Martin Jacques investigates the poor standing of politicians not only in the UK but abroad. Bob Geldof, strangely enough, airs his opinions. It is a case of the incredible scarpering cauliflower-cutters on tonight's Cutting Edge: Rich Pickings (C4, 9.00). When the Department of Employment's inspectors arrive down on the vegetable fields of East Anglia and Lincolnshire, dozens of dole-fiddlers run like rabbits. However, it is the crooked gangmasters employing them and growing fat on the pickings who make the harder targets in this film of under-cover operations. On Radio 3, The Marquesa's Memoirs (9.00) run all week. Tim Eastwood talks to the remarkable Marquesa de Cadaval about her memories of Puccini, Ravel, Stravinsky, and dozens more.</p>

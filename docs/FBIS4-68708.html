			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Trosnikov and Yana Mirontseva under the </F> rubric "Foreign Trade": "Leopold Rothschild's Visit to Moscow:  The London Company Will Work in the Interests of a Moscow Bank"]    [Text] In March of this year, the Russian National  Bank signed a 10-year agreement on cooperation in the Russian  stock market with one of the structural subdivisions of the  London banking house, N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons Co, and the  trust  company, Rothschild Trust Corporation Ltd. The first joint  project within the framework of this agreement was the issuance  of bank bills which representatives of the London bank arrived  to present (see yesterday's issue of KOMMERSANT). Yesterday  representatives of the House of Rothschild and their Russian  partners held a press conference devoted to business cooperation  on the Russian capital market.    The plane which brought the English financiers to Russian  land landed on Tuesday evening. Even earlier there were rumors  floating about that the Englishmen had refused the services of  the ninth directorate of the KGB and preferred to hire guards at  one of the Israeli firms. And it was said that almost an entire  planeload of bodyguards would fly to Moscow. However this  information was indignantly denied by the bank's representative,  who reported that the host side would ensure the delegation's  safety.    So the business meetings of the representatives of the House  of Rothschild began on Tuesday, and the schedule was so full  that yesterday's press conference, despite the journalists'  numerous questions, was brief. But even so, the KOMMERSANT  correspondents managed to ask a question which bothers many  people, why a powerful financial group agreed to become a  business partner of a Moscow bank which is not the largest.    "We are very pleased to be working with the Russian National  Bank," the president of the company Rothschild Trust Corporation  Ltd., Leopold Rothschild, clearly did not want to reveal all the  nuances of cooperation with the Russian bankers. According to  him, the Moscow bank was the first to show initiative by  proposing that the Rothschild group participate in issuing bills  and the plan itself proved to be "very practical and  interesting."    Leopold Rothschild emphasized that the agreement on  cooperation in the Russian capital market was signed for 10  years and its prospects largely depend on the success of the  first project. Mr. Rothschild reported that his company's role  in it is minimal. Gold will be bought with the currency  transferred to the trust company's account in the N. M.  Rothschild &amp; Sons Co. bank, and it will be kept in storage  and  sold as needed. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, this plan  has a number of indisputable advantages. Thus, the Russian  National Bank, like most Russian banks which do not have a  license to work with gold, thereby receives the opportunity to  back bills with gold assets. And selling some of the gold will  be sufficient to pay off the bills (the London company will do  this at the bank's instruction) and settle obligations. The only  problem is that after a year (the term of circulation of a  bill), gold may drop in price.    Mr. Rothschild was asked the perfectly logical question of  in  what form the gold is to be bought. For example, will term  contracts be concluded for its delivery? But the head of the  trust company, who had obviously decided to avoid specific  answers when possible, merely said that gold deals would be made  "based on the principle of commercial wisdom" and "with maximum  advantage for the Russian National Bank."</p>

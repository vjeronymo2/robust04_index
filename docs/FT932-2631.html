			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Book Review: Not exactly Elm Street NIGHTMARE ON WALL STREET Salomon Brothers and the Corruption of the Marketplace By Martin Mayer Simon &amp; Schuster, Dollars 23, 256 pages Like many recent books about Wall Street, Martin Mayer's account of the scandal that nearly felled Salomon Brothers in 1991 tries to turn a tale of financial abuse in high places into a metaphor for a decade. The story at the heart of Nightmare on Wall Street is relatively simple. Mayer describes how Paul Mozer, a trader at the powerful US bond house, Salomon Brothers, faked hundreds of millions of dollars in customer bids for US government securities. The trader's bosses, believing Salomon was so powerful it did not have to answer to officialdom, did nothing when informed. Mayer also tells how government agencies supervising the market operated a poorly regulated system open to manipulation. It is an engrossing tale, well told. But Mayer weakens its impact by using it as a stick with which to beat the 1980s, and those on Wall Street who prospered during that much-maligned decade. The book should, thus, be approached with care. The dust jacket, for example, refers to 'masters of the universe' and their 'trophy wives and extravagant personal indulgences', and to a system 'run amok' with young, ruthless traders. Though Mayer cannot bear responsibility for such cliches, he does for passages at the end of the book. He writes: 'Very few of those involved in (the securities) industry in the 1980s . . . contributed to the economy or to their society anything like what they were paid.' How does Mayer know? How do you measure anyone's contribution to an entire economy, or to society? Employees are rewarded for contributing to a company, not to an economy or society. He adds: 'The misallocation of America's resources from the malfunctioning of our financial markets in the 1980s slowed the growth of the nation's productivity and diminished its economic prospects.' There were some spectacular malfunctions in the US in the 1980s (the savings and loan crisis and the 1987 stock market crash among them), but to suggest that an entire decade of work on Wall Street - work that fuelled one of the strongest periods of economic expansion in US history - retarded the country's growth is an exaggeration. Although Mayer ends with an attack on the 1980s, the bulk of the book is a history of Salomon, and its role in the US financial markets. He is a more than capable guide for the firm's journey from the earliest days of the three brothers - Arthur, Percy and Herbert - to the gung-ho trading heroics of the 1980s under John Gutfreund, the once all-conquering chairman whose downfall was precipitated by the 1991 scandal. The most compelling section reveals how the management of Salomon deteriorated under Gutfreund, a master salesman and trader but a hopeless manager. Mayer tells how key issues at Salomon - from capital allocation to employee compensation - were left to be decided by the whim of senior executives or by cut-throat competition between department heads. At times, Mayer's account is confusing. He argues that it stretches credulity to swallow the official Salomon version of the story - that Paul Mozer was acting alone - yet he paints a convincing portrait of Mozer as a solitary, highly competitive trader eager to gain revenge on the US Treasury for its restrictions on his bidding activities. Nightmare on Wall Street is a worrying tale of how one firm (or one trader, depending upon which version you believe) can so easily abuse its dominant position in a market. A source of greater worry is Mayer's contention that nothing decisive has been done by the government to improve surveillance of the world's biggest market in light of the Salomon scandal.</p>

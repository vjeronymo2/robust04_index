			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nadezhda Garifullina feature comprising statements by </F> Mikhail Poltoranin, "Russia's Choice" State Duma deputy, and  Viktor Stepanov, Federation Council deputy and chairman of the  Republic of Karelia Supreme Soviet: "Question to Deputies:  What Do You Think of the President's Message?"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Regions Will Save Russia </H5>   Mikhail Poltoranin, "Russia's Choice" State Duma deputy:    It seems to me that on this occasion the president tried,  like never before, to analyze the current situation in the  country in depth. For some people this seemed to be a departure  from the reforms policy, for others there seemed to be nothing  new in the message, and still others said there were more  statements than proposals in it. I, having an insider's  knowledge of everything and following the president's thoughts  step by step, can see that the report proved to be difficult for  the president and I would say that he came out with it too late  -- he should have made it two years ago.    Without boasting and claiming more for myself than I should,  I can say that I said similar things at Russian Government and  Presidium sessions in February-March 1992. I said then: There  are two ways of converting to a market economy. One way is to  open the sluice gates, but we have to determine how much we can  open them. Here, having worked out a program of structural  restructuring for industry and created a modern doctrine for the  Russian Armed Forces, leaving part of the military-industrial  complex's plants under this doctrine and the international arms  market -- let us say about 40 percent, with 60 percent  undergoing conversion, an effective tax policy program would  have to underpin all that which would stimulate the productive  forces' development. This is what "opening the sluice gates"  meant.    Then there is the second model -- you blow up the dam, that  is there is a chaotic transition to market economics. You blow  up the dam, pressure is released, and absolutely everything is  washed away -- be it useful or not, then you sort everything  out. At that time I warned that if we started down the second  path -- and we did actually start down the second path and blew  the dam -- we would just the same be forced to follow the first  model after a couple of years, but by that time we will be  swallowing or being swallowed up by the mire we have gotten  into. In principle this is what has happened. But Gaydar is  not guilty of this. Gaydar was in general in agreement with  this level of regulation back then, but he lacked a team. Those  people who criticize Gaydar today -- Shokhin and others -- are  culpable precisely because they did not manage to carry out the  modeling while they occupied key posts. Several models should  have been demonstrated, then we should have forecast where we  would be, and only then should we have acted.    But everything happened as God had ordained it. The  president was to bring into the government more people from the  provinces...but he gave in to pressure from Shokhin's team --  they said that they would not accept anybody into the  government, their team, then this government in general began to  represent a sect. This factional policy gradually led to what we  have today.    I fear very much that the president's speech will serve as a  kind of sign that we should reject the reforms and go into  reverse. This is no longer possible as going into reverse is  suicide for Russia, a path back to where we have come from. I  do not call this system totalitarian or anything else. It was  simply a system where the flywheel of the cost-led economy  turned with terrible force, sucking all the strength out of  people and using up all natural resources and so on. But it is  our misfortune that this flywheel continues to turn today.  People work but they are told: We will not pay your wages.  But his cannot happen! It might end in an outburst.  Therefore, the government has today been forced to turn on the  printing presses, turn on the currency-issuing mechanism, and  put out the flames. But, by switching on the currency-issuing  mechanism, the government, the Central Bank, and our authorities  in general are beginning to provoke hyperinflation. As the  saying goes, go left and you'll lose your horse; go right and  you'll lose your life. The government is in this most difficult  of positions today.    I consider that we have no alternative route today. In  order to survive, we will certainly have to jettison our gold  and diamond reserves, and we will possibly have to sell several  sources of major concessions to save the country from the threat  of impending disaster.    The most important thing -- which I also mentioned two years  ago -- is that we should devolve some functions of the federal  authorities to the regional level. We should not give them  political power but economic power, power of management.  Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the the apparatus in Moscow  by a factor of 25-30 and send it there. Then the regions will  save Russia for us, I assure you. [Poltoranin ends]   <H5>    Specific Steps Awaited </H5>   Viktor Stepanov, Federation Council deputy and chairman of  the Republic of Karelia Supreme Soviet:    In his speech the president only set out the points in his  message to the Federal Assembly. Even a cursory analysis of the  message's 100-page text shows that the proposals in this  document with regard, among other things, to problems of the  economic reform, strengthening federalism, and the development  of the market go much further here than in the form they were  presented in the Kremlin.    The president called on society for reconciliation and  accord  in 1994; however, without the economy becoming revived, that is  revived and not stabilized, inasmuch as protectionism is  required at the level of surgical intervention, Russia's economy  cannot be saved. If there are still discount-credit rates of  more than 200 percent from the Central Bank, if the attitude  toward rural areas is still so irresponsible -- after all the  peasants have not yet been paid the astronomical debt of 3  trillion due them -- it will hardly be possible to talk of  reviving the economy.    Frankly, I expected more precise and specific targets for  the  government with regard to the economy's revival in the  president's speech. In particular, there should, in my opinion,  have been a statement about the undesirability of changing  prices for energy sources this year, because our producers --  whatever form of ownership they enjoy -- will not manage to get  used to the new prices.    The president went on to emphasize in his message that the  tax burden is fairly large and that it is necessary to change  taxation policy. But again, logic would dictate that specific  steps should be initiated by the president himself; after all,  as recently as 22 December he signed an edict which actually  proposes raising taxes for producers -- whatever form of  ownership they enjoy -- and simply makes them bankrupt. In the  context of enterprises becoming bankrupt, and thousands of  workers simply beginning to live by begging, it will, perhaps,  be very difficult to talk of national accord.</p>

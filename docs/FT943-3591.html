			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Digital seeks to ease fears over its future Digital Equipment, the troubled US computer manufacturer, plans to announce a comprehensive new technology strategy within two months. The aim is to reassure customers and financial analysts concerned about the group's future in the light of four consecutive years of losses. For the fiscal year to end-June 1994, the company reported net losses of Dollars 2.16bn after restructuring charges, against a fiscal 1993 loss of Dollars 251m, and revenues of Dollars 13.4m, down 6 per cent on 1993. The plan will complement the restructuring strategy put in place earlier this year by Mr Robert Palmer, chief executive, which is expect-ed to lead to some 20,000 job losses, reducing the workforce to less than 60,000 people. Mr Enrico Pesatori, head of the computer systems division which is the largest part of Digital's operations, said that the new strategy would be made public by the middle of November. The chief element is expected to centre on Digital's new technology, a family of microprocessors called Alpha, generally recognised as one of the world's most powerful microprocessors. Digital has tied its future largely to the success of Alpha, but so far the chip has failed to dominate the market in the way the company had expected. Alpha is based on reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology and competes with similar devices from IBM, Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics, as well as with microprocessors sold by Intel, the leading semiconductor manufacturer. Digital's top management agrees that the next two years will be critical for Alpha, which they accept has proved to be ahead of its time. Their worry is that their lead with Alpha will be lost as Intel improves its Cisc processors. Last week Digital unveiled the latest Alpha processor, the first capable of carrying out 1bn instructions a second and up to five times faster than competing microprocessors. Critics argue that the company has been rash to place so much reliance on a single technology. Mr Pesatori said, however, that sales of Alpha technology reached Dollars 1bn last year and were growing at a rate of 100 per cent a year. Acceptance of Alpha in the market remains the main problem. Digital's recent decision to sell its stake in Olivetti has been attributed partly to the Italian company's failure to sell more Alpha-based systems. Mr Pesatori said the company's investment in Alpha designs would carry it through to the first years of the next century while its investment in manufacturing facilities for the chip could be defrayed by alliances with other manufacturers anxious to make use of the latest process technology. He said there had been a significant improvement in Digital's financial performance. Revenues for the current quarter were ahead of the recovery plan and he expected to break even by the end of the year. The company would be profitable by the end of the second quarter next year.</p>

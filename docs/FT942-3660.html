			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Stars in first beauty contest focus on union concerns Mr Tony Blair sketched out a surprisingly detailed domestic programme for Labour, Robert Taylor writes. He pledged himself to the objective of re-establishing full employment, to a national minimum wage on 'economic as well as moral grounds' to help low-paid workers, and to a new partnership between unions and employers so that 'social justice and economic efficiency could go hand-in-hand'. Specific commitments in his speech included: signing up to the social chapter of the European Union as soon as Labour came to office; giving the same legal rights to part-time workers as to full-time workers; abolishing by law employer blacklists of workers; returning trade unionism to the government's communications centre at Cheltenham; and giving all workers the right to belong to a trade union, with legal recognition for trade unions where a substantial number of workers wanted it. These detailed pledges pleased the delegates and indicated that Mr Blair, in spite of the views of some of his modernising supporters, is keen to meet trade union demands. Mr Blair received warm applause from the delegates - though not a standing ovation - as he called for Britain's 'national renewal' and the creation of a 'strong, united society' based on 'bonds of social solidarity'. Mr Blair added there must be a 'business plan for Britain' with an emphasis on encouraging industrial investment, the creation of regional development agencies and a new bank to help industry. Increasingly confident as his speech developed, Mr Blair also called for a comprehensive nursery education and childcare system so that every woman could be free to work if she wanted to. He received loud applause for a passionate commitment to the National Health Service and said Labour was now the party of law and order.</p>

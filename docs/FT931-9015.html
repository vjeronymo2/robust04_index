			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Siemens energy unit sees 5% rise in profits MR ADOLF Huttl, chairman of KWU energy division of Germany's Siemens industrial group, expects profits to grow by 5 per cent for the current fiscal year, in spite of a drop in orders for the first quarter. The group, which builds nuclear and traditional power plants, recorded sales of DM6.6bn (Dollars 3.97bn) for the year to September 30, 1992, up 32 per cent from DM5bn the previous year. Orders reached DM8.6bn against DM8.8bn the year before. Exports rose significantly over the previous year to DM3.8bn against DM2.7bn in 1991. Foreign orders accounted for 43 per cent of total orders compared with 34 per cent the year before. The US share of orders increased to 22 per cent, from 9 per cent of the total figure. In October, 1992, KWU operations in the US were regrouped under the Siemens Power Corporation. Orders from Asia increased to 36 per cent of the total from 34 per cent. This was largely due to KWU's biggest contract which is a 817MW unfired combined cycles power plant in Nan Pu in Taiwan. KWU is also building large power plants in India and Indonesia. A third of KWU's sales come from its nuclear-related business and two-thirds from its production of conventional power plants. This nuclear share of the group has been steadily declining over the years. Mr Huttl also launched a bitter attack against the recent creation of a Dollars 700m fund by the G-7 group to study ways to make nuclear power stations in the former communist bloc safer. He called the amount 'negligible' and said billions of dollars were needed. In Bonn, the environment ministry defended the plan, saying the money was only a first step which would allow studies to be conducted and high-risk nuclear power stations to be identified.</p>

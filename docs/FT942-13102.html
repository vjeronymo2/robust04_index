			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Bonds volatility 'defies realities' Recent turbulence in world bond markets seemed more a reaction to myths than to realities, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said yesterday. The volatility was hard to explain partly because financial markets were not necessarily governed by logic, he told the American Council on Germany in New York. Financial transactions had come uncoupled from the real economy. 'In addition to cyclical factors the underlying reason may have been a rise in inflationary expectations, especially in the US. But that does not say anything as to whether that rise has been justified.' In any case, the scale of the response was out of proportion to the relatively modest changes in economic prospects, Mr Tietmeyer added. Noting that 'markets sometimes over-react', he suggested that other factors such as more activist portfolio managers and the widespread use of derivatives might have contributed to the volatility. Although the Bundesbank has shown increasing concern over the implications of free-for-all activity in financial market derivatives, Mr Tietmeyer's comments were relatively restrained. Globalisation trends in capital markets, cross-border investments' rising share of assets under management and other factors might increase the potential for volatility, he said. There was no need for panic, but learning to live with the new situation implied a need to understand market behaviour and analyse risks for the banking system. This did not require legislation, but market transparency and disclosure requirements had to be improved and 'risky activities' of institutions had to be underpinned by adequate capital, Mr Tietmeyer proposed. The best way to avoid distortions of competition was through international co-ordination. Although he suspected he might be accused of 'carrying coals to Newcastle', Mr Tietmeyer felt obliged to bring up some of the adverse consequences which had accompanied globalisation and liberalisation of capital markets. These included the 'bubble' or surge in asset prices in some countries which was later to collapse. Even small changes in capital flows could have profound effects on foreign exchange and capital markets, let alone the massive speculation in Europe in the last two years which led to a shake-out of the European Monetary System.</p>

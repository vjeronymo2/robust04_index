			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY TO PAY $150,000 TO KIN OF MAN POLICE SHOT  </P> <P> The Santa Ana City Council agreed Monday to pay $150,000 to the family of a  robbery suspect who was fatally shot in the back by a Santa Ana police officer  last year.  </P> <P> The council voted 6 to 1 in a closed session to settle a lawsuit filed by the  family of Ernest Henry Nunez. Nunez took a single shotgun blast to the back on  Sept. 20, 1989, after he ignored a police officer's order to stop running,  police said. Nunez, 31, died five hours later.  </P> <P> His three children, who range from 10 to 13 years old, witnessed the shooting.  Nunez was not carrying a weapon, police said. The district attorney's office  ruled in February that there had been no criminal wrongdoing by police in the  case.  </P> <P> Mayor Daniel H. Young said the city decided to settle the suit to avoid a trial  and also the possibility that more would be owed to the family.  </P> <P> "We wanted to protect the police officer from the agony of a trial," Young  said.  </P> <P> Councilman Richards L. Norton said he voted against the settlement because he  thought the amount was too much. Norton said that an internal police  investigation showed that the officer had fired at Nunez because he thought the  man was armed.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police said Nunez had five drug and burglary convictions in Orange  County dating to 1977.  </P> <P> "The city attorney said he (Nunez) was a drug addict and was arrested several  times," Norton said. "He was less than a successful member of society. I don't  want to pay out good, hard-earned taxpayers' dollars like this."  </P> <P> Nunez was suspected of robbing a clothing store in Orange, where his wife,  Rosie, worked, two weeks before the shooting. There, according to police, he  tied up his wife after she refused to give him money to buy drugs and fled with  about $3,000 from the cash register.  </P> <P> Police then placed the Nunez house in Orange under surveillance shortly after  the robbery. The night of the shooting, police were following Nunez, who was in  the family car as it traveled into Santa Ana. When Nunez realized that he was  being trailed, police said, he tried to flee and was shot.  </P> <P> Rosie Nunez filed the suit against the Santa Ana police last year. In the suit,  she asked for more than $400,000 in damages.  </P> <P> In an interview Monday night, Nunez said the money that she will receive in the  settlement. will pay for her children's education.  </P> <P> "The money is not going to bring him back, and it's not going to compensate us  much after all we have been through," Rosie Nunez said. "But it's enough right  now to get back on our feet."  </P></p>

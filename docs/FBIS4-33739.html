			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Cesar Gaviria with </F> unidentified moderator and unidentified reporters in Neiva;  broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] [Gaviria] ...all of the region's infrastructure was  completely destroyed and many, many people are homeless. They  have received some attention, but I am still worried about them.  We are obliged to provide them with much better attention. I am  going to work on that. The minister will remain at the site and  I will return tomorrow to make sure we provide whatever support  is needed for these people to receive better attention, so they  can get more timely attention from the Colombian Government. We  need to reinforce the logistics for each task. To this end, the  generals of the Armed Forces and the ministers who came here  with me, will stay on top of the situation to ensure that those  displaced get more timely assistance in these coming days.    [Reporter] Mr. President, you made a direct commitment to  aid  the people here with housing, roads, and so on. Have you spoken  with them?    [Gaviria] No. These people feel very bad, they are so very  distressed about the general situation and because of the panic  they experience from the continuing tremors, that no one wants  to talk about rebuilding yet. This morning we spoke briefly  about rebuilding roads and bridges. The acting manager and the  person in charge of housing subsidies at the Agricultural Bank  are here, the manager of the Presidency Social Emergency Fund  and all the officials who have some responsibility concerning  these events are also here. The governors have assessed the  general situation, and we will be able to begin reconstruction  work in a few days. Today and during the coming days our  assistance must focus on making sure they all have shelter,  food, medical attention, and some sort of social support. That  is the priority task now.    [Monitor] A question from "QAP Newcast."    [QAP reporter] Mr. President, this morning you spoke about  the need for international aid. After having assessed the  situation, what would you ask the international community to  provide?    [Gaviria] Basically what I asked for this morning. More than  aid for this specific moment to assist the homeless, for food,  or to give these families some warmth, we will need support in  rebuilding the region, because the great majority of homes in  the region were destroyed or severely damaged; not one single  bridge is standing along any of the roads here, which leaves the  region completely isolated; and the cost of rebuilding this  region will be very high, very high [repeats himself]. Some  places, where there used to be several corregimientos or towns,  were buried by the landslides. There we must relocate the  people. There are other places where the people will not want to  go back because of the extensive landslides. The people in  Belalcaza closed the town and fled to the nearby hills and now  refuse to return. Many of them will probably not want to live  there any more. The same happened in Irlanda, where the people  abandoned the few homes and community areas left undamaged and  probably will not want to go back.    [Moderator] Juan Carlos Matheus from Radio Caracol.    [Matheus] Are there any plans to create a fund to aid the  people with education, housing, and health care, to prevent the  government's effort from being lost?    [Gaviria] We are going to give all the victims subsidies. We  will be offering housing subsidies to help all those who no  longer have homes. However, that is not the priority job today.  We cannot distract the people with that, because they are still  in shock. They are still rescuing their injured, and we have  hardly begun to set up tent sites and provide medical attention.  We will not be able to talk to them about reconstruction efforts  for a few days yet. We cannot even begin to talk about  relocation. Many of these people will not want their homes to be  in the same place they were before, because of the high risk.    [Moderator] Juan Pablo Diaz with the last question.    [Diaz] Mr. President. It is logical to say that  reconstruction work on all these roads and towns will not be  complete before you leave office in two months. How can you  commit the incoming government to complete this task?    [Gaviria] I trust we will be able to establish a  construction  plan and leave with it already under way, using the funds from  the government, the budget, housing subsidies, Social Emergency  Funds, and the aid we are sure to receive from abroad. Obviously  the incoming government will still have a responsibility to  complete this effort and we are all sure they will.</p>

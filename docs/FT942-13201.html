			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Discount for PTT private investors Shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch telecom and postal group which is being partially privatised in June, will be offered to private investors at a 5 per cent discount to the price paid by institutional investors. Private investors will also be given preferential treatment in the allocation of shares. The Dutch state and ABN Amro, the lead manager of the issue, said yesterday that the 5 per cent discount will apply to allotments of up to 75 shares. The price of the shares and the exact timing of the issue have not yet been disclosed. In practice the 5 per cent discount will mainly benefit Dutch private investors, as private investors in many other parts of Europe will be barred from taking part by local laws and regulations. The shares will not be sold in the retail markets in the US or Japan. Roadshows, mainly in Europe and the US, will take place in the second half of March, the bank said. The government is expected to sell an initial stake of around 30 per cent in a transaction which analysts estimate will be worth at least Fl 5bn (Dollars 2.62bn). The flotation will be the largest in Dutch history.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Clinton aims to ease Israel-Syria deadlock President Bill Clinton's brief visit today to Damascus, only the second undertaken by a US leader in 20 years, is rich in symbolism. But, as he stressed yesterday, it may prove light on substantive moves to resolve enduring differences between Israel, seeking a full peace with its neighbour, and Syria, which wants a full return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in exchange. 'I expect we will make some progress to narrow the gap,' Mr Clinton said of today's talks with President Hafez al-Assad, Syria's leader. 'But I do not expect it to produce a dramatic breakthrough.' Expectations for Mr Clinton's visit are running high in Damascus. 'There's a popular feeling here that this could unjam things. The average Syrian seems to believe this trip is about the most significant thing that could happen just now,' a western diplomat in Damascus said. Diplomats say the Syrians hope Mr Clinton may come bearing some Israeli concession on the Golan, or may grant Mr Assad a long-sought bilateral concession, such as erasing Syria from the list of states viewed in Washington as sponsors of terrorism. Mr Clinton has indicated neither is likely. 'Terrorism is still an issue between our two countries,' he said yesterday. 'But the most successful way to end terrorism in this part of the world is to have a comprehensive peace'. His implicit message in visiting Mr Assad seems to be that such prizes as removal from the terrorist list and further improvements in US-Syrian relations can come, but only once the peace with Israel is sealed. Mr Clinton's arrival in Damascus, a late addition to a regional swing built around yesterday's Jordan-Israel peace ceremony, will be received in Syria as the greatest possible acknowledgment of Mr Assad's regional stature and Syria's importance to any lasting peace. 'The symbolism of that cannot but help, even if it will not on its own produce the goods,' a diplomat said. The trip will also underline what the tireless Middle East shuttling of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has made plain: that the US will act as guarantor for any Syrian deal with Israel. Damascus, ever wary of negotiating alone and directly with Jerusalem, has always needed this assurance, adding to it repeated demands that Washington lean more heavily on its Israeli ally. 'The US should ..take stands that put more pressure on Israel to push the peace process,' Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's foreign minister, said recently. Mr Clinton's trip will affect the atmosphere surrounding the Syrian-Israeli talks, the real progress of which both sides, aided by the supremely tight-lipped Mr Christopher, have kept under wraps. It comes amid ground-breaking gestures from Syria suggesting the climate for these talks is warming. Mr al-Sharaa recently gave an unprecedented interview to Israeli television. He also met US Jewish leaders during a recent US trip. The most tangible result of Mr Clinton's visit, diplomats say, could be for him to express Syria's ultimate willingness to embrace a full peace with Israel, and what that peace would entail, more explicitly than Mr Assad is so far prepared to do publicly. Possibly, Mr Clinton may be able to announce plans for eventual direct talks between Mr al-Sharaa and Mr Shimon Peres, his Israeli counterpart, a direct encounter long sought by the Israelis. Otherwise, the substance of Israeli-Syrian negotiations will continue under US auspices and through further US shuttles in and out of Damascus. Egyptian officials and some diplomats in the region believe these talks may be only months away from a basic agreed deal. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak has spoken of a deal by Christmas. If so, then Mr Assad and Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin may be awaiting the most propitious timing to make the political moves to clinch agreement. Mr Assad's desire for a 'durable, comprehensive peace' makes it unlikely he would commit himself to a deal with Israel if that with the Palestinians looked to be failing.</p>

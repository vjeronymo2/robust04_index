			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Sharp rise in Pakistani shares SHARES on the Karachi Stock Exchange yesterday recorded their highest rise on any single day this year, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The KSE-100 index rose 44.63 to close at 1399.68. The surge came amid expectations that last Thursday's devaluation of the rupee would improve textile profits by boosting exports. Almost a third of the 652 companies on the KSE are in textiles, which have suffered heavy losses over the past year. The market was also lifted by confidence in Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former vice president of the World Bank who became interim prime minister a week ago.</p>

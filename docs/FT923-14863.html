			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hafnia to relaunch rights issue HAFNIA HOLDING, which controls Denmark's second largest insurance group, S said it had asked the Copenhagen Bourse to be allowed to launch its postponed DKr2bn (Dollars 344m) rights issue and lift this week's two-day suspension of trading in its shares with effect from Monday morning, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. Hafnia said investigations would continue over the weekend into irregular option transactions by a now dismissed senior manager, which sparked this week's crisis in the company. Hafnia suspended trading in its shares on the Copenhagen bourse on Thursday along with postponing the share offering planned to start that day after discovering irregularities in an options deal. The deal obliged Hafnia to redeem DKr288m for shares in Interbank, a small but successful Copenhagen niche bank, owned by Brondby Football Club. Hafnia said its directors were unaware of the transaction. Hafnia said investigations would continue throughout the weekend and that if any further irregularities came to light an announcement would be made to the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and further action taken.</p>

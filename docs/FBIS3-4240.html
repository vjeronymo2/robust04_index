			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 26 (CNS) -- A survey conducted by  the Institute of Economics of the State Planning Commission on  differences in the consumption pattern between the urban and  rural areas showed that a consumption gap had taken place,  having an adverse effect on the growth of the national economy.  It has also caused serious idle productivity in the consumer  goods industry as well as heavy stockpiling of finished  products. The survey called for the early adoption of effective  measures to coordinate economic development in urban and rural  areas with the eventual aim of solving the growing serious  economic contradictions between the urban and rural areas.    The report revealed that from 1979 to 1984 when rural income  increased to a great extent, purchases of expensive consumer  goods including watches, bicycles, sewing machines, radio sets  and black-and-white television sets showed a sharp gain. Urban  income has since 1985 posted a rise and continued to grow at a  rate higher than in rural areas. A shopping spree for  high-grade consumer goods took place. Consumption of expensive  items tended to go further in urban areas after 1988, but most  consumers in rural area saw their consumption capability lagging  behind their urban counterparts mainly because of their slow  gain of income, thereby constituting a gap between the urban and  rural areas regarding consumption patterns.    The survey indicated that the per capita net income in rural  areas was RMB [Renminbi] 784 in 1992. When taking into  consideration price fluctuation, the rural income was equivalent  to RMB 454.49 as it was in 1980 and to RMB 431.77 after taking  into account a reduction of five percent from the income for  expansion of production. It then struck a balance with the  urban income of RMB 439.4 as it was in 1980. Judging from the  figure, the current consumption capability in rural areas is  just the same as that in the urban areas in the early stages of  reform. This means that the rural areas have lagged behind for  12 years when compared with the urban areas in terms of  consumption capability. The report suggested that the  authorities should adopt measures to narrow the gap.</p>

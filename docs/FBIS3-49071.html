A correspondent of Serbian  Banja Luka Television today reports about fierce internecine  Muslim fighting. The news is that Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  forces have launched a seemingly successful counteroffensive.    [Unidentified Banja Luka TV correspondent] Following fierce  attacks by artillery and infantry, members of the 5th Corps of  the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army today inflicted this  year's first defeat on the autonomist army. In fighting that  continued all last night and this morning, Alija Izetbegovic's  soldiers seized all strategically important sites around  Pecigrad in the municipality of Cazin, shifting their lines by 1  km toward Velika Kladusa, a town in which around 1,000 citizens  of Pecigrad found shelter before the onslaught of Izetbegovic's  killers today.    Internecine Muslim fighting also took place near Buzim  today,  where the combatants of the 5th Corps occupied the villages of  Sestanovci and Marjanovici. Both sides have reported dozens of  casualties. [passage omitted]</p>

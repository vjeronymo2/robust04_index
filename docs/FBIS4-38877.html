			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Here Is the News" rubric: </F> "Miners Striking Again"]    [Text] Miners in the Baykal and Transbaykal areas stopped  mining and dispatching fuel to consumers yesterday. With the  exception of workers at two opencut mines, the 20,000-strong  collective of the "Vostsibugol" joint-stock company is insisting  on immediate payment of debts which now amount to approximately  170 billion rubles [R]. The principal debtors are power  industry workers, specifically in Khabarovsk and Maritime Krays.  However, the list of demands put forward by the miners is  topped by an appeal to the Russian Federation Government, which  they say should allocate funds to pay off debts of R69 billion  run up by budget-financed and other organizations    In accordance with a statement made by Vladimir Solomin,  chairman of the joint-stock company strike committee, the strike  action is scheduled to last for three days and also has a  political angle: The East Siberian miners are demanding the  resignation of the government and early presidential elections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shell Factory Dispatched to Turkey"] </F>   [Text] In the middle of January, a complete weapons  factory produced by the German-Dutch defense company Eurometaal  was transported by truck from Liebenau in Lower Saxony to  Turkey. The factory is to be assembled in Kirikkale by German  and Turkish specialists and is to be used for the production of  large caliber artillery shells that have a splinter effect. The  Economics Ministry, which is responsible for authorizing such  exports, only approved the export of the factory to the  Netherlands. As recently as 1992, the Bonn-based Federal  Security Council rejected an application from the Eurometaal  subsidiary in Liebenau to export 18,000 special shells to  Turkey. The main reason was that it could not be ruled out that  the ammunition would be used against Kurdish rebels.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Swedes go on strike as wage challenge grows THOUSANDS of Swedish electrical workers went on strike yesterday as a rift between labour unions and employers over wage bargaining structures threatened a rash of industrial action. The strike underlined the decline of the country's consensus system of industrial relations. The strike may provoke a lockout by employers of up to 20,000 workers if the dispute is not resolved by tomorrow. More than 1,000 workers in the food processing industry also began a strike on Thursday. Union leaders said an overtime ban by 400,000 engineering workers, more than 11,000 newspaper industry workers and hundreds of caretakers and cleaners would begin on Monday if agreements on this year's wage round were not reached by then. Action by engineers would hit companies such as Volvo and SKF, the big roller bearing maker, both struggling to recover from recession-induced losses. At the heart of the disputes is an effort by employers to dismantle the traditional system of centralised wage agreements and shift wage bargaining to individual companies and plants. Already the old system of a guideline package agreed between SAF, the national employers organisation, and the LO trade union confederation has been abandoned. But the unions want to preserve a system of base agreements within separate industrial sectors, rather than devolving negotiations to individual companies, and are demanding general in - creases for lower paid workers.</p>

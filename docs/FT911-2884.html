			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: Hard to pay - costly to borrow Sir, Further to R. Bradley's letter (April 19), may I add Access to the list of UK financial institutions which have not yet come to terms with 'abroad'? While UK Access statements are apparently sent through the post, those going abroad are sent via a mailing company, and there is invariably a considerable time lag between the date of a statement and its arrival here. Although I send off a cheque at once, I have on some occasions been charged interest which I have not incurred. Repeated correspondence requesting that this be remedied and my statement be sent through the post has produced very evasive replies, plus the suggestion that I ask someone in England to settle payments for me 'during your temporary absence from England'. I have now been living in Germany for nearly 20 years and am astonished that someone at Access in Southend appears to know what my plans are. At the very least, I detect disapproval of my being so unpatriotic as to live elsewhere, and perhaps this is the misdemeanour for which l am being charged interest?

Seishu  Miyazato, Japan Communist Party member of the Prefectural  Assembly, also asked Takayama to stop the live-shelling  exercises.    Yamakawa and his party protested the prefectural  government's  proceeding with construction work for the P3C communications  station. They criticized the prefectural government for this,  saying: "We cannot permit the construction of a new military  base. Sneaky construction work amounts to a betrayal. I hope  you work harder to realize the governor's peace ideals."    Protesting the U.S. Forces' live-shelling exercises,  Miyazato  said: "The prefectural assembly has repeatedly asked that such  exercises be stopped. The discontinuation of the exercises is  the consensus of the Okinawan people." He asked the prefectural  government to take measures concerning this problem. Takayama  replied that he plans to petition for stopping the exercises  with the U.S. Forces Okinawa, the U.S. Consulate, and the Naha  Defense Facilities Administration Bureau shortly.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Books: Renaissance man remembers - The curious double life of Ernst Gombrich A LIFELONG INTEREST: CONVERSATIONS ON ART AND SCIENCE by EH Gombrich and Didier Eribon Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 14.95, 191 pages THOSE who are familiar with the writings of Sir Ernst Gombrich, Professor Emeritus in the University of London, will know that he favours two distinct kinds of title for the collections of essays and lectures he has published since he came to England in January 1936. Here are some examples of what may be called Gombrich's binary title-form: Ideals and Idols, Norm and Form, Means and Ends, Art and Illusion, The Image and the Eye. And here are some of the other form, the purely descriptive: The Story of Art, The Sense of Order, Meditations on a Hobby Horse, Topics of Our Time - to which must be added the present book, A Lifelong Interest. The title this time refers to his lifelong interest in art history. It is the more descriptive titles that are usually given by Gombrich to the collections of his papers that do not have a unifying theme but range over a miscellaneous field of learned inquiry. If the Italian Renaissance is a continuing interest of his, it co-exists with a host of others, from the art of ancient Egypt to contemporary abstract painting, from the nature of perception to the decline of general knowledge, from Goebbels to Malraux. The present volume - a series of tape-recorded interviews with a French journalist - is the most heterogeneous of them all. Didier Eribon, who has done a similar book of conversations with Levi-Strauss, has elicited much interesting diverse material from his interviewee. The exchanges start with some biographical information, where Gombrich looks back upon his youth, and then deal at length with many of the recurring preoccupations of his writings. Questions that frequently crop up in his books such as how 'innocent' - innocent of pre-conditioning - is the eye that the spectator brings to a painting, are addressed again here, and second thoughts are sometimes voiced by this least bigoted of scholars. He was born in 1909 in Vienna. Though his parents were of Jewish origin he had the same classically-oriented general education as his gentile contemporaries. Gombrich tries to deflate the myth of Vienna as 'the birthplace of every modern movement', but he is soon forced to admit reluctantly that 'the Vienna you read about in books' did have a considerable influence on his formation. His mother knew Schoenberg, Mahler and Freud, but even more important than that was the prevailing ambience, the high regard paid by the Viennese middle-class to Bildung - culture in a general sense. His father - a lawyer - hardly bothered to oppose his youngest son's declared aim of becoming an art historian even though he feared for his chances of earning a livelihood. We are given vignettes of people like Joseph Strzygowski and Julius von Schlosser, the rival professors of art history in the city, and Ernst Kris, the psychoanalyst and curator of the Hapsburg collection of goldsmith-work in the Vienna Museum. They were among Gombrich's earliest mentors. It was from Kris that Gombrich learnt that art history could be combined with other disciplines - hence the inclusion of Science in the subtitle of this book - and with whom he wrote his first book published in this country, Caricature (1940). Gombrich's first ever book was published before the war in Vienna in 1935. It was commissioned there by Walter Neurath (who founded Thames &amp; Hudson in London) to be part of an educational series of books for children he was editing. Gombrich's book was a History of the World; though written in only six weeks it proved to be a great success. The following year Gombrich came to London as a research assistant at the Warburg Institute to put into order the books, manuscripts and papers of Aby Warburg; the Institute Warburg founded had moved from Vienna to London in 1933 as the Nazis began to encroach upon Austrian cultural life. Gombrich inherited not only the founder's scholarly interest in the Renaissance but also his sense of the range of knowledge (especially through the acquisition of books in a variety of disciplines) required to understand a period such as Florence under the Medicis. Then the second world war broke out: Gombrich left the Institute to work in the BBC monitoring service. He was approached for a book by another Viennese publisher now in London, Dr Horovitz, the head of the Phaidon Press. Gombrich searched among his papers and found the few chapters of a volume on Art he had begun to write as a companion volume to the children's history. But it was not until the war was over and he had returned to the Institute (by then a part of London University) as a full member of its staff that he completed this book - The Story of Art. It was a best-seller on publication and it still sells steadily throughout the world. The current edition, with a new chapter on photography, is the 15th. Its immediate effect on the author was to transform his life from that of an obscure struggling academic in London into that of an internationally known, much sought after authority of the museum and art worlds. He was appointed Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford and invitations came from Harvard, Washington and from many other centres of learning all over the world. 'People know me' Gombrich tells his French interviewer 'as the author of The Story of Art who have never heard of me as a scholar. On the other hand, many of my colleagues have never read the book. They may have read my papers on Poussin or Leonardo, but not that. It is a curious double life'. It may be curious yet it remains one which he has fruitfully led for many years and continues to lead to the enrichment of anyone who reads him in either capacity.</p>

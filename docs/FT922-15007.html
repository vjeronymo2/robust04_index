			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank plans stricter rules DEUTSCHE BANK, the largest bank in Germany, is to be the first of the country's big banks to introduce an Anglo-Saxon-style compliance regime. The plan is to introduce strict rules designed to prevent the misuse of sensitive financial information. Speaking yesterday as the bank reported a 16.5 per cent increase in operating profits to DM5.97bn (Dollars 3.61bn) last year, Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive, exhorted rival German banks to follow suit. He said this would help strengthen Frankfurt as a financial centre. The new regime will introduce formal Chinese walls between bank departments and will introduce a 'restricted list' of shares, designed 'to impose rigorous limitations on own-account trading', both for the bank acting on its own account and for employees' personal deals. There will also be a 'watch list' for situations when the bank has access to market-sensitive information not available to the public. It will be modelled on best practice at Anglo-American securities houses, in particular on Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche's UK merchant banking subsidiary, and is to be policed by a new 55-strong compliance department headed by a senior bank executive. The move comes nearly three months after the Bonn government announced plans to set-up a central regulatory body for the German securities industry and to introduce tough penalties against insider dealing, which is still not illegal in Germany. Last year, Frankfurt was plagued with a succession of scandals which, bankers fear, has made international investors wary of dealing via German securities firms. Buoyed by strong demand for credit in both the east and west of Germany, interest income roes 17 per cent to DM10.62bn last year. As previously announced, the bank is planning to raise its 1991 dividend, by DM1 to DM15 per share, although Mr Kopper said this was no reason for the bank to yield to bank unions' demands for a pay award of 10.5 per cent and shorter working hours. Mr Kopper said the group's balance sheet was so healthy - following growth of DM49bn to DM449bn this year - that there would be no need to raise equity capital this year, although the bank may take the opportunity to raise secondary capital via an issue of profit-participating certificates. Mr Kopper said the bank's uninsured exposure to the former Soviet Union stood at under DM1bn, while the amount not covered by provisions was less than DM100m. The cover ratio for the group's problem loans to 60 countries stands at 84 per cent. Group commission income last year rose by 5.4 per cent to DM3.77bn. The strongest contribution to profits on own-account trading came from fixed income business.</p>

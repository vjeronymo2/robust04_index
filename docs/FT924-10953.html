			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Peregrine new powerhouse in Hong Kong PEREGRINE Investments, which yesterday increased its stake in Invesco MIM, the UK fund management group, has rapidly emerged as one of the leading financial powerhouses in Hong Kong since it was founded in 1988. Helped by its strong connections with the colony's leading businessmen, including founding shareholder Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's richest man, the firm has grown to a market capitalisation of Dollars HK5.6bn, compared with its start-up capital of Dollars HK300m. It has focused on stockbroking, corporate finance and direct investment activities. 'The investment in Invesco MIM is a logical extention of our business', said Mr Francis Leung, managing director. It had long been rumoured that Peregrine would set up its own fund management operation, but Mr Leung said: 'It would be too difficult to be a late entrant in that market.' Mr Leung said it was a strategic stake. Peregrine has held discussions with Invesco MIM about expanding sales and finding investment opportunities in south east Asia. Peregrine has offices in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul and Singapore, although the bulk of its earnings continue to flow in from the colony. The company was set up primarily by Mr Philip Tose and Mr Leung, two senior executives from Citicorp Vickers, who obtained financial backing from a client list that reads like a Who's Who of corporate Hong Kong. Its backers include Hopewell Holdings, Great Eagle, Citic Hong Kong - the local arm of the Beijing-controlled corporation - and Yue Xiu Enterprises, another influential Chinese corporation. Peregrine has profited substantially from these connections. This year, it was lead underwriter for placements by Hopewell and Mr Li's conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. It has also developed a reputation for providing easy access to Hong Kong's deal-makers. A sell note on Hutchison earlier this year led to a diving share price, despite the company's assertions that its Chinese Walls remained intact.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Iraq arms papers still withheld KEY GOVERNMENT documents which could shed light on the extent to which ministers sidestepped government guidelines on defence sales to Iraq are still being withheld from the arms-for-Iraq inquiry it emerged yesterday. The missing documents include details of a secret system for classifying countries according to their perceived security risk, which was apparently used by the Ministry of Defence in processing exports to Iraq. Guidelines announced to parliament in October 1985 officially made defence sales more restrictive both to Iraq and Iran. But it is thought the internal classification system for Iraq remained unchanged from 1981 until August 1990, when Kuwait was invaded. Reference to a classification system code-named Table X was made by a former senior official of the Ministry of Defence, Mr Christopher Sandars, in evidence at the start of the second week of the Scott inquiry's public hearings. Mr Sandars said that under an internal system set up in the ministry in the 1980s, British defence companies wishing to trade with Iraq dealt directly with defence officials, some of whom were charged with promoting exports. The inquiry heard that the opinions of these officials, in consultation with the Foreign Office, were often 'fairly definitive' in deciding whether a company was granted an export licence. The system of 'informal clearances' brokered by an internal arms working group did not involve the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Sandars was told by Lord Justice Scott that he would be required to attend a fresh hearing after he had provided missing documents covering Table X and other important areas of defence policy. Mr Sandars was head of the MoD's Secretariat 13 in charge of defence sales between September 1980 and December 1984. He subsequently served as assistant secretary of state (Defence Export Services Administration), a separate department which also oversaw defence sales. It emerged last night that Mr Sandars remains a serving senior civil servant. He was recently moved to the Cabinet Office's Defence and Overseas Affairs Secretariat which co-ordinates policy between departments. Sources close to the inquiry were playing down suggestions of a clash over missing documents between Lord Justice Scott and the government although they said the judge was determined to get all the documents he had asked for before preparing his report later in the year. The hearing continues today.</p>

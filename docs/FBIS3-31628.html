Secretary General  special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi stated on  Monday that the solution for the partial demilitarization of  Sarajevo will be a model for other cities in the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example Mostar.    Fighting has been going on for one year already in Mostar,  southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, between Bosnian Moslems and Croats  for domination over the city.    If there are no grave breeches of the ceasefire in the  region  of Sarajevo, we could say that the possibility that NATO air  strikes be launched in Bosnia is longer existant, Akashi said in  an interview to Japanese television.    Serbs and Moslems have complied with NATO's demand that by  midnight February 20 heavy weapons around Sarajevo be withdrawn  or placed under U.N. control, therefore according to UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] headquarters, NATO air strikes are not  necessary.    The ceasefire, which was signed last Wednesday by Serbian  and  Moslem forces in Sarajevo, is also respected.    Akashi said he hoped that new agreements between the warring  sides will be reached soon. The economic and social life in  Sarajevo could be renewed and citizens could leave and enter the  city freely, he said.    Akashi explained that NATO's threats of air strike have had  a  specific role in achieving the partial demilitarization of  Sarajevo, but that other factors have also helped.    The complete calming of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina  cannot be achieved for several months yet, Akashi assessed and  added that the U.N. will continue to use the carrot and stick  method, to bring the warring sides to an agreement.    Akashi considered that the three warring sides in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, Moslem, Serbian and Croatian, will form three  republics, gathered in a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina. Akashi  said he hoped that the earlier communal life would be possible  once again.    The plan to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into three ethnic  republics, supported by the European Union and on the basis of  which peace negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina are being led, is  accepted by Bosnian Serbs and Croats, and rejected by Moslems.</p>

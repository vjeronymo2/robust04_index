			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / CBI says weak exports may threaten upturn A WEAKENING in export demand from continental Europe may hold back the expected recovery by manufacturing industry, a Confederation of British Industry report says today. It indicates that many manufacturers have become less confident over the past two months about output growth this year, in line with signs of economic fragility on the Continent and falling consumer confidence in the UK. The survey fits with other evidence that, after relatively strong growth in the first quarter, the economy may have entered a new phase. One bright spot from the report is that few manufacturers expect to increase prices in the next four months, which suggests general inflationary pressures remain muted. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said the survey indicated a 'small setback' for export orders. He pointed out that overseas orders remained stronger than at any time between August 1990 and April this year, reflecting a boost to competitiveness from the fall in sterling and the success by many manufacturers in controlling costs. The CBI's monthly survey of 1,606 manufacturers was conducted between May 28 and June 16. The employers' body said the report did not alter its view that the UK would see reasonably good growth this year. Also, despite the fall in export orders, domestic demand might have picked up slightly in the past month. Of the companies questioned, 21 per cent said export order books were above normal and 31 per cent said they were below. The balance of 10 per cent expressing a negative view compares with a balance of 5 per cent in the May survey and a balance of 22 per cent cent saying order books were below normal in April. A balance of 12 per cent of companies expect output volumes to increase in the next four months, after a comparable balance of 23 per cent in May and one of 14 per cent in April. Total order books are largely unchanged from May, with price rises expected to remain subdued. The survey indicates the lowest net proportion of companies since last November believes it will raise prices in the next four months. Stocks of finished goods remain more than adequate to meet demand, though stock levels have been run down slightly since May. Finished goods stocks are rated as more than adequate by 19 per cent of businesses and less than adequate by 5 per cent.</p>

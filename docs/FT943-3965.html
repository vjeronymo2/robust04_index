			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Telecoms worries as Indian official goes Companies hoping to invest in India's telecommunications market have reacted with shock to the sudden transfer of Mr Nagarajan Vittal, the top civil servant in the Telecommunications Ministry and a strong advocate of economic liberalisation. They fear his departure last week from the ministry could delay the implementation of a telecommunications policy announced in May, in which the government promised to end the state's monopoly of basic telephone services and invite private enterprise, including foreign companies, to invest up to Rs230bn (Pounds 4.75bn) in the industry. 'Mr Vittal's departure is bad news,' said a Delhi representative of a US telecommunications group with plans to invest in Indian telecommunications services. 'He wanted to make things happen quickly. Implementing the new policy is bound to take longer now.' Mr Vittal, who was telecommunications secretary and chairman of the government's telecommunications commission, remains secretary in the Electronics Ministry, a post he held in tandem. He also remains India's candidate for an elected senior post at the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva. Government officials suggested that Mr Vittal's transfer would give him more time to lobby for the ITU post. But few observers in Delhi believe this was the real reason for his job change. Mr Vittal was brought into the Telecommunications Ministry late last year at the behest of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to lead a radical overhaul of the industry. But he ran into tough opposition from Mr Sukh Ram, the telecommunications minister, who sided with the ministry's bureaucrats, its trade union leaders and others who wished to slow reform. The conflicts between these two abrasive characters frequently surfaced in the press - to Mr Narasimha Rao's anger. Mr Vittal's departure could mean the new telecommunications policy will be less liberal in practice than in intent. Among issues still to be settled are the maximum shareholding foreign companies will be permitted to hold in an Indian telecommunications carrier, the commercial relationship between the new private carriers and the state-run network, and regulatory matters. The ministry also has still to solve a long-standing muddle over the award of licences for cellular telephone networks.</p>

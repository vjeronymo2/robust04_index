			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Yearender" by staff reporter Liu Liping (0491 4539 1627)] </F>   [Text] Washington, 27 Dec (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--There  were both advances and setbacks in Sino-U.S. trade this year.  This was the appraisal of Wang Tianming, counselor responsible  for economic affairs and commerce at the Chinese Embassy in the  United States. He believes problems during the year will soon  become a thing of the past. He said: Sino-U.S. economic trade  relations underwent relatively many difficulties in 1993,  nevertheless, they saw a degree of improvement.    Quoting statistics released by the Chinese Customs, Wang  Tianming said: The total volume of trade between China and the  United States was $20.4 billion in the first 10 months of this  year, with the former's export trade with the latter put at  $12.9 billion, a rise of 17 percent, and its import trade with  the latter put at $7.5 billion, a gain of 11 percent over the  same period last year. It is expected that by the end of this  year, China's import trade with the United States will be over  $9 billion. The United States is China's third-largest trade  partner.    According to the Tianming's briefing, China's exports to the  United States were mainly textiles and light industrial  products, while China's imports from the United States centered  on machinery and technology-intensive commodities. Together they  made up 75 percent of China's total import from America. U.S.  investment in China increased a lot over last year; many large  enterprises and companies made long-term investments in China.  According to current available statistics, the cumulative number  of projects using U.S. investment in China is 6,383, and the  amount of money involved in their agreements totals $10.6  billion, of which $3.3 billion has been utilized. The United  States has thus ranked itself after Hong Kong and Taiwan in  terms of investment in China.    China has made great efforts, according to Wang Tianming, in  developing Sino-U.S. trade this year. Up to today, in the newly  established "Statements of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation of the PRC," four internal regulation  documents have been made public to increase the transparency of  trade, while taxation on 2,898 commodities has been lowered.  China has revised its trademark law and entered into a patents  treaty. Sino-U.S. memoranda on market access, intellectual  property rights, and products made by China were signed a year  ago. The authorities concerned in China have offered great help  to U.S. enterprises in obtaining protection for intellectual  property rights. In March this year, Chinese and U.S.  Government delegations reached a relatively satisfactory  understanding on how to implement the memoranda on products made  by prisoners....    Wang Tianming stated: Of the problems and difficulties  facing Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, the first is the  annual reviewing and approval of most-favored-nation [MFN]  treatment, which causes a sense of instability and insecurity  among U.S. industrialists and businessmen. This way of doing  things has a direct bearing on the trade cooperation between  China and the United States. On the intellectual property  rights issue, although China has made great efforts, the United  States still declared it was altering China's listing from a  nation under general observation last year to a key nation on  the list. The United States still restricts export of high-tech  products to China and has not yet lifted the sanctions imposed  upon it. At the same time, the United States has imposed more  and more new restrictions on the import of Chinese products.  Textiles are the traditional major commodities China exports to  the United States. The Sino-U.S. agreement on textiles,  currently in force, is to expire by the end of this year. Both  sides have held three rounds of talks on signing a new  agreement. Because the United States persisted in demanding that  the Chinese accept totally the penalty article in the  anti-corruption provision, which was in violation of  international norms, and the article which one-sidedly stressed  U.S. rights, the talks made no progress.    Wang Tianming pointed out: It is not strange that there are  problems and differences in the economic and trade activities  between China and the United States. It is necessary for both  sides to seek a solution through dialogue and on the basis of  mutual benefit and cooperation rather than using sanctions as a  means to put pressure on the other. Putting pressure on others  will solve no problems.    Wang Tianming said: As for the coming year, it is of great  significance to accelerate China's reform and to open up to the  outside world. As far as the economic and trade fields are  concerned, reform will be carried out in areas such as the  foreign economic and trade structure and systems covering  foreign investment, banking, taxation, and foreign exchange.  The state will promulgate a dozen economic laws and regulations  next year, including the foreign trade law, the foreign  investment law, the company law, the securities law, the fair  trade law, the antidumping law, and the antisubsidy law, which  will have much to do with, the development of Sino-U.S. trade.  With a population of 1.1 billion people or more, China has a  huge market potential. Tianming revealed that in the next seven  years, China would introduce, from abroad, 210 major  technological items ranging over 23 trades and with a gross  value of almost $30 billion. He said: As China and the United  States are economically highly complementary, China will seek  U.S. technology and advanced technical know-how, while the  latter will require China's abundant manpower resources and its  vast market. Economic and trade activities between the two  countries are very promising.    Further development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade  relations, Wang said, required great efforts by both sides. The  solution of the MFN treatment problem, which was viewed as the  bedrock of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, was  advantageous to both countries. Economic and trade activities  between China and the Unites States will develop in a healthy  way so long as the United States gives up its annual practice of  reviewing and approving China's MFN treatment.    China and the United States will hold the eighth joint  committee meeting in Washington April of next year. This will  be the first time the Clinton administration will hold such a  meeting with China. China, Wang said, was actively making  preparations for the meeting, and would then send a large  investment seeking delegation comprising central and local  enterprises to the United States. At the same time, China was  also considering dispatching a procurement group to the United  States. He stated: China hopes that the meeting will contribute  to the further development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade  relations.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WCAC ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BELL HELPS USF UPSET ST. MARY'S  </P> <P> James Bell's 3-point play with 54 seconds remaining snapped a tie and lifted  the University of San Francisco to a 62-55 upset of St. Mary's in a West Coast  Athletic Conference game Friday night at Moraga.  </P> <P> USF trailed, 55-53, with 2:24 left, but Mark McCathrion scored on a short jump  hook at 1:43 to tie the score. St. Mary's had a chance to regain the lead, but  Dan Curry missed the front end of a 1-and-1 to set up Bell's winning play.  </P> <P> St. Mary's saw its 7-game winning streak come to an end and fell to 16-2  overall and 4-1 in the WCAC. The Gaels, who were 7-0 in road games, fell into a  second-place tie with Loyola Marymount. Pepperdine leads at 5-0.  </P> <P> McCathrion, the 6-foot 8-inch center who had missed the previous 2 games  because of a death in his family, led the Dons with 14 points as USF (10-8,  2-3) shot 65% against a team that was leading the nation in field goal defense.  </P> <P> Al Lewis led St. Mary's with 15 points, including back-to-back 3-point shots  that took the Gaels from a 53-49 deficit to a 55-53 lead with 2:24 remaining.  </P> <P> Santa Clara 67, San Diego 66 -- The Toreros, trailing by 18 points with 7:32  left, staged a furious rally, but came up short at San Diego.  </P> <P> With Santa Clara (13-5, 2-3) ahead by 1 with 8 seconds left, Bronco guard  Melvin Chinn missed a free throw. San Diego's Craig Cottrell rebounded, and the  Toreros (5-12, 0-5) were within seconds of pulling off the victory.  </P> <P> Cottrell passed to freshman forward Kelvin Woods, who had trouble getting the  ball upcourt. Woods passed it to Danny Means. With 2 seconds left and the ball  at midcourt, Means tried to get off a shot but couldn't.  </P> <P> Santa Clara had used an 8-0 run to go ahead, 50-32, with 8:09 left before San  Diego started its comeback. The Toreros pulled to within 65-64 on Wayman  Strickland's 3-point shot with 23 seconds left.  </P></p>

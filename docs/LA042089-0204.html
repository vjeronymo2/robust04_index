			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENATE BOWS TO GOVERNOR, PUTS OFF ITS GUN BAN VOTE;  </P> <P> ATTY. GEN. CALLS PLEA INCREDIBLE  </P> <P> The Democratic leader of the state Senate today postponed a vote on his bill to  restrict military-style assault weapons at the request of Gov. George  Deukmejian, who said he wanted to review the measure before it was sent to his  desk.  </P> <P> In a letter this morning to Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los  Angeles), the Republican governor said he had expected to consider suggesting  amendments to Roberti's bill after it went to a two-house conference committee.  </P> <P> "It had been my intention to offer my observations and any suggested amendments  at that time. I was informed yesterday, late in the afternoon, that you intend  to bring up the bill for a final vote on the Senate floor today," Deukmejian  said in the letter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No New Vote Date Set  </P> <P> "I have not had an adequate opportunity to review what you intend to be the  complete version of SB292. Therefore, I request that you not bring your bill up  on the Senate floor for a final vote today so that I may review its provisions  and suggest amendments where appropriate," the governor said.  </P> <P> Roberti said he had agreed to Deukmejian's request for a delay. No new date was  set for a vote on Roberti's bill, but Capitol sources said as a practical  matter it could not come up again until early May because of a scheduled trip  by several key state lawmakers to Washington next week.  </P> <P> At a Capitol news conference, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said  Deukmejian's request was "unique and a little bit incredible." Deukmejian and  his staff "have had ample opportunity to participate in the development of this  bill," Van de Kamp added.  </P> <P> The Democratic attorney general said he was concerned that this bill be voted  on quickly because the opposition, including the National Rifle Assn., "will  use whatever delay there is to put pressure" on the governor and lawmakers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Input Urged  </P> <P> "The overwhelming majority of Californians who support this measure" should  make the governor aware that they want the bill passed, Van de Kamp said.  </P> <P> Later in the day, the Senate approved a nearly identical Assembly version of  the assault weapons bill, AB347 by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). The  26-11 vote moved the bill into a position where it could be used either as a  backup to the bill introduced by Roberti or as a vehicle for technical  follow-up amendments.  </P> <P> Before the vote on Roos' bill, Roberti said: "We live with restraints. . . .  You can't own a bazooka. You can't own a ground-to-air missile, and we have to  put restrictions on assault weapons, too."  </P> <P> But Sen. John Doolittle, a Roseville Republican, argued: "We're not talking  about tanks. We're not talking about bazookas. We're talking about  semiautomatic weapons which cannot be distinguished from (sporting weapons)."  </P> <P> "We're going to create a huge class of lawbreakers out of decent, (law-)  abiding citizens," Doolittle said.  </P> <P> Roberti's nearly identical bill would restrict sales and possession of more  than 50 models of assault firearms, including the type of AK-47 used to kill  five Stockton students and wound 29 students and a teacher in January.  </P></p>

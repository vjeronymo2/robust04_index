			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Counting the cost of cleaning up - Andrew Fisher examines the progress being made in bringing eastern Germany up to western environmental standards It seems like an almost impossible task. By the start of the next century, Germany hopes to bring its economically ailing and underdeveloped eastern states - now part of a united country for only 16 months - up to the environmental standards of those in the west. Some experts say it just cannot be done. Others are confident that the necessary financial, industrial and political muscle will be brought to bear on the problem and that east Germany will become an environmental showcase. The end result is likely to be somewhere between the two. Germany's unification treaty stresses the importance of raising environmental standards in the east both to improve the quality of life and as part of the whole economic reconstruction process. More than DM60m (Pounds 21m) has been spent on studies alone to assess what needs to be done and what is feasible. What the experts do not dispute is that the whole process will be extremely costly; the Ifo economic research institute in Munich estimates around DM200bn, though others go much higher. The old east Berlin government treated the issue of pollution with notorious disdain, forbidding concerned citizens to seek out the real facts. The environment was a taboo subject. What was important was economic success and self-sufficiency in industrial and energy production. 'Nature was exploited,' says Karl Eugen Huthmacher, an environment ministry official. Today, it is apparent that progress in clearing up east Germany's environmental mess is being made. For anyone going to east Germany for the first time after the border was opened in November 1989, one important change is obvious - the air smells cleaner. Heavy use of lignite (brown coal) for domestic and industrial power gave the air an unpleasant tang which has now been lessened as the worst plants have been shut. Improvements of this kind were inevitable as outdated industrial factories were closed, either because they were dangerous or filthy or both, or because they could not keep pace with the demands of the free market economy. Emissions of noxious fumes have fallen dramatically, as has the pollution of rivers and lakes by waste chemicals. 'The main successes have come from economic restructuring rather than an active environmental policy,' comments Huthmacher. Two of the worst industries in pollution terms were chemicals and metal processing. Bitterfeld, the town which housed one of east Germany's biggest chemical complexes, became a byword for the industrial fouling of the land, air, and water. The name symbolised east Germany's environmental ills all too aptly; as well as the mouldering chemical plant, a factory producing lignite briquettes also contributed to the stench and dirt. Bitterfeld lies in the heart of the industrial complex between Leipzig and Halle, both historic cities which suffered from the weight of industrial development. Not far outside Leipzig is an opencast lignite mine, which devastated a vast area of landscape as the coal was brutally scooped off the ground by huge excavators. From the air, it looks like an arid moonscape where life never existed. Centred on Halle is a huge chemicals complex, which accounted for half of east Germany's toxic waste and 30 per cent of its water and air pollution. Slightly to the west is Eisleben, the headquarters of the Mansfeld metals complex. Scattered around the countryside are big slag heaps. In the shadow of one, near a collection of tumbledown outhouses where ducks waddle among old pieces of machinery, is an arresting little reminder that western standards are being introduced. In a neat row stand six containers - blue for wastepaper, grey for cans, yellow for plastic, and white, green, and brown for glass. Ironically, notes Ifo, east Germany did specify the protection of nature in its constitution, one of the few countries to do so. But it is only in the past two years that environmental consciousness has been allowed to develop. Because of past neglect, the clean-up job looks forbidding: Air. East Germany had the worst air pollution in Europe, mainly because 80 per cent of electricity was produced by sulphur-rich brown coal. Power plants had no filters. By 1996, the government's aim is to reduce sulphur dioxide pollution by 4.2m tonnes a year and that of dust particles by 1.3m tonnes. This will mostly be the job of the utility companies which are investing heavily in the east. Nearly 280 large power plants will have to be modernised. In the state of Saxony-Anhalt, containing the bulk of the chemical industry, sulphur dioxide emissions have been cut by 30 per cent and of dust by 40 per cent, says Huthmacher. By 2005, the plan is to lower the amount of carbon dioxide in east Germany's air by 40 per cent. Water. With 45 per cent of rivers too heavily polluted for use as drinking water and only 35 per cent capable of being brought into such use with complex, expensive technology, the water problem is one of the most acute in east Germany's environment. Industrial closures and modernisation have led to a steep drop in the chemical pollution of the River Elbe, which flows graciously through Dresden - its mercury content has been halved - but further progress will be costly. One disadvantage for east Germany is that its water lies at a lower average level than in the west, thus putting it closer to the sources of pollution and reducing its capacity for self-purification. Only 75 per cent of the 16m population is connected to a sewage system and less than 60 per cent to treatment plants. Several thousand miles of sewage pipeline will thus have to be built to accord with west German standards. In the lakes, only 1 per cent the water is suitable for drinking. Names like Silver Lake, near Bitterfeld, and Sweet Lake, near Eisleben, belie the real state of their contents. With its imposing shoreside castle, Sweet Lake was an important tourist area under the old regime. But the lake has suffered from sewage and heavy use of fertiliser. A study of the Mansfeld area commissioned by the government described the water as being in 'an extremely endangered state'. Ground. Here, the problem encompasses contamination by industry, mining, uncontrolled waste disposal on open dumps, and by troops, East German and Soviet. Altogether, some 28,000 sites have been identified as possibly being contaminated. Ifo reckons the clean-up cost could be DM10bn. This does not include cases like the uranium mines and enrichment plants, agricultural sites, brown coal pits which need recultivating, demolishing the closed nuclear plant at Greifswald, or the 280,000 hectares which Soviet troops occupied. These could cost an extra DM170bn. At present, only the worst industrial sites are being cleared, partly in preparation for new investment. To keep former employees busy, at least temporarily, many are now helping clear the sites where they once worked. Heinrich Bonnenberg, a director of the Treuhand privatisation agency, says it will be impossible to spend as much as DM200bn for total soil decontamination - 'these are fantasy figures'. The east German states, still short of money, will only be able, with Bonn's help, to tackle areas of highest priority. Even when these have been identified, the task of cleaning up has to be linked with new investment prospects, decisions on which industries or sectors can survive and which must close, and local employment needs. Investing companies do not want to be saddled with huge expenses caused by past pollution. On the other hand, the government and the Treuhand want to ensure that they bear at least some of the environmental costs. Encouragingly, some of the most notorious regions have turned out to be not as polluted as feared. In the Mansfeld metalworking area, for instance, experts have discovered that ground pollution is confined mainly to the smelting sites and has not infected nearby rivers and streams. On the other hand, there is plenty to be done. High concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, and zinc have been found near an old lead smelter. Helmut Wopkemeier, the head of the Mansfeld group, says it could cost up to DM2bn to remove the waste caused by copper mining and processing. Attracting new investment is also proving hard. The same is true at Bitterfeld, though Bayer, the west German chemicals group, is among several companies moving into the area. As with Mansfeld, the number of jobs that survive will be only a fraction of those employed at the old East German kombinats (conglomerates). 'We are dealing with abstract figures,' says Volkmar Kayser, also of the Treuhand, 'but the human and social dimensions are enormous.' Among these are the state of the environment. Here, at least, change in east Germany can only be for the better.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japan is ready to introduce  an insurance broker system to break the deadlock in its  insurance negotiations with the United States as part of  bilateral framework trade talks, government sources said Friday  [4 February].    They said the government will seek a revision of the  Insurance Business Law in fiscal 1995 to allow brokers to sell  policies for different insurance companies.    Japan is also willing to liberalize in stages the insurance  markets for disabilities, diseases and nursing to meet U.S.  demands in the talks, the sources said.    Foreign insurance companies control a major share in those  fields.    But Japan will refuse to introduce numerical targets for  market opening, the focus of the insurance negotiations as well  as in other talks, they said.    The U.S. is demanding that the foreign share of the Japanese  insurance market be increased to 10 percent from the present 2  percent.    The sources said negotiations on this issue are likely to  drag on until the scheduled Japan-U.S. summit in Washington on  February 11 between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Bill Clinton.</p>

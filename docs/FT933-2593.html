			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (8): Smaller of the species under threat - Brian Bollen notes that financial advisers must adapt - or go the way of the dinosaurs FINANCIAL advisers have had to respond to the much changed levels and patterns of international M&amp;A activity to avoid going the way of the dinosaurs. Broadly, investment bankers say their work has not diminished in volume, but that it has changed in nature since the late 1980s. There is less financial thinking behind transactions and more strategic thinking; buyers want more thorough 'due diligence' investigations and they seek to consider the long-term implications of deals more carefully. Clients are also seeking more integrated - and global - advice in the context of an M&amp;A transaction, such as advice on financing, derivatives and balance sheet structures. The transaction range has broadened and there has been a shift away from transaction-centred relations. The renaissance of relationship banking is one of the phenomena of the 1990s, says Mr Francois von Hurter, co-head of European M&amp;A at the Credit Suisse First Boston group. An added complication is the ability of the big, very experienced companies to handle much of their own M&amp;A activity. A common complaint by advisers is: 'The fastest growing competitor is No Adviser.' The main houses have evolved differently over the past 10 years, whether by integration, internationalisation or industry specialisation, and they have seen newcomers try to carve out a living in their traditional market. As UK public company takeover activity has become less important, the US and Europe have become, in strategic terms, more so. Privatisation is another growing issue. Baring Brothers, for example, decided to develop internationally some years ago. It says that now more than 50 per cent of its business is cross-border work. The bank's current workload helps to illustrate the changed marketplace. After advising Northern Telecom of Canada in 1990 on its purchase of STC, then a fully listed UK company, today it is advising NorTel on the sale of STC's submarine cable business to Alcatel of France. The legwork involved in establishing contacts with a wider European client base could help explain why the top banks say that, despite the recession, they have not had to shed corporate finance staff. Those who do own up to reducing the numbers directly employed on financial advice say they have been able to redeploy staff. Green shoots are growing and staff are at least fully employed, if not actually in short supply. 'We have kept busy throughout the slowdown,' says Mr Tony Freeman, a senior strategic adviser at Merrill Lynch in London. 'We have been less affected than, say, UK merchant banks, who are tied to a particular market. We're now growing the business, recruiting and developing young people within the organisation; we're investing in clients, in people and in ideas.' Those with international ambitions need global facilities as well as multi-product capabilities. 'If you have a substantial increase in cross-border transactions, you need an adviser with local expertise in different markets,' says Mr Klaus Diedrichs, J P Morgan's co-head of European M&amp;A. J P Morgan, highly regarded by its rivals for the way it has translated existing corporate relationships into financial advisory mandates, says it has doubled the numbers employed in its European M&amp;A operations over the past three years. Others - admittedly smaller and less successful - say that there are at least 25 per cent too many people across the City in banks, legal and accounting firms, and that something has to give. Meanwhile, the recent departure of co-founder Mr Joseph Perella from Wasserstein Perella in New York is seen in some quarters as further proof that the days may be numbered for the niche firms - the so-called boutiques which mushroomed at the height of the M&amp;A market in the late 1980s. While J O Hambro Magan in the UK, and Wolfensohn and Gleacher &amp; Co in the US, are acknowledged successes, few bankers see a long-term role for the smaller of the species, unless it is based on sector specialisation and relationship. There is an argument, however, that if the niche firms did not exist, they would have to be invented in order to service smaller industrialists who have growth ambitions but are nervous in a formal City atmosphere. Continental Europeans, too, often feel happier turning for advice to individuals with a demonstrable pedigree, rather than to faceless organisations (some of which have an unfortunate reputation for arrogance). Mr John MacArthur, the founder of MacArthur &amp; Co, formerly of Kleinwort Benson and Prudential Bache, argues that the critical question is whether the niche firms will become mini-merchant banks, developing a retained client list. 'If M&amp;A business is going to be smaller and different, those who set out their stall to do pure M&amp;A could have a pretty thin time,' he says. 'We are a full service corporate finance advisory organisation, from the generation of ideas to organisation and execution; many of the people around are not equipped by background or training to give mainstream corporate finance advice in the UK.' Mr MacArthur's own small team, which already features Mr Nigel Christie, an old Kleinwort Benson and Warburg hand, was strengthened recently by the arrival of Mr David Hudson from Campbell Lutyens Hudson, where he was a partner. Wasserstein Perella, for its part, is firmly optimistic about the long-term future. 'We have a 10 to 15-year plan which includes diversification efforts that have already been in process for five years,' says Mr Michael Biondi, managing director. 'We also believe our advisory business is solid and will continue to improve as the market improves.' The debate on whether the corporate finance arms of accounting firms can legitimately claim to be financial advisers has taken something of a new turn as M&amp;A values have fallen. Bank attitudes range from grudging acceptance of such claims to contemptuous dismissal. 'If you widen the definition of corporate finance activity, there is a perception that the accounting firms have muscled in,' says one banker. 'But they have done little more than assemble traditional accounting-related activities in one department.' 'We have a worldwide network second to none,' argues Mr Richard Agutter, for the other side. The chairman of KPMG's international corporate finance network says his firm is again competing with merchant banks at the lower end of its target Pounds 5m-Pounds 50m transaction range. Mr Agutter says: 'A number of merchant banks have come down into what we thought was our market place, and we have moved up a bit; the edges have become blurred.' KPMG illustrates its points by referring to its role in advising Gillette on the acquisition of Parker Pen, a deal concluded earlier this year. The corporate finance division of Price Waterhouse exudes more aggression. Several years ago Price Waterhouse might have accepted a company's reluctance to use an accounting firm as a fully fledged financial adviser. 'We have now been in business long enough to be a fair way up the corporate credibility curve,' says Mr Tom Wilson, a senior partner at PW Corporate Finance. 'We regard as our competitors not the other accounting firms but the established M&amp;A houses who are operating at the top end of the market. The keys are good contacts with local companies on the ground, which we have.' Mr Peter Espenhahn, deputy head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell, agrees: 'There is a market for people doing smaller transactions. Our cost structure does not allow us to do a small deal for a first time client; we are happy to see the accounting firms doing that business.'</p>

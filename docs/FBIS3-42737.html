			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk, president </F> of the Ukrainian Society of Lawyers, by Yuriy Bondar: "The Path  Which We Have Chosen"]    [Text]    [Bondar] Viktor Volodymyrovych, the Supreme Council recently  decreed supplements to the Ukrainian Code of Criminal Procedure  with regard to citizens' right to a defense. What is the essence  of these supplements?    [Medvedchuk] The right to a defense is an unchanging and  important feature of a state based on the rule of law. To a  considerable extent, it is conditioned by what kind of role is  played by the institution of the bar within the legal system. In  line with the earlier enacted law entitled "On the Bar in  Ukraine," the full weight and authority of lawyers were  expanded. However, they were still unable to guarantee citizens'  right to a defense. It took a year for the legislators to become  aware of the need for supplementary legal changes. In my view,  the most essential of these supplements is the provision  that--from now on--a citizen who has been arrested by staffers  of the internal-affairs organs, security service, or  procurator's office as a suspect or an accused person shall have  the right to see a lawyer face-to-face (and, therefore, to  obtain skilled legal assistance) prior to the initial  interrogation. There are also other changes and supplements with  regard to a lawyer's participation in the preliminary  investigation and the court trial. It must be said that their  interpretation corresponds to the legal norms which exist in  civilized countries.    [Bondar] Insofar as I know, these very demands for  guaranteed  rights to a defense constituted one of the demands made by the  recent lawyers' strike.    [Medvedchuk] Yes, that's true. And it is important to  understand here that--in demanding the changes which have now  been incorprated into the legislation--neither the strike  committee nor the Ukrainian Society of Lawyers were defending  the rights of the lawyers themselves. The expansion of our full  powers and authority is the expansion of the full powers and  authority of the citizens who entrust us with the task of  defending their rights and interests.    [Bondar] A short time ago the expansion of thier own rights  was also achieved by the organs of the procuracy; and  corresponding changes were introduced into the effective  legislation. To what extent are these two branches of justice  equal today, let's say--for example--in the pertinent court  procedure?    [Medvedchuk] With respect to legislative acts and norms in  both court procedures and in matters of procedural regulation,  the procuracy and the bar are markedly equal. In this  connection, however, I cannot--unfortunately--affirm that we  have achieved such equality in practice. The courts (such is the  inertia of thought) are still inclined to pay more attention to  the ideas set forth by the procuracy. But the recent changes,  including those in the awareness of our fellow-citizens, attest  to the fact that--no matter what has been said there--we are,  nevertheless, building a state based on the rule of law. And I  am convinced that this will not be just something on paper here  in our country.    [Bondar] You say that the rights of lawyers are the rights  of  the citizens whose interests they are defending. But to what  extent are the rights of lawyers themselves defended and  protected? I ask you this bearing in mind the instances whereby  some lawyers have been persecuted for participating in the  recent strike....    [Medvedchuk] I would not view this matter in a narrow  aspect,  inasmuch as lawyers are not at all unique in the legal  understanding of a portion of society; their civil rights are  the same as those of other persons. As to specific persecutions  of lawyers for participating in the strike, let me note the  following: These persecutions were neither organized nor  targeted in their nature. Leading officials in the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court,  and the Procurator General's Office supported the demands made  by the strikers; they addressed a letter on this matter to  persons occupying the highest positions in our country. The  violations and abuses of power were perpetrated by certain  staffers of the law-enforcement organs on the local level. Such  actions attested basically to a desire to take adavantage of the  strike in order to settle some old scores with certain lawyers  who were inconvenient for them. None of these attacks was left  without a reaction from the Ukrainian Society of Lawyers. At  present I can affirm that there are no illegal actions with  regard to lawyers.    [Bondar] The Ukrainian Society of Lawyers recently addressed  a proposal to the president of Ukraine, wherein they advocated  the creation--under him--of a coordinating council for the  defense and protection of human rights. But there are quite a  few such committees and commissions already in existence. How  does your proposal differ from them?    [Medvedchuk] The citizens' committees and commissions which  already exist cannot encompass all aspects of the right to a  legal defense; they are limited to merely the most blatant  political cases. But we, as lawyers, encounter on a day-to-day  basis violations of human rights which have nothing to do with  politics. However, for an individual citizen, they are--believe  me--no less painful. Moreover, a person whose interests are  being trampled upon cannot always travel in search of justice to  a rights-defense committee which is located in Kiev or some  other large center. But our proposal boils down to creating a  coordinating council which would be able to combine the  information and efforts of lawyers (making good use of their  organizationally repaired structure) and the other  rights-defending organizations. It would also enact decisions  pertaining to human-rights violations regardless of whether they  involve--so to speak--persons who are of great power in this  state. Because for the state there should be no difference whose  rights are being violated--whether it is a well-known or a  little-known person. It is certainly the case that either one is  a citizen of this country.    [Bondar] To what extent, in your opinion, does the presently  existing legislative base fully defend, protect, and guarantee  the right of a citizen to have a defense?    [Medvedchuk] If we compare the system of legal defense for a  Unkrainian citizen with what we had just a few years ago, I can  assert the following: In our country the right to a defense is  now much, much greater. Today we are proceeding along the path  of building new legislation, introducing new legal norms  which--at the legislative level--are strengthening the  protection and defense of Ukraine's citizens. Of course, this  path is still far from reaching the stage of full protection and  defense. But I am convinced that there is no other path for us  to take. I anticipate that the new Ukrainian parliament will  also support and maintain such a stance.    P. S. By the way, if you have questions for the  president of the Society of Lawyers--questions which pertain to  the legal defense of citizens, their rights and interests--you  can send them to our editorial offices. Viktor Medvedchuk has  promised to answer them.</p>

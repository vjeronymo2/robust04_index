			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Leading Article: The price of a Tory vote HOWEVER MUCH the government may dream of buying the election, there is no case for a cut in the standard rate of income tax. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, may be tempted to knock 1p off, reducing the rate to 24p, when he presents his Budget on March 10, but he should remain true to his characteristic sense of prudence. Many will advise him to throw caution to the winds in order to save the government's skin. It is thought by some Conservatives that a cut in personal taxation would put Labour on the spot, since Mr Neil Kinnock is pledged to reverse any reduction. If the Budget was quickly followed by an election, voters would prefer to keep the money. In practice a 1p cut would certainly be poor fiscal management and probably bad politics. Consider, first, the Budget strategy. A penny off the basic rate of tax here, an increase in the tax thresholds by more than the rate of inflation there, and pretty soon one is talking serious fiscal profligacy. Against that, Mr Lamont is publicly committed to the proposition that the Budget should be balanced in the medium term over the cycle as a whole. The chances that the Budget will be so balanced are already minimal. If the government made inroads into the overall tax take in March it would become non-existent. In the Autumn Statement the Treasury suggested that the public sector borrowing requirement would be 3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992-93. Given the dismal statistics on the economy published since last November - some of them released only this week - this is certainly an underestimate. Since general government expenditure was also set to grow at 3 per cent a year in real terms between 1990-91 and 1994-95, the chancellor's forecast of a medium term budget balance depends on the achievement of a sustained period of above-trend growth. At the current sterling parity and real rates of interest, that is about as likely as a Welsh victory in the five nations rugby championship this year. ERM constraints Having junked one rationale for its fiscal policy, an imaginative government could easily find another one. It could mutter about the constraint imposed by the ERM and appeal to the widely-held view that an active fiscal policy is a natural corollary of a fixed exchange rate. It could not do so without embarrassment. If he were persuaded to ride out the political assault, Mr Lamont would also have to consider the economic context for such a looser fiscal policy. A country with a substantial current account deficit in the midst of a deep recession is not the ideal candidate for further incentives to consumption. If fine-tune the government must, then lower taxes on business and particularly on investment seem the better alternative. This would certainly be a better choice than lowering income tax. 'Economic competence' As to the politics of the matter, it is not at all clear that a cut would be to the government's advantage. One of the Conservatives' most precious electoral assets is the public perception that they are to be trusted with the management of the economy. The Tories' 'economic competence' rating scores consistently higher than Labour's. It has continued to do so even through a period when there has been reason to question that competence. A little light electoral bribery on March 10 might be met by a heavy barrage of criticism. That could destroy the Conservatives' image as the better economic managers. There is also the evidence of the opinion polls. These indicate that there is an overwhelming majority, spread across all parties and income groups, that favours public expenditure over a cut in the standard rate. Politicians tend to disregard such results on the grounds that what people say in answers to questionnaires is different from what they do when they calculate the effect on their own incomes. This is true, but the size of the majorities against tax reductions suggests that there could be a residual loss for the government if it went that route. This is not to say that the government has to go naked into the electoral arena. There is still time for it to refine a series of radical policies to offer the voters. There is plenty in Labour's programme that can be attacked, not least the unclarified starting level of higher rate taxation and the vague assurances that the removal of the ceiling on national insurance contributions may be phased in. Labour is vulnerable to the charge that its many promises cannot be kept without either a higher rate of economic growth than seems achievable under its proposals, or further taxation. One or other side of its equation - the rebuilding of the public-sector infrastructure or the means of financing it - must be unsound. There is no need for a Tory tax bribe to reinforce that argument.</p>

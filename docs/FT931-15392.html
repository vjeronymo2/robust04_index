			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Second strike called at TSB BIFU, THE banking union, called a second one-day strike of its 19,000 members in branches of TSB Retail Banking and Insurance yesterday, and said there might be separate lightning strikes in TSB computer centres. The one-day strike called for January 22 follows what the union claimed was a successful one-day strike in the TSB's branch network last Friday. Bifu said it had agreed with TSB to cancel negotiating meetings scheduled for this week to discuss issues including the annual pay round. It said it was willing to talk to the bank about the dispute at the Acas conciliation service. TSB said that it was willing to negotiate with Bifu over the redundancies at any time, and it hoped the union would approach any talks 'in a constructive manner'.</p>

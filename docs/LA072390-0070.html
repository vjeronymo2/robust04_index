			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 2 OF TRIATHLON'S TOP 3 FINISHERS ARE DISQUALIFIED;  </P> <P> OXNARD: NINE PROFESSIONAL COMPETITORS IN ALL WERE ELIMINATED FOR SWERVING OFF A  NARROW BICYCLE COURSE TO AVOID HITTING SLOWER COMPETITORS.  </P> <P> The Oxnard Triathlon stumbled in its first lunge into big-time sports events  Sunday when two of the top three finishers were disqualified for veering off a  narrow bicycle course to avoid crashing into slower contestants.  </P> <P> Organizers of the eighth annual event heavily promoted the $10,000 in prize  money that lured more than 700 amateurs and two dozen top professional  triathletes to compete in a combined 1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer bicycle  ride and eight-kilometer run.  </P> <P> But the event ended on a sour note as top competitors complained about an  unsafe bicycle course with a awkward mix of fast-paced pros and slower  amateurs.  </P> <P> "It doesn't feel like a win," said Brad Kearns, who was moved up to first place  after judges disqualified Miles Stewart of Australia and eight other  professional competitors. "A lot of pros were disqualified for something they  didn't have any control over.  </P> <P> "It is the first time Oxnard had a field with a lot of pros," Kearns said. "The  course was unsafe and it wasn't good for them to ride on. It is too bad for the  people who organized this."  </P> <P> Race director Rob Fukutomi acknowledged that the bike course was too narrow for  so many contestants. "But they were warned ahead of time," he said.  </P> <P> During the cycling leg of the event, bike riders were restricted to the bike  lanes of a loop running along Harbor Boulevard, Olivas Park Drive, Victoria  Avenue and 5th Street. The problem arose when faster professional triathletes  tried to pass slower amateurs on their second lap of the course.  </P> <P> "The worst thing about this race is that the bike course was much too narrow,"  said Stewart, 19, who was disqualified for swerving out of the bike path marked  by orange cones.  </P> <P> "Some of us are going twice as fast as others and if they swerve in front of us  we'll knock them down if we even touch them," Stewart said. "We have to trust  our judgment and go around them instead of getting into an accident."  </P> <P> Mike Zugmaier, an official with the Triathlon Federation USA, said judges had  no choice but to penalize those who broke the rules by departing from the  course.  </P> <P> "There were people out there who were trying to obey," Zugmaier said. "Some of  them fell back and went slower because they couldn't pass the other riders. It  wouldn't be fair if we just ignored the rules after the race."  </P> <P> But Kearns, who benefited from the disqualifications, disagreed. "When it's  dangerous to follow a rule, that shouldn't be a rule," Kearns said. Several  racers, including Mike Montgomery, 34, a professional triathlete who was  disqualified, said they would not be returning to Oxnard's event because of  problems with the course.  </P> <P> Fukutomi agreed that the success of future Oxnard Triathlons depends on what  happens with the bicycle course. Organizers will be faced with designing a new  course or widening the present one, he said. But both present problems of  adding to traffic congestion in the area.  </P> <P> "Or maybe this just won't be a pro race anymore so we don't have the same  problems we did this year," Fukutomi said. "But I don't want to do that."  </P> <P> For the past eight years, organizers have been trying to develop the race into  a premier event that would draw top athletes. For the first time, sponsors Bud  Light, Sizzler Restaurants and Pepsi put up $10,000 in prize money to attract  athletes from as far away as New York and Connecticut, as well as a few  international competitors.  </P> <P> When the triathlon first began, "It was like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney  saying 'Hey, let's put a show on in the barn,' " said Laura Mosqueda, assistant  race director. "We didn't really know what to do, but we just wanted to see if  we could do it."  </P> <P> Since then, the event has become a prestigious race with one of the largest  purses of state triathlons. On Sunday, the top competitors and wide field of  amateurs drew about 2,000 spectators to the park at Oxnard State Beach. An  additional 500 fans lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the bicyclists and  runners.  </P> <P> Although some professional triathletes complained about the bicycle course,  other pros and amateurs seemed to enjoy the three-leg event that began with a 7  a.m. swim in the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> Paula Newby-Fraser of Encinitas, who took first place in the women's division  for the fourth time in a row, said she was delighted to compete in the event.  She said she considers it "one of the top one or two in Southern California."  </P> <P> For Lisa Laiti of Leucadia, who came in second in the women's division, the  event marked her continued determination to disprove doctors' predictions that  she would never fully recover from two serious accidents. "But you can't listen  to the negative thoughts of other people," she said. "You have to listen to  what your body tells you and to what you believe."  </P> <P> In the men's division, Scott Tinley of Del Mar finished second behind Kearns.  Garrett McCarthy of Redondo Beach came in third.  </P> <P> Coming in last was Gordon Gooding, a 59-year-old Shadow Hills man with 12  grandchildren. Although he completed the race in less than three hours, he said  he had thoughts of quitting. "There was no one there at the back with me and it  gets kind of boring that way," he said. "But once I start something, I like to  finish it."  </P></p>

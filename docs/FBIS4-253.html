			<p>BFN     [Text] The first ordinary session of the Togolese National  Assembly could not begin this morning as scheduled due to lack  of quorum. Not all opposition deputies showed up at the  assembly session. Another conspicuous absence was that of  outgoing Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. From Lome,  Olabire da Cruz reports:    [Begin Da Cruz recording] Only 37 out of the remaining 78  deputies responded to the invitation to attend the National  Assembly session this morning, which was convened by the  chairman and most senior assembly man, Ayitoh Kossi of the  Action Committee for Renewal, who was himself absent in line  with the joint decision of his party, the Togolese Union for  Democracy, to suspend opposition deputies' participation in the  National Assembly deliberations until the Supreme Court  clarifies its decision to invalidate the election of three  deputies of the parliamentary majority.    Following the lack of quorum, the 37 deputies of the Rally  of  the Togolese People [RPT] and the Union for Justice and  Development, the RPT's ally, left the National Assembly, noting  with regret the absence of their 40 opposition colleagues.    The outgoing prime minister, the only elected candidate and  leader of the Coordination of New Forces, was also absent from  the session. Sources close to the prime minister's office said  however that the reason for his absence is quite different from  that of the opposition deputies.    We note that this morning's session was notably to allow  deputies to discuss the assembly's standing orders. The  referent documents on the standing orders were distributed to  the parliamentarians on 30 March for prior study. [end recording]</p>

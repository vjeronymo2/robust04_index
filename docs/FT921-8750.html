			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Gardening: Scotland's green Heaven NIGHT after night, artificially-keen weathermen have been telling us that it will be warmer and wetter in the north. Down here in the south, frosts have been sharper than we thought at first, and not every good plant has come through unscathed. But what, I had been wondering, was the state of gardens north of the border? To find out, I have been on a northern mission, not expecting tropical forests but unsure whether snowdrops, for instance, would yet be in flower. I had intended this report to be controlled rigorously: aconites in Motherwell, the first sign of bluebells in Dundee. It has gone off the straight and narrow because I have been seduced. It might be the air or the bottled water but, whenever I go to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh, I lose my wits. I walk round in aimless circles for hours, like a spaniel let out from a hot car. Leave Kew to run its admission charges: in Edinburgh, entrance is still free. It will soon be cheaper to take a coach pass up there to see what are far-better gardens, anyway. Signs of quality confront you immediately. Up the tarmac path to the main entrance, there are two new beds of pernettyas, showing those dusky pink and white berries which develop so prettily on lime-free soil. Inside, the light falls magically on the pure white trunks of the eastern birches. Winter is an excellent guide: its highlights are fewer and so it sets its own trail, leading you from one to the next. I could dwell on the many types of snowdrop, with names like Mighty Atom, in bloom on Britain's finest rock garden. Pink and white flowers have declared that the rhododendron season is open, not only on the mauve-pink praecox but on the superior mucronolatum. Below the new greenhouses, dozens of single pink flowers are already open on a fine camellia called Bow Bells. Inside, there are clouds of pale-yellow mimosa and some huge violet-blue flowers on the tibouchina, that lovely Brazilian plant for a conservatory. The show of the month is called the Rain Forest Experience, in which a thatched straw hut asks visitors to try to forget they are under glass in Scotland. Prince Charles has written a letter of support, but Rain Foresters will have to forgive me: the Alpine Experience is very much better. Beyond the Tropical Rock glasshouse, you can find a magical corner. Perhaps, this weekend, there is a better one somewhere in an unknown garden but I think I refuse to believe it. In my local botanic garden in Oxford, I have been smiling contentedly at one good witch hazel and its gold-yellow flowers. We are growing old together, but only one of us is improving with age. In Edinburgh, there is not one but a whole hamamelis corner, ranging from the pale-yellow pallida to the dusky flavopurpurascens, which I have never seen anywhere else. Their companions are as charming as their scent: half a dozen varieties of winter-flowering viburnum in full beauty all over their bare stems. I have already decided on a swathe of viburnums under trees beside my house. In Edinburgh, the sweetest form was unexpected to me: not Farreri or Dawn but Charles Lamont. Naturally, it would not have been unexpected to Arthur Hellyer, who has been writing about the forgotten importance of the Lamont blood-line and the value of this variety. Naturally, too, he is right. The Charles branch of the Lamont family is a generous performer with an aversion to shady corners. He covers himself in the sweetest pink-white flowers. Below the nearby wall, there are clumps of the palest Algerian iris, the form called Walter Butt. A few yards away, there is another world in the gardens' famous Alpine House. The mood changes with the season, but this weekend it takes you to far finer worlds than a steamy rain forest. There are pans of exceptional crocus, the big lilac-blue veluchensis and the exquisite corsicus, the flowers of which are feathered with yellow and dark streaks of a pale lavender. Sub-species of wild cyclamen proliferate, from pink and white to rare Turkish varieties. Special forms of corydalis are out in force; one of the dionysias is covered with pale mauve flowers; you forget that it is still winter as the entire corner around you seems to have jumped into spring. Its leap has been helped by the usual scattering of plants which I have never seen anywhere in the past 30 years. If you think that aconites are all yellow, go and look at a rare Japanese variety, flowering its grey-lavender head off in a pan in Edinburgh. Best of all, admire the small narcissi, where the brightest is a lemon-yellow form in the Hooped Petticoat class called Jenny Jane. The prettiest use for a cold greenhouse is to fill it with alpine plants and bulbs which need no heating: Edinburgh will show you how to do it. For me, it is simply a visit to Heaven. The Edinburgh gardens could bemuse you for half a lifetime, not least because there is one thing which the rest of us have in plenty but, somehow, they seem to exclude. That something is weeds - but it is hard to catch sight of any lying undisturbed among this extraordinary collection of every sort of plant.</p>

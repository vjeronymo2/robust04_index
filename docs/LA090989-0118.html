			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S FIRST GAY PRIDE FESTIVAL TO OPEN  </P> <P> After months of protests from some fundamentalist Christians, Orange County's  first gay pride festival is set to open today at Centennial Regional Park in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The two-day festival is the first major organized gay celebration in a county  known for its conservativism, and national gay activists and opponents of  homosexuality alike have stated they will monitor the event. Opponents say 300  persons will march today along the park's boundaries to protest the event.  </P> <P> The festival itself will be a modest production compared to other gay pride  festivals in West Hollywood and San Francisco, which feature hundreds of booths  and dozens of stages.  </P> <P> In Orange County, simplicity is the key word. The festival will be one-fifth  the scale of the one in West Hollywood.  </P> <P> It will be a "generic" celebration, said Janet Avery, president of Orange  County Cultural Pride, the nonprofit group organizing the event.  </P> <P> "We have no glitz or glamour," Avery said.  </P> <P> On Friday, organizers began setting up about 50 booths from a variety of  organizations, including the Gay Democrats of Orange County and the Republican  Log Cabin club, in the 87-acre park's multipurpose field. A chain-link fence  has been put up to border the festival grounds.  </P> <P> Volunteers have pitched a 40-by-70-foot tent to house Art Expo, a display of  more than 100 works of art by 20 artists that range from simple sketches of a  pickup truck to landscape oil paintings. The Art Expo is the festival's largest  exhibition.  </P> <P> An outdoor cafe has been built in the center of the site.  </P> <P> Music and comedy will be performed both days on a main stage in the corner of  the site. Festival hours will be 10 a.m. to 11 p.m today and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Sunday. Admission is $10.  </P> <P> The festival's main draw is expected to be a parade Sunday in which more than  60 participants, including Orange County's chapter of Parents and Friends of  Lesbians and Gays, will march a mile around the park's lake.  </P> <P> The theme, like that at many other gay pride celebrations this year, is  "Stonewall 20: A Generation of Pride," marking the 20th anniversary of the  birth of the gay movement in New York City. In 1969, a police raid on a gay bar  called the Stonewall provoked a three-day riot, increasing awareness of  homosexual rights issues.  </P> <P> In Orange County, organizers have also adopted the slogan "Orange County Comes  Out." A pink triangle inside an orange is the symbol of the event. Organizers  adopted the pink triangle because homosexuals were forced to wear pink  triangles in Nazi concentration camps.  </P> <P> The cost of the festival will be about $65,000 and will be covered by donations  and fund-raisers, Avery said. About $15,000 of the money already has gone to  Santa Ana for a security bond.  </P> <P> Despite contentions from opponents that the festival would present a "clear and  present danger" to the community because of the number of people it would  attract, Santa Ana police said they do not foresee problems.  </P> <P> Police Lt. Robert Helton said the police are prepared to handle crowds as large  as the 10,000 predicted by organizers.  </P> <P> The park will also be patrolled by county park rangers and security guards,  Avery said.  </P> <P> The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, leader of an Anaheim-based lobbying group called the  Traditional Values Coalition and the festival's staunchest opponent, said he  expects more than 300 protesters to turn out Saturday. The counterdemonstration  will be held on sidewalks of Edinger and Fairview streets bordering the park.  </P> <P> "We are doing peaceful demonstrations on the sidewalk for the heterosexual  ethic," Sheldon said in an interview.  </P> <P> Sheldon said his protest will be held Saturday, but not Sunday.  </P> <P> "We're not going to desecrate the Lord's day," he said.  </P> <P> Sheldon said his supporters are continuing their effort to recall six of the  seven Santa Ana City Council members who refused to sign a statement promising  to ban the gay pride festival.  </P></p>

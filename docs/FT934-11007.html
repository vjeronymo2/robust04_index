			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / National party ahead in NZ poll NEW ZEALAND'S ruling National party appears increasingly likely to win Saturday's general election, aided by a surprising late run from the third-ranking Alliance, according to the last national opinion poll to be conducted before the election. The Heylen polling organisation yesterday confirmed other recent polls which showed that the Alliance is attracting votes from Labour supporters, reducing its prospects of victory. Up to a fortnight ago, Labour and National were attracting similar levels of support at around 40 per cent. Mr Mike Moore, the Labour leader, worried by the loss of support, this week switched the focus of his campaign to fight on two fronts: attacking both the government and the Alliance. The Alliance is led by Mr Jim Anderton, a dissident former Labour MP who as party president orchestrated Labour's landslide victory in 1984 before resigning over its move to the right. Mr Anderton stitched together an apparently unlikely consortium of opposition groups, including left-wing trade unionists, former Labour party members, the Green party, the Social Credit party, and a Maori opposition group Mana Matahaki led by Mr Mat Rata, a former Minister of Maori Affairs in a past Labour government. They are united in wanting to overturn the 'monetarist' reform programmes followed since 1984 by both National and Labour parties in government. The poll showed that National had increased its lead by one percentage point to 39 per cent. Labour was down two points to 32 per cent as support grew for the Alliance, especially in the key marginal Auckland seats which are expected to decide the outcome of the election. The Alliance was up one point to 17 per cent, and New Zealand First, led by Mr Winston Peters, a dissident former Maori MP, was down one point to 9 per cent. Mr Moore remained the preferred prime minister with 22 per cent support. Mr Anderton was up five points to 15 per cent to match the prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, while Mr Peters had 14 per cent support. The poll also showed that voters were moving towards favouring a continuation of the Westminster-style first-past-the-post electoral system ahead of a referendum being conducted along with the election. Support for that system had increased to 41 per cent, while that for the German mixed member proportional option was down slightly at 46 per cent. This time last year only 20 per cent of voters favoured the UK method while 72 per cent wanted the German system.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE NOTES: DIFFICULTY IN IDENTIFYING GRAPES  </P> <P> The controversy over what is a Zinfandel grape and what is not has become a  side issue in the grape-switching cases filed by the state against a number of  grape sellers.  </P> <P> Should the buyer of grapes be able to identify the grape type by looking at  them? State and federal government agencies are looking into the question of  culpability by some wine makers who the agencies think should have known the  difference. But it's not that easy to tell one variety from another, say the  experts.  </P> <P> Bob Steinhauer, viticulturist and vineyard manager for all of Beringer  Vineyards' vast holdings around the state, says it's far easier to identify  Zinfandel grapes while they are on the vine than after they have been harvested  and sitting in a gondola.  </P> <P> Steinhauer notes that once they are picked, the grapes no longer have their  leaves, and it's from the configuration of the leaf that the buyer of the  grapes should be able to identity the grape.  </P> <P> "Zinfandel has a five-lobed leaf with tomentum (tiny, fuzzy hair) on the  underside of the leaf," said Steinhauer.  </P> <P> "I think you could be confused by a load of Petite Sirah, but on the vine, you  can tell the Petite Sirah because it's glabrous (has no hair on the underside  of the leaf)."  </P> <P> There were more unanimous gold medal-winning wines -- 10 -- at this year's  Orange County Fair Wine Competition than ever.  </P> <P> The unanimous awards, called Four-Star Golds, went to the following wines: 1985  Bargetto Komes Ranch Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($12), in the medium-priced  category; 1986 Concannon Selected Vineyards California Chardonnay ($10.85),  medium; 1987 J. Kerr Santa Barbara County Chardonnay ($16), high-priced; 1987  Edna Valley Vineyard Estate Chardonnay ($15), high; 1987 Kistler Estate  Chardonnay ($35), premium-priced; 1988 Windsor California Grenache Rose ($5),  medium; 1987 Gary Farrell Howard Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir ($20), high; 1986  Sanford Santa Barbara Pinot Noir ($14), high; 1987 Lytton Springs Zinfandel  ($12), high, and NV Cook's Imperial Blush sparkling wine ($3.99), low.  </P> <P> About 2,500 wines were judged at this year's competition.  </P> <P> St. Supery Vineyards and Winery, located between Rutherford and Oakville in the  Napa Valley, will open its doors with tours on July 27.  </P> <P> The winery project, estimated to cost in excess of $10 million, is owned by  Robert Skalli and is a subsidiary of Skalli S.A. of France, a giant food  company.  </P> <P> An hourlong tour will include a glimpse of life in the 1880s, when the property  was first farmed as a wine-making venture, and all wine tasting will be barrel  samples from as-yet unreleased wine.  </P> <P> I was impressed with two wines that recently won gold medals at the Alameda  County Fair wine competition. Both are in short supply and may be hard to find,  but the prices are so fair they are mentioned here.  </P> <P>  -- 1987 Retzlaff Livermore Grey Riesling ($5.95): Fresh and broad tasting,  this attractively dry wine with a soft finish is a nice picnic wine.  </P> <P>  -- 1988 Chouinard Monterey County Gewurztraminer ($6.50): The spice character  of this fine wine is akin to carnations and litchi nuts, and the rather  full-bodied taste comes in part from 1.5% residual sugar masked by high  acidity. Excellent with spicy foods.  </P> <P> A third gold medal-winning wine at the competition, 1986 Concannon Sauvignon  Blanc ($9.50) is a striking example of great wine making and perfect barrel and  bottle aging. The crisp acidity and rich finish from its aging regimen make  this a classic that reminds me of Graves in Bordeaux.  </P> <P> One more gold medal wine from this event that impressed the judges was a  nonvintage sparkling Malvasia Bianca, a very sweet and luscious dessert wine  that, at $6, is a steal. Serve it with fruit salad and watch people ask for  more.  </P> <P> It has taken some time, but the first all-Freixenet Gloria Ferrer wine is on  the market and it's an excellent example of why on-site control is better than  remote control.  </P> <P> More than three years ago, when the first sparkling wine of the Gloria Ferrer  winery came on the market, it impressed a lot of people with its complex,  French-like nature and the fact that it was so well conceived.  </P> <P> The fact was that the first California wine from this Spanish-owned house was a  joint project of then-wine maker Eileen Crane and Pete Downs, who was and  remains wine maker for Chateau St. Jean's sparkling wine project at Graton. The  reason for this was simple: at the time, there was no Gloria Ferrer winery. It  had not yet been built.  </P> <P> So in order to release a wine soon after the announcement of the project,  Gloria Ferrer contracted with St. Jean to have it make the first Gloria Ferrer  sparkling wine.  </P> <P> The fact is, Downs has never received much public credit for the sparkling  wines he has made for a number of producers who contracted with Chateau St.  Jean to make their wines at Graton. (Among them were the wines of Shadow Creek,  now a brand owned by Domaine Chandon.) And only savvy consumers knew that the  first Gloria Ferrer wine was from Downs.  </P> <P> Indeed, many sparkling wines made by Downs carried small print on the bottle of  the label that said the wine was produced and bottled at Graton. There is only  one sparkling wine operation in Graton. It is St. Jean's.  </P> <P> The second and third wines released by Gloria Ferrer had labels saying they  were produced and bottled at Windsor. The only sparkling wine facility at  Windsor is at Piper-Sonoma, where these wines were made under the eye of Chris  Markell.  </P> <P> As good as these wines all were, none is as good as the latest Gloria Ferrer  wine, made completely in Gloria Ferrer's gorgeous, newly completed winery  building. And even though it is a nonvintage wine, Gloria Ferrer Brut, you can  still determine who made it.  </P> <P> In the address line at the bottom of the label, it says this wine was produced  and bottled in Sonoma. This is the first wine of now-wine maker Bob Iantosca.  (Crane is now general manager for Domaine Carneros, the Taittinger project down  the road from Gloria Ferrar that has yet to release a product.)  </P> <P> Iantosca's first solo effort, and the first release with a "Sonoma" address, is  a sprightly, delicate, finely made wine that has a crisp, slightly lime zest  note in the taste.  </P> <P> At $13, it's well-priced and proof that hands-on control leads to better wine.  </P></p>

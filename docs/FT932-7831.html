			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Personal View: IMF leads where others must follow 'Much ado about lending', by Edward Balls and John Lloyd (May 12, 1993), had too much ado about gossip among unnamed officials, and more than a little misinformation about help provided in the past and now made available to Russia and other transition economies by the International Monetary Fund. Readers may be misled into believing that money is about to be dispensed without regard for the pace and quality of economic reforms. Such misperceptions could harm the reform process and western support. A closer look at what transpired last year would have helped Mr Balls and Mr Lloyd to appreciate why the IMF recently initiated a fresh approach. They might have avoided repeating the myth that only Dollars 1bn of an original Dollars 24bn aid package (for Russia) was disbursed in 1992. In fact, the IMF alone disbursed Dollars 1bn. Bilateral credits and European Community disbursements totalled another Dollars 16bn, and formal debt rescheduling plus the accumulation of arrears conferred effective debt relief of Dollars 14bn. Views may differ on how to count all this against the ill-defined Dollars 24bn promised by western governments but everyone should understand that Russia, by standard measures of external financing applied by the IMF to all countries, effectively received financing of about Dollars 30bn. Russia could have obtained more help by now from the IMF and elsewhere, and be closer to a stable market economy, if it had been able to adhere to the economic and financial programme the government drew up last summer. Unfortunately, support within Russia for halting inflation and accelerating basic reforms was not broad enough, and crucial supporting institutional arrangements were not in place. Credit expansion by the central bank and the government's budget went badly off track, while most legal and institutional reform failed to accelerate. The problem was not that 'the IMF tried to nail down too many details', but that the government and central bank did not implement their own programme. From long hard experience in many countries the IMF has learned that the devil is usually in the details. Successful implementation of a stabilisation programme requires that the authorities themselves pay full attention to the details. Some states of the former Soviet Union and other transition economies have also encountered unanticipated difficulty in sustaining economic reform programmes, although by contrast the three Baltic states have had considerable success so far, and not by ignoring the 'details'. What could be done? Long before any Group of Seven pronouncements, the IMF was evaluating ways to help transition economies to focus on the preliminary steps necessary in vital areas before they could execute comprehensive, fully articulated economic programmes. Concern was also mounting over the deteriorating external payments situation facing many of them, due to the collapse of state-directed trade and payments systems and to abrupt hikes in oil and gas import costs as energy prices were raised towards world market levels. An innovative form of IMF engagement was needed, and quickly. The solution devised was a special temporary lending window, similar to others set up by the IMF in the past, with a more concentrated, streamlined version of the conditionality associated with traditional IMF standby credits. That is where Mr Balls and Mr Lloyd are especially wide of the mark: far from jettisoning 'financial considerations', the chief element for countries to qualify for the new IMF loans will be adoption of the critical measures needed to move towards financial stability. Mr Lawrence Summers is right: conditionality is being focused, not weakened. In all its lending operations the IMF seeks credible assurances - including initial actions - that sound financial policies will indeed be taken by borrowing countries. Only then does the IMF begin to disburse. Further drawings are conditional on agreed indicators of financial stabilisation being met. The IMF's new 'Systemic Transformation Facility' (STF), to provide modest opening round help to hard-pressed transition economies, was unveiled to strong support from its executive board. The ensuing Tokyo endorsement by the G7 of the IMF proposal was gratifying, but equally vital will be additional G7 financial support. A large G7 bilateral aid package for Russia is welcome, but support for the other transition economies, many highly interdependent with Russia, has still to be announced. Here again the IMF is taking the lead - the first STF drawing has just been approved for Kyrgyzstan. The G7 and others must soon follow.

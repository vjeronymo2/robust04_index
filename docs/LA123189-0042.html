			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPARTURES  </P> <P> When Lucille Ball's heart gave out, Americans responded with a flood of  heartfelt emotion normally reserved for only the most intimate of friends. In a  sense, the pumpkin-haired co-creator and star of "I Love Lucy" was just that.  Durning the Golden Age of TV, she turned up weekly in the living rooms of 40  million viewers. In reruns, she is bound to continue entertaining well into the  21st Century. Perhaps President Bush summed it up best. The whole world, he  declared, loved Lucy. Overall, the year took a heavy toll on Hollywood. Others  who died included actors Bette Davis and Lord Laurence Olivier; Man of 1,000  Voices Mel Blanc, and songwriters Irving Berlin ("God Bless America," "White  Christmas"), Johnny Green ("Body and Soul"), Sammy Fain ("Love Is a Many  Splendored Thing") and Sammy Lerner ("I'm Popeye the Sailor Man"). Oh yes,  another major Los Angeles voice was lost in 1989. The feisty Los Angeles Herald  Examiner expired as a result of dwindling circulation and ad revenues, leaving  the city with only one regional newspaper. Other notable passings: local TV  news ace Bill Stout, former Roman Catholic archdiocese leader Cardinal Timothy  Manning, boxing great Sugar Ray Robinson, innovative dance troupe founder Alvin  Ailey and the Pan Pacific Auditorium. The latter, Los Angeles' primary example  of the Streamline Moderne architectural style of the 1930s, was destroyed in a  suspicious fire.  </P></p>

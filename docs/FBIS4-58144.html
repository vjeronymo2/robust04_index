			<p>BFN     [Text] Reacting to claims by Jordan Valley settlers that  they would no longer be permitted to drive through Jericho as of  Wednesday [4 May], an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Central  Command spokesman clarified that there would be no traffic  changes in the Jericho area after the inception of autonomy.  The spokesman clarified that the road through Jericho would  remain open to Israeli vehicles.    Major General Ilan Biran, the commander of the Central  Command, nevertheless decided to accede to the settlers' request  and to open the road along the border near Jordan, which is  currently being renovated.</p>

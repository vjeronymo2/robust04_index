			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Income of Crown Estate set to soar The Crown Estate, which owns large tracts of London's West End, including all of Regent Street, will see its income rise sharply in the next decade as many of its long-running fixed-rent leases expire. The estate, which yesterday announced a 6 per cent rise in net rents, said prospects for income growth in Regent Street, one of the world's premier shopping streets, were excellent. Mr Christopher Howes, chief executive, said ground leases on about a quarter of the 123 Regent Street properties fell due between now and 2005. The properties represent the bulk of 42 buildings let in the street during the 1920s on long leases and fixed rents which are now very low. Mr Howes said: 'They account for about 28 per cent of Regent Street's capital value of Pounds 305m, but produce only 4 per cent of its rents.' The estate is part of the hereditary possessions of the sovereign, managed under the provisions of the Crown Estate Act 1961 by the Crown Estate. The net surplus, after deductions for management expenses, is paid to the Exchequer. The organisation's role dates back to 1760, when King George III handed over profits from the Crown's estates to parliament in exchange for the provision of the Civil List. Under new Civil List arrangements the Queen will receive Pounds 7.9m this year. The revenue surplus to be handed to parliament increased 6.2 per cent last year to Pounds 78.9m. More than two thirds of income and 77 per cent of capital value was generated from urban property, four-fifths in central London. The value of the estate's property portfolio also rose in 1993-94 - for the first time in four years - increasing by 17.5 per cent to Pounds 1.95bn. In 1990, however, the value of the estate's property portfolio was almost Pounds 2.4bn. The surplus on rents, however, has risen throughout the recession, increasing by 80 per cent since 1988-89. This was due mainly to a decision in 1989 to curtail all new development. More recently the estate has increased investments outside the capital in business parks in Cambridge and Guildford, offices in St Albans and a retail park in Leamington Spa. The estate is responsible for managing 55 per cent of Britain's foreshore, almost all of the seabed out to 12 miles, as well as large tracts of farmland and forests. Agricultural income last year increased by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 9.13m while income from marine activities rose by 10.5 per cent to Pounds 14.7m. The estate expects to increase its total revenue surplus to about Pounds 81m in the current financial year.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YANKEE EXECUTIVE SUES VINCENT  </P> <P> A New York Yankee executive sued Fay Vincent in federal court Tuesday, accusing  the commissioner of trying to run him and George Steinbrenner out of baseball.  </P> <P> Leonard L. Kleinman, executive vice president and chief operating executive of  the Yankees, made the allegation in a $22-million suit against Vincent and John  M. Dowd, the commissioner's special counsel who directed an investigation of  Steinbrenner's dealings with gambler Howard Spira.  </P> <P> Kleinman accused Vincent of framing him and Steinbrenner on charges they acted  against the best interests of baseball and of covering up ex-Yankee outfielder  Dave Winfield's involvement with Spira.  </P> <P> The suit in Manhattan's federal court seeks to stop Vincent from holding a  hearing Thursday to determine possible disciplinary action against Kleinman.  U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand will hear arguments today on Kleinman's  request for a temporary restraining order to block Vincent's hearing.  </P></p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: How companies can relieve the problem of a substantial tax burden COMPANIES CAN boost UK profits to furnish more corporation tax to relieve the ACT by moving costs - such as R&amp;D and borrowings - abroad, while bringing more revenue to the UK. Pilkington, the international glass group which shoulders a substantial burden of ACT, decided last year to move its R&amp;D facility to Brussels. The group's ACT problem cannot but have been a consideration. Most companies offer shareholders the choice of taking dividends in shares rather than cash, as ACT is not payable on scrip dividends. But they are unattractive to tax-free institutional investors who cannot reclaim the tax credit, and generally have a low take-up rate. Some companies have gone to the extent of making acquisitions in order to buy capacity to relieve ACT. This can be a by-product of a normal acquisition, but there are schemes which appear to be simply moves to avoid tax. The purchasers are naturally reluctant to discuss such schemes - one finance director when asked if his company had employed one said: 'Let's just say I am familiar with how they work'. The sellers are also secretive. One said: 'It does no one any good to have these things talked about'. Recent sellers include Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathroom group which sold four subsidiaries with net asset values totalling Pounds 1.6m for up to Pounds 11.3m. In May, Farnell Electronics, the electrical components distributor, sold a subsidiary with net assets of Pounds 6.2m for Pounds 12.7m. The unofficial market in subsidiaries, organised by tax consultants, allows companies with a subsidiary which has paid corporation tax over the previous six years in excess of its own ACT requirements to strip the subsidiary of its trading activities and sell it. The buyer then passes dividends through the subsidiary and offsets the ACT on those dividends against the corporation tax paid by its former own-ers. The Inland Revenue is understood to be looking at such schemes carefully, and may apply Sections 703 and 704 of the 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes Act - which require that there is a genuine commercial reason for the transaction. One finance director of a large, international public company, says: 'We receive suggestions on ACT regularly and look at them carefully. We discard 98-99 per cent of them either because they are inappropriate or of doubtful legality. 'The key is whether you can genuinely say there is a valid reason for the transaction other than avoidance of tax, otherwise the Inland Revenue will challenge it. We have done one or two which the Inland Revenue will challenge but we believe we can say there is a genuine commercial reason.'</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet Jewish emigration continued at a high rate in February with 2,226  arrivals in the West, the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration reported in  Geneva. The figure brought to 4,842 the total for the first two months of 1989.  Although down slightly from the January figure of 2,616, the number of Soviet  Jews allowed to leave by Moscow in February was still far higher than last  year's monthly average of 1,673. By contrast, the monthly average in 1987 was  668, and it was only 79 in 1986. Meanwhile, in Moscow, a group of about 20  Soviet Jews staged their first protest in half a year, gathering near the  Kremlin to accuse the government of violating global human rights agreements by  barring their emigration. Police made no move to halt the protest.  </P></p>

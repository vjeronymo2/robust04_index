			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why goodwill can be bad news Following what turned out in 1991 to be the advertising industry's worst post-war year, few advertising agencies are prepared to square up precisely to how financially strapped they are. The recession could hardly have come at a worse time, following as it did the acquisition-driven merger mania of the previous decade and ensuing debts. However, investors in the advertising sector can now turn for guidance to a report* produced by Willott Kingston Smith, the London-based accountancy firm. Taking as the basis for its survey the most recent annual accounts of 50 public and private companies, the study concludes that, in aggregate terms, the companies paid 45 per cent of their combined operating profits - Pounds 97m - in interest during their last financial year. This compared with Pounds 81m (22 per cent) the previous year. Collectively, pre-tax profits collapsed by 76 per cent and profit margins halved; 36 per cent of the companies incurred a pre-tax loss, compared with 16 per cent a year earlier. In terms of returns on capital employed, the study concludes that the advertising sector, overall, has fallen behind expectations. The survey states that 'the measurement of profits as a return on capital employed in the business has become of increasing importance' following agencies' acquisitions of other companies, investment in freehold properties and spending 'on anything from information technology to fleets of smart cars. At its most basic, the return on the investment must leave a margin of profit after paying interest on the capital borrowed to run the business.' The report points out that 'the balance sheets of acquisitive UK public companies do not show the full extent of the capital which has been ploughed into the business' because of the perfectly legal practice of immediately writing off any amounts paid for the goodwill of companies which have been acquired in the past. This was a practice popular with many of the companies in the report in the 1980s, since it helped them with further acquisitions. Willott Kingston Smith have thus reconstructed the balance sheets of the companies involved to include the goodwill as an asset, giving 'a more meaningful view of the total capital employed'. On that adjusted basis, 'the return on average capital employed by the top 50 groups (including both quoted and private companies) . . . was a meagre 4.38 per cent. Much higher returns averaging 10.2 per cent were achieved by many of the unquoted UK groups, particularly those which have eschewed the acquisition trail. 'But the returns achieved by most UK quoted groups, after reinstating goodwill write-offs, were quite unacceptable at an average of just 0.4 per cent. Only CIA group (31.3 per cent), Geers Gross (26.4 per cent) and Abbott Mead Vickers (21.9 per cent) could claim to be operating at a respectable margin. None of the three had been particularly acquisitive.' *Financial Performance of Marketing Services Companies, 1992. Willott Kingston Smith, 15 Cavendish Square, London W1M 9DA. Pounds 100.</p>

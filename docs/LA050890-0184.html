			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EL AL TELLS $24.2-MILLION PROFIT  </P> <P> State-owned El Al Israel Airlines today reported profit of $24.2 million for  1989, its fourth consecutive year in the black.  </P> <P> The profit marked a 28.7% jump from El Al's 1988 earnings of $18.8 million.  Revenues rose 7.2% to $713.6 million from $665.3 million in 1988.  </P> <P> El Al said it carried 1.74 million passengers last year, 12% more than in 1988,  when tourism to Israel fell sharply in the early months of a Palestinian  uprising in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip.  </P> <P> The sustained profitability is likely to enhance prospects of floating El Al  shares on the Tel Aviv and foreign stock exchanges, proposed as part of  Israel's privatization drive.  </P></p>

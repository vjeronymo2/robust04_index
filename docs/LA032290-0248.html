			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> YALE GETS POET'S RARE LETTERS  </P> <P> Twenty-eight letters from American poet Ezra Pound to Irish novelist James  Joyce are among a major new acquisition by the Beinecke Rare Book and  Manuscript Library at Yale, university officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The letters, plus other correspondence and manuscripts, were among the papers  of Eugene and Maria Jolas, founders of the avant-garde magazine, Transition,  and close friends of Joyce during the last decade of his life. Joyce died in  1941.  </P> <P> The materials shed light on Joyce's years in Paris, the university said. Very  few scholars have had access to the material, although a handful of the Pound  letters have been published, an official said. The letters discuss various  literary matters.  </P></p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Management buy-out at Dollond &amp; Aitchison Gallaher, the UK subsidiary of American Brands, has sold the UK's largest optical retailer, Dollond &amp; Aitchison, and its other European optical businesses to its management for Pounds 94m. Mr Peter Wilson, Gallaher's chairman and chief executive, said the optical business was sold because it 'does not form part of our plans for the strategic development of the group', which has substantial UK interests in tobacco, spirits, retail distribution and housewares. The buy-out is one of the largest in Europe this year, with total financing amounting to more than Pounds 100m, split equally between debt and equity. There have been two earlier attempts at an MBO since late 1992. These fell through because of the complexity of the pan-European transaction, the uncertain economic climate, and the devaluation of the peseta in November 1992 and May 1993. The successful transaction was led by CVC Capital Partners, part of Citicorp Ventures, while the debt portion was led by NatWest Acquisition Finance. CVC said it planned to float the company within the next five years. The venture capitalist owns 90 per cent of D&amp;A's equity, with the remainder owned by the senior management, who will remain with the company. D&amp;A achieved sales of Pounds 240m in the year to November 27 1993, and a trading profit of Pounds 14.9m. In addition to its UK business, which has a 13 per cent market share, D&amp;A owns the largest optical chain in Spain, General Optica, and Italy, where it trades under the Salmoiraghi Vigano name. It also operates outlets in the IrishRepublic. The UK and Spanish businesses contribute the bulk of earnings, but the company also owns the Keeler optical instrument company. The group employs 5,000 people. Gallaher purchased D&amp;A from Slater Walker in 1970, and built up its European presence. Mr Peter Coldwell, D&amp;A's chief executive, said: 'As a bank-backed business it may make us sharpen our pencils, but I don't think you will see a dramatic change in strategy.' The UK business, which fell into losses at the outset of the recession in 1989, is now recovering rapidly. Mr Coldwell said D&amp;A planned to build up the number of franchise outlets.</p>

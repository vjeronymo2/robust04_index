			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Glasgow Income net asset value rises Glasgow Income Trust reported a net asset value of 48.64p per share as at March 31, up from 47.68p at its September year end and 43.46p at end-March 1993. The total return on net assets at the period end was 5.2 per cent, against 5.5 per cent on the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. Gearing stood at 8.2 per cent, funded by short-term borrowing; directors said the employment of gearing reflected their view that after recent weakness, particularly among large capitalisation stocks, UK equities represented 'good value'. Net revenue dipped to Pounds 353,000 (Pounds 362,000) for earnings of 1.18p (1.23p). A second interim dividend of 0.6p maintains the total at 1.2p, requiring a transfer of Pounds 17,000 from the revenue reserve.</p>

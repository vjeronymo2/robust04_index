			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Jianwei (1728 0256 0251): "Law Enforcement </F> Organs Abuse Office for Profits"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] After lying dormant during the  drive to improve the economic climate and rectify the economic  order, the economy rebounded before long and bold reform slogans  replaced the debate over whether one should call something  "socialist" or "capitalist." Unfortunately a number of law  enforcement organs, responding to the slogan of "overhauling our  thinking, changing our ideas, and serving economic construction"  but misinterpreting the policy, behave in a way that departs  from the law in doing their job, as epitomized currently by  their abuse of power to profit themselves illegally.    First of all, they confiscate, collect fees, and impose  fines  arbitrarily. Taking advantage of their power to manage traffic,  public security organs set up checkpoints, stop traffic, impose  fines, and confiscate as they please. As managers of the  permanent residency registration system, they arbitrarily demand  payments, all clearly marked on a price list, from peasants who  want to switch from agriculture to a non-agricultural sector and  from people who want to transfer their residency registration  from one locality to another. As keepers of law and order, they  arbitrarily confiscate and impose fines higher than the maximum  amounts allowed under the regulations. As investigators of  crime, they arbitrarily collect fees and impose fines,  masquerading them as "deposits," and replace prison sentences  with fines or confiscation, even demanding a "case-solving" fee  from the victim or defendant. As managers of prisons and  detention centers, they demand from suspects and defendants in  custody as well as convicted criminals money to cover meals and  collect from them a "management fee." Relatives of convicted  criminals who come to visit are told to pay a "visitation  management fee." Abusing their power to investigate some cases,  to approve and rule on arrests, and to file charges,  procuratorial organs substitute a fine for a prison sentence and  collect "deposits," "exemption from lawsuit fees," "exemption  from lawsuit study fees," and "exemption from lawsuit bang jiao  fees" arbitrarily. Taking advantage of their judicial power,  judicial organs collect "sentence suspension fees," "sentence  suspension study fees," and "sentence suspension bang jiao fees"  arbitrarily. Judicial administrative organs in prisons and  reform-through-labor facilities even go so far as to allow  criminals in custody who have already been sentenced to go out  to engage in commercial activities and take a cut of the  latter's profits.    Second, acting ultra vires or sidestepping the law, some law  enforcement organs meddle in economic disputes by collecting  fees or demanding debt repayment on behalf of an enterprise. In  the name of "serving economic construction," "protecting an  enterprise," and bolding searching for a new way to serve  economic construction, public security organs and procuratorial  organs marshall the human and material resources of their own  units to help enterprises with their debt or payment collection  efforts in return for some form of compensation known variously  as "service fee," "labor fee," "sponsorship fee," and  "deduction." Deviating from the judicial principle of not  accepting or hearing a case unless charges have been filed,  judicial organs collect bad debts on behalf of enterprises  through extra-judicial channels. All these activities differ  from recovering stolen goods for the victim in a criminal case.  They also differ from ruling in or adjudicating civil cases and  economic cases in accordance with mandatory civil rules or  enforcing mediation agreements.    Third, they engage in all manner of revenue-generating  activities. Abusing their power, for instance, law enforcement  organs collect fees, levy taxes, and impose fines on behalf of  other departments in return for appropriate compensation. A few  law enforcement organs even use police cars as taxis to make a  profit.    These days a widely held view among law enforcement workers  in the field is that since law-enforcement organs are seriously  under-funded when it comes to processing cases, the practices of  fining a criminal instead of imposing a prison term and  demanding sums from defendants and victims can only strengthen  those organs economically and therefore make them better able to  handle cases. Fining a defendant, it is also argued, serves the  purpose of punishing him. Regarding the practice of collecting  debts on behalf of an enterprise, some law-enforcement personnel  claim that as a method of solving an economic dispute, the civil  lawsuit takes too long. Even if a person wins a case, the  verdict is often difficult to enforce. Enterprises turn to  law-enforcement organs for help, it is said, because they are  leery of getting trapped in litigation. When a law enforcement  organ, overstepping its authority or sidestepping the law,  succeeds in collecting a debt promptly, it provides production  with a powerful safeguard. On the one hand, it wins praise for  "protecting an enterprise." On the other hand, it obtains a  tangible benefit that would enable it to add new equipment or  modernize existing equipment and improve its financial position.  It is a case of killing two birds with one stone. What is wrong  with that, they ask?    To my mind, the above argument is long on trivia but short  on  major principles. To argue thus is to see the part while  overlooking the whole. These people are only concerned about the  preservation and aggrandizement of departmental interests while  ignoring the preservation of the general interest. Work guided  by such thinking will inevitably damage the reputation of state  organs and encourage the spread of corruption.    First of all, law enforcement organs which abused their  office to profit themselves illegally constituted a blot on  China's political history.    There were two major chronic ills in China's political  history. One was autocratic politics, which had its origins in  the Qin Dynasty. Calling himself the First Emperor, its founder  thought he embodied the moral virtues of the Three Emperors and  considered his achievements greater than those of the Five  Emperors. He unified the whole country and made China his  personal possession. Although the dynasty he founded did not  pass from one generation to the next endlessly, contrary to what  he had hoped, the autocratic system he put in place lasted with  no interruption to become a terminal disease in our feudal  history. The other was bureaucratic politics. It too had an  impressive list of symptoms. Economically, bureaucratic politics  manifested itself as abusing one's power to profit oneself. One  way to do this was to create a state-run economy. Another was to  extort excessive taxes and levies by virtue of one's power.  [passage omitted]    Third, when law enforcement organs abuse their authority to  enrich themselves illegally, they in effect connive at criminal  conduct and hurt legal construction.    Lax law enforcement is an outstanding problem these days.  One  of its causes is the phenomenon of law enforcement organs making  money illegally. Consider : 1) Public security organs demand a  "case solving fee" from victims. Only after they are paid would  they agree to return the stolen goods or economic damages. Since  victims are made to suffer two times over, they often balk at  reporting a crime. The result is a serious crime under-reporting  problem. 2) The practice of demanding a fine instead of imposing  a prison term has given rise to a de facto system of bribing  one's way out of jail. In handling some cases, law enforcement  organs take the mediation route. After paying the victim a  specified sum, they make him drop the charges regardless of the  interest of the state in prosecuting the case. The upshot is a  new way of handling cases in which a criminal who pays a fine  will not be physically punished or can buy his way out of  prison. Criminals get off easily. 3) In collecting debts, law  enforcement organs content themselves with the recovery of  properties. Even when they discover criminal activities, they  ask no questions, let alone handing over the case promptly to  the agency with the proper jurisdiction so that the latter can  investigate it in accordance with the law. Consequently,  criminals escape scot-free and remain beyond the reach of the  law. This deals a heavy blow to the authority and dignity of the  law, in addition to preventing the elimination of adverse  factors in the economic climate, which in turn militates against  healthy economic development. 4) When a law enforcement organ  devotes a substantial portion of its human and material  resources to collecting debts and other sums, normal  case-solving is affected, resulting in half-hearted law  enforcement. Without exception all these circumstances are a  byproduct of law enforcement organs trying to line their pockets  illegally. At a time when the market economy needs the  protection of the law, they disrupt the legal system and  undermine the concept of the rule of law. The danger is obvious.    Fourth, it is corruption itself for law enforcement organs  to  profit themselves illegally by abusing their power. In so doing  they seriously damage the image of law enforcement organs in the  public eye.    When law enforcement organs abuse their office and collect  fines and fees arbitrarily under all sorts of pretexts, they are  behaving in a way that runs counter to the honesty and  incorruptibility long advocated by our party. This situation has  aroused the concern of people of insight as well as the anger of  the masses and severely damaged the image of law enforcement  organs in the public mind. When law enforcement organs demand  case-solving fees from victims or meddle in economic affairs  with hopes of taking a cut, when they help enterprises or  individuals collect unpaid debts, they are in effect behaving  like for-hire social service organizations such as  private-investigation companies or debt-collection outfits,  projecting an image far from appropriate for law enforcement  organs. Once state organs preoccupy themselves with  money-making, they lose the incorruptibility indispensable to  operating impartially. Practice also proves that the inevitable  result of such conduct is more and more people bending the law  for personal gains.    In collecting unpaid debts, moreover, some law enforcement  organs misuse their coercive state power to, for instance, take  a person into custody. This practice seriously tarnishes the  reputation of state organs.  [passage omitted]</p>

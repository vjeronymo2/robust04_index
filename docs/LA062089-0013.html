			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYA VISTA DEVELOPER TO CUT BUSINESS SPACE  </P> <P> Responding to complaints that the project was too massive, the new lead  developer of Playa Vista, the residential and commercial development planned  just south of Marina del Rey, announced Monday that the space designated for  shops and offices will be reduced significantly and the number of residential  units will be increased.  </P> <P> Nelson C. Rising, who heads the development team for Maguire Thomas Partners,  said the amount of office space will be reduced by nearly 1 million square  feet, to about 5 million, and the amount of retail space will be reduced by  nearly 300,000 square feet, to about 680,000.  </P> <P> By comparison, the Westside Pavilion shopping mall at Pico Boulevard and  Overland Avenue is about 1 million square feet.  </P> <P> "The single most important thing we can do is improve the jobs-housing balance.  We want to create a community where people work, live and play," Rising told a  group of about 500 community members at the Airport Marina Hotel in Westchester  on Monday night.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the number of residential units will rise by about 2,300, to about  11,000 units.  </P> <P> The proposed changes apply only to about three-quarters of the 957-acre parcel  that was part of the estate of the late billionaire Howard Hughes. Plans for  the remaining 209 acres are not expected to change substantially.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wildlife Habitat  </P> <P> Much of the tract consists of open fields and wetlands that are home to a wide  variety of birds.  </P> <P> The changes represent a victory for residents living near the project and for  Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who defeated former Councilwoman  Pat Russell in 1987. Russell's support for the project was widely viewed as a  major cause of her ouster.  </P> <P> As part of her campaign, Galanter said she would fight to have the project  scaled back, even though it had already been approved in 1986 by the city and  the state Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> The plan also includes 2,400 hotel rooms and a 40-acre marina with up to 900  boat slips. As part of the plan, the previous lead developer, Howard Hughes  Properties Inc., agreed to set aside 175 acres of wetlands and 41 acres of sand  dunes and bluffs as a nature preserve. Hughes also pledged $10 million to the  National Audubon Society to restore and maintain the wetlands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Election Sent Message  </P> <P> Galanter's victory, however, signaled that the city would almost certainly seek  to reduce the size of the development. Last August, Galanter called for a new  environmental impact report, the preservation of a larger portion of wetlands  and a 40% reduction in the amount of office space.  </P> <P> In February, Maguire Thomas, whose other projects include the 73-story First  Interstate World Center now under construction in downtown Los Angeles, bought  into the project for an undisclosed sum and took over as managing partner.  Hughes Properties, a subsidiary of Summa Corp., remains as a limited partner.  JMB Realty Corp., which owns and built much of Century City, also purchased an  interest in the project.  </P> <P> Rising has been meeting with community groups since February to get public  comment on what changes should be made in the project. Rising said his proposed  changes will be turned over to designers and architects, who will develop a  more specific, though not final, plan within about a week, Rising said. That  plan will then be available for further public comment.  </P></p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SCI to raise offer for Great Southern Great Southern Group, the funerals operator which faces a hostile takeover bid, is to receive an offer worth up to 800p a share from its US aggressor early this week. The offer was being thrashed out yesterday between the Field family, which has a controlling interest in Southern, and Service Corporation International (SCI), the world's largest funeral company. Sources close to Houston-based SCI said yesterday that it was in talks over an offer 'somewhere between Southern's closing share price of 709p and 800p.' Southern was also hedging its options and holding discussions with Loewen, a Canadian rival. SCI made its original Pounds 87.4m offer at the start of June, but was stonewalled by JD Field and Sons, the private company controlled by the Field family, which has been in the burial business since 1690. The family, said to have bridled at the abrasive approach of Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI's Texan chairman, rejected the offer immediately. It also ignored a higher offer of 680p a share made last week, valuing the company at Pounds 99.1m. Under Takeover Panel rules a move has to be made this week and it is believed that the latest offer will be accepted. SCI controls almost 30 per cent of the enlarged capital.</p>

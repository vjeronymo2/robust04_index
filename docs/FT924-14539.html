			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Roche expects 'considerable improvement' CONSOLIDATED sales of Roche, the Basle-based pharmaceutical and speciality chemicals group, rose only 6.3 per cent in the third quarter to SFr3.04bn (Dollars 2.4m), but the group said it expected 'another considerable improvement' in net profit for the year, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The sales growth rate in the third quarter was sharply lower than the 19 per cent recorded in the first half. Roche said the sales trend was affected by the shift of currency effects from positive to negative in the third quarter and by disposals in the diagnostic division and a minor seasonal effect. Roche expects 'a further healthy growth in sales' in the fourth quarter, and this appeared to relate to its highlighting of the 15 per cent sales growth to SFr9.7bn in the nine months to September 30. Sales by the pharmaceutical division soared 20 per cent in the nine months to SFr5.09bn.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No complaints, whatever the 'human need' Sir, I congratulate John Willman on his 'dispensation of a biblical text' to the bishop of Birmingham ('Judge not, that ye be not judged', July 9). The bishop obviously aspires to the sort of health service that existed in former socialist countries like East Germany. Allow me to relate a story I heard in Berlin the other day. Unwell lady in what was East Berlin to a friend in West Berlin: 'I got my appointment with the specialist for last Wednesday at 9 am. I sat there all day. At 6 pm they told me to make another appointment.' Lady from West Berlin: 'Did you not complain?' Answer: 'It would not be allowed.' A pause: 'Would it?' That is how an all-powerful state treats its citizens. Even after four years of being allowed to complain they are still afraid to complain. And so much for the bishop's 'basis of a human need'. I do recommend a trip to east Germany to anybody who wants to do away with the 'morally wrong and unchristian culture of competition'. It is an eye-opener. Thank you, John Willman.

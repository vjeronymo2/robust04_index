			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Money Markets: All eyes on Budget THE UK money market continued its policy of watching and waiting ahead of the Budget next Tuesday. Speculation about the timing of a base rate cut is intensifying, with a majority of dealers still believing one will come next week, either just after the Budget - provided the market reacts positively to it - or on the day itself, the so-called 'double whammy'. Others, however, are more pessimistic, believing that the government may not lower rates before the general election, or will hold back if market reaction to the Budget is negative. The key three-month interbank rate, often a pointer to the direction of interest rates, seemed to reflect the more pessimistic view, holding steady at 10 3/8 -10 5/16 per cent. Some players are surprised the rate is not closer to 10, given the expectations of an imminent rate cut. The March short sterling contract ended three basis points down at 89.66. Liquidity was easier than in recent days, with the Bank of England quickly taking out much of the shortage. It forecast a Pounds 1.3bn shortage, but immediately purchased Pounds 1,272m of bills for resale to the market on March 23, 24 and 25 at 10 7/16 per cent. The forecast rose at midday to Pounds 1.4bn, but the Bank did not act until a further increase in the forecast to Pounds 1.45bn, when it bought Pounds 196m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The overnight rate was easier as a result, moving down from 10 1/2 -10 3/8 per cent to 10-9 1/2 after the Bank's morning operation, and later to around 9 1/4 per cent. In Germany, the Bundesbank drained DM2.5bn from the banking system, a move underscoring its determination to keep monetary policy tight. Dealers had been expecting the bank to replace fully two securities repurchase agreements worth DM44.5bn, which expired yesterday. In fact it allocated only DM42bn - seen as surprising in a month in which heavy tax payments mean large sums are withdrawn from the system. Dealers noted the bank could have made a larger allocation, but chose not to accept bids below 9.45 per cent. They did not, however, expect any change in interest rates at today's regular Bundesbank council meeting. Call money rates were virtually unchanged at 9.60/65 per cent.</p>

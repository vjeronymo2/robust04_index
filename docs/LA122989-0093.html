			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MYERSON &amp; KUHN LAW FIRM FILES FOR CHAPTER 11;  </P> <P> ATTORNEYS: THE FIRM HAS NOT MATCHED THE AMBITIONS OF ITS FOUNDERS, LITIGATOR  HARVEY MYERSON AND BOWIE KUHN, FORMER BASEBALL COMMISSIONER.  </P> <P> Myerson &amp; Kuhn, an elite law firm built last year when one of the nation's  largest firms went bankrupt, has itself filed for reorganization under Chapter  11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> Founded by flamboyant litigator Harvey Myerson and former baseball commissioner  Bowie Kuhn, the firm one year ago boasted a staff of 160 lawyers, including  big-name talent that it attracted with hefty salaries. But the firm's receipts  never matched its ambitions, and Myerson &amp; Kuhn has been cited as an  example of how today's big firms can elude management control.  </P> <P> The firm sought bankruptcy court protection in a petition filed Wednesday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.  </P> <P> Among the firm's creditors was Marine Midland Bank, which was listed on the  petition as being owed $3 million.  </P> <P> The firm and some of its remaining partners still face a sizable claim from a  former client, the Shearson Lehman Hutton investment firm. In one of the  heaviest blows to the firm, Shearson last year fired Myerson &amp; Kuhn and  then sued it for allegedly overbilling the brokerage by at least $2 million.  </P> <P> Shearson settled for $1.2 million last June. But this week the investment firm  filed a new suit, claiming that the law firm still owed $488,000 of the  settlement.  </P> <P> Myerson &amp; Kuhn was organized by trial lawyer Myerson two months after the  November, 1987, collapse of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Unterberg, Manley,  Myerson &amp; Casey, a law firm that was then the nation's fourth largest.  </P> <P> Myerson launched the firm with a fanfare of publicity and a pledge that it  would have first-year revenue of $50 million to $75 million. He described the  organization as a "start-up superstar firm" with a client list that included  Shearson, the Trump Organization and Weyerhaeuser Co.  </P> <P> But the firm never reached that revenue goal and had a falling out with Donald  Trump, in addition to Shearson.  </P> <P> Among Myerson &amp; Kuhn's original hires were such widely recognized names as  Faith Ryan Whittlesey, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and Gerald  Eppner, a top corporate lawyer.  </P> <P> During much of this year, Myerson &amp; Kuhn saw a stream of defections from  its offices in New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Philadelphia.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the firm's office fell from a peak of 19 lawyers to 12.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Los Angeles lawyers broke away from the home office and  set up shop under a new name, Cooper &amp; Dempsey, according to partner  Michael D. Dempsey.  </P> <P> Still unclear at this point is exactly what will happen to the leases on the  Los Angeles group's office space and equipment, which are held under the  Myerson &amp; Kuhn name and are thus included in the bankruptcy proceeding.  "For the moment, we're stuck in this," Dempsey said.  </P> <P> Myerson is now forming a firm of his own in New York, while Kuhn, 62, is  reportedly considering retiring.  </P></p>

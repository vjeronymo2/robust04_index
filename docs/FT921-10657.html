			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Compass liquidator wins extension for rescue talks THE provisional liquidator of Compass Holdings, the failed Australian airline operator, has been granted an extension to hold talks with three interested investors, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. The liquidator, Mr Ian Ferrier of chartered accountancy firm Ferrier Hodgson, was due to begin winding-up procedures yesterday if he could not present a rescue plan to the Federal Court. However, the court extended that deadline until March 10. Compass was placed in provisional liquidation on December 20. Legal counsel for the liquidator told the court that negotiations were continuing with three unnamed parties interested in investing in the airline. Any proposal emerging from the talks would involve a scheme of arrangement which requires court approval. Existing members of the Compass board will be excluded in any proposed rescue of the airline. The Australian Securities Commission previously told the court that it was investigating Compass, and on present information it would have 'serious concern' if any of the airline's directors retained a role in the company.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 3 Jun (AFP) -- Members of the House of  Representatives, dissolved by the military authorities, today  called on General Sani Abacha to relinquish power "by 11 June."  The call was made in a communique issued at the end of a  meeting attended by 348 members.    The 11 June deadline was chosen because it is the eve of the  first anniversary of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections  annulled by the military.    The results of these elections are expected to be announced  and the winner sworn into office to form a broad-based national  government, the communique stated. It also indicated that the  number of delegates at the meeting was sufficient for the  necessary quorum to be attained.    "The meeting came to the irrevocable conclusion that the  current military junta lacks the necessary spirit or wisdom to  move the country forward," the communique added.</p>

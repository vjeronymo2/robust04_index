			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim al-Zuray'i, "a senior Fatah official </F> in the Gaza Strip," by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] [Khashanah] What did you discuss with the Fatah  leadership and President 'Arafat in recent days?    [Al-Zuray'i] We discussed matters pertaining purely to the  movement and we also discussed the security situation, the  people's suffering in the strip, and the economic blockade  against our people. I believe that the hot security situation  in Gaza is a result of the bad economic situation but Israel  also is not unconnected with the disturbances and sedition. It  helps foment internal conflict in the occupied territory by  flooding the Strip with arms via "collaborators," but Palestine  cannot be turned into another Afghanistan or Somalia because  there is profound national awareness and the state of the  political movement is good despite the fact that the people are  in dire need of essential goods and normal living conditions.    [Khashanah] How do you explain the growing phenomenon of  liquidation of "collaborators" with the occupation?    [Al-Zuray'i] This is a new phenomenon and it is exaggerated.  I believe that under no circumstances should a gunman become  magistrate, judge, and executioner. The collaborators can be  classified into categories. There are those who are beyond  reform and have crossed the point of no return, and there are  those who got involved inadvertently or were wronged. Some of  the latter could be returned to the national ranks or  neutralized.    At any rate, the situation in the Gaza Strip is difficult,  like the other occupied areas. The cause of the difficulty is  the Palestinian masses' frustration resulting from the Israeli  procrastination on the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement.    [Khashanah] What is your estimate of the number of the Gaza  Strip detainees?    [Al-Zuray'i] The general estimate is over 10,000 detainees  including 6,000 detainees from Gaza. That affects the people of  the Strip. In our meeting with the Palestinian leadership in  Tunis we concentrated on the need for a clear timetable and  deadline for the release of the Palestinian revolution's  detainees regardless of their organizations and affiliations  because the PLO embraces all sectors of the Palestinian people.  Without fulfillment of that objective there can be no  meaningful agreement.    [Khashanah] What was the leadership's answer?    [Al-Zuray'i] There was official response and agreement with  that view because the agreement would be worthless without the  release of the detainees and prisoners. In fact that would be  the only step that would ameliorate the agreement or make it  less ugly.    [Khashanah] What kind of relations exist between Fatah and  the other factions which reject the agreement, in the Gaza Strip?    [Al-Zuray'i] We and many cadres and leaderships of these  factions in the Strip have the long struggle in common and we  have had dialogues with them in prison and outside. We always  maintained that the homeland is above all organizations. There  is cooperation now in all fields, apart from the differences of  opinion. There is field coordination at a level higher than the  level of coordination outside the occupied territory. It is  enhanced by the sense of responsibility demonstrated by all  factions.    [Khashanah] How would friction and conflict be avoided when  Fatah becomes a ruling party and assumes power?    [Al-Zuray'i] We have discussed these matters as  Palestinian citizens with the parties concerned, especially the  Islamic parties, at an early stage. There can be no doubt that  many brother leaders and members of the factions at home have a  clear vision. Now the common vision leans toward finding a  clear national program that would answer all questions in the  next phase. But so far there is no national program for the  prospective Palestinian authority. We hope that, through joint  meetings and seminars, we will be able to formulate an initial  concept of a national program that would confirm the principles  of democracy, independence of the judiciary, freedom of the  press, human rights, and the rule of law. These are the  principles on which there is Palestinian consensus. The  situation at home will not stabilize without the fulfillment of  these objectives as the main foundations of national authority.    [Khashanah] Did you discuss the Palestinian draft  constitution in the strip?    [Al-Zuray'i] There is no crystallized final draft yet. The  dialogue on it is continuing. All the Palestinian people should  be consulted on it.    [Khashanah] Did you and the leadership make any practical  decisions regarding the state of the movement in the Strip?    [Al-Zuray'i] Decisions were made on most of the issues we  came to discuss with the leadership. We are waiting for the  implementation of the recent Cairo agreement and we hope that  will be done before the end of the month, as President 'Arafat  told us.    [Khashanah] What matters relating to the Strip were  discussed?    [Al-Zuray'i] Organizational matters, the security situation,  and the people's suffering.    [Khashanah] Do you believe that the phenomenon of  liquidating the collaborators is likely to continue?    [Al-Zuray'i] Negative aspects have appeared between members  of the Palestinian people since 1936, between families and  between tribes, resulting in many casualties. That is why we  have fought that phenomenon and still do, strongly, and we hope  that we will turn over that leaf quickly to protect the lives of  these people. I believe that Palestinian justice will be fair to  everyone and will bring to account everyone who collaborated  with the occupation. That is why we say let us leave this  matter to the Palestinian authority and national justice, for it  to task those who did wrong and be fair to those who were  wronged.    We found the other factions responsive to that view. Those  who carry out the liquidation operations do not take orders.  They are youngsters under the age of 18. Their actions are  usually based on personal views.</p>

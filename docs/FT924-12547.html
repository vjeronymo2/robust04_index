			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Queen welcomed to Bonn, Britain welcomed to Europe: Monarch emphasises bilateral relations and German reunification THE flags of Britain, Germany and the European Community flew over Bonn yesterday to welcome Queen Elizabeth on a state visit, and to underline Germany's desire to see the UK as an enthusiastic EC member state. The European theme was a clear German leitmotiv on the first day of the visit by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who will spend most of their time in Berlin and the states of former East Germany. President Richard von Weizsacker, the German head of state, stressed the point repeatedly in his welcoming address, that 'Europe without the British is unthinkable'. 'We in Germany are convinced that we need the special British contribution to Europe more than ever,' he said. The response from the Queen was slightly more subdued, with the emphasis rather on bilateral relations and her enthusiasm for German unification. Yet she rose to the European theme, with a firm statement that 'We British are Europeans. That means that we are your partners in the European Community.' 'Building the European Community has never been easy,' she added. 'Nor, as so much of our continent emerges from a dark age, has it ever been more important.' Both heads of state were anxious to paper over some of the recent verbal cracks in the bilateral relationship, with good humour if possible. The German president remarked that 'recently a war of words was declared over, without any declaration of war having ever been given. How nice]' It was perhaps a gentle reminder that the disagreement over turmoil on the currency markets which began and ended in Britain. The Queen remarked that 'like all close friends, we do not always see eye to eye, but, as friends should, we try not to let the sun go down on our quarrels. We have too much to lose to allow that.' Her real enthusiasm was reserved for a tribute to German unification: 'The division of Germany was always artificial,' she declared, 'and an affront to freedom. Its end was widely welcomed in the UK.' Not only that, she said, it gave her personal pleasure, 'not least because many of my German ancestors had close associations with places in the new states'. It was a personal touch which will underline her already huge popularity with the German population.</p>

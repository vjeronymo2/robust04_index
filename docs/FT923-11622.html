			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: GIO shares expected to trade at a premium GIO Australia Holdings, the recently privatised insurance group, is expected to trade at a small premium when the shares are listed on the Australian stock exchange today. Brokers said GIO, formerly owned by the state government of New South Wales, would probably trade at a premium of about 20 cents to the flotation price of ADollars 2.40. Brokers had earlier suggested the shares would list at up to ADollars 2.90, but forecasts have been reduced in line with general weakness in the Australian market. The ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 890m) flotation, the biggest privatisation in Australia, was ADollars 1bn oversubscribed. Southern Cross Airlines, which hopes to resurrect collapsed Compass Airlines next month, is expected to begin trading today at a discount to its flotation price of ADollars 0.50. The ADollars 50m Southern Cross flotation was 46 per cent undersubscribed, mainly because of worries about competition following deregulation of the domestic aviation market in October 1990. Compass, acquired by Southern Cross, collapsed in December after losing a fare-cutting battle with government-owned Australian Airlines and Ansett Australia, owned by TNT and News Corporation.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / German inflation at 4.2% West German annual inflation averaged 4.2 per cent in 1993, the highest rate since 1982, the federal statistics office said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. Announcing a slight upward revision in provisional figures, the office said consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in December from the previous month to give a year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent. The annual average rate of 4.2 per cent compared with 4 per cent in 1992. It was the highest since 1982, when prices rose 5.3 per cent. Although the final December figures were fractionally higher than the preliminary data, economists said inflation had peaked and would fall steadily throughout 1994. Mr Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said he saw the figure falling to 2.7 per cent by the end of the year.</p>

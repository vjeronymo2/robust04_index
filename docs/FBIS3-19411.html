			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Mario Soares by Sandra </F> Cohen; place and date not given]    [Text] [Cohen] The issue of immigration to Portugal was  aggravated after Portugal joined the European Union (EU). Every  day five tourists are expelled from Portugal. Isn't it  contradictory to close the borders when there are 4.5 million  Portuguese abroad?    [Soares] I am against the restrictive immigration policy,  which falls under the government's jurisdiction, and not under  my jurisdiction. Portugal has international obligations because  it is a member of the EU which, as is known, is abolishing  internal borders. I believe foreigners should be treated with  due consideration, especially Brazilians, because for years  Brazil has welcomed the Portuguese, and is still giving  privileged treatment to the Portuguese who are living in that  country.    [Cohen] Are you and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva afraid of  the  social consequences of the possible return to the country of  500,000 Portuguese immigrants from South Africa?    [Soares] I believe this will not happen. Efforts should be  made for the Portuguese who are in South Africa to cooperate  with the democratization process. I am willing to ask for the  Portuguese people's support in the elections, because elections  are very important. If things do not work properly, we cannot  abandon the Portuguese who are living there.    [Cohen] Twenty years after the Revolution of Nails  [Revolucao  dos Cravos], do you think the ideals that prompted the military  revolt have been betrayed?    [Soares] No. The Revolution of Nails attained its  objectives, which are outlined in the so-called three D's:  democratization, decolonization, and development.    [Cohen] The decolonization process was traumatic, and could  not be overcome by the main ex-colonies, like Angola and  Mozambique. What is, in your opinion, the reason for this  failure?    [Soares] I would not say decolonization in Africa has  failed.  I blame the traumas on the conditions under which the colonial  war developed. Portugal was placed under a ferocious  dictatorship. It impeded the formation of African elites,  making the nationalists shift to the international communist  movement.    [Cohen] What do you think of the criticism of actress  Christiane Torloni about the boycott she suffered in Portugal?    [Soares] I believe her criticism was a bit inopportune, but  I  do not attach too much significance to the case. She is a nice  artist who enjoys popularity in Portugal, who received a major  subsidy, and who appeared in funny ads.    [Cohen] The euphoria that prevailed in Portugal at the end  of  the 1980's, and the myth that the country was an oasis, gave  rise to an economic crisis. What went wrong?    [Soares] The European Community aid was important for the  development and modernization of some infrastructure areas, but  some reforms the country needs have not yet been implemented.  Free market conditions are posing problems for Portuguese  enterprises. Tourism seems to be improving. We still have to  receive major aid from the Community. I hope it will be  properly used so we can reactivate, as we should, the Portuguese  productive sector. Over the past few years the entire European  continent has experienced a strong recession, which has also  affected Portugal.    [Cohen] What is the solution to the crisis?    [Soares] To strengthen the Portuguese productive sector.  This also involves the field of education. We should bet on  the intelligence of the Portuguese people, on their immense  capacity for adaptation and creativity.    [Cohen] Do you agree with Ambassador Jose Aparecido de  Oliveira's project to create a Community of Portuguese-Speaking  Countries?    [Soares] It is very important for Brazil and for Portugal to  understand that it could be very profitable for them to create a  true brotherhood and design common plans for the future. The  fact that Portugal is a European country and an EU member is not  in contradiction with its love for Brazil or with our priority  purpose of designing a coordinated policy with Brazil.    [Cohen] What are, in your opinion, the mistakes that led to  the defeat of the French Socialist Party?    [Soares] The French Socialist Party had a very sketchy  vision  of the French situation. It tried to implement a  nationalization policy, but had to back down three years later  because of poor economic results. There were lamentable  corruption cases, even though they are neither more nor less  significant than those occurring in rightist governments. They  are more serious when they occur within the leftist sector,  because a lot more is always expected from this sector.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wilmer Lizama; from the "YSKL 94 Electoral News </F> Coverage" program]    [Excerpt] The elections have been held under good  conditions here in San Miguel. We visited the towns of  Chinameca, Moncagua, and Quelepa and talked with residents who  said at least 1,600 people are registered to vote in the town of  Chinameca.    There are approximately 11,000 registered voters in Moncagua  Municipality. In Moncagua, Jose Felicito Rivas Gomez, mayoral  candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, said  the residents of this area have turned out to vote in large  numbers. These are the areas in which during the wartime  residents did not come out to vote.    Meanwhile, Vice President Francisco Merino Lopez is here in  San Miguel. He gave statements to YSKL listeners on the  elections, which have been called the elections of the century.    [Begin Merino recording] Thank you, YSKL friends. We are  really surprised at this civic festivity Salvadorans and San  Miguel residents are witnessing. We believe, from our  comparative analyses, there are many more voters in these  elections than in previous ones, a reflection of the people's  expectations there would be more freedom of expression with  peace.    We believe the elections are being held orderly and  normally.  A great deal of political definition is perceived in the  atmosphere, in terms of which parties are more organized and  have more supporters. The way people are dressed helps one  understand for whom they would vote. I think we are taking a  very important step in the country's political history. We will  gain a privileged position on the continental level with these  elections.    In addition to general currents, all currents of political  thinking are participating in the elections, and the people will  decide with their votes, freely, who will be elected.

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (30): Turnover doubled / An address look-up system based on postcodes has helped holiday company English Country Cottages to cut the time of telephone calls for bookings by a third and improved accuracy and information English Country Cottages sells self-catering holidays in 4,000 properties, let on behalf of the owners, mainly in the UK but also now in Europe and New England in the US. Its annual Pounds 500,000 UK advertising budget produces 150,000 responses; mailshots to 250,000 people bring in 75,000 enquiries; and 170,000 brochures are sent to past customers. The company has 100 full-time and part-time staff working from converted farm buildings in Fakenham, Norfolk, writes John Kavanagh. The company has doubled in turnover to Pounds 30m in the last five years and puts much of its success down to its computer systems, running on ICL DRS 6000 equipment under the Unix operating system. The booking system includes the Quickaddress package from UK firm QAS Systems. This product is built around the Post Office's file of 1.7m postcodes and 24.5m associated addresses. The package produces complete addresses from a name and postcode or from other partial and misspelt information. It can be used to clean up databases and eliminate duplicates and to sort mailshots to give the best savings through the Post Office's Mailsort discounts. Customised information relating for example to sales territories or local authority wards can also be held. QAS Systems says the package cuts the number of keystrokes to enter an address by up to 80 per cent if the postcode is known. Many of these claims are confirmed by Mr Brian Soper, information technology manager at English Country Cottages. 'A typical customer booking-call that used to take three minutes now only takes two, and it now also includes all the confirmations we can provide,' Mr Soper says. Callers can now ask for properties in specific areas or near certain towns. English Country Cottages sends property postcodes to QAS, which provides a file linking postcodes to the holiday company's map references. Broad areas can be entered and the system provides lists of properties in that area. The address of the chosen property is transferred to the booking screen. 'Before we had this system we couldn't do such tightly-focused searches,' Brian Soper says. 'Very few of our properties are in towns, so it was no use searching by town name. Normally it meant searching by county, a much larger area.' Customers' own addresses are now generated automatically and accurately from minimal information from the caller. Operators can take credit or debit card payments and the booking system checks the cards and authorises payments through on-line links to the appropriate financial services organisations. Telephone bookings are normally confirmed by the customer with a booking form. Brian Soper says that because the use of Quickaddress guarantees the address held by the system is accurate, it is no longer necessary to check the address and postcode on the form. 'We are looking at eliminating booking forms and we couldn't do this without knowing the address was accurate,' he says. 'We have very tight quality assurance here.' English Country Cottages paid Pounds 7,000 for Quickaddress. Prices range from Pounds 875 for the first year and Pounds 250 for subsequent years for a personal computer version to Pounds 35,000 and Pounds 9,000 for a system running on a mainframe with more than 150 users. Maintenance ranges from Pounds 275 to Pounds 12,000, including quarterly updates of the postcode address file. QAS Systems has 500 UK customers and is the biggest third-party outlet for the postcode address file. QAS was formed in 1990, and expects its turnover to grow 70 per cent in 1993-94 to Pounds 1.5m and net profit to grow from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 200,000. Contact: 081-675 6690.

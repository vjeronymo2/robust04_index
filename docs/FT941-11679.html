			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Heseltine pressed over Post Office Members of the Commons trade and industry committee yesterday criticised Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for failing to give the Post Office more commercial freedom. Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour chairman, said: 'To dismiss giving the Post Office more commercialism is disgraceful. The committee believes the status quo is the worst possible option.' Mr Heseltine gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday and the MPs are determined to keep up the pressure on the DTI to speed up its review into the future of the corporation. Mr Heseltine told the committee he favoured privatisation of the Royal Mail letters division but had been prevented from changing its ownership because of 'political considerations'. He said more commercialisation within the public sector was proving very difficult to achieve. A senior Conservative member of the committee said privately that he backed the call for greater freedom within the public sector. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, accused the DTI of 'damaging the business of the Post Office' by failing to make a decision. He has written to Mr Heseltine urging him to give an early answer on the future of the corporation and to recognise its need to work with the private sector. Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, agreed with Mr Heseltine's view that there was a strong economic case for privatising the Royal Mail while leaving Post Office shops in the public sector. The Post Office revealed that the increase in the amount it has to give the government was mainly responsible for November's price increase.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The financial market  in Shenzhen city, in south China's Guangdong Province, has been  operating well since the beginning of this year.    According to Wang Xiyi, head of the Shenzhen branch of the  People's Bank of China, by the end of May, the balance of  savings of various kinds in the city reached 73.205 billion  yuan, an increase of 9.483 billion yuan over the corresponding  figure in January, while the sum remaining after extending loans  stood at 54.195 billion yuan, up 5.611 billion yuan on January's  corresponding figure.    Wang said it was encouraging that more and more bank savings  in the city came from fixed deposits, which meant that the sum  for long-term use is growing.    To guarantee enough funds for major enterprises and  construction of key basic facilities in Shenzhen, the loans  issued by various banks in the city in June are estimated at 1.6  billion yuan.    The branch head said that though Shenzhen, as a pilot city  for China's policy of reform and opening to the world, has a  freer financial environment, there still remained a need for  effective measures to control inflation there, to strengthen the  withdrawal of currency from circulation and to prevent the use  of working capital as investment capital in the form of fixed  assets.</p>

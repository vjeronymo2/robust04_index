			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Japan plans to ease rules on funds In a belated attempt to revive flagging interest in the nation's investment trust business, Japan's ministry of finance has announced it plans to sweep away most of the tight restrictions that are currently stifling demand for such funds. Many of the rules governing fund management and distribution of profits will go in the widest ranging shake-up of the investment trust sector for decades. The changes are likely to take effect before the end of the year. The most significant of the changes will be the lifting of a ban on investing in derivatives. At present, trusts are permitted to invest in derivative instruments, such as futures and options, only for the limited purpose of risk-hedging. In a further effort to create a more investor-friendly environment, the trusts will have to disclose their funds' performance in greater detail, including publication of monthly performance data. More transparent reporting will also be required to enable better comparison between trusts. The Japanese equity market has fallen from its highs of the late 1980s and savers have shied away from investment trusts. The ministry of finance estimates that net assets of equity-based investment trusts have fallen from more than Y45,000bn (Pounds 287bn) in 1989 to less than Y19,000bn at the end of October this year. Other principal reforms are: Investment trusts will be allowed to invest in any foreign market. Restrictions on the sale of foreign investment trusts in Japan will be eased. The ban on mergers between investment trust companies and investment advisory companies will be lifted. 'Churning', excessive buying and selling of equities to increase brokers' commission income, will be banned. See Capital Markets</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hala Boncompagni] </F>   [Text] Beirut, March 24 (AFP) -- A government ban on a  Christian party and private news programs was seen here Thursday  [24 March] as an unofficial declaration of a state of emergency.    Information Minister Michel Samahah, who announced the  measures at the end of a five-hour cabinet meeting on Wednesday,  accused Israel of colluding with Lebanese parties in a bid to  destabilise Lebanon.    The government charged that Israel was carrying out  "terrorist activities in a bid to harm unity and peace in  Lebanon, and the chances of peace in the region."    Samahah said that the media ban would take effect from  midnight Wednesday until the government can come up with a law  to regulate the media in Lebanon.    The cabinet would meet next Tuesday to discuss the  legislation, he said.    But until then news coverage would be strictly limited to  state-run Radio Liban [Beirut Radio Lebanon] and Tele Liban.  Radio and television stations that violate the ban will be shut  down, Samahah said.    The unprecedented moves came after Lebanese police arrested  on Wednesday Fu'ad Malik, the second-in-command of the Lebanese  Forces (LF), a militia disbanded at the end of the 1975-1990 war  which had become a political party.    Malik was taken into custody in connection with the bombing  of a church last month in which 10 worshippers were killed. The  judge investigating the attack identified seven other suspects  as members of the LF.    The measures amount to "an unofficial declaration of a state  of emergency in the country," a government official told the  independent Arabic-language newspaper AL-NAHAR.    "It's a counter-coup to the coup which would have taken  place  if plans for destabilisation had been successful," he added.    "Good for them. The Lebanese Forces made us cower in  shelters for 20 years while they destroyed the country," a taxi  driver said about the former militia's involvement in the  Lebanese war.    He also applauded the decision to ban private news program  saying: "We've been poisoned by too many news bulletins each  day, too many radios giving their opinion. It's just as well."    But opposition MP Najah Wakim warned that he will try to  fight the government's media ban, stressing that it was an  infringement on political freedoms.    "The right to broadcast news should not be confined to the  state run media only. Every radio and television has the right  to broadcast news," he said.    The Lebanese press hailed the measures while Lebanon's 20  radio and television stations -- except for the pro-Israeli  Voice of the South -- complied with the ban, which also covered  political talk shows.    LF radio, Voice of Free Lebanon [(Clandestine) Radio Free  Lebanon], and their television, Lebanese Broadcasting  Corporation, broadcast music instead of its scheduled news  bulletins.    Sawt al-Sha'b [(Clandestine) Voice of the People], run by  the  Communist party, issued a statement saying it would abide by the  ban but urged the authorities to take immediate steps to issue a  law regulating the media in Lebanon.    Authorities earlier this month lashed out against private  stations for leaking findings of the investigation into the  bombing of Our Lady of Deliverance church north of Beirut.    They charged that some private media, which flourished  during  the country's civil war, were spreading rumors that it said  could fan disputes between the country's Moslem and Christian  communities.</p>

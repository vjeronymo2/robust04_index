			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries post strong gains as sentiment swings US Treasury prices posted impressive gains on the heels of a weakening equities market as investors switched from stocks to bonds in search of higher yields. At the close, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 94 29/32 , yielding 7.942 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 27/32 , yielding 7.165 per cent. The market closed at 2pm local time for the Thanksgiving holiday and will remain closed all day today. After another sharp fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday and losses in European and Asian equity markets, the long-bond yield fell below 8 per cent for the first time this month. Mr Joseph Liro, chief economist at SG Warburg, warned, however, that there is no guarantee yields will remain this low. 'If the equity market stabilises in the next week, bond yields will go right back through 8 per cent like a hot knife through butter,' he said. For the moment, he added, bond market investors have both eyes on the equities market. For nearly all of this year the stock market has taken its lead from the bond market. Late Monday afternoon, as share prices tumbled, however, the two markets moved apart as bonds benefited from the same fears of rising interest rates that hit equities. Mr Liro attributed most bond market gains to speculation rather than the much-talked-about asset reallocation, because most of the buying seemed to be in long bonds, which are normally not havens for investors worried about rising short-term interest rates. Some traders, though, reported signs of buying in the 10-year sector of the market. Markets hardly took notice of new economic data. The Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders declined 1.5 per cent in October from September. Analysts had expected an increase of about 0.1 per cent. Much of the decline, however, came from a drop in car and aircraft orders. Excluding transport, orders increased 1.1 per cent. A drop in aircraft and car and truck orders caused transportation equipment orders to decline 9.4 per cent. European government bond markets took their tone from the US yesterday, with stronger sentiment leading to rises in both German and UK government bonds. One analyst said: 'Inflation seems to be under control by the Fed and the risk premium is reducing in bond markets.' German government bonds followed the US rise and the December bund futures contract ended at 91.07, up 0.62 on the day. Ms Alison Cottrell at Kidder Peabody said bunds had been supported by US Treasuries rather than the October M3 money supply figures, which showed an annualised rise from the fourth quarter of last year of 6.9 per cent, rather than the 7.3 per cent which some had expected. UK government bond markets showed some strength and the December long gilt future had moved up  27/32 of a point to trade around 103 13/32 by late in the day. Three tap issues of gilts worth a total Pounds 550m were exhausted yesterday. They were: Pounds 200m of 9 per cent due 2008 at a price of 104.18; Pounds 200m of 9 per cent due 2012 at 105.08; Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked due 2003 at 162.22. Mr Kevin Adams at BZW said: 'People may be feeling that bonds are back in fashion.' He said investors had shrugged off hints of political uncertainty stemming from disagreements in the governing Conservative party over the UK contributions to the European Union budget. He said: 'Investors cannot believe any Tory MP will risk going to the country when they will so obviously get completely pasted.' The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds rose 3 basis points to 12.14 per cent. Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said the fall in price was due to further political uncertainty.</p>

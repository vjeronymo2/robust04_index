			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: 'Time' for a tiger 'Luciano Pavarotti has banned strong-smelling flowers from his hotel suite for fear of inflaming his tonsils before his concert at the Scottish exhibition centre in Glasgow.' News item. I WASN'T surprised to read that snippet, aware, as I am, that each day we breathe about 23,040 times and inhale and exhale something like 438 cubic feet of air. As my good friend Diane Ackerman has written, in A Natural History of the Senses: 'Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland - it's cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.' Which is why a pasta-basher of Luciano's luminosity has to be extremely careful of what he breathes - or, indeed, touches, tastes, hears and sees. I think I read somewhere that if Pavarotti looks out of a hotel window and sees something that displeases him - a Tesco superstore, or Lord King on a motorbike, or a herd of brown cows, or Virginia Bottomley in her Wellingtons picking pears up a ladder - then there isn't a hotel manager anywhere who is not prepared, right there and then, to rush outside his hotel and smite into oblivion, expunge from view, render invisible, the object or person that is distressing Luciano. Even if I didn't read it, or misconstrued what I read, I am sure it must be true, given the awe and reverence in which Luciano is held. Which set me thinking - if I had Pavarotti's power, which person or object would I want expunged from view, rendered invisible, so that I could set about my tasks, or enjoy a bit of lifestyle, free of distraction and irritation? A politician? Perhaps poor John Major, or poor Neil Kinnock? Droopy Chris Patten? Doomed Norman Lamont? Chest-thumping Michael Heseltine? Lugubrious John Smith? Pouty Diane Abbott? Virile Paddy Ashdown? Not a bit of it. So far as politicians go, I am in upmode at present. I have decided I like them. The realisation that I like politicians dawned on me two weeks ago in my hotel suite in Los Angeles. I had finished a day of meetings and was sitting on my sofa, looking at my flowers - and wondering if there was anything in my suite, or outside the window, down by the swimming pool, maybe in the parking lot, worth ringing the manager about and demanding he remove. There was nothing. So I turned on the TV and was able to see at once that George Bush was in trouble. He was in trouble because the network anchorman, sitting in his studio, said he was in trouble. The fact is that US anchormen, indeed most of the US media, are so spectacularly thick that it has taken them four years to see that George is in trouble, whereas someone like me, if there is, in fact, anyone, could see years and years ago that George was in trouble. But I like George a lot. He is droll and jokey and beautifully relaxed. In any case, the real reason I am in upmode about politicians is that I have realised, just lately, that they can only be blamed for a fraction of the things for which they are blamed. Journalists like to blame politicians for almost everything; to claim that the world is in such great trouble because politics attracts the corrupt, the dim and the - invariably - untalented. I now think this a fallacy. If it was easy to run democracies, there would be textbooks and formulas telling us how to do it. But there aren't, because it isn't. And it is getting harder all the time - more people, less money, bigger and bigger problems. I do not believe that poverty can be eradicated. Or that people will stop hitting one another. Or wars suddenly cease. Not for 10,000 years. At some point in the future perhaps all of us will be happy and live in clean cities without fear of mugging or bombs in stations or muck in the water or having to wonder why Britain needs a submarine fleet, let alone a nuclear one. But not right now we won't; which is why I am feeling kindly towards politicians. So who would I banish from view if I was as powerful as Pavarotti? The answer - you've guessed it  - is that well-known novelist, composer, script-writer, critic, lexicologist, lecturer in speech and drama, education specialist, historian, geographer, rocket scientist, astronomer, wit, pundit, commentator, Olympic silver medallist, multiple world record holder, architect, town planner, gourmand, gourmet, vintner's assistant, raconteur, after-dinner speaker, Magic Circle president, patron saint of club-class and certain Nobel prizewinner - yes, the utterly unavoidable and omniscient Anthony Burgess. I wish he would shut up. He is getting on my tonsils.</p>

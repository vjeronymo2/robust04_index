			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'FRONTLINE' UNRAVELS LINCOLN SAVINGS COLLAPSE  </P> <P> "Frontline's" account tonight of the misadventures of Charles H. Keating Jr.  and Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan provides some interesting new details and an  excellent summary of a complex case of financial fraud and mismanagement that  likely will cost the American taxpayers $2.5 billion. (It airs at 9 p.m. on  Channels 28 and 15, at 10 p.m. on Channel 50.)  </P> <P> The Irvine-based savings and loan, purchased by Keating in the heyday of  deregulation in 1984, was seized by the government in April, 1989. It is  expected to be the most expensive thrift collapse in the nation's history.  </P> <P> Drawing on federally insured money from Lincoln, Keating accomplished a great  deal during the five years he owned the thrift. He developed the $300-million  Phoenician resort and other properties, paid many of his relatives salaries of  $1 million a year or more, and spent $3 million to buy influence with  politicians in Washington, Arizona and California -- influence he later used to  keep regulators at bay.  </P> <P> "Frontline" sheds new light on how about 23,000 investors -- mostly elderly --  who put their life savings in now-worthless bonds issued by Lincoln's parent  company, American Continental Corp., lost their life savings. An internal memo  obtained by "Frontline" advised bond salesmen to prevent potential buyers from  seeing the prospectus, which would have informed them the bonds were not  federally insured. "The weak, meek and ignorant are always good targets," the  memo said.  </P> <P> A highlight of the show comes in an interview with M. Danny Wall, former  chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who has been accused of dragging  his feet after investigators recommended seizure of Lincoln as early as 1987.  Wall staunchly defends Lincoln's $100-million investments in junk bonds  arranged by confessed insider-trader Ivan Boesky.  </P> <P> "A hundred-million dollar investment in junk bonds with the pejorative added of  Ivan Boesky today means something," Wall says. "Then, it didn't. Ivan Boesky  hadn't been accused of anything at that point in the process, as I recall, in  1986, 1987."  </P> <P> When the narrator reminds him that Boesky plead guilty to securities violations  in the fall of 1986, Wall looks shocked. "I could be wrong; I could be wrong,"  he admits. SARA FRITZ  </P></p>

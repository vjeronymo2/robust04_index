			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Delta and UAL post solid gains in third-quarter operating income Delta Air Lines and UAL, parent of United Airlines, yesterday offered more evidence of a gradual return to financial stability for the US airline industry, as both posted solid operational gains in the third quarter. The encouraging results were released a week after AMR, parent of American Airlines, the largest US carrier, announced details of its best three-month operating period in the past five years. Wall Street responded warmly to yesterday's news from UAL and Delta, the second and third biggest groups in the industry, respectively. In early trading on the NYSE, UAL's share price added Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 86 and Delta's stock jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 48 3/8. Delta's performance was particularly impressive. Operating income for the quarter climbed 27 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 154m, on revenues of Dollars 3.2bn, up slightly from Dollars 3.1bn in the 1993 period. The gain was held to a modest level as a result of a 3.6 per cent reduction in capacity and lower fares, as reflected in a 4.4 per cent downturn in revenue per passenger mile. Nevertheless, underlying net income was up a robust 19 per cent at Dollars 72m. Including a one-time after-tax gain of Dollars 114m, net income was Dollars 186m, against Dollars 61m a year ago. UAL's results were more complicated. The third quarter was the first to reflect an agreement under which employees would acquire an initial ownership stake of 55 per cent in return for wage and other concessions. As a result of the transaction, outstanding shares decreased to 14.6m, from 28.7m a year ago on a fully diluted basis. The company took a Dollars 96m one-time charge to pay costs associated with the buy-out. Excluding the provision, profits were nearly 20 per cent better at Dollars 178m, or Dollars 10.05 a share, compared with Dollars 149m in the 1993 period. The improved profitability was struck on a 3.3 per cent gain in revenues to Dollars 3.4bn. A 7.2 per cent increase in traffic was partially offset by a 2.4 per cent decline in revenue per passenger mile.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Dearer petrol helps to keep inflation at 4.1% INFLATION stayed stubbornly unchanged at 4.1 per cent in February, disappointing government hopes that it would drop to 4 per cent. However, an increase in the German inflation rate to 4.3 per cent in February means that Britain's annual inflation rate fell below Germany's for the first time since 1967. The end of heavy discounting in the January sales caused prices in certain groups of the retail prices index to bounce back last month, and that left the annual rate unchanged. Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that the index rose from 135.6 in January to 136.3 in February, based on a weighting of 100 in January 1987. This represented a rise of 0.5 per cent. In spite of the month-on-month increase, the UK inflation rate remained below the EC average of 4.6 per cent in January, and below the 4.3 per cent average of ERM countries. After a sharp drop in clothing and footwear prices in January because of heavy discounting in the sales, the rate of inflation for this component of the RPI rose 1.3 per cent last month after a fall of 5.1 per cent in January. Higher petrol prices boosted the motoring expenditure component 0.7 per cent on the month, although it was also affected by some increases in second-hand car prices and spare parts. The higher petrol prices, against a drop in prices a year ago, contributed to keeping the underlying rate of inflation, which excludes mortgage payments, stable at 5.6 per cent. Leisure-services prices registered an annual rate of 11.3 per cent, unchanged on the previous month. The month-on-month increase was 0.1 per cent. Food prices rose 0.5 per cent last month, but there was a sharp drop in seasonal food price inflation, reflecting the mild winter. The rate of seasonal food price inflation dropped to 0.1 per cent last month from 3.3 per cent in January. A monthly increase of 0.9 per cent in household-goods prices reflected some recovery from January's record price reductions. There was no change in the cost of household services. While the year-on-year rate of increase in the RPI could come down to below 4 per cent in March as the recent reduction in mortgage interest rates takes effect, April could be a different story. The increases announced in the Budget earlier this month in excise duty on alcohol, tobacco, petrol and car road tax could combine to push the index up.</p>

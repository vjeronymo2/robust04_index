			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'SO MANY PEOPLE THINK WE'RE BAD PEOPLE. TO ME, THIS IS A VERY  RESPECTABLE BUSINESS.'  </P> <P> There is something very comfortable about the circular, green, felt-covered  tables, the many chunky glass ashtrays and the thickly cushioned chairs. There  is something almost soothing about the clink and slap of poker chips being  tossed into the pot and cards being quickly but gently shuffled. Hanging plants  and fresh floral arrangements complete the ambiance at the Oasis II Card Room  on El Cajon Boulevard. Kathy Graham, a thoughtful woman who once taught  Catholic Sunday school, seems an unlikely manager for a place like the Oasis.  The 39-year-old Alpine resident said she stumbled into managing the card room,  but now, after 10 years in the business, both as a dealer and a manager, she  couldn't imagine doing anything else. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke  interviewed Graham and Vince Compagnone photographed her.  </P> <P> We're regulated by the Police Department and the City Council, so we can be  open from 10 in the morning until 12 midnight. We're closed on Sundays. We all  have to wear badges. We have to go to the Police Department every year and  renew our badges -- they do a check on us and fingerprint us to make sure we're  not felons or running from the law.  </P> <P> An average day in here starts at 10 a.m. with a small game, a $20 buy-in game.  These people have some coffee and doughnuts, and they're ready to play at 10  o'clock. They have either reserved their seat the day before or they play  daily. The way we make our money is by charging $1.25 a half hour for the  rental of the seat. We're not allowed to rake the pot or take a percentage of  the pot like they do in Vegas. We have center dealers who don't play, they just  deal cards and make sure the pots are right and make sure no one is cheating.  </P> <P> At night we get a little busier, the games get a little bigger. During the day  most of our players are elderly people, who, if they didn't come in to this  place, they would probably vegetate in front of a television and not use their  minds or have a good time. They meet people. It's an excuse to get dressed, get  out of the house and come down here and meet their friends. We have some  elderly people, if they don't come in here for two or three days, we call them  and make sure they're all right. So, it's a pretty good little social club  here. It's real nice.  </P> <P> I came here to the Oasis to deal cards. The manager here just quit one day. He  had put a sign on the door saying he quit and he wouldn't be back. One of the  dealers called me at home and said, "Kathy, what shall we do?" I said, "Well,  sell the chips, get the games started and take that sign off the door." Ever  since that point I became the manager.  </P> <P> It was a difficult transformation for me because I had worked with all these  people and now I was supposed to be their boss. I thought we could just work  all together like a co-op, but that doesn't work. Most people said I could do  it, though, because I'm bossy anyway.  </P> <P> One thing I got out of Catholic school and a Catholic education -- and I might  have been lucky to have the nuns that I had -- but they told me, whatever I do,  don't be a hypocrite, and whatever I do, do it well.  </P> <P> That's why I love this business. It's so real here. It is. There's just nothing  phony here. If you come in and you look sick, they will say, "You look sick.  What's the matter with you?" And, if you come in and you look cute, they say,  "God, you look so cute." They don't hold back in here. It's pretty honest in  here. It's real.  </P> <P> There are times when it's difficult working with people who are losing their  money. They don't mind spending their money, going out to dinner, but when they  come in here and lose it and they want to win, sometimes it gets a little  difficult. It's also frustrating not to be understood or to be misunderstood in  this business. So many people think we're bad people. To me, this is a very  respectable business. To a majority of people, they think it's just awful.  </P></p>

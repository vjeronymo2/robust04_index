			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of the Albanian Christian Democratic Party"] </F>   [Text] Tirana, May 9 (ATA) -- The Albanian Christian  Democratic Party [PDK] supports the statement of the Democratic  Party branch of Kukes and considers most of the demands of the  displaced families as a result of the construction of hydro  power stations, as legitimate and realisable, a press release of  this party says. "But it asks these families not to allow that  their economic problems and demands be manipulated by those who  have been the real authors of their drama and who are now  pouring crocodile tears."    It says that the blocking of the roads and occupation of  state buildings are acts which only intend to give political  colour to the just economic demands of the removed families.  Also, it asks the representatives of these families and strikers  to define the ways of solving these demands through dialogue  with the government and in a constructive spirit. It also asks  the government to adopt all measures to accelerate the drafting  and application of the aid program for the removed families and  solve their problems, the statement concludes.</p>

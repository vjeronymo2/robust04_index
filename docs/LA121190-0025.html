			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> A CALL FOR COMPASSION AND SAFETY  </P> <P> The deaths of two commuters at the Del Mar train station last week were  accidents just waiting to happen.  </P> <P> The aging station was designed for leisurely tourist travel.  </P> <P> Now it is heavily used by Los Angeles-bound commuters, many of whom have to  cross the tracks from one of two nearby parking lots -- an inherently risky  layout that encourages using shortcuts.  </P> <P> There's a sanctioned -- and safer -- place to walk across the tracks 25 yards  away, where lights signal the trains' arrivals. Using it is a common- sense  prescription indeed.  </P> <P> But the station's daily use is incompatible with its design.  </P> <P> Even when the dangerous shortcut at Del Mar is fenced off, commuters will still  have to cross the tracks. And once the memories of Usha Waney and Roberta  Halpern fade, many will make the dash. Amtrak calls these two women  "trespassers." A more compassionate company would view them as victims.  </P> <P> San Diego and Del Mar are the only stations along the route to Los Angeles  where regularly used parking lots are located across the tracks. This should  change in 1992, when a new Solana Beach station will replace the Del Mar stop.  </P> <P> It's probably not practical to expect Amtrak to build a temporary overpass or  underpass. But it is not unreasonable to expect the company to put up signs and  look for other ways to help the passengers on one of its busiest routes.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Radio station KPFK-FM, in an unusual gesture, broadcast an early wake Tuesday  afternoon for its neighbor on the FM dial, KFAC, the pre-eminent classical  music station that is expected to change formats in September. During the first  hour of the two-hour program, some 20 listeners called in to lament news of  KFAC's impending change. KPFK host William Malloch called his program " a sort  of a funeral for KFAC." Said Malloch: "It appears KFAC will no longer broadcast  classical music starting sometime in mid-September. . . . I think the situation  is infuriating. I feel frustrated and I think listeners have rights. They're  taking a classical music station away from us which we have gotten used to and  which has become a part of our lives and we want it back." Malloch urged  listeners who are upset about the station's expected demise to write and call  the station and Evergreen Media Corp., which bought it in January for $55  million, the highest price ever paid for a classical music station. Although  station officials have not confirmed that the classical format will indeed  change, station employees and industry insiders say they have been told that  the station will change formats in September. The new format has not been  chosen, according to KFAC's general manager Jim de Castro, but speculation  centers on rock music. KFAC aired portions of a Rolling Stones press conference  last week. Said Malloch: "One minute Bach, the next moment boom, Twisted  Sister." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

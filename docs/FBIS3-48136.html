			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- With only six days  remaining in the current Diet session, the governing coalition  started a last-ditch effort Monday [24 January] to revive the  government-proposed political reform bills that were rejected by  the House of Councillors on Friday.    Top leaders of the government and the seven-party coalition  during a meeting are expected to confirm their policy that the  package be enacted during the current Diet session, which ends  Saturday, by gaining a compromise with the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a joint committee of both  houses.    Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito and chief  negotiator from the coalition, will meet his LDP counterpart  Yoshiro Mori on Monday afternoon to seek consent from the LDP.  Senior officials of the House of Representatives steering  committee on Monday will also discuss the issue of forming the  joint committee.    The coalition hopes to decide on setting up the joint  committee at a Diet plenary session Tuesday.    The future of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is in doubt  after the upper house rejected the reform bills he has pledged  to enact before the current Diet session ends.    Tokyo stock prices plunged in the morning session amid  Japan's political turbulence with the 225-issue Nikkei stock  average tumbling 727.07 points to 18,580.36 at 10 A.M.    Hosokawa, who took office last August as the first prime  minister from outside the LDP in 38 years, has vowed that he  will take "political responsibility" if he fails to achieve  political reform, suggesting he will dissolve the lower house  for a snap general election or make his cabinet resign en masse.    As the package, which was rejected by a margin of 12 votes  at  an upper house plenary session, has already passed the lower  house, it can be enacted if it is passed again by the lower  house by a two-thirds majority, or if a joint committee of 10  members each from both houses works out a compromise that wins  approval by a majority vote from the two houses.    A tug-of-war between proponents and opponents of political  reform within the LDP has intensified. A proponent group of LDP  parliamentarians led by former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will  urge LDP President Yohei Kono Monday afternoon to seek a  compromise with the coalition through a joint committee of both  houses, party officials said.    Another LDP group led by former Foreign Minister Taro  Nakayama decided Monday morning to call for a council to seek  enactment of the anticorruption measures separate from the  package, party officials said.    The government package is designed to clean up Japan's  scandal-tainted political system, completely overhauling the  mechanism for electing the lower house and tightening curbs on  political funds.</p>

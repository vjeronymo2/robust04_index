			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] On 4 February, the province held a meeting to  award outstanding news reports on propagating Liaoning. Gu  Jinchi, Wang Huaiyuan, Wang Chonglu, Zhang Rongmao, Zhang  Rongming, Wu Dengyong, and Zhao Fu, chairman of the provincial  press workers association, attended the meeting and also issued  awards to the award winners.    The activity of awarding outstanding news reports on  propagating Liaoning was cosponsored by the propaganda  department of the provincial party committee and the provincial  press workers association. Nine reports won special awards, 16  reports won the first-grade awards, and 28 reports won the  second-grade awards. [passage omitted]    Gu Jinchi made a speech at the meeting. On behalf of the  provincial party committee and the provincial government, he  extended greetings to the award winners and extended cordial  regards to the broad masses of press workers who have made  efforts to promote the construction of the material and  spiritual civilizations. He also set forth four opinions on  further achieving news propaganda. First, we should grasp an  accurate orientation of mass media, bring into full play the  news propaganda front's instructive and educational functions.  We should mobilize the broad masses of the cadres and the  masses to dedicate themselves in reform. Second, closely in  line with the central work of the provincial party committee and  the provincial government, we should increase the contents of  propaganda on economic work and promote a sustained, fast, and  sound development of the economy. Third, we should  conscientiously select subjects, strengthen the depth of  reports, and strive to upgrade the quality and level of news  propaganda. Fourth, we should strengthen external propaganda  and further expand Liaoning's influential power at home and  abroad.    Gu Jinchi said: The news propaganda work is of extreme  importance. The provincial party committee and the provincial  government have paid high attention to it. The year 1994 is a  key year to promote the package economic reform with  breakthroughs in key areas as well as a year when the number of  major reform measures is more than any other years and the setup  of the socialist market economic system is accelerated.  Therefore, strengthening the news propaganda work is of  peculiar importance.    Gu Jinchi said: The propaganda on the promulgation of major  reform measures is an important content of the news propaganda  work. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the  14th party congress, particularly the third plenary session of  the 14th party Central Committee; and also pay attention to  grasping the central guidelines by handling the relationship  between the promulgation of major reform measures and the setup  of the socialist market economic system. The problems that the  masses pay attention to should accurately be explained and  positively be guided. We should propagate the contents of  various reform measures among the cadres and the people; clearly  explain the relationship between reform and development, between  reform and the work in other aspects, and between reform and the  lives of the people; enhance the people's understanding about  reform and their psychological bearing ability; and form a  social environment and a mass media environment that are  conducive to reform. It is not easy to achieve the work in  these aspects. Therefore, the press workers should not only arm  their brains with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the  14th party congress but also deeply engage themselves in the  practice of reform and go deep to the grass roots to catch the  news of guidance importance and high value to promote the work  of the overall situation and to deepen the reform work of the  province.    Gu Jinchi said: Concentrating energy to achieve the  economic construction is a central task of the province. We  should fully apply various means to conscientiously propagate  economic construction and concentrate the people's attention to  achieve modernization and realize the province's second  pioneering work. The propaganda on economic work should be  carried out closely in line with the reality of the province.  In line with the province's economic development strategies and  ideas, we should prominently increase the dynamics of  propaganda. The propaganda on economic work should be carried  out closely in line with the reality of economic construction,  reform, and opening up. We should be good at abstracting some  essential things from large amounts of complicated economic  phenomena, sum up those successful experiences in economic work  and gained from the practice of production and management  activities, and propagate them. By so doing will our news  reports be compiled vividly and profoundly.    Gu Jinchi said: News can directly and actively reflect  political, economic, cultural, and social activities. The  principle of party spirit of news decides that press propaganda  prominently has main melody and fully displays the spirit of the  times. We should reflect the profound changes in the society as  a whole brought about by reform and opening up; the party and  government's major measures for leading the construction of  socialist modernization, particularly the ideas and measures for  implementing the major policy decisions of the central  authorities according to Liaoning's reality; the fruitful  achievements in building material and material civilizations;  and the mental outlook of the people. We should pay attention to  the research on the thinking of reports. It is necessary to  grasp the selection of major subjects. Not only editors in  chief and radio and television station directors but also  editorial staff members should make researches on it. So long  as we often make researches and deliberations will we be able to  grasp key news points and major subjects and improve the quality  and efficiency of news propaganda. We should pay attention to  strengthening the depth of reports, concentrate on disseminating  major subjects and key typical examples, and bring into full  play the mass media's guidance role. We should persist in the  principle of propaganda by giving positive examples, grasp  hot-debated issues, have the daring to touch the hot-debated  problems in society, and also give accurate explanations and  guidance. We should increase reports and commentaries on public  opinions and increase the ideological contents of reports. It  is necessary to vigorously encourage press workers to change  their work style and to go deep to the grass roots to conduct  investigation and study.    Gu Jinchi said: External propaganda is an important  component part of the propaganda work. The fundamental tasks  for external propaganda are to foster Liaoning's image at home  and abroad and to create a good mass media environment for the  province's reform, opening up, and modernization. Over the past  years, the external propaganda work has ceaselessly been  enhanced and played a key role. Besides the concerted efforts  made by all fronts of the province, the central and overseas  press units stationed in Liaoning and the key press units of the  province have made lots of fruitful achievements and made key  contributions to expanding Liaoning's influential power at home  and abroad. The purpose to launch the activity of "giving  outstanding news reports on propagating Liaoning" is to  strengthen external propaganda and news propaganda and to  encourage the broad masses of press workers to make more  introductions of Liaoning to the places at home and abroad.  Now, many countries in the world are carrying out the strategy  of opening up. There are frequent international economic and  cultural contacts. We must make more and faster introductions  of Liaoning to the outside world. We should be good at using  the current favorable opportunities, positively improve and  realistically strengthen external propaganda, bring into full  play the external propaganda work's functions for guiding the  mass media in the course of expanding the scale of opening up,  and have Liaoning enjoy high prestige in the world.    Gu Jinchi hoped that in the new year, the broad masses of  press workers should work harder, create increasingly more  outstanding works, and make greater contributions to promoting  the construction of the two civilizations.    Wang Chonglu, member of the standing committee of the  provincial party committee and director of the propaganda  department, chaired the meeting. Gao Dongxiao, deputy director  of the propaganda department, introduced the situation relating  to the selection of news and commentaries. Responsible persons  of the central press organizations stationed in Shenyang and the  provincial-level press units and representatives of award  winners held talks and set forth many good opinions and  suggestions on how to achieve the news propaganda work.</p>

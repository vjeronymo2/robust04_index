			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Pounds 650m rise in electricity prices 'unjustified' The electricity distribution industry was yesterday accused by two consumer groups of imposing Pounds 650m of 'unjustified' price rises in the three years following privatisation. The National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association urged Offer, the electricity industry regulator, to claw back 'excess returns' and cut prices. The two groups said domestic price rises of 13 per cent in the first three years after privatisation had failed to deliver better service. Their report is the latest in a series criticising power distributors over price rises and profits, and accusing them of favouring shareholders over customers. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said the report showed the need for the government to put pressure on companies to give back money to consumers. 'Consumers were promised lower bills with privatisation,' he said. 'Instead the main beneficiary has been the City.' The issue is increasingly sensitive as the government prepares to impose value added tax of 8 per cent on electricity bills in April. Protests about recent high profit rises suggest that controls which the industry might regard as draconian would be seen as inadequate by consumers and political opponents of privatisation. One of Offer's problems is that the review covers only power distribution businesses, which account for about 25 per cent of final power bills. Tight controls would have limited impact on final prices. Offer and the power distributors frequently say prices have fallen in real terms since privatisation, particularly since last April, which is not covered by yesterday's report. They also point to improved service standards. But yesterday's report, a response to an Offer consultation document, demonstrates the cynicism with which the industry's claims are regarded. Analysts say a case can be made for real rises and falls, with the outcome depending on the start and end dates and on assumptions for inflation. The Consumers' Association said electricity companies could have made a more than adequate profit without increased prices. Dr John Belshon, its chief executive, said: 'Offer has got to get its act together urgently. It has been sitting on its hands for too long.' The National Consumer Council said the regional companies' rate of return for the distribution businesses reached 9.2 per cent in 1992-93, compared with 6 per cent at British Gas and targets in the water industry of between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.

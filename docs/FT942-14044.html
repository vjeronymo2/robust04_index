			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Norwegian medical unit heads for Gorazde Members of a Norwegian medical unit left Sarajevo airport yesterday as part of a United Nations convoy of 100 troops and 40 medical staff heading for the besieged Bosnian Moslem enclave around Gorazde, only to be blocked by a crowd of Serb women demonstrators. In Gorazde itself Serb forces continued to shell the town, including a makeshift hospital, where about 20 people were killed, Our Foreign Staff reports. In Washington, the US yesterday proclaimed its 'strategic interest' in containing the Bosnian war. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, said the US wanted to stop conflict from reigniting in Croatia or starting in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. 'We have a strategic interest in preventing that war from spreading,' he told Congress, voicing confidence that European allies would back escalating air strikes when they confer in Brussels. In Gorazde 450 people have been killed and 1,500 injured since last month when Serb forces began their assault. Bosnia's prime minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, said the town's Moslem defenders faced Serb demands that they abandon their remaining pockets of resistance on the right bank of the town, where the hospital is located. But local radio stations said the defenders would not surrender. There were reports last night of hand-to-hand fighting in the town. UN officials yesterday feared for the fate of 13 UN and humanitarian workers trapped in Gorazde.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mauricio Menezes, Marcelo Faga, and Marita Boos] </F>   [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The Rio de Janeiro district  attorney will send the federal government files on the entrance  of cocaine into Brazil through Paraguay in operations allegedly  financed by the Rio de Janeiro illegal numbers lottery bankers.  This is one of the main branches of the investigation that began  after police busted into the fortress home of illegal lottery  banker Castor de Andrade last week. Hundreds of names of  individuals and organizations financed by the illegal lottery  were found thanks to the investigation.    Illegal lottery banker Waldermiro Garcia, aka Miro, who is  considered the richest of all the numbers lottery bankers, owns  a casino in Ciudad del Este (Paraguayan city on the border with  Foz de Iguazu). According to Paraguayan builders, nearly a year  ago he invested $2 million just to refurbish his casino.    According to information obtained by Brazilian police that  is  in the District Attorney's Office's hands, 60 small, private  airplanes fly daily from Paraguay into Brazil bringing drugs  from Bolivia and Colombia. Most of the airplanes land in Sao  Paulo State, from where the drugs are taken to Rio de Janeiro in  small quantities.    The Rio de Janeiro district attorney will ask the government  to carry out negotiations with the Paraguayan Government to  further control the flights of small airplanes leaving for  Brazil. The subject is being handled with total discretion  because there are suspicions that Paraguayan Government  officials may be involved in these operations. The  investigations show that besides being used to bring cocaine,  the airport [not further specified], which already has been  closed once, also is used to receive smuggled weapons.  <H5>  Reactions </H5>   The day at the Rio de Janeiro District Attorney's Office was  marked by reactions against the release of the list of names of  people who received money from the illegal lottery scheme.    Rio District Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia, who today  wanted to concentrate on analyzing the thousands of pages from  the accounting books where the financial movements of the  illegal lottery bankers are registered, was forced to receive  politicians and lawyers protesting the manner in which the case  was made public.  <H5>  Files </H5>   After decoding 166 diskettes confiscated from the home of  Castor de Andrade, the prosecutors and computer experts  investigating the corruption scheme operated in Rio de Janeiro  by the illegal lottery on 8 April managed to enter the files of  the illegal lottery's top bankers, and they believe they will  obtain extraordinary revelations. Nonetheless, they are waiting  for authorization from District Attorney Biscaia to reveal their  findings.    The diskettes found in the safes of Castor de Andrade's  fortress home that police busted last week are being studied by  experts from the District Attorney's Office and the Rio de  Janeiro State Data Processing Center [Centro de Processamento de  Dados--Proderj]. The work being carried out at the Military  Police Classified Services Office, at the institution's  headquarters, were surrounded by mystery on 8 April.    According to Classified Services Commander (P2) Colonel  Marcos Paz, some of the diskettes' contents already have been  printed by the experts. The printed pages were taken to the  District Attorney's Office. The experts did not want to give out  any information about their work, saying the information on the  results is centered at the District Attorney's Office.</p>

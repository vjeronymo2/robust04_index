Later at  a local hotel, he met with reporters and admitted that  Guatemalan rebels could have provided guidance and weapons  during the Chiapas conflict.    [De Leon] "Just today, we spoke with President Carlos  Salinas  de Gortari about the possible involvement of Guatemalans or  other foreign nationals in the January events. As the defense  minister has already said, we cannot deny that possibility."    During a dinner hosted by the Mexican leader and his wife to  honor Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and his  coterie, President Salinas said economic development is a  guarantee for peace.    [Salinas] "This is why it is important to maintain peace as  an asset of unbreakable unity and a requirement for civilian  coexistence. For Mexico and all Latin American countries, peace  with justice is our most valuable heritage."    President De Leon Carpio was optimistic about signing a  peace  agreement thereby concluding three decades of war between the  Guatemalan guerrillas and the Army.    [De Leon] "The conflict is such that it has hampered any  possibility of growth and impaired all efforts of moving more  swiftly toward sustained and sustainable development."    Mexican cabinet members and the Guatemalan delegation also  attended the dinner offered by Mr. and Mrs. Salinas de Gortari  in honor of the Guatemalan president and his wife, Maria Eugenia  Morales de Leon Carpio.</p>

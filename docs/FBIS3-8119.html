PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Cabinet stands  firmly in favour of closer contacts with Bulgaria, Mr. Kornazhev  told a BTA reporter upon his return to Bulgaria. He also said  that Greece is expecting a visit by Bulgarian Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov in a two week's time.    Mr. Kornazhev told this reporter that he and his host  identified a common understanding on the judicial problems of  the European Union. The two discussed a variety of issues,  including the conditions in Bulgarian and Greek jails, problems  pertaining to the execution of death penalty and the specificity  of the Balkans.    Mr. Kornazhev and Mr. Skouvelakis reportedly considered a  bilateral agreement on transfer of convicts which has to be  further deliberated before being signed.    Speaking with his Greek hosts, Mr. Kornazhev stressed that  Bulgaria is supportive of a policy of active neutrality in the  Balkans and that it sees no controversial issues concerning its  borders with Greece. The Bulgarian minister of justice said he  also met Greek Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos.</p>

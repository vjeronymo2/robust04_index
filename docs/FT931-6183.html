			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Heroes of the Italian inquisition: A look at the role of investigative magistrates probing corruption AN OBSCURE television programme presenting court cases has suddenly become mass viewing in Italy. The producers hit on the idea of covering a case of municipal corruption in Milan with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the high-profile investigative magistrate, as the prosecuting attorney. The case, now nearing its close, has attracted more than 8m viewers. The programme's success derives from the mix of voyeurism at the pathetic figure of a municipal official writhing under the accusations of corruption and the satisfaction of seeing a confident interrogation by Mr Di Pietro as the triumphant prosecution. As the nation is buffeted by the growing wave of corruption scandals, it needs heroes and villains. The investigative magistrates, led by the team in Milan which started to lift the lid on corruption a year ago and which includes Mr Di Pietro, are undoubted heroes. But to what extent are they behaving correctly and are they stigmatising those investigated as automatic villains? Their critics have tended to be discounted because they are chiefly among the ranks of the accused like Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader. However, the comportment of the magistrates raises awkward questions about their tactics and political motivation. The investigative magistrate plays the role of a detective in an accusatory system of justice with powers of preventive detention. Any person about to be investigated has to be issued with a caution warning them of this avviso. The magistrates have exploited the issuing of the avviso as a form of public announcement of guilt. People like Mr Craxi have heard they are under investigation through the media, who in turn treat the avviso as a proof of magistrates possessing substantial evidence against the individual. The avviso, an instrument intended to protect citizens rights, has thus becomes a form of accusation. Magistrates have the right to imprison a suspect for three months, renewable on request by the courts. Throughout the Milan corruption scandal there has been a clear correlation between the amount of time a person spends in prison and their willingness to confess. Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the financier and builder dubbed the 'King of Milan concrete', spent 101 days in prison before he was released after talking of his role in pay-offs to politicians. Mr Enzo Papi, the managing director of Fiat's construction arm, Cogefar-Impresit, remained in prison for 55 days before being released after a confession. In contrast, Mr Silvano Larini, the Milan architect who helped collect commissions for the Socialists, handed himself in last month after eight months on the run having done a deal with magistrates. He was home on bail within three days. Milan's now notorious San Vittore prison, which houses the majority of those imprisoned, was built in 1879 to hold 800 detainees. Currently it has 2,040 and a further 80 in its clinic. The lawyer of Mr Antonio Mosconi, the chief executive of Toro, Fiat's insurance arm, complained last week that his client, arrested on February 22, was sharing a cell with three others. The magistrates argue they need preventive detention both to stop people leaving the country and stop people they are about to charge from talking to each other. At present at least three people are on the run, including the former head of Ferruzzi-Montedison, Mr Giuseppe Garofano, wanted for alleged involvement in pay-offs to the political parties. But it is not just the fact of preventive detention which has worried some of the victims - it is also the way the media is frequently tipped off to be present at arrests. The media, working in a pool, is also used to filter information on interrogations which in theory are covered by secrecy. In the meantime, the person investigated has either no chance to reply or replies once the magistrates' version is already known. In the case of the Milan corruption scandal, the position of accused persons is complicated because so many people have decided to confess to either taking or receiving bribes - close to 110. The final issue of the magistrates' behaviour centres on the accusation that the investigation is politically motivated, aimed at decapitating a corrupt politico-economic establishment. The Socialists believe they have been made particular victims with their leadership in the front line. In private top Socialists wonder why the investigative net has not caught up with senior figures in the Christian Democrats.</p>

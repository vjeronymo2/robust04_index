Former Prime Minister Marc Bazin has chosen the U.S.  newspaper THE MIAMI HERALD to voice his support for holding such  a national conference. The idea of a national conference is  nothing new. It has already been conducted in many countries,  and the results are positive,, writes the leader for the  Movement For the Establishment of Democracy, Marc Bazin. He  states in his article that there is no other peaceful and  reasonable alternative than the national conference. The return  to guerrilla techniques would be devastating and would only  facilitate the return to dictatorship. On the other hand, to use  and manipulate the tragedy of the boat people in order to take  power would be completely inexcusable, inhumane and  reprehensible. We are quoting some excerpts from Marc Bazin's  article in THE MIAMI HERALD of 16 January. The former prime  minister concludes, quote: A national conference should be,  above all, an invitation to a realistic, fair and practical  compromise,  unquote.</p>

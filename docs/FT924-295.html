			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Arts: The rehabilitation of Busoni - Berlin Opera Offenbach was not the only composer to find inspiration in the tales of ETA Hoffmann. Hindemith was another, Busoni a third. And it is to Busoni, least known of the three, that Daniel Barenboim turned in his opening season, just ended, as artistic director of the Deutsche Staatsoper in Berlin. Die Brautwahl was Busoni's first completed opera. Since its premiere in Hamburg in 1911, it has been infrequently revived, partly because Busoni's inexperience made for a long-winded text, but also because his music is so hard to classify. This excellent new production is therefore another step in Busoni's rehabilitation in the pantheon of 20th century music. Die Brautwahl (The Bridal Contest), subtitled 'a musical-fantastic comedy', is drawn from a collection of stories Hoffmann wrote shortly before his death in 1822. It follows the bizarre train of events set in motion when the Berlin dignitary Voswinkel decides to marry off his daughter Albertine. Voswinkel's favourite suitor is Thusman, a grotesque old bureaucrat. His rivals are the bright-eyed young artist Edmund Lehsen, with whom Albertine immediately falls in love, and an aristocratic fop named Baron Bensch. But larger forces are at work. The contest is manipulated by two mythical, medieval Jews - the eerily benevolent goldsmith-magician Leonhard and his eternal opponent, the malevolent hobo Manasse - who emerge from the woodwork at every turn, slogging it out for good and evil. Busoni, who was a bit of a wizard himself, matches this black farce note for note. Mercurial, contrapuntal and full of tricks only a master orchestrator can pull, the score shifts bewitchingly from sunny to sinister whenever the supernatural world impinges on the action. There are lightly-worn melodies and pirouettes, quotations from Rossini and Tchaikovsky, a love duet of intoxicating lyricism and glimpses of visionary ecstasy. It is all very eclectic. The Deutsche Staatsoper used an edition specially drawn up by the Busoni authority Anthony Beaumont and the stage director Nicolas Brieger. Roughly a third of the original has been cut, leaving just under two hours of music. This is not as extreme as it appears: disappointed by the work's poor reception at its premiere, Busoni sanctioned a heavily cut version for production in Mannheim and the swift succession of scenes hang together convincingly. The production, designed by Hermann Feuchter and Margit Koppendorfer, matched the fun and dexterity of the music. The setting was updated to early this century, with semi-naturalistic cut-away flats and gauzes and some authentic stage magic. The film sequence giving Thusman's eye-view as he hurtled through the Berlin streets was a tour de force, perfectly synchronised with the music. Brieger's intelligent direction helped unravel the complications of the plot, while Barenboim's conducting gave the performance momentum and transparence. But the wind solos did not suggest a major league orchestra. The two outstanding members of the cast were both experienced German bass-baritones - Siegfried Vogel as Albertine's cigar-smoking father and Oskar Hillebrandt's scruffy, shifty, Schigolch-like Manasse. Roman Trekel (Leonhard) and Robert Swensen (Lehsen) made up for small voices with strong characterisation. Dalia Schaechter, arriving on roller skates, was the agile Albertine, and Peter Kazaras a Mime-like Thusman. Carl Heinrich Graun, Kapellmeister at the court of Frederick the Great in Berlin, composed Cleopatra e Cesare for the opening in 1742 of his master's new opera house, now known as the Deutsche Staatsoper or Lindenoper. The work, unperformed for more than two centuries, has been revived as the centrepiece of the theatre's 250th anniversary celebrations. A performing edition was conflated from two hand-written scores - one apparently used by Graun himself, the other Frederick's library copy - which were unearthed in the east Berlin state archives. Rene Jacobs, a specialist conductor of 18th century opera, was engaged along with his original ensemble, Concerto Koln. The production team was German, the cast young and international. The result was a spectacular success, not least because it showed the theatre to be ideal for pre-Romantic opera. Graun's music typifies opera seria of mid-18th century Germany: a succession of da capo arias, linked by the briefest of recitatives, lacking Handel's dramatic sensibility or Gluck's feeling for words, but making up considerable ground in melodic elegance and coloratura. Honours are due all round: first to Jacobs and his musicians for breathing so much life into the score - fluent, well-sprung, texturally refined, full of dynamic subtlety. The cast, too, gave almost unalloyed pleasure: no self-serving vocal exhibitionism, stylistic correctness always married to musicality. Lynne Dawson invested Cornelia's arias with palpable feeling. Lentulo and Tolomeo were both tenors - the stylish Jeffrey Francis and a fiery but out-of-condition Curtis Rayam. Cesare was sung by the Italian mezzo Debora Beronesi, who held the stage like a classical god. Cleopatra was the nubile Janet Williams - an operatic Eartha Kitt, more sex-bomb than Egyptian queen, despatching her arias with mesmerising accuracy and aplomb. Fred Berndt's unfussy staging respected the formality of the music, while creating its own imaginative aesthetic. The decor was built around two motifs - a blue pyramid, shaped like a hollow, triangular staircase, to symbolise Caesar's precarious power, and a transparent pink obelisk symbolising Cleopatra's love. The performance began and ended with drop-curtains based on lithographs from Frederick the Great's time, depicting him and his court in harmony with the ancient Greek and Roman world. His example as patron of the arts serves us well today, and was the rightful inspiration for this glorious performance.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Trade fair to be held in Co Down More than 100 companies are expected to be represented at a trade fair at the end of September in Newry, Co Down. The fair, organised by chambers of commerce in Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, is aimed at encouraging business contacts between north and south. It also aims to help companies grasp the opportunities which will develop against the background of a lasting IRA ceasefire. Mr John Stringer, director of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, said: 'The timing is particularly important. There could hardly be a better time for a very practical initiative such as this.' It will be the largest conference of its kind organised by the chamber of commerce movement in Ireland. The chamber is also due to represent Northern Ireland companies at an exhibition in Dublin next month.</p>

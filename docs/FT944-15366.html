			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: French urge UK to join transport aircraft project France yesterday urged the British government to join the European project to build a new military transport aircraft. Mr Henri Conze, procurement chief at the French defence ministry, said UK participation was 'fundamental' to the project because the British might buy 60 of the planned 300 aircraft. Also, British involvement would help ensure that the Airbus consortium would carry out the project, he said. Last month, Airbus announced plans to establish a new military equipment subsidiary to manage the development and production of the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), Europe's proposed military transport plane. The separate military subsidiary would include the Italian aerospace company, Alenia, as well as the four Airbus partners, Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Casa, of Spain. The move was designed to strengthen the FLA group and to help market the aircraft to potential customers - including the UK's Royal Air Force. British Aerospace has been lobbying hard to persuade the UK defence ministry not to buy any more Lockheed transport planes from the US but to join the FLA project endorsed by France, Germany and some other European governments. Mr Conze predicted that Airbus could build the FLA 35 per cent more cheaply than the traditional cumbersome forms of international collaboration. 'But how can we achieve this if BAe is not in the programme, or if BAe is in, but the UK government is not in?' he asked during yesterday's opening of Euronaval, the biennial maritime equipment exhibition which France has opened for the first time to other Europeans. At next month's Franco-British summit, which is likely to be dominated by defence issues, the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, is expected to press Mr John Major, his UK opposite number, to go with the FLA rather than Lockheed. France is also hoping that Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, will show the same support for the European option as he did in the Westland affair in the mid-1980s. CMN, the French shipbuilder which recently failed to reach agreement to take over the bankrupt Swan Hunter yard in Newcastle, yesterday announced a marketing agreement with BAe Dynamics to put the latter's missiles on CMN's range of missile boats.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Greenpeace criticises Earth Summit agenda GREENPEACE, the environ-mental activist organisation, has accused organisers of next week's Earth Summit of allowing it to be 'hijacked by industry' and failing to include in the conference agenda any controls on industrial activities. At a press conference in Rio de Janeiro, Mr Kenny Bruno, co-ordinator of the Greenpeace Hazardous Export/Import Project, said the Summit had 'adopted industry's line that first world corporations have the capacity to spread environmentally sound, sustainable technologies thoughout the world'. The truth was that they remained 'the primary creators of dirty, dangerous and unsustainable technologies and are at the root of all the world's main environmental problems.' Mr Bruno accused companies of 'greenwash', which he said meant 'hiding environmentally destructive practices behind environmental images and language stolen from the ecological movement'. In a report Greenpeace examines the records of big companies which Mr Bruno claims 'are proclaiming environmentalism' while continuing to cause damage.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pan Rongjun [3382 2837 3182]: </F> ``Semiconductor-Laser-Pumped Er[.sup]3+[/]-Doped Fiber  Repeater Amplifier Modules Pass Appraisal'']    [Summary] On 15 December 1993, the model EFA9306  1480-nm-wavelength LD-pumped EDFA utilitarian module prototype  and the model EFA93O9 980-nm-wavelength LD-pumped EDFA  utilitarian module prototype developed by Qinghua University in  conjunction with other domestic research units passed the formal  technical appraisal organized by the State Education Commission.  These projects were supported by the State 863 High-Tech  Program, Information Area, Optoelectronics Key Task group. Both  EDFA modules met 1991 international standards; in addition, the  gain bandwidth for the model EFA9306 module measured 26 dB, well  over the stated 20 dB level.</p>

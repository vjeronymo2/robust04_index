			<p>BFN     [Text] The question of the Republic fully joining the ruble  zone was one of the important issues discussed during [recent]  talks between the leaders of Tajikistan and Russia.    Abdujalil Samadov, chairman of the Council of Ministers,  together with a group of experts, is now preparing the relevant  documents in this regard in Moscow.    However, reports on [Russian] central television allegedly  say that Tajikistan is introducing its own national currency.  These rumors are untrue.</p>

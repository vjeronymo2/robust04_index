			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: DSM in negotiations to buy Bristol-Myers Squibb unit DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, is in negotiations to buy fine chemicals business of Bristol-Myers Squibb's German subsidiary. DSM did not disclose terms or the sales figures of the businesses to be acquired. The operations DSM plans to acquire involve the manufacture of intermediates for antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs and diagnostic agents. The fine chemicals facilities at Regensburg, Germany, would be incorporated into DSM's Andeno fine chemicals division, the company said. Pharmaceuticals production at Regensburg would remain part of Bristol-Myers Squibb. The move is part of a trend for pharmaceuticals groups to dispose of non-core activities. Chemicals groups have been anxious to acquire fine chemicals and speciality activities. DSM has recently launched a corporate strategy called DSM 2000 aimed at focusing the group's operations. The company announced last month it planned to sell the US operations of Pixley Richards, its plastics moulding and assembly subsidiary. The company is also understood to be looking for a partner for its European fertiliser business. It is Europe's seventh-largest nitrogen fertiliser producer, and operates two Dutch ammonia plants with more than 1m tonnes a year capacity.</p>

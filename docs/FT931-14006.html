			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Footwear workers win 2.5% pay rise FOOTWEAR WORKERS are to receive a pay rise of 2.5 per cent in March. The deal covers about 30,000 employees, some 60 per cent of the industry's workforce. The industry's workers received a rise of 3.75 per cent in May last year. The National Union of Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades said it had put on hold its aspiration for a shorter working week and longer holidays in return for the pay rise and retention of the national agreement until next February. Footwear workers earn on average between Pounds 170 and Pounds 180 a week. About 5,000 jobs have been lost in the industry since mid-1991. The pay deal gives an early indication that the government's 1.5 per cent limit for the public sector may be exerting downward pressure on rises in the private sector. However, although most pay experts expect that the majority of the public sector will receive increases of about 1.5 per cent this year, there are doubts about whether the government will be able to prevent increases rising next year. Some public-sector employers have warned that the 1.5 per cent benchmark is raising pay aspirations in the public sector. Mr Stephen Bubb of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said yesterday that without the limit, many councils would have insisted on pay freezes this year.</p>

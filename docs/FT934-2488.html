			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Business failures decline sharply The number of business failures and bad debts dropped by a third in the third quarter compared with the same period in 1992, figures from Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurer, showed yesterday. In further indications of the recovery, all regions and all industry sectors reported declines in the number of failures in the period from July to September. The total of failures and bad debts, based on reports from Trade Indemnity clients, was 1,171 against 1,780 in the third quarter last year. The latest figures showed an 18 per cent decline on the second quarter of this year. Mr William Simpson, chief economist, said the trend 'provides conclusive proof that recovery in the UK is now established'. But he stressed that many businesses reliant on summer business slow down in the fourth quarter while those dependent on Christmas sales may also yet suffer difficulties. The largest falls between the third quarters of 1992 and 1993 were 51 per cent in Wales, 49 per cent in East Anglia and 45 per cent in Scotland. The sharpest sectoral declines between the same periods were 40 per cent for building and construction, 39 per cent for furniture and upholstery and 37 per cent for textiles and clothing. The smallest decrease in failures was of just 2 per cent in northern England. There was a 15 per cent decline in the north-west. Trade Indemnity warned that the risk of smaller companies failing would remain high because of their more limited access to funding.</p>

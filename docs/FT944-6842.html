			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Architecture: Welcomed in the hillside - The work of Niall Phillips I have long admired the work of the architect Niall Phillips. There has been a spate of publicity for his new buildings in Wales, and the announcement of a Royal Institute of British Architects award for the Castell Henllys educational centre in Dyfed marks his Bristol-based firm as one of the most outstanding in Britain. During the 1970s, Phillips worked with two brothers who described themselves as 'artist constructors'. Their work was largely in Somerset and in and around Bristol, and it represented a bold - if sometimes awkward - attempt to bring good modern architecture to the English village and countryside. In many ways the Organ brothers were catalysts because they saw clearly where run-of-the-mill modernism had gone so wrong. They also saw the low quality of so much speculative housing development that appeared on the edges of most villages in the 1960s. Much of the inspiration for Phillips's work comes from his intense regard for the site. His Welsh buildings are all in beautiful countryside, but they are enhancers, not damagers. They grow from the land - not by some phoney imitation of the vernacular but by original inspiration. He set up his own office in 1981 in Bristol having enjoyed a time working on the repair of old buildings on a Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings scholarship. This undoubtedly helped his appreciation of materials and his understanding of the integrity of old structures. Many houses on the Welsh borders have benefited from his skills, and he is an active conservationist working with the Vivat Trust and rescuing unwanted and unloved buildings. His work came to my attention particularly in connection with the conversion of some farmyard buildings that had been covenanted to the National Trust. The conversion of Lower Treginnis farm, near St David's, for the Farms for City Children charity (which takes inner-city children on working breaks to the countryside) is both sensitive and vigorous. There are wonderful features at Treginnis - windows low enough to the ground for small children to look out of; a great bay window in the dining room; comfortable (but not twee) inglenook fireplaces. The Welsh Wildlife Centre is a very special building. Phillips won the commission in a limited competition and the brief was for a centre which would include a field laboratory, classrooms, restaurant, an exhibition room and the inevitable shop. The site is on the south bank of the River Teifi near a disused railway line that once ran north to Cardigan. The client was the Dyfed Wildlife Trust, which was sensitive in its briefing about the need for an energy-efficient building that could demonstrate 'the sustainable use of natural resources.' The immediate environment was considered 'fragile', although rich in the flora and fauna of the river marshes. By deciding to let the new building nestle its three storeys against a steep escarpment, the architect both sheltered the structure and made it feel at home. By going to three storeys, less of the vulnerable land was used up by the footprint of the building, and the top floor could be used for the cafe with glorious views over the reed beds. From behind, the building simply shows its timber galleries and wooden shingle roof. This unassuming and quiet elevation is little preparation for the agreeable shock that you are in for on reaching the front, where the shop and exhibition area and the main restaurant are housed behind an elegant glass wall, beneath a roof that is curved like a Welsh coracle. The drama of this large high space is such that you feel as though you are in a very large and beautiful tree-house. The views from the top floor are stunning, and the carefully controlled use of materials relates the new building to the colourful autumn trees and the restrained palette of the marshes. The base of the whole building roots it to the site because it is carefully made of local stone. The decision to mix old and new technologies - timber and frameless planar glass - was a bold one, and succeeds brilliantly. It is precisely the way that this architectural firm marries old and new technologies while utterly respecting its sites that makes it an outstanding one. Another educational visitors' centre was recently opened at Castell Henllys, near Haverfordwest in the Pembrokeshire coast national park, and here Phillips used materials that come entirely from local sources. He spent only Pounds 250,000, and provided a place that is mainly for children who gather among its tree-trunk columns in an almost Hobbit-like way. The roof of this centre is covered in turf that continues to produce a fine crop of wild flowers and meadow grasses. This little building, surrounded by tree-trunk seats for the children and magic rings of local stone, could be criticised as sentimental. In fact, it is not. It is entirely appropriate both for the site and for the children, who love it. Phillips has worked on a larger scale and in towns. His conversion of Ebley Mill in Stroud, Gloucestershire, into offices for the local authority, and the transformation of New Mills at Wooton-under-Edge into a high-tech engineering plant, demonstrate how to re-use redundant industrial buildings effectively. Niall Phillips is typical of a few architects who ignored the madder aspects of the booming 1980s and stuck to their principles of sustainable architecture. He and his disciples are the architects of the future.</p>

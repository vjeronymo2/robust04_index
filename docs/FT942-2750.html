			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Packaging groups to merge health interests CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging group, is merging its health and beauty packaging interests with those of Wheaton, the privately-owned US packaging concern, to create the largest force in that area of the international packaging industry. Mr Jurgen Hintz, chairman of CarnaudMetalbox, said Wheaton International, the newly-merged company, would be world leader in the profitable health and beauty packaging business with a 5 per cent market share on annualised sales of FFr5.1bn (Dollars 895m). 'We'll be the only company in that market with the capacity to launch products simultaneously all over the world,' he added. The merger reflects the consolidation among the cosmetic, perfume and pharmaceutical companies that are the customers of CarnaudMetalbox and Wheaton's health and beauty packaging interests. These areas of the packaging market have shown strong growth in recent years thanks partly to the trend towards more elaborate packaging, particularly in the beauty sector. CarnaudMetalbox and Wheaton, which respectively command annualised sales of FFr2.5bn and FFr2.6bn in the businesses that will be pooled to create Wheaton International, share some multinational clients such as France's L'Oreal, Procter &amp; Gamble of the US and the Anglo-Dutch Unilever. However, Mr Arnaud Fayet, director of CarnaudMetalbox, stressed the two companies were 'very complementary in terms of regional spread and product specialisations'. CarnaudMetalbox, he said, was strongest in Europe and in cosmetics packaging with Wheaton's strength lying in North America and the pharmaceuticals field. The ownership of Wheaton International will be evenly split between CarnaudMetalbox and its US partner.</p>

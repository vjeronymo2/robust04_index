			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Arts: Welsh Symphony - London Promenade Concerts Sunday afternoon's Prom concert may have had a 'safe' programme, reasonable enough for the family-slot in a Bank Holiday weekend, but it never sounded like mere routine. Conducting the BBC Welsh Symphony, Tadaki Otaka was freshly attentive to everything. The longest piece was Max Bruch's G minor violin concerto, which has been fading from the repertoire since the Second World War. Raphael Oleg delivered it with searching affection, and complete command of its virtuoso writing - in which he always found good musical sense; Otaka built up the orchestral music to a grand Brahmsian scale. The central Adagio was both poignant and imposing, as it should be. A worthy performance of this concerto always makes one think that we ought to hear much more Bruch: it is a pity that not much more Bruch actually lives up to this elevated standard. Even the choice of concert-opener, Mendelssohn's familiar overture Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage, had an extra point here, for Elgar quotes it in the penultimate variation of his 'Enigma' set which ended the concert. There was another, more languishing seascape after the interval, when Ann Murray sang Chausson's Poeme l'amour et de la mer+. She captured a sharp sense of loss beyond well-bred feeling, almost persuading me that the darker mezzo voice usually assigned to the piece is not strictly necessary; meanwhile Otaka - and particularly his cellos - drew out Chausson's svelte lines with assured poise. Finally, the 'Enigma' Variations got a properly idiomatic performance, emphasising both continuity and contrast: no sense of an old war-horse being exercised, but rather of respectful, sympathetic rediscovery. Clearly, the BBC Welsh orchestra is prospering with Otaka. ***** Friday's concert in the Albert Hall was given over to the music of John Adams. In the hierarchy of the proms such honours do not come the way of many contemporary composers; that Adams was favoured is a measure of the insidious popularity of his works and the brouhaha that has surrounded his two operas, Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer. Adams himself conducted the London Sinfonietta whose director, Paul Crossley, was the soloist in Eros Piano. That piece, sandwiched between Shaker Loops and Grand Pianola Music, proved the low point. Inspired by the music of Takemitsu it shows Adams' powers of construction at their weakest, and its language of Skryabin, Berg and Messiaen rechauffe at his flabbiest. At least Shaker Loops, which established Adams as a distinctive voice in the 1980s, has stylistic consistency and strength. There's a convincing integrity about the musical material and a carefully plotted structure which owes more than a little to Sibelius. At least Adams is pleasantly unabashed about all these magpie tendencies, consciously absorbing all the influences and allowing them to ferment. In Grand Pianola Music they burst out in glorious profusion, throwing 19th-century triumphalism into the mix as well. The result is coarse-grained  -there's nothing subtle about the scoring, and the big tune that caps the second movement is irredeemably banal. But in this case it is done with some panache and tongue firmly wedged into cheek; when Adams doesn't take himself too seriously his music seems all the better for it.</p>

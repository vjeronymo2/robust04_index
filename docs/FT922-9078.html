			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: National Savings cuts its rates NATIONAL Savings overhauled its products this week in the wake of the base rate cut and building society complaints that its products were luring their depositors away. Rates were cut by between 0.5 and 1 percentage point across the range. There were also changes in the maximum holdings on certain products. The changes were: Certificates. The 36th issue (which paid 8.5 per cent) has been withdrawn; the new 37th issue, on sale from May 13, will offer 8 per cent tax-free if held for five years. This is the equivalent, for a top rate taxpayer, to a gross rate of 13.33 per cent and still looks pretty attractive. Returns, of course, will be lower if you cash in early. However, the maximum holding will be only Pounds 7,500, compared with Pounds 10,000 for the 36th issue. The rate on the Yearly Plan has also been reduced from 8.5 per cent to 8 per cent, but the maximum monthly contribution has been increased from Pounds 200 to Pounds 400. Capital bonds. The Series C bonds, which paid a taxable 11.5 per cent, have been withdrawn. The Series D certificates, on sale from May 13, will pay 10.75 per cent per annum if held for five years. Taxpayers should be aware that, although interest is only paid on maturity, they will be taxed each year as if they were receiving the interest in cash terms. The requirement to give three months notice before cashing in the bonds has been abolished. Children's bonus bonds. Issue A, which paid a healthy 11.84 per cent tax-free, has been withdrawn. Issue B will go on sale from May 23 and will pay 10.9 per cent per annum if held for five years. Returns on all these certificates are fixed, and biased towards those who hold the bonds or certificates for the full five years. Income bonds. The return on these variable rate bonds will be cut from a taxable 10.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent from June 18. The maximum holding has been increased from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 50,000. Joint holders may now hold up to Pounds 100,000 between them. Investment account. The variable return on this account will be cut from a taxable 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent on May 19. Deposit bonds. The variable return on these bonds, which are no longer on sale, will be cut from a taxable 10.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent on June 18. The building societies will make their own rate revisions, in the light of the Chancellor's announcement, and investors may well find that these National Savings returns are still highly competitive.</p>

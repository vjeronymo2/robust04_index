			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bally Chief Rules Out Bankruptcy Filing: The new interim chief executive of  Chicago-based Bally Manufacturing Corp. said bankruptcy is not an option for  the financially troubled gaming and recreation company.  </P> <P> "That word isn't in my vocabulary," Arthur A. Goldberg said. Goldberg, the  largest stockholder, took the reins Friday when Chairman Bob Mullane stepped  down. The company, which owns hotel-casinos in Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic  City, has $1.86 billion in debts. Goldberg, known as a cost-cutter, said, "I  have been on record that a thing's for sale at the right price, but we're not  committing ourselves to anything."  </P></p>

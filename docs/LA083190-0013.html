			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TUNNEL FIRE  </P> <P> On behalf of Caltrans, District 7 -- and especially the bridge, construction,  maintenance and traffic forces -- I want to express our thanks to the motoring  public who helped us deal with the closing of the downtown Hollywood Freeway  (101) due to last month's fire, which destroyed a portion of the RTD Metro Rail  tunnel.  </P> <P> I realize the inconvenience to commuters was horrendous.  </P> <P> However, California drivers have proven once again that when we ask for their  help, they are more than willing to respond.  </P> <P> While the various freeway closures were in place, Caltrans' maintenance forces  removed graffiti from signs and walls, replaced some signs and washed the rest.  They also replaced 4,200 pavement markers; stenciled pavement markings on all  closed ramps; repaired guardrails and one bridge joint; swept shoulder areas,  as well as maintained closures and barricades at all approaches to the downtown  101 slot.  </P> <P> When Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol began reopening freeway  sections and ramps, it was very gratifying to see motorists smile and give us  the thumbs-up sign as they drove by. I also want to thank the Los Angeles City  Department of Transportation and County Health; RTD/Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission/Metro Rail; the fire companies from throughout the  Southland; the Los Angeles police and CHP, Cal/OSHA; Tutor-Salib-Perini, Metro  Rail contractor and the Red Cross.  </P> <P> JERRY B. BAXTER  </P> <P> District 7 Director, Caltrans  </P></p>

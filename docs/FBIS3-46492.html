			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year Message by King Phumiphon Adunyadet -- recorded] </F>   [Text] Thai people, the New Year is an occasion when we  should be thinking of each other and wishing each other  happiness and the fulfilment of his aspirations. I convey my  good wishes to everyone and thank you very much for your good  cooperation and support in all my endeavors.    In the past year several abnormal events occurred, including  the simultaneous events of drought and flooding. Some of these  abnormal events caused anxiety and concern, while some greatly  affected the livelihood, occupation, and economy of individuals  and the country. However, because most of us have good sense,  perseverance, strong mind, and compassion, we were able to  cooperate to alleviate the severity of these events.    These abnormal events should make you realize that in a  person's life he is going to face danger, obstacles, good as  well as bad luck. No one will be able to live happily forever.  Everyone must prepare his mind and body to be ready to cope  with and recover from abnormalities and problems, using  rationality, sound knowledge, righteousness, thoroughness, and  the power of unity.    I strongly wish that everyone is aware of and truly  understands the country's situation. That is, our country now  needs efficient and urgent development so that it will fully  benefit from its resources and from every Thai person's labor  and intelligence. There can be no delay for any reason, because  whatever benefits that could be gained will be wasted. In this  era, such a waste is a loss.    We can all help by being determined to uphold national  interests as the goal. Selfish interests and disputes over  nonsensical matters must be minimized. One must quickly perform  and complete his duties to the best of his ideas, knowledge,  ability and to do so with sincerity, kindness, a sense of unity,  and good intention toward others. In this way, the achievements  of everyone will consolidate into happiness, security, and  prosperity of the country, which is our ultimate goal.    May the power of the three gems and all sacred beings in the  universe protect you from all danger and evil and endow you with  good and strong health, mind, and wisdom to successfully carry  out all your activities that benefit yourself, the country, as  well as its independence, freedom, and happiness forever. May  everyone of you enjoy happiness and prosperity and the  fulfillment of your wishes.</p>

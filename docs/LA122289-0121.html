			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eastern Pilots Oppose Route Sale: The leaders of the Eastern Airlines pilots'  union said they oppose the proposed sale of the airline's South and Central  American routes to American Airlines and plan to file an objection to the  transaction in bankruptcy court. Eastern is in bankruptcy proceedings. The  airline's 1,800 pilots ended a damaging nine-month walkout on Nov. 22 but none  have been rehired because Eastern replaced them during the strike.  </P></p>

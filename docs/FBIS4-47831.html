			<p>BFN     [Text] A caucus of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly is to  meet in Ulundi today to discuss claims of electoral fraud in  KwaZulu-Natal. A spokesman for the assembly said there would  also be discussions on the future of legislative assembly  members after the inauguration of the new provincial legislature  in Pietermaritzburg. He said King Goodwill Zwelithini planned to  address the meeting.    The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] said earlier that  it was investigating allegations by the ANC of massive election  fraud by the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal. IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  spokesman Frank Mdlalose has denied the ANC allegations. He  told REUTER that he was not aware of any fraud orchestrated by  the IFP. Commenting on the IEC investigation, Dr. Mdlalose said  he doubted its impartiality because there were too many ANC  sympathizers in the commission. An ANC official in  KwaZulu-Natal said the party had information that ballot boxes  from IFP strongholds in rural areas of the region had been  tampered with.</p>

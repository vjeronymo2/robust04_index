			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mohammad Yamin] </F>   [Text] India's decision to deploy long-range nuclear  missiles -- Prithvi and Agni -- has caused understandable  concern to Pakistan. The Indian move will greatly enhance the  threat to peace and security in South Asia and as a spokesman of  Pakistan's Foreign Office observed the other day, it will raise  the specter of a nuclear arms race in the region. In view of  the ongoing internal uprising held in Kashmir and the unresolved  dispute between India and Pakistan over the future status of  Jammu and Kashmir, and also the historical fact that there have  been three major armed conflicts between the two countries since  their independence, Pakistan will be the most likely target of  India's newly acquired military muscle. In long term, of course,  there will be other countries who would also have to face up to  the reality of life when India decides to flex its muscle in  pursuance of its hegemonic designs in the region and its  ambition of becoming a regional superpower.    Pakistan has, therefore, conveyed its concern over the  matter  to the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, countries that  include, among others, the United States. Hopefully, the MTCR  nations would respond positively to Pakistan's message and  exercise their collective and individual influence over India to  give up dabbling in nuclear missilery and other weaponry of mass  destruction.    Given India's intransigence over the issue, or for that  matter over any bilateral or multilateral issues throughout 47  years of its existence as an independent nation, the pursuance  of Pakistani request by the MTCR countries is going to be a  formidable task. The Indian prime minister has given a fair  proof of it. Addressing the Indian Parliament on the eve of his  departure for the United States on an official visit, Mr.  Narasimha Rao chose to rule out the possibility that he might  agree to roll back India's nuclear or missile program during his  U.S. trip. In fact, his decision for any such suggestion was  forceful and vehement and he remarked that a leader would be  worthless if he changed the policies of his government during  visits to foreign countries. He reiterated that his government  would firmly adhere to its nuclear and missile development  policies. (?While) on one hand, India is pressing ahead with  its militaristic designs and augmentation of its military might  at a hectic pace, on the other hand, it is [word indistinct]  upon its own brand of disinformation and spread of false  propaganda against Pakistan. To blame the revolt of Kashmiri  people against the Indian occupation on Pakistan is easy enough.  It now holds Pakistan responsible for trouble even inside its  northeastern states that are over a thousand mile distance from  Pakistan. It is also engaged in repeating the wild stories of  Pakistan's complicity in last year's bomb blasts in Bombay.  Along with its diplomatic and publicity offensive, India is  also busy in acts of sabotage and mischief in liberated areas of  Kashmir. It is also indulging in violations of the airspace of  Azad Kashmir. Several Indian military helicopters flew along  the Line of Control on 5 May and on two occasions, they crossed  over into Azad Kashmir, besides two Indian terrorists were  apprehended recently in Kotli sector of Azad Kashmir. They were  carrying 52 kg of explosives and had confessed that they were on  a sabotage mission at the behest of the Indian authorities. All  these have ominous forebodings for peace and tranquillity in  South Asia, particularly the deployment of Agni and Prithvi  missiles must be seen as an important landmark in India's  nuclear capability and a clear adoption of a threatening posture  against small neighbors, Pakistan being on the top of the list.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Maximum Alert at Aviano and Other </F> Air Bases"]    [Text] Rome -- A state of maximum alert has been declared  at all NATO bases in Italy. The security measures, implemented  on the ground as well as in the air, were strengthened before  the attack [on Gorazde] and are aimed at avoiding possible  terrorist attacks and at preventing reprisals. Aircraft at all  bases are ready to take off immediately.    The NATO bases involved are: Aviano, with U.S. F-15, F-16,  F-18, and A-10 antitank aircraft; Istrana, with French Mirage  aircraft; Cervia, with French Mirage and Jaguar aircraft;  Villafranca, with Netherlands F-16's; Ghedi, with Turkish  F-16's; Gioia del Colle, with RAF Jaguar and Tornado aircraft;  and Brindisi, with U.S. AC-130's. The latter aircraft, which  carries a 105-mm gun on its side, was used by the Americans in  Somalia.    The aircraft carriers in the Adriatic Sea -- the USS  Saratoga; the British Ark Royal, carrying Sea Harriers; and the  French Clemanceau -- also have been placed on maximum alert.</p>

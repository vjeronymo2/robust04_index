			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Welcome to the Jerk Centre 'SO, WHITE man, you want a lickle buss up shut?' I was looking at a very large Trinidadian lady holding an 18-inch serving spoon in her hand. It sounded threatening. But she hardly seemed violent, so I took a punt on it. I was handed a polystyrene box with knuckles of curry goat and some paratha (unleavened bread). It tasted good, but it left me wondering what buss up shut could be. In Trinidad there are so many food stalls that you hardly need to sit down to a formal meal. And you can start right outside the airport when you arrive - Queenie will give you a roti, an envelope of filled bread. The many snacks on offer reflect Trinidad's extraordinary mix of population. Rotis are of (East) Indian origin (as are about 40 per cent of Trinidadians). So are doubles, more unleavened bread folded over double, with a yellow channa (split pea) filling, and aloo pie (aloo is Indianfor potato). Aripa is supposedly of Spanish origin, a cornflour pattie with mince stuffing, while pastels (Spanish, via Venezuela) are a mix of peppers, raisins and minced beef wrapped in a dasheen (like spinach) leaf. There is even Chinese in the mix. Earlier this century, Trinidad had quite a community of Chinese, though many have now left for the Pacific coast of Canada. Taken from the Chinese word for bread, pow is a ball of fluffy dough with a savoury or sweet filling. Vendors selling batter balls often stand in a line together. You can buy phulori (split peas in batter), sahina (spinach) and baigani (eggplant). Sweet mango chutney is on hand for a dip, but you are advised to be wary of hot pepper sauce. There is also a variety of sweet offerings: pamie (supposedly of French origin) is sweet coconut with raisins in cornmeal. Only the very brave try a tamarind ball, a sluggish lump of unverifiable specific weight, a torture of bitter and sweet. If you fancy fruit, a walk around the centre of Port of Spain will get you anything in season from the back of a pick-up. Coconuts are on sale throughout the islands. They are well worth trying, though it may come as a surprise that as soon as you show interest in having one, the vendor will promptly whip out his machete. Do not be alarmed. With a few deft strokes he will top the nut, leaving a small hole for you to drink through. Another great Jamaican institution is the Jerk Centre. Contrary to what you might think, these are not gathering points for the socially ungainly (you will even find the occasional Executive Jerk Centre), but open-air barbecues where you can buy jerked meat. Jerking is a special way of cooking meat, originally developed by the runaways in the Jamaican hills, who would shoot wild boar and cook it for a couple of days in an underground oven. Nowadays they use an open oven in the ground, with plum and mahoe wood for flavouring. The original pork has now become chicken, sausage and 'spear ribs'. Your order will be hacked into bite-size pieces and bundled into a piece of paper. Then comes the offer of hot pepper sauce. Take the tiniest dab at first, because pepper sauce has a searing taste and a nasty habit of affecting anything edible for about 100 yards around. It struck me that hot pepper sauce is what buss up shut had threatened to be. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I asked what buss up shut was. The large Trinidadian lady took a piece of paratha bread and held it up. 'You see it look like a shirt material?' (it looked like a piece of khaki denim). 'Well now, I bust up de shirt,' she said, tearing it up in strips, 'an' so, you 'ave buss up shut.'</p>

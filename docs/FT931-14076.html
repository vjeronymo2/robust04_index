			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Diller to head TV shopping network MR BARRY DILLER, who resigned last February as chairman of Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox film and television studio, was yesterday named chairman and chief executive yesterday of QVC Network, a leading US cable television home shopping network. The move follows Mr Diller's recent agreement to purchase Dollars 25m of QVC's equity in a privately negotiated transaction. The negotiations that led to Mr Diller's appointment are believed to be aimed at achieving joint control of QVC's board by Mr Diller and two corporate partners which are also substantial QVC shareholders - Liberty Media, a Wyoming-based company that has also agreed to buy voting control of QVC's main rival, and Comcast, a cable operator. QVC, which had Dollars 922m of revenues in its fiscal year to January 31 1992, previously said that Mr Diller had reached an agreement to form a group with Comcast and Liberty Media. Liberty at present has 25 per cent of QVC, while Comcast owns 14 per cent. QVC had Dollars 36.2m of net profits on Dollars 729m of revenues in the first nine months of its 1992 fiscal year, which ends next January 31. The company has 4,500 employees and reaches 42m homes in the US with round-the-clock shopping programmes. QVC's share price, quoted on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, rose by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 yesterday.</p>

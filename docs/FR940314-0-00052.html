			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Postal Service shares the commenters' concerns about package size. After consideration of the comments received, a decision was reached to require packaging of residual pieces only if 10 or more pieces destinate to an AADC area. The 10-piece minimum (which was formerly the minimum for state packages) balances concerns about extremely small packages against the Postal Service's need to reduce piece handlings of residual mail at origin. Residual pieces not meeting the 10-piece package minimum are to be placed in a working tray in AADC sequence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Processing Efficiency of Packages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three comments were received concerning the relative efficiency of processing residual AADC packages instead of full, unpackaged residual trays. The commenters suggested that the costs associated with unbanding residual packages prior to processing on automated equipment may outweigh any benefits the Postal Service receives through presorting. These mailers stated that mail in full trays is more suitable for induction into high-speed automated equipment than is mail in bundles. The commenters argued that the Postal Service might actually realize increased processing costs for the residual portion of mailings as a result of the proposed preparation changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Postal Service has determined that presortation of the residual portion of a mailing will improve overall operating efficiency for the Postal Service relative to nonpresorted residual trays. Mixed-AADC trays will contain AADC packages that must be distributed at origin. However, no piece processing will be performed on this mail at the origin facility. Piece processing of residual mail at origin will be limited to working trays containing pieces that do not meet the 10-piece minimum to an AADC area. Thus, presortation of residual mail will virtually eliminate piece processing of this mail at the origin facility. Although there is some cost to handle packages, the Postal Service has concluded that this cost is outweighed by the need to correct the processing problems currently presented by piece handling of residual mail, as described in the proposed rule. Moreover, a significant proportion of the packages will not be handled at origin; for example, all residual mail in AADC trays will be routed directly to destination. Also, the new requirements allow for the creation of full AADC trays of residual mail that is not packaged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Mailer Operating Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five commenters stated that the proposed changes would increase their operating costs. Two of these mailers remarked that the Postal Service is essentially transferring costs from mail processing plants to mailer plants. Two of the commenters expressed concerns about the costs of training their workers on the new requirements. One mailer commented that the proposed changes were incompatible with his operation and would require substantial and costly changes to his production processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The residual preparation requirements in this rule are comparable to those in effect prior to March 21, 1993, for automated rate second- and third-class letters prepared in sacks, and those still in effect for nonautomated presort second- and third-class letters. Prior to the March 21, 1993, change, mailers were required to prepare packages of residual second- and third-class automated rate letters and place them in state and mixed-states sacks. State sacks were then routed to a destination SDC for processing while mixed-states sacks were, in most cases, processed at the origin SCF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule will require similar presortation of the residual portion of second- and third-class automated rate letter mailings. Like state packages and sacks, residual AADC packages and trays involve presortation of the residual portion of a mailing in order to bypass outgoing processing operations at the origin facility. Only mail in working trays will be processed at the origin SCF, as was mixed-states mail under the previous preparation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring this presortation of the residual portion of a second- or third-class mailing is justified by the fact that some degree of worksharing is assumed in the basic rate paid for second- and third-class residual letters, a rate that is substantially reduced from the single-piece rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter expressed concern about being required to prepare a large number of less-than-full residual AADC trays, which would be a waste of time and space. This final rule, which permits AADC packages of 10 or more pieces to be placed in a mixed-AADC tray if a full AADC tray cannot be prepared, and allows groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC to be placed in working trays, avoids the potential problem raised by this commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Creation of Nonuniform Preparation Standards for Different Classes of Automated Mail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the proposed changes represented a retreat from the Postal Service's declared goal of simplified and standardized mail preparation requirements. This mailer remarked that adopting the proposed changes would necessitate the retraining of his workforce and lead to verification problems for the Postal Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the changes in this rule will make the required preparation of the residual portion of second- and third-class automated rate letters different from that for First-Class Mail, the Postal Service believes these changes are appropriate given the processing problems that led to the proposed rule and the discount mailers receive for basic rate mail in second- and third-class mailings. Furthermore, the final regulations are modified to allow First-Class mailers the option of preparing residual mail according to the residual sortation options required for second- and third-class mail. This modification will allow mailers the opportunity to presort first-, second-, and third-class mailings in a uniform manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Lower Minimum for 3-Digit Packages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

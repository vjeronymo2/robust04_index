			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CASE AGAINST SILBERMAN IS DETAILED BY U.S.;  </P> <P> BUSINESSMAN ARRAIGNED BY MAGISTRATE IN S.D.  </P> <P> Richard T. Silberman believed that $300,000 he allegedly laundered for an  undercover FBI agent came from Colombian cocaine traffickers and boasted to the  agent that he had been involved in money-laundering ventures numerous times  before, according to an affidavit unsealed by federal prosecutors Monday.  </P> <P> During a wiretapped telephone conversation, Silberman told the agent "this is  not my first go-around" and said he solicited money-laundering business through  Chris Petti, an alleged co-conspirator and organized crime figure, because he  "wanted a little diversification," the affidavit says.  </P> <P> Silberman also said he was anxious to move on to "bigger and better things"  after allegedly completing two laundering transactions negotiated with the  agent during meetings at several San Diego hotels, the document says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrested at Hotel  </P> <P> A wealthy San Diego businessman and powerful player in local and state  Democratic politics for 15 years, Silberman was arrested by FBI agents Friday  at the Hyatt Islandia hotel while allegedly arranging to launder $1.1 million  in funds portrayed to him as proceeds from cocaine sales. The arrest -- along  with several other transactions conducted during the six months Silberman was  under FBI scrutiny -- was secretly videotaped.  </P> <P> In a complaint issued by prosecutors Monday, Silberman, 59, is accused of  conspiring with Petti and two Los Angeles men still at large to launder  $300,000 in cash represented by undercover agents to be proceeds of cocaine  trafficking. He is also charged with violating a federal law requiring that all  cash financial transactions over $10,000 be reported to the U.S. Treasury  Department.  </P> <P> Silberman, who is married to San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, faces  20 years in federal prison if convicted of the charges. After spending one  night in the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center, he was released on a  $500,000 personal surety bond Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formally Charged  </P> <P> On Monday, Silberman and Petti, 62, were formally charged before U.S.  Magistrate Roger McKee and a swarm of reporters and onlookers. Dressed in a  dark-blue suit and looking somewhat haggard, Silberman was accompanied in court  by Golding and noted criminal defense attorney Milton J. Silverman, who was  making a special appearance and had not been retained.  </P> <P> Although prosecutors asked that McKee require Silberman to secure the bond with  property, the magistrate declined, saying he believed Silberman would honor his  promise to return to court. McKee, who confiscated Silberman's passport and  required him to sign a list of standard conditions required of those posting  bail, scheduled a preliminary hearing for April 21.  </P> <P> Outside the courthouse, Silberman declined to comment. But Golding, wrapping  her arm tightly around her husband, vowed that Silberman's name would be  cleared.  </P> <P> "He's innocent, that's all there is to it," said Golding, her voice tremulous.  As for the effect her husband's legal woes may have on her rising career in  Republican politics, Golding said, "I haven't thought much about that. I'm a  county supervisor and will continue to be one."  </P> <P> At one point during the couple's brief meeting with reporters, Golding  whispered, "I love you" to her husband. Silberman then leaned down and kissed  her on the cheek.  </P> <P> As the couple and Silverman walked from the courthouse, another emotional  episode unfolded when Charlie W. Dozzell -- a 70-year-old shoeshine man at the  Town and Country Hotel who said he has polished Silberman's shoes for 20 years  -- approached and wished his customer well. As the two men embraced, Silberman  broke into tears.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. said the government has "a very  strong case" against Silberman and is optimistic that its charges will hold up  in court. Perhaps most importantly, he said, Silberman was told frequently that  the source of the agent's money was cocaine trafficking and that such knowledge  did not dim his desire to do business.  </P> <P> "On several occasions, to make it clear that the money was coming from cocaine  sales, the agent would say it was furnished by Colombian (drug) traffickers,"  Gorder said. "Silberman would say something like, 'Well, I don't want to hear  that,' or 'I didn't hear that.' (But) clearly he did."  </P> <P> In addition to Silberman and Petti, agents are seeking Darryl Nakatsuka -- also  known as Darryl Naka -- and Jack Norman Myers. Sources said Myers, 43, of  Malibu, has been associated with Silberman since both men raised political  funds for former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. Myers is the former son-in-law of MCA  Chairman Lew Wasserman but has been divorced from Wasserman's daughter Lynn for  about 10 years, sources said.  </P> <P> Petti is being held without bail pending a hearing Thursday. He was serving  probation for a federal gaming conviction when arrested Friday night.  </P> <P> The 76-page affidavit -- filed in support of search warrants for Silberman's  offices at Yuba Natural Resources Inc. on B Street in San Diego and two Los  Angeles County offices -- provides the first glimpse of how solid a case the  government may have against Silberman.  </P> <P> Prepared by FBI Special Agent Charles B. Walker, it details the genesis of the  laundering deals and the system Silberman allegedly used to dispose of the  $300,000. The document suggests that evidence against Silberman ranges from the  wiretapping of more than a dozen telephones to videotapes of cash transfers and  the negotiating session preceding Silberman's arrest.  </P> <P> Among the telephones tapped was a line in Silberman's office provided by the  California Medical Assistance Commission -- to which Silberman was appointed in  May, 1986. At one point, the affidavit says, Silberman told an undercover agent  not to call his primary office phone because the secretaries maintain a record  of all incoming calls. Many of the negotiations covered by the affidavit were  made during calls to the Medical Assistance Commission number.  </P> <P> Prosecutors say FBI agents stumbled upon Silberman's alleged activities during  their 2 1/2-year investigation of Petti. Described in the affidavit as a  Southern California associate of La Cosa Nostra, an organized crime group in  Chicago, Petti -- also known as Chris George Poulos -- served nine months for a  bookmaking conviction and was placed on probation in 1984.  </P> <P> In April, 1987, FBI agents began trailing Petti and unidentified others in  connection with their alleged organized crime ties. The investigation involved  the use of wiretaps and other electronic monitoring, the affidavit says. Among  other things, the surveillance of Petti disclosed that he was allegedly engaged  in a series of extortions against people who owed money to the late Anthony  Spilotro of Las Vegas, a member of the Chicago organized crime family who was  murdered in 1986, the affidavit says.  </P> <P> Last year, Silberman proposed a laundering scheme to Petti, telling him he  could "get money out of the country, launder it, and realize a profit at the  same time," the affidavit says.  </P> <P> Petti then allegedly set up a meeting with Robert Benjamin, a convicted felon  from Los Angeles who became a cooperating witness for the FBI in 1986.  Benjamin, a longtime acquaintance of Petti, provided a cover story telling  Petti he was living free in a La Costa apartment owned by a New Jersey man who  laundered money for Colombian cocaine traffickers.  </P> <P> Petti arranged for Silberman to meet Benjamin's New Jersey contact on Nov. 9,  1988, at the coffee shop at the Stardust Hotel and Country Club, the affidavit  says. The New Jersey associate was in fact an undercover FBI agent.  </P> <P> Although Silberman said he was not interested in laundering less than $500,000,  the agent insisted on a "test" run of $100,000, and Silberman agreed, the  affidavit says.  </P> <P> As details of the deal were hammered out during more meetings and wiretapped  telephone conversations, Silberman was told that the undercover agent  represented Colombians whose money was "not legitimate." During one monitored  call to Silberman, the agent said of his associates, "all they know is coke and  they don't know nothing else." And in a meeting with Silberman in February, the  agent called his sources "a bunch of . . . Colombian cocaine drug lords."  </P> <P> Silberman's responses to such remarks -- as quoted in wiretap transcripts  included in the affidavit -- make it clear he knew the source of the money. In  one instance, after the agent referred to "the drug types" he worked for,  Silberman said, "Let's us not even . . . use any of the words anymore, OK?"  Later, he said, "You and I never have to use the word."  </P> <P> In November, the undercover agent and Silberman began mapping plans for the  first "test" deal, involving $100,000 in federal money, the affidavit says.  During a taped conversation on Nov. 12, Silberman assured the agent that he was  a veteran of such laundering operations.  </P> <P> "First of all, just for your background, this is not my first go-around, OK.  I've been here before," Silberman is quoted in the affidavit. "I just wanted a  little diversification and that's why I went to Chris."  </P> <P> Silberman added that he could handle "five very big ones" and that "all the  guys I deal with" think that it's a real good deal if they pay 20% to get the  money "from here to there," the affidavit says.  </P> <P> The exchange of the $100,000 was made Nov. 30 when Nakatsuka picked up the  money from the undercover agent at the Airport Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles, a  pick-up that was videotaped. Those funds were apparently to be used in a stock  swap involving Yuba American Gold, Ltd., a subsidiary of Yuba Natural Resources  formed in April, 1987. Prosecutors, however, say details of Silberman's plans  for the money are unclear.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eager for More  </P> <P> Touting his accomplishments in conversations that were wiretapped after the  first transaction, Silberman told the undercover agent he was eager to  negotiate more deals involving larger sums. During a monitored conversation on  Dec. 2, Silberman told the agent that he hoped the agent realized "you're  dealing with something . . . I've done . . . 15, 20 years a lot of different  ways," according to the affidavit.  </P> <P> Silberman also told the agent that he hoped, "by now, you're satisfied that  it's first class, it's not normal and there's a lot more potential if we got  active," the court documents show.  </P> <P> On Feb. 22, the second transaction -- involving $200,000 of federal money --  occurred. It was also videotaped. Those funds were used to purchase zero coupon  bonds with the help of Myers, who used a connection at a Westlake stock  brokerage house to obtain a favorable rate. The affidavit said Silberman stood  to receive a commission of between 6 and 12 points for his laundering services  and intended to pay a fee to Petti as well.  </P> <P> After the second transaction, the undercover agent complained that the bonds  turned over to him in a Hyatt Islandia hotel room were $50,000 short. That fact  prompted the undercover agent to hesitate in negotiating additional deals with  Silberman, the affidavit said.  </P> <P> Angry about the snafu, Silberman told the undercover agent that the employees  of the stock brokerage firm he used for the transfer were normally reliable but  apparently were "playing games." If the firm failed to rectify the situation,  Silberman promised to bring in some of Petti's "friends" and have them use  "muscle" to express his displeasure "in no uncertain terms."  </P> <P> In building their case against Silberman, the FBI made wide use of newly  authorized "roving wiretaps." Among the phones that were tapped were pay phones  at the Stardust Hotel and the Plaza International Hotel frequently used by  Petti.  </P> <P> Silberman, who served as secretary of the Business and Transportation Agency  under former Gov. Brown, has been a key player in statewide Democratic politics  for 15 years. He was Brown's chief fund-raiser in his 1976 presidential  campaign and had a similar role in Brown's failed bid in 1980. On the local  scene, he joined the movement that ended the reign of C. Arnholt Smith and  helped elect Mayor Pete Wilson and Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller in the 1970s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Active in Business  </P> <P> He has been equally active on the business side. In 1968, he made a fortune  when the Jack in the Box restaurant chain -- in which he was a general partner  -- was sold to Ralston Purina Co. He also teamed up with Robert O. Peterson to  take over First National Bank, later renamed California First Bank.  </P> <P> More recently, however, Silberman's financial success has been less impressive.  He became an officer in Yuba Natural Resources in the 1980s, and lately the  company -- which mines for gold in Yuba County north of Sacramento -- has not  been faring well. It lost a total of $6.5 million during the four fiscal years  from 1984 through 1987 and would have lost money in 1988 had it not been for  the $5-million sale of land and mineral rights. For the first nine months of  the current fiscal year, Yuba is running a $2.6-million deficit.  </P></p>

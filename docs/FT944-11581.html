			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Tory car-boot gift for Labour Conservative officials in Lancashire face possible prosecution under data protection legislation after confidential files about company donations found their way to a car-boot sale and ended up in the hands of the Labour party. The episode has embarrassed the party locally and put a question mark over efforts by Conservative Central Office to ensure local constituency associations take proper measures to safeguard computer data. The early Christmas present to Labour is believed to have come about after a personal computer was discarded from the Ormskirk offices of the West Lancashire Conservative Association in a spring-clean after the 1992 general election. The computer ended up in a car-boot sale where it was bought for Pounds 20 by an electronics enthusiast. He discovered that software in the computer contained details of cash gifts to the Tories from local companies, with canvassing returns related to the political opinions of the 70,000 people on the electoral register in the West Lancashire constituency. Mr Barry Gannaway-Jones, vice-president of the West Lancashire Conservative Association, said: 'I am very annoyed. I want to find out exactly who was responsible.' Mr Frank McKenna, the Labour agent for the constituency, said: 'This seems to be a cock-up of the highest level. I'm particularly interested in the data about company donations and hope I will get to see the information in the near future.' Lancashire police said yesterday they would be passing a file on the issue to the Office of the Data Protection Registrar, which is empowered under the 1984 Data Protection Act to take action against groups that fail to take proper care of confidential computer data.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / German unions warn on budget HOPES for negotiation of a 'solidarity pact' of wage restraint between the German government and trade unions could be dashed by plans to cut social spending next year, union leaders warned at the weekend. The ruling coalition plans to cut several billion D-Marks from next year's budget, including a freeze on social security payments, a cut of 25 per cent in allowances for asylum seekers and rise in unemployment contributions. Details of the spending package, due to be finalised on Wednesday, were spelt out by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister. He called for a three-year pay pause for public sector workers, with wages tied to inflation, and a postponement in student grant rises. He said a freeze on social security payments could save DM2bn (Pounds 810m) next year, while the cut in allowances for asylum-seekers would save a further DM1bn. Linking public sector pay rises to inflation could save as much as DM5bn in 1993 and DM10bn in 1994, for central government, the federal states and local government combined. As for subsidies to special industries - including agriculture, shipbuilding and coal mining - Mr Waigel would say only that payments would be investigated again before the 1993 budget was finalised. Despite the savings, the government has accepted that next year's slower economic growth will mean a DM6bn increase in the forecast central government budget deficit. Mrs Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy chairman of the DGB trade union federation, said cuts in social spending would postpone a pact 'into the distant future'. The opposition Social Democrats (SPD), which Chancellor Helmut Kohl also hopes to involve in a pact, also attacked the cuts. The case for wage subsidies in east Germany, Page 6</p>

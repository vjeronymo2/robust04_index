			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings On its own, the acquisition of Corbin &amp; Russwin, the US locksmith, will hardly transform Williams. Yet the Pounds 50m deal, completed on new year's eve, brings the group's acquisitions for last year to nearly Pounds 140m. Taken together with the recent sale of its engineering businesses, Williams thus seems less trapped by its balance sheet than some of its critics have claimed. Though sale of the electronics businesses and its Fairey bridge builders will have to wait, the group has made progress in adjusting its focus on to a limited range of businesses with a reasonable strategic fit. Corbin, for example, will double Williams' share of the US commercial lock market to 20 per cent, creating a stronger base from which to attack the market leader, Ingersoll-Rand. In the final quarter of 1993, Williams' shares outperformed Hanson by 10 per cent and BTR by 15 per cent. This relative re-rating does not necessarily mean Williams can now relax. The Corbin acquisition will both absorb cash and involve a goodwill hit of some Pounds 30m, so that gearing will rise to 60 per cent. Williams may rail against those on the Accounting Standards Board who still believe goodwill should be written off. But even with eight times interest cover, such gearing leaves little leeway for acquisitions to complete the transformation process. It will help if the company's full-year figures show its cash generation has improved as the use of acquisition provisions has come down.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 13 May -- The Georgian Parliament is  discussing the Georgian-Abkhaz draft agreement. Eduard  Shevardnadze is not attending the session despite the deputies'  call on him to do so. His absence was supposedly justified by  the fact that he was meeting a U.S. delegation, but this turned  out to be untrue.    The draft envisages separation of the sides, a cease-fire,  and the introduction of peacekeeping forces along the  confrontation line. The draft caused a protest from not only  the opposition but the governing majority as well, for the  following reasons:    A. The draft envisages introduction of peacekeeping forces  not throughout the whole Abkhaz territory but solely along the  Enguri River;    B. The draft envisages withdrawal of the Georgian Army  formations from the Kodori gorge, which is the only base for the  Georgian armed forces in Abkhazia;    C. Peacekeeping forces will not be responsible for the  defense of the refugees, which means that the refugees will not  be able to return to Abkhazia.    The leader of Abkhazia's Liberation Organization, Boris  Kakubava, demanded Shevardnadze's immediate resignation and  called his supporters traitors to the country.    Opposition members put to a vote the draft resolution, which  forbids the Georgian delegation to sign any document in Moscow  before the Georgian Parliament makes a decision. A  parliamentary majority then left the hall, resulting in there  being no quorum, but the issue was still put to vote.    The decision was adopted not in the form of a resolution,  but  a recommendation, which enables the Georgian delegation to sign  the agreement as a recommendation, which has no legal force.    The situation remains tense.</p>

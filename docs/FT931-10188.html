			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Japan acts to cool US trade tensions MR Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, will try to defuse mounting trade tension with the US when he meets Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary in Washington at the weekend. Mr Hayashi is expected to relay Tokyo's objection to US proposals to raise tariffs on minivans and multi-purpose vehicles from 2.5 to 25 per cent. Mr Yoshiro Mori, international trade and industry minister, yesterday urged the US to act sensibly in dealing with the proposed tariff increase, saying he would be willing to travel to the US ahead of Premier Kiichi Miyazawa, to discuss trade issues including the minivan tariffs. Mr Mori's trade minister's initiative comes as Tokyo also prepares for a three-day visit to the US by Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, starting tomorrow. Mr Watanabe is expected to focus on political issues, but discussions between Mr Hayashi and Mr Bentsen are set to touch on trade, including Japan's growing surplus with the US and efforts to conclude the Gatt Uruguay Round. Japan is increasingly concerned about Washington's trade stance. As well as the minivan issue, the Japanese are worried they are being pushed into bilateral talks on matters they believe are better dealt with through a multilateral forum such as Gatt, including the opening of Japan's rice market. Calls are increasing in the US to make this a bilateral issue. Japan also believes preliminary anti-dumping duties imposed on Japanese steel imports by the US Commerce Department undermine efforts to work towards fair trade in steel. Japan's Iron and Steel Federation yesterday said it had sent a position paper to US government and congressional leaders seeking their support in the anti-dumping action, and stressing the importance of the multilateral steel agreement. Friction is growing over landing rights, after the US Transport Department said it might retaliate against Japanese airlines, after Tokyo decided not to allow United Airlines to extend its New York-Tokyo flights to Sydney.</p>

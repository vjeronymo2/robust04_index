			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Clarke to look at tax increases OPTIONS for tax increases in the November Budget will be discussed tomorrow by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, at a private meeting in his official country home at Dorneywood, Buckinghamshire, Peter Marsh writes. Mr Clarke will talk about the Budget with other Treasury ministers and senior officials. The group is expected to consider proposals for increasing taxes from April, as part of the effort to bring down the rising budget deficit - expected to be Pounds 50bn this financial year. Any tax increases would come on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of tax rises which have already been announced. The meeting will review the latest unpublished Treasury forecasts that gross domestic product this year will grow slightly faster than the 1.25 per cent predicted by officials in March. However, in recent weeks signs have emerged that the solid growth of the first half of the year might not be sustained in the second half, owing to weak UK demand and a deterioration in export markets in continental Europe.</p>

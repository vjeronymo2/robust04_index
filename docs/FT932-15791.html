			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Hungary in EC trade conflict An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle has led the EC to stumble into the first tit-for-tat trade conflict with its east European associated members, Nicholas Denton writes from Budapest. The EC Commission this week imposed a one-month ban on imports of live animals, meat, milk and dairy products from eastern Europe. EC officials said the measure was aimed at preventing the spread of foot-and-mouth from the region. Hungary, the country most affected by the EC move with forecast losses of up to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.1m), retaliated with its own prohibition on imports and transit of EC products.</p>

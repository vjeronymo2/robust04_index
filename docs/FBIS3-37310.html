Today it is the turn of the  Azeri side. The state adviser for foreign political affairs of  Azerbaijan VAFA GULUZADE talks to the Interfax correspondent in  Baku.    IF: The Russian special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov stayed for  several days in Azerbaijan. He attempted to achieve progress in  the process aimed at the political settlement of the  Armenian-Azeri conflict within the framework of the Russian  mediation. What does Baku think about the visit?    GULUZADE: As is known, late in November Vladimir Kazimirov  was in Baku. He discussed with the Azeri side a Russian plan  and took into account all our remarks. Then the head of the  Russian mediatory mission was to leave for Yerevan to discuss  the plan with the Armenian side. Then his car was fired at from  Armenian positions. It was a serious incident which was not  settled immediately because the Armenian side refused to  apologize.    I believe the current visit by Kazimirov to Yerevan and Baku  is the continuation of the November mission.    Russia is the mediator in the conflict and acts accordingly.  However, the time that has passed since November was missed  since there were fierce battles at the fronts. There were many  casualties and there are even now.    I put the responsibility for all these developments on the  Armenian side. Azerbaijan is attempting to solve the problem  peacefully, through political talks.    IF: Namely?    GULUZADE: This means that Armenia must withdraw its troops  from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan. (Yerevan claims  that involved in the hostilities are the Nagorno Karabakh  self-defense forces, not Armenian troops--"IF"). This may cause  the beginning of the talks on the essence of the Armenian-Azeri  conflict.    However, the Armenian side want to stay on the occupied  territories to settle there and build fortifications. The world  public does not know about this in full measure. At the same  time, Yerevan deludes the world public opinion claiming that  Armenia stands for a peaceful settlement of the conflict and  fully shares the schedule of the settlement developed by the  CSCE Minsk Group under which Yerevan put its signature.    It took part in the recent meetings of the Minsk Group in  Vienna, and I say with full responsibility that the Armenian  side disagrees with the schedule.    The signing of the schedule was a diplomatic maneuvering.  Armenia has added a letter to the signature in which it puts  some conditions. For example, the Armenian side conditions the  compliance with the schedule with the guarantee of the  Nagorno-Karabakh safety in a way seen by Yerevan.    On the other hand, Armenians say that they understand the  notion "side" as the recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh status.  Could it be said that the Armenian delegation signed the Vienna  schedule? I believe now the peaceful settlement of the conflict  fully depends on the will of the Armenian side.    There is a resolution of the UN Security Council and there  are universally acknowledged norms which say that any talks may  be conducted only after the occupied territories are liberated.  In conditions of the occupation of one-fifth of the Azeri  territory, it is out of the question to speak about any peaceful  talks, I believe. It is possible to hold a Minsk conference and  speak about the status of Nagorno-Karabakh only after the  withdrawal of the Armenian troops.    IF: What does the Russian peace plan specify?    GULUZADE: The Russian plan mainly coincides with the CSCE  schedule. It has similar demands and a similar schedule for the  withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied territories. It  is premature to speak about it once it is not yet coordinated.  (As is known, later the Azeri side turned down Moscow's  proposal on cease-fire since February 1 for at least 2-3 weeks  and put a condition of the withdrawal of the Armenian troops  from Azerbaijan -- "IF").    IF: Does the Russian peace plan provide for the deployment  of  a Russian peacekeeping contingent in the zone of conflict?    GULUZADE: There is much speculation around the problem of  the  deployment of a Russian or a CSCE peacekeeping force. I believe  these forces can be deployed.. First, they must be deployed  along the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia because the  aggression against Azerbaijan comes from the Armenian territory.  Second, such forces could be deployed between the warring sides  after Armenia withdraws its occupation troops from the captured  Azeri territories.    The question about the peacekeeping force was also discussed  in Rome last year, at the meeting of the CSCE foreign ministers.  According to the decision taken there, the peacekeeping force  may be deployed on the territory of this or that state only on  the country's request, which is the manifestation of respect for  its Constitution and territorial integrity. Naturally, if we  wish, we shall apply to Russia.    IF: The official Baku demands the withdrawal of the Armenian  troops from Azerbaijan. Does it mean that they must be pulled  out from Nagorno-Karabakh, as well?    GULUZADE: Logically, from the point of view of justice, all  Armenian armed forces must be withdrawn fro the territory of  Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is also part of Azerbaijan.    According to foreign sources, 8,000 Armenian nationals fight  on the side of the so-called Karabakh forces against Azerbaijan.  I believe it is a matter of complete cease-fire and full  withdrawal of Armenian troops from Azerbaijan.    IF: What could be Baku's attitude to the deployment of the  Russian forces along the border between Azerbaijan and Iran as  CIS external borders?    GULUZADE: I believe it is a matter of the future. For us the  border between Azerbaijan and Armenia is the most acute problem.  This was mentioned by President Geydar Aliyev during the visit  by the commander of the Russian Border Guard troops, General  Andrey Nikolayev, to Baku.    As to our borders with Iran... well, Azerbaijan is a  sovereign state. It will guard its borders itself. At the same  time Azerbaijan is a CIS member-state. Baku may negotiate to  what degree CIS can help ensure common interests.    IF: Which is the likelihood of a Moscow meeting between  presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan which is a common talk over  the past time?    GULUZADE: I believe a relevant political basis should be  developed for such a meeting. If Russia acts as a mediator, it  should take into account all factors for the conflict to be  settled. If so, details could be discussed under Russia's  auspices. But, by that period, the essence of the problem should  be coordinated; that is, I repeat, the withdrawal of the  Armenian troops from Azeri territories.    Azerbaijan poses no obstacles for a peaceful settlement.  This is confirmed by many statements made by President Geydar  Aliyev. For the peaceful process to start it is necessary that  Armenia show a desire to such a settlement and make a statement  that it will withdraw all its troops from Azerbaijan. This  could be achieved given the goodwill of the Armenian side, and,  I would say, the due decisiveness of Russia. I want to  emphasize that Russia has levers of pressure on Armenia. The  Russian Army is deployed on its territory. It is common  knowledge that Yerevan uses the fact for acquiring armaments,  ammunition and even uses Russian servicemen in the above  conflict.    IF: What is known about the date of the meeting?    GULUZADE: I do not know anything about the date of the  meeting. I believe the talks should be an aim in itself. The  meeting could take place if the mediator will be able to prepare  the necessary basis for it. Azerbaijan has enough of goodwill  and constructive approach.</p>

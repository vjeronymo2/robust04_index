			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: BICC BICC produced just enough in yesterday's interim figures to sustain the stock market's considerable faith in its recovery potential. The swing back into profits in the US after three years in the red was the biggest factor behind a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. With a fair wind in the second half, the group may be able to cover its dividend this year for the first time since 1990. The nagging worry is that much of the improvement reflects cost-cutting and rationalisation rather than improved market conditions. Despite the pace of US recovery and more stable markets in Europe, cables prices are no higher than this time last year. In addition to general deflationary pressures, overcapacity remains a problem at the low-technology end of the business. Privatised telecommunications and power utilities may also prove to be more demanding customers than they were in the public sector. Against that background, restoring operating margins in cable back to the levels of the late 1980s will be a long - if not impossible - task. With Balfour Beatty experiencing margin pressure as well, BICC looks on track for a steady rather than spectacular earnings recovery. While a safe yield of 5.7 per cent limits the downside for the shares, a multiple of over 20 times this year's forecast earnings demands something more. For all BICC's good work positioning the business through recession, the suspicion remains that cables markets are exceptionally difficult. That may explain why the group has underperformed the stock market over five, 10 and 20 years.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Lucas limbers up Provisions on the scale of those announced yesterday by Lucas Industries do not normally trigger a euphoric stock-market reaction, especially when the company concerned last pushed through a chunky restructuring provision only two years ago. But, after his achievements at Rover investors have faith in Mr George Simpson, believing that his strategy, and the sheer scale of the provisions, imply a genuine break with Lucas's accident-prone past. If the provisions were bigger than expected, so was the increase in underlying profits and sales. Encouraging, for example, was the 13 per cent increase in automotive turnover, achieved despite the modest pace of recovery in the European car industry. Operating profits for this business segment nearly doubled. Even so, margins here are a meagre 5 per cent. Lucas aims to raise them to at least 9 per cent, which it earned at the top of the previous cycle, but this will be no easy task. Cost-cutting will help, but the path to robust margins - across the Lucas group as a whole - requires the patient development of new products and strategic alliances. In this respect Lucas looks a long way behind competitors such as Bosch, Valeo or GKN in the race to become one of the select band of favoured suppliers to the automobile industry. If any manager can induce Lucas to catch up, it is Mr Simpson. But the shares are taking a great deal for granted. They stand on a multiple of 18.5 times 1994-95 earnings, based on consensus forecasts, and yield little more than the market average. This looks demanding, especially as the prospects for a bid will be diminished by Lucas's determination to put its own house in order.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Ministers fight for rail bill after Lords setback THE CREDIBILITY of the government's rail privatisation plans was dealt a serious blow last night by a series of defeats in the Lords on the crucial issue of franchises to run British Rail routes. The defeats were immediately reversed in the Commons, but only after a rowdy debate in which Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, faced angry opposition demands for his resignation. Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, said the passage of the Railways Bill had degenerated into 'farce' because of the procedural 'trickery' deployed by the government. The Lords still has to ratify the government's proposals before they can become law. However, peers are expected to back away from further confrontation when they reconsider the matter today. Lord Peyton, the prime mover of the Lords amendments, said a further attempt to defeat the government would raise the prospect of 'a serious constitutional clash' with the Commons. The drama began in mid afternoon, when the Lords voted three times to loosen restrictions placed by the government on BR's ability to bid for routes against private-sector companies. The effect of the amendments would have been to resuscitate the spirit of an earlier Lords amendment, overturned by the Commons on Tuesday, which ministers had dismissed as an attempt to wreck the bill. The series of defeats left government business managers facing the choice of capitulating to the Lords, or bringing the bill back to the Commons for a further bruising debate. After a couple of hours' discussion, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the house, told MPs that the scheduled business in the Commons would be interrupted to make way for an immediate attempt to rewrite the bill. The announcement provoked angry protests from the Labour benches, including a protest by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy opposition leader, that she was given only 30 seconds' notice. Backbench Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs attempted to force the suspension of the debate, at times coming close to shouting down Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse, the deputy speaker. When the debate finally began, Mr MacGregor nearly missed his opportunity to speak by being out of the chamber when he was called. The exchanges underlined the air of confusion which now surrounds the bill, which has had a difficult passage through both houses. However, the government was assured of a Commons majority for its attempt to reverse the Lords defeats after the collapse on Tuesday of a threatened backbench rebellion. In a division, the main Lords amendment was rejected by 301 votes to 260, a government majority of 41. The votes in the Lords would have given BR an unfettered right to bid for franchises unless the franchising director, who will supervise the bidding, decided to exclude it. As a result of the Commons vote, BR will be able to bid for franchises only if no credible private-sector bidder emerges. Clarke warned over VAT on fuel, Page 6</p>

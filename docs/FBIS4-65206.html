			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed D. Dh.: "Celso Amorim's Visit in France: </F> Brazilian Foreign Minister Wants His Country To Become a Member  of the Security Council"]    [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, on an  official visit in Paris from 6 to 8 May, argued that "expansion"  of the UN Security Council [UNSC] should not be limited to  "northern developed countries" such as Germany and Japan.    Mr. Amorim felt that Brasilia's wish was well received in  Paris. France now recognizes that the Germans and the Japanese  must one day be given a permanent seat. Would it therefore not  be time to take in the world's 11th economic power on behalf of  the developing countries in the southern hemisphere?    [French Foreign Minister] Juppe turned a willing ear to Mr.  Amorim's arguments. It may be that Paris is only trying to  delay as much as possible the inevitable expansion process by  increasing the number of candidates, thus making the process  more complex.    Paris believes that while permanent member status confers a  number of rights as well as increased international prestige, it  also implies "duties." One such "duty" is obviously to take  part in peacekeeping operations whenever possible. To begin  with, the two "natural" candidates (Germany and Japan) must meet  certain criteria, including constitutional ones. Nevertheless,  France believes that including a major Third World country would  make for a more balanced council. What remains to be done then  is selecting the lucky one. Other northern and southern "major  developing countries" have applied for membership as well.</p>

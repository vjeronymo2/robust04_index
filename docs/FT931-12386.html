			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Proteus loss marginally higher at Pounds 1.2m Proteus, the USM-quoted company which uses computers to model molecules for drug design, yesterday announced continuing losses but steady progress on its research projects. Pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.2m in the six months to September 30 compared a deficit of Pounds 1.12m last time. There was no revenue from sales as projects remain at the research stage. Cash on deposit stood at Pounds 9.6m at the end of December, following last May's Pounds 12.2m rights issue. This lifted net interest received from Pounds 89,000 to Pounds 316,000. The company's shares fell 8p to 471p</p>

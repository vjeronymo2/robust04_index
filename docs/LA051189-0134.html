			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: QUARRY CAN COMPACT ITS FILL  </P> <P> The Rolling Hills Estates City Council will permit Chandler's Palos Verdes Sand  and Gravel to begin compacting fill at its 120-acre quarry near Palos Verdes  Drive East and the Lomita city limit. But in the face of overwhelming  opposition from residents across from the quarry, the council decided Tuesday  not to approve Chandler's plans for a golf driving range there.  </P> <P> While residents said they do not want to stop Chandler's from building the golf  range, they want it located away from the street so homes will not be affected  by noise and lights.  </P> <P> John Robertson, Chandler's general manager, said the company has no timetable  for compacting the inert materials that are dumped into the quarry landfill,  but wants permission because compacting "gives more options for future use" of  the quarry pit once it is filled. Compaction is required before buildings may  be placed on the fill.  </P> <P> On the golf-range use permit, the council indicated it would like Chandler's  and the residents to agree to a plan that would be resubmitted.  </P> <P> Residents also used the hearing to object to dust and noise from the "batch  plant" which is part of the ready-mix concrete operations. Robertson said the  company would reduce plant noise -- which the city said exceeds legal noise  levels -- by moving the plant if necessary.  </P></p>

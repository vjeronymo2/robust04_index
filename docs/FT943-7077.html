			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Observer: Who's on next? Spotting the succession at any family company is a tricky job, and particularly so when the company is as secretive as the Paul Raymond Organisation, which owns a large chunk of Soho's nightlife. However, Raymond is getting on - he turns 69 this year - and the tragic death of his daughter Debbie means that there is no obvious heir apparent. Hence Joe Daniel's appointment as group managing director might give a few clues about what happens to one of Britain's most profitable private companies when Raymond eventually heads for the great night club in the sky. Given that he was managing Barclays Mayfair business centre until a few weeks ago, Daniel should know his way around the business world of night-time London. Not that Raymond seems in need of any help from his bankers. According to his last report and accounts, he made pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.3m on turnover of Pounds 29.8m and employed 83 staff. He might not be the richest man in Britain, but there cannot be many who can boast of no gearing and Pounds 25.7m of cash in the balance sheet.</p>

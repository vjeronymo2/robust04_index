			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLACK MINERS IN SOUTH AFRICA  </P> <P> I write to point out that your article, "A Gold Mining Slump Digs Into South  Africa," which appeared in World Report (July 10), contained a number of  factual errors.  </P> <P> Firstly, to state that "little effort has been made to move blacks into the  skilled trades" is simply devoid of truth. In the very short time since the  removal of restrictive racial laws -- a development initiated and vigorously  pursued by South Africa's private sector mining industry -- more than 6,000  black employees have moved into skilled positions previously reserved by law  for whites.  </P> <P> Furthermore, in a period of less than two years following the abolition of  discriminatory legislation, an additional 600 blacks have been given the  necessary training and awarded the so-called "blasting certificate," a  qualification enabling them to move into the most senior positions in South  African mining.  </P> <P> While it is true that the majority of black mine workers are migrants and that  they are housed in single-sex hostels, it is incorrect to infer that a  "prison-like atmosphere" prevails. No restriction is imposed on any employee's  freedom of movement and the quality of accommodation provided is the envy of  many other mining communities elsewhere in the world.  </P> <P> That there are difficulties in the migrant labor system is common cause but the  industry has long been mindful of these problems and has done much to ease or  erase them.  </P> <P> Your report also states that the average wage paid to black mine workers is  $200. This is not true. The present average wage for unskilled and semi-skilled  employees is in excess of R700 per month. At current exchange rates this  amounts to more than $300 but you may be sure that R700 in South Africa has a  great deal more purchasing power than $300 in the United States.  </P> <P> In addition it is conservatively estimated that supplementary benefits enjoyed  by employees (i.e., free food, accommodations, medical treatment and  recreational facilities) are worth an additional R270 per month.  </P> <P> I must also take exception to your reporter's allegations of racial inequities  which he bases on the observation that whites are brought out of mines ahead of  blacks at the end of a shift.  </P> <P> For a number of reasons -- among them safety -- some measure of control is  required in moving large numbers of people in and out of deep level mines and  existing practice is founded not on racial criteria but on the basis of  seniority. The most senior employees come out of the shaft first irrespective  of race.  </P> <P> At the present time the majority of senior positions are, indeed, occupied by  whites but the rapidly changing skills profile of our black employees will soon  dictate that considerable numbers of them will be returning to the surface  ahead of many of their white colleagues.  </P> <P> The South African mining industry does not lay claim to perfection. We  acknowledge our shortcomings. But now that we have jettisoned the iniquitous  discriminatory laws that for so long impeded our optimal development we have  moved with great speed and are a truly equal opportunity employers.  </P> <P> P.G.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] During the session it held this morning under  Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of  Representatives heard the letter addressed to it from Acting  Prime Minister Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar.    The letter reads: Brother Esteemed Speaker of the House of  Representatives, Esteemed Members of the House of  Representatives. May God's peace and blessing be upon you. The  House of Representatives had earlier approved the declaration of  the state of emergency in accordance with Republican Decree No.  20 of 1994, which was necessitated by the internal sedition  which was the result of the rebellion of secessionist elements  in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership against the  constitutional legitimacy, and the ensuing military actions and  direct threat to the citizens' security and stability. Since  the political leadership was concerned to make the period of the  state of emergency very limited in harmony with the democratic  policy of our country, the period was set for 30 days. However,  the circumstances which necessitated the declaration of the  state of emergency have not been finally settled. This calls  for extending the state of emergency for another similar period.  Based on Article 97 of the Constitution on the need to obtain  the House of Representatives' approval for extending the state  of emergency, we hope that the House will extend it for another  30 days as of the end of the previous period, taking into  consideration that the National Defense Council, which is  entrusted with assessing the state of emergency, has approved  such extension. In light of this, we present this request to  your esteemed house. Please accept our greetings and  appreciation.    The Parliament has agreed to extend the state of emergency  for another 30 days in accordance with the public interest.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: French holiday group's profits advance NOUVELLES Frontieres, the French holiday company, bucked the recession in the travel market by increasing profits by 62 per cent to FFr112.8m (Dollars 20.1m) in the year to September 1991 from FFr69.7m in the previous year. Mr Jacques Maillot, president, said that Nouvelles Frontieres, like its competitors, was affected last year by the instability caused by the Gulf war and the civil war in Yugoslavia. The company was also hit by the effects of the economic slowdown. However it increased sales by 14 per cent to FFr4.46bn. Nouvelles Frontieres, which has interests in package tours, hotels and airlines, has emerged as the chief competitor to Club Mediterranee in the French travel market. Package tours produced consolidated profits of FFr79.6m in the last financial year. The division benefited from an exceptional profit of FFr15.9m from the sale of Nouvelles Frontieres' interest in the Opera-Cadet hotel company. Airline activities, which includes Corsair, the charter company, boosted profits to FFr40m. Distribution made a profit of FFr1.4m. The only loss-making area of activity was the hotel division, where Nouvelles Frontieres lost FFr4.7m.</p>

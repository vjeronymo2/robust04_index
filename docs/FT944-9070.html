			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Children to be allowed in pubs Children under 14 will soon be legally allowed in pubs, the government said yesterday. But they will have to be accompanied by an adult, must leave by 9pm and will not be able to drink alcohol. Ministers are also considering allowing pubs to open for longer on Sunday afternoons under new rules. Landlords who want to benefit from new rules will have to apply for a children's certificate and show licensing justices that their pub has a 'family atmosphere'. Mr Michael Forsyth, Home Office minister, said the laws would probably come into force early in the new year. The intention is to limit under-14s to one bar where food and soft drinks are available. Ministers first announced their plans to change the laws earlier this year. Brewers welcomed the move, saying surveys showed that many people were in favour of children being allowed into pubs. Mr Forsyth said the government hoped that children would benefit from seeing sensible drinking in a relaxed atmosphere. The government was also looking at changing the rules on Sunday opening, although no decision had been made. Mr Forsyth said: 'It isn't easy to defend pubs open in the afternoons each weekday but closed each Sunday.'</p>

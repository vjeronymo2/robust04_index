			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities surge after excellent inflation news - Market Report Much better than expected economic news, principally on inflation trends in the UK, coupled with widespread relief in international markets that the US Federal Reserve had at last moved to increase interest rates, triggered a burst of strength on the London stock market. The FT-SE 100 Index, which has struggled to penetrate the 3,170 level since the start of the month, moved into overdrive yesterday, piercing the 3,170 short term resistance level and closing a net 43.0 higher at 3,190.3. The market's second tier index, the FT-SE Mid 250, was less impressive but still managed to record a 26.6 gain at 3,741.7. And dealers said the UK market was set fair to launch a determined challenge on the Footsie 3,200 level as the institutions digested the raft of excellent news on the UK economy. Adding to a generally buoyant mood across the market was a sharp increase in turnover in London equities. Volume jumped to 771.9m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for only 50 per cent of the total, indicating that the big international instititutions had moved in to buy the leading stocks. The value of customer business in London in expected to easily surpass the Pounds 1.2bn figure recorded on Tuesday; 'There has been some seriously good business transacted in the market today,' said the head trader at one of the UK integrated trading houses . Senior marketmakers were impressed with London's resilience to pockets of profit-taking, triggered by some hefty bouts of selling pressure in international bond markets where gilts ended an extremely volatile session with gains of around 10 ticks, having been up almost 1 1/2 points early in the session. 'The equity market feels good; it's taken everything the market has thrown at it and is still only five points off the day's high; we should be okay tomorrow but I would expect to see further profit-taking,' was the view of one marketmaker. The market was braced for a strong start to the trading session after the move by the US Federal Reserve, late on Tuesday, to lift its Fed Funds rate and the discount rate each by 50 basis points, a move which European markets had mostly factored in. What impressed UK traders was Wall Street's overnight response to the move by the Fed and, more so, the response of US bonds which raced ahead on the news. The FT-SE 100 index kicked off over 20 points higher and thereafter moved progressively higher, with the market extremely happy with the raft of good news on the UK economy. The negative inflation figure for July, which showed a 0.5 per cent decline, its biggest ever monthly fall, was much better than even the most optimistic strategists had hoped for; 'the RPI figure beat best expecations by a long way,' said Mr Steve Wright at BZW. 'It's very good news for equities,' he said. Mr Roger Barker, equity market strategist at UBS, described the inflation result as a 'positive surprise,' but, in keeping with UBS's cautious stance on UK equities, said 'the market is running to the limits of its upside; fair value is around 3,000; on fundamentals we can't see it going much higher.' A slightly disappointing performance by Wall Street at the opening yesterday took some of the shine off London's performance but a general mood of quiet optimism was evidentaround the City's trading desks. The Dow-Jones Average was down almost eights points two hours after London closed. All eyes in Europe are now focused on the German Bundesbank which meets today to formulate German monetarey policy. Super optimists are hoping for a reduction in German rates, but the more cautious expect the Bundesbank Council to hold fire until next month.</p>

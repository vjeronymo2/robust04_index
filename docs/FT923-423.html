			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Finding the way to the right bar - Andrew Bolger charts the progress of Tim Martin's fast-growing career DISMAY AT the deal being offered to the capital's drinkers set Tim Martin on a path which should lead to flotation of his chain of London pubs within the next two months. Mr Martin, 37, who came to London in 1978 intending to become a barrister, remembers: 'I was shocked by the pubs, which all had loud music, keg beer and high prices.' Despite joking that he spent three years researching the licensed trade while studying law at Nottingham, Mr Martin was not a particularly sophisticated consumer: 'I only realised I had been drinking real ale at university when I tasted keg.' His bar exams did not progress well, so he used a quick profit from selling his flat to buy an eight-year lease on a pub in Muswell Hill, north London. It had real ale and no jukebox - features maintained in the 44 pubs currently operated by his company, JD Wetherspoon. The rapidly-expanding company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m on sales of Pounds 21m in the year to July 31. The flotation will raise about Pounds 20m, most of it new money, which should give the chain a market capitalisation of Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m. Mr Martin, who owns just under half of the existing company, always intended to build a chain of pubs, and during the eighties developed other elements of the formula he wanted - offering one low-priced beer, with careful attention to food and decor. The pubs trade under the names of JJ Moons, Moons Under Water and White Lions of Mortimer. Sometimes a name with local historical significance is chosen, but the group's pubs are now all being badged with the JD Wetherspoon logo. Mr Martin said: 'We cut across accepted wisdom in the pub trade, which during the eighties was dominated by the awful fashion for market segmentation. 'People who run high-quality pubs think you can charge high prices. By charging low prices, we attracted large number of students and pensioners - people with low discretionary income, but who as regulars can generate high volumes. They also contribute to a good mix of clientele.' Wetherspoon's other distinctive policy has been its willingness to open pubs in new locations, coverting shops and car showrooms. Mr Martin believes that much of the recent regulatory concern over the brewers' tied-house system has been misplaced, and the real problem is the lack of competition at the retail level. He said: 'Most areas only have a limited number of good locations with licences - which none of the big groups will sell.' To overcome this, Wetherspoon has been prepared to shoulder the considerable costs involved in obtaining licensing and planning permission to convert good locations into pubs. Having bought a car showroom in Crouch End, it was two years before the group was able to open it as a pub. Mr Martin said he followed the example of McDonalds, the fast food chain, which puts a lot of resources into researching and securing the right locations. Instead of buying sites and then trying to obtain permissions, the current depressed property market enables the group to take six-month options on attractive sites, during which time it can seek planning and licensing clearance. Mr Martin's said his pubs, which strive to have a welcoming and unmenacing atmosphere, had proved trouble-free - even when opened in supposedly rough areas. As the group's formula became more established, it was easier to persuade the authorities to grant licences. Wetherspoon is now also approached by developers, whose planning permission requires them to include a pub. The group has opened a pub in Leicester Square, runs the only one in the new Liverpool Street railway station and was chosen to operate the sole traditional pub in Heathrow's Terminal 4. The pubs are at present evenly divided between leasehold and freehold properties. Mr Martin said: 'Leases give a high return on capital, so the proportion of freeholds will diminish. We are not a property company.' The company has 44 pubs within the M25 and planning and licensing permission for a further 19. The need for funds to develop these sites was one reason for the flotation, which will leave the group's balance sheet with gearing of about 50 per cent. Leading shareholders include John Govett and 3i. Mr Martin, advised by Kleinwort Benson, aims to have 200 pubs within and around the M25 before looking further afield. But he has no doubt that the formula will travel: 'London is very diverse, so we are confident that it will work well in different parts of the country.'</p>

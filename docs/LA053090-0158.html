			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THOMPSON CASE PROSECUTORS ASK FOR DISMISSAL  </P> <P> Prosecutors asked today for dismissal of drug possession, explosives and sexual  assault charges against Hunter Thompson, saying their case against the "gonzo"  journalist was not strong enough.  </P> <P> The dismissal motions, to be heard Thursday in Pitkin County District Court,  said potential witnesses had not cooperated with district attorney's office  investigators.  </P> <P> A statement by the district attorney's office also said a preliminary hearing  May 22 resulted in discrepancies between sworn testimony and previous  statements to investigators.  </P> <P> Thompson said in an interview that the decision was "a huge victory for all of  us" and there would be a "celebratory orgy" tonight at his favorite hangout,  the Woody Creek Tavern in Aspen.  </P> <P> Thompson, 53, last week was ordered to stand trial June 25 on four felony and  three misdemeanor charges after the preliminary hearing before Judge Charles  Buss, who threw out a felony charge of using cocaine.  </P> <P> The charges stemmed from a visit to Thompson's home in Woody Creek last  February by Gale Palmer-Slater of Port Huron, Mich., an entrepreneur and  ex-pornographic film actress and producer. She claimed that Thompson grabbed  her breast and threw a drink at her and that she saw him sniff cocaine during  her hours-long visit to his home.  </P></p>

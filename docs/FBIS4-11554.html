			<p>BFN     [Text] Since it was his wish to be buried in Cuba,  outstanding revolutionary Alfonso Guillen Zelaya was buried at  the Colon Cemetery today. Commander of the Revolution Juan  Almeida Bosque, along with relatives, friends and  comrades-in-arms, headed the procession, and funeral.    Alfonso Guillen Zelaya's rich past was recalled today by his  comrade, Gabriel Gil Alfonso. Guillen Zelaya was the youngest  member of the Granma expedition. He was arrested after his  active participation in the Alegria de Pio affair. To the  prosecutor who tried him, Guillen said: One need not be Cuban to  fight for liberty, for all men of justice fight for liberty  wherever it may be offended.    Because of his firmness, in 1957 he was deported to Mexico  where, directed by the 26 July movement, which was in exile, he  carried out important missions. With the triumph of the  Revolution, Guillen returned to Cuba, where he held different  administrative positions. He was vice president of the Cuban  Institute of Friendship with Peoples for 10 years.    As an education ministry official, he attended the Latin  American and Caribbean Congress of Teachers in Mexico, where he  was surprised by death at the age of 57. Guillen received  numerous decorations and distinctions, among them the award for  being one of the founders of the Communist Party of Cuba.</p>

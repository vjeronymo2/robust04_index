			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Currencies subdued Foreign exchanges took a back seat yesterday, with market attention focused on the weakness in UK and German interest rate markets, writes Philip Gawith. The focus of activity was the short sterling futures, where a combination of factors caused prices, especially in the longer contracts, to fall sharply. The dollar had a quiet day with the market constrained from selling the US currency, following weak economic data, by fears of central bank intervention. It finished in London at DM1.6435 from DM1.6444 and against the yen at Y104.655 from Y104.400. It closed in New York at DM1.6458 and Y104.78. The D-Mark had a mixed day in Europe, while the sterling index closed at 80 after finishing on Friday at 79.8. The bearish performance of the futures markets, particularly short sterling, laid further to rest any recent optimism that sentiment in the market might have turned. The December contract ended at 93.59, down 19 basis points from the Friday close. Most of the longer contracts were off by more than 25 basis points. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, described the market as a 'bloodbath', with lots of distress selling. The volumes were not especially large - the December contract traded nearly 34,000 lots - but prices moved a lot. Weakness in Eurosterling was a spillover from bearish sentiment in the gilts market. Traders cited a number of factors as contributing to this: weekend newspaper reports that the Treasury had upward revised its growth forecast for 1994 to 3 per cent; rumours about a rise in the pricing component of the May purchasing managers' survey; and the M0 measure of money supply growing by 7.1 per cent in the year to May, compared to a government range of nil to 4 per cent. Traders said investors were also clearing up end of month positions and this contributed to price movements. Movement in the futures market was not reflected in the cash markets, with three-month interbank sterling quoted at 5 3/16 -5 1/8 , after Friday's 5 3/16 -5 1/16 . Mr Phillips said the failure of traders to arbitrage the markets suggested either that they were nursing heavy losses, or that their attention was elsewhere. In this regard, he said the hedge funds, previously very active in these markets, had recently been 'noticeable by their absence'. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said the weakness in interest rate markets seemed to be related to the recent trend of hedge fund investment in commodity markets. This triggered a rise in commodity prices, which then fed over into the sale of bond futures as markets expressed concern that higher commodity prices meant higher inflation in future. Sterling had an uneventful day, closing at DM2.4846 against the D-Mark from DM2.4806. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.5118 from Dollars 1.5086. Mr Norfield said the interest rates discounted in the futures markets increasingly favoured sterling and this was supporting the UK currency. The December contracts, for example, project UK three-month money to be 128 basis points above German money by the end of the year. By December 1995 that gap has jumped to 251 basis points. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 771m of assistance after forecasting a Pounds 750m shortage. Overnight money traded in the 3 to 5 per cent range. In German money markets, call money rose to 5.75/5.95 per cent, near to the 6 per cent Lombard rate ceiling, as a temporary outflow resulting from pension payments caused a cash squeeze. Call money was at 5/5.25 per cent on Monday. The Bundesbank has again announced a variable rate repo, and the market is expecting a fall of about five basis points at today's allocation, from 5.20 per cent. The dollar had a quiet day, unmoved by a weaker than expected set of economic data. Among the figures released, April personal consumption expenditure declined by 0.1 per cent, consumer confidence fell to 87.6 in May and new single-family home sales dipped in April by 6.8 per cent. Commenting on the data, Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank, said: 'What we are seeing is the pace of economic growth slowing in response to tax increases and a rise in long-term interest rates since last October.' Most analysts believe the market would like to take the dollar lower, but is wary of the central banks. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said that for intervention to have a significant and sustainable effect, 'the market will need to be short of dollars, which currently does not appear to be the case'. The two weak currencies of Europe, the Greek drachma and the Portuguese escudo, had quieter days. Against the D-Mark, the escudo closed at Es103.7 from Es104 and the drachma was fixed at Dr148.100 from Dr147.970 at the previous fix. The German currency closed at FFr3.419 from FFr3.417 against the French franc, and against the lira at L968.2 from L967.4.</p>

When the governor started the visit here a week ago, he  claimed that his purpose was to promote the economic and trade  ties between Hong Kong and Australia.    It sounded good, but Patten soon forgot it. In most of his  speeches here, he talked in a big way about his proposals on  Hong Kong's political system.    it's not a surprise. When he unilaterally introduced part of  his proposals to the Legislative Council last December, he  undermined the ongoing Sino-British negotiations on the issue.  Yet, he, regardless of the fact, blamed China for being  responsible for it .    He said that he came to Australia to seek "understanding and  support" and that his proposals were to ensure Hong Kong's  democracy and future.    However, people here in the Australian society have their  own  judgement about Patten's so-called proposals. While some may  regard it as "admirable," many others took it the other way.    Australian former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in a column  article before Patten's visit said what Hong Kong needs during  the transitional period is stability, but Patten's proposals  will only bring about chaos there.    Anyone who's familiar with the British colonial history  knows  that the british Government had never shown any interest in  democracy in Hong Kong over the past 150 years. So why does  Patten raise the issue when the territory is to return to China?  the article said.    It said that it's clear that Patten simply wants to maintain  the prestige of the colonial empire of Great Britain even after  1997. To achieve that, he used the word "democracy" as his  pretence.    David Lague, "THE AUSTRALIAN" newspaper's Hong Kong  correspondent, said while Patten upholds his proposals of  "democratization," he "has made little effort to end the  arrogant and undemocratic style of his administration".    "More fundamentally, he has failed to take the Hong Kong  people into his confidence," Lague said.    During talks with Patten this week, Australian Prime  Minister  Paul Keating, who once said his government was not impressed by  Patten's proposals, stressed again that the "continuing  prosperity and stability" in Hong Kong is important to his  country.</p>

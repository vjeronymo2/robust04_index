			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ESPERANZA MANAGES TO HOLD OFF EL DORADO  </P> <P> Esperanza High School could never quite accomplish what it seemed bent on doing  in an Empire League game against El Dorado Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The Aztecs tried, but failed to blow a 14-point lead, hanging on for a 67-58  victory at Esperanza.  </P> <P> After leading, 32-18, late in the second quarter, Esperanza let El Dorado come  within, 34-28, early in the third quarter. Then after the Aztecs built the lead  to 45-32 with 1:25 left in the third quarter, they watched the Golden Hawks  trim it to 59-58 with 1:18 left to play.  </P> <P> But Esperanza made six of eight free throws in the final minute to pull out the  victory.  </P> <P> "That's the character of this team," Esperanza Coach Mark Hill said. "Last  year, they would have fallen apart. We've been able to bounce back this year."  </P> <P> For Esperanza (13-9 overall, 5-1 in league), Seth Romans scored a game-high 20  points, Walter Forcatto had 19 and Joe Foss added 16.  </P> <P> Esperanza's collapsing, two-three zone held El Dorado's Jerome Facione to 13  points, six below his average.  </P> <P> Mike Bradach had 19 points, 13 in the second half, to lead El Dorado (11-9,  2-4).

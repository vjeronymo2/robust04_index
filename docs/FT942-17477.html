			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Devaluation fears batter Turkish lira: Currency chaos presages austerity package Turkey's currency markets were in chaos again yesterday, with the lira falling by more than 10 per cent in the interbank market on the eve of an announcement of the government's long-awaited austerity package. The dollar was trading at TL30,500 in the interbank market, compared with a closing rate on Friday of TL27,000, as banks rushed to close their foreign exchange positions amid rumours the package could include another devaluation, following the 12 per cent realignment on January 26. The Central Bank's opening price yesterday was TL22,500 to the dollar. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, is expected to unveil a package of reforms today to restore market confidence in her economic management and curb the fiscal deficit which is running at 17 per cent of GNP. Last month's local elections, which saw Mrs Ciller's True Path party squeeze a narrow victory, strengthened the prime minister's hand, but it remains to be seen whether she has the courage to administer the far-reaching changes most economists say are now needed. The reforms are understood to include measures aimed at reducing foreign exchange holdings in an attempt to undercut the speculators. The rush for foreign exchange yesterday underlines banks' concern that the government will make it more costly to hold foreign exchange by raising the statutory amounts banks must lodge with the Central Bank as reserve requirements. In addition, many banks were trying to close foreign exchange open positions. Interbank rates have risen as high as 1,000 per cent in the last 10 days, but have since fallen back. Rates yesterday were about 250 per cent. In a further indication of the government's desperate search for cash, the Treasury this week took the unprecedented step of issuing bills with an interest rate of 125 per cent through branches of the Turkish state telecom company. Turkish newspapers reported the package, which will apply for six months, would include job cuts in overstaffed public sector industries, price rises for state sector industry products, faster privatisation, an investment freeze, and increases in value added tax. However, some economists suggest this will be insufficient to curb growth and squeeze inflation, which reached an annualised 73.6 per cent in March, according to figures announced by the state statistics department yesterday. Tax and privatisation revenues have been lower than expected and the earlier devaluation has added to foreign debt servicing costs. Central Bank reserves are about Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.19bn). Confidence has been further damaged by the decision of US rating agencies to downgrade twice since the start of the year, and by the Treasury's decision to pull its recent Dollars 750m global bond.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / US-Cuba talks 'business-like' The US said yesterday its first round of talks with Cuba on migration was 'serious, professional and businesslike,' writes James Harding in Washington. The Cuban delegation leader, Mr Ricardo Alarcon had said before arriving in New York for the talks that the only way to stop the exodus of Cuban refugees was to end the US trade embargo of the island. But the US said the opening round 'focused exclusively on migration', including US plans to accept more legal emigrants from Cuba, the stepping-up of US legal action against illegal immigrants, and returning Cuban criminals from US jails. The talks were expected to continue today.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) In addition to the above selection criterion, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall provide a half-mask air purifying respirator,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than a disposable respirator, equipped with high efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filters whenever the employee performs the following activities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class II and III asbestos jobs where the employer does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a negative exposure assessment; and Class III jobs where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM is being disturbed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) In addition to the above selection criteria, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall provide a full facepiece supplied air respirator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated in the pressure demand mode equipped with an auxiliar76y  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees within the regulated area where Class I work is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed for which a negative exposure assessment has not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Respirator program. (i) Where respiratory protection is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used, the employer shall institute a respirator program in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134(b), (d), (e), and (f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The employer shall permit each employee who uses a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filter respirator to change the filter elements whenever an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in breathing resistance is detected and shall maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an adequate supply of filter elements for this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Employees who wear respirators shall be permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leave work areas to wash their faces and respirator facepieces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whenever necessary to prevent skin irritation associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respirator use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) No employee shall be assigned to tasks requiring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of respirators if, based on his or her most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination, an examining physician determines that the employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be unable to function normally wearing a respirator, or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safety or health of the employee or of other employees will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be impaired by the use of a respirator. Such employee shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to another job or given the opportunity to transfer to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different position the duties of which he or she is able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform with the same employer, in the same geographical area,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and with the same seniority, status, and rate of pay and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> job benefits he or she had just prior to such transfer, if such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different position is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Respirator fit testing. (i) The employer shall ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the respirator issued to the employee exhibits the least possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facepiece leakage and that the respirator is fitted properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Employers shall perform either quantitative or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualitative face fit tests at the time of initial fitting and at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least every 6 months thereafter for each employee wearing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative-pressure respirator. The qualitative fit tests may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used only for testing the fit of half-mask respirators where they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are permitted to be worn, or of full-facepiece air purifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respirators where they are worn at levels at which half-facepiece  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air purifying respirators are permitted. Qualitative and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitative fit tests shall be conducted in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix C of this section. The tests shall be used to select  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facepieces that provide the required protection as prescribed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1, in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Protective clothing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The employer shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide and require the use of protective clothing, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coveralls or similar whole-body clothing, head coverings, gloves,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and foot coverings for any employee exposed to airborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of asbestos that exceed the TWA and/or excursion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, or for which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required negative exposure assessment is not produced, and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any employee performing Class I operations which involve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal of over 25 linear or 10 square feet of TSI or surfacing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACM or PACM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Laundering.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) The employer shall ensure that laundering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of contaminated clothing is done so as to prevent the release of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airborne asbestos in excess of the TWA or excursion limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Any employer who gives contaminated clothing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another person for laundering shall inform such person of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section to effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the release of airborne asbestos in excess of the TWA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contaminated clothing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Contaminated clothing shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transported in sealed impermeable bags, or other closed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impermeable containers, and be labeled in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (k) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

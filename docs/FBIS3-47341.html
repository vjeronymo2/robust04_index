Ryuzaburo Kaku, vice chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), told a press conference  that stepped-up efforts to develop innovative technologies is  the only way for Japan to recover its competitive edge.    "But this takes a few years to do, so the situation will not  change this year," he said.    Kaku, who is also chairman of leading camera maker Canon  Inc., said U.S. companies have poured much effort into  improving their production technologies in recent years, while  dramatically reforming their approaches to management.    These steps, he said, have substantially reduced  manufacturing costs and thereby the prices of their products,  leaving Japanese-made products less competitive.</p>

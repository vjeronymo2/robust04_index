			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes that the pilot program applicable to odd-lot execution procedures be approved on a permanent basis. The Exchange believes that current odd-lot execution procedures under the pilot program have resulted in superior customer executions, in terms of price and time of execution, compared to previous odd-lot procedures under Rule 205. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Odd-lot market orders as well as executable odd-lot limit orders, entered in the Exchange's PER system or directly with the specialist after a regular opening or a reopening following a trading halt, receive an immediate automatic execution at the displayed Amex bid or offer; odd-lot market orders entered before the opening or reopening are accumulated and automatically executed at the price of the opening or reopening transaction without a differential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that, prior to approval of the current procedures on a pilot basis, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 4, odd-lot market orders were executed at the price of a subsequent round-lot transaction, plus or minus an odd-lot dealer differential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because, except for odd-lot market orders entered prior to the opening, execution of such orders is not based on a subsequent round-lot transaction, as previous market order procedures under Rule 205 required, the Amex believes odd-lot market orders (as well as odd-lot limit orders executable at the time entered) are executed without delay at prices reflecting market conditions at the time the order is entered, with the customer receiving a report more quickly. This is particularly important with respect to odd-lot orders in less frequently traded issues, which, under former Rule 205 procedures, could have been subject to significant execution delays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The added system efficiencies and greater timeliness of executions provided by the pilot procedures, together with the opportunity for improved price executions, have resulted in significant customer benefits compared to prior procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to permit the pilot program to continue without interruption, the Exchange also requests that the existing program be extended for an additional six month period in order to provide the Commission with further opportunity, if necessary, to assess the operation of the program beyond February 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with sections 6(b) and 11A(a)(1) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it facilitates the economically efficient execution of odd-lot transactions, and is intended to result in improved execution of customer orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-93-45 and should be submitted by March 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Partial Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In regard to the six month extension of the Amex's odd-lot execution pilot program, the Commission, for the same rationale discussed in its previous orders regarding these procedures, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular with the requirements of sections 6(b) <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  and 11A(a)(1) <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission believes that the revised procedures, which provide for pricing of odd-lot market orders at the prevailing Amex quote rather than at the execution price of a subsequent transaction, should provide investors with more timely execution of these orders. Moreover, these orders should receive less costly executions than under the former procedures because no differential will be charged. In addition, the Exchange has implemented enhancements to its PER system for the automatic execution of odd-lot market orders, as set forth in the Commission's order approving the use of the pilot program procedures. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78k&hyph;1(a) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26445,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 4, for a description of the Exchange's odd-lot procedures and the Commission's rationale for approving those procedures on a pilot basis.

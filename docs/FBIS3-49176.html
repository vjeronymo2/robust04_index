We are contacting you regarding a vital issue! For the first  time in its history, the Association of Csallokoz [Velky Zitny  Ostrov] Towns and Villages is calling a national, grand meeting  of all elected representatives, mayors, and parliamentary  representatives of southern Slovakia. Just why did we decide to  call a national grand meeting?    We did so to express our unanimous view: The government of  this country is ruining us. It inhibits our development  potential because it deprives us of the possibility to exercise  rights to which individuals and communities in every  constitutional state are entitled, and because it withholds some  of the funds our municipalities are entitled to receive. It  limits the exercise of our autonomous rights, and the evolution  of autonomous local governments. The government is planning to  implement a state administrative and regional reorganization  over our heads, one that is akin to the one we have already  experienced in the era of centralized state administration and  autocracy. This would violate the principle of self-governance,  and from our standpoint, would mean another deprivation of  rights.    The political leadership of the country is spreading  propaganda of a kind that creates social unrest, and incites  coexisting Slovaks and Hungarians against each other. It makes  Hungarians appear as enemies of Slovakia. It endeavors to turn  against each other the Hungarian people of southern Slovakia and  their parliamentary representatives elected through democratic  processes.    Danger signals, which characterize our social, political,  and  economic situation, prompt us to call a national, grand meeting  of the elected Hungarian representatives of this large region,  who share our interests.    We are aware of the fact that, according to every  indication,  the highest degree of mutual tolerance exists in this large  region spanning from Pozsony [Bratislava] to the Ukrainian  border, where a mass of about 600,000 Hungarians lives. This is  in contrast to the prevailing atmosphere in other parts of the  country. There are mutual, good relations between the Hungarian  and Slovak people who live here; they are bonded by historical  roots and have established productive social relations and the  basic conditions for an economy capable of evolving. We must  reap the benefits of this valuable situation by acting on the  basis of our common will, and this is why we jointly state:  Based on Recommendation No. 1201 of the Council of Europe, the  establishment of a province with special legal status, with its  own local government and administration, is needed in areas  where significant numbers of Hungarians reside. An area having  such status would preserve and enrich European values that, in  the course of the past several decades, have gradually withered  in this region.    With that, we also want to state our firm demand to settle  the legal status of the Hungarian national community in  Slovakia, in a manner consistent with the proposed draft  constitution prepared by the parliamentary representatives of  the Hungarian coalition. At the same time, let us also declare  that as a result of this settlement, the rights of Slovak people  residing in the same area, but in a minority compared to us,  must not be infringed upon in any respect.    Let us elect from among the participants of the grand  meeting  a 100-member committee charged with the implementation of  resolutions adopted by the meeting.    We recognize the special mission of this historic meeting in  the fact that by virtue of its positions it would unite the  politically divided Hungarian people of Slovakia. Our jointly  agreed-upon concepts concerning our fate would not become prey  to partisan struggles.    For this reason we are calling upon all mayors, local  government representatives, and parliamentary representatives in  southern Slovakia, irrespective of their political and  ideological commitments, to take part in the national grand  meeting to be held on 8 January 1994 in Komarom [Komarno]!    Council of the Association ofllokoz Towns and Villages    Komarom, 6 December 1994  <H5>  Supporting Statement </H5>   A resolution was passed at the 7 December 1993 conference  designed to streamline the leadership policies of the  Coexistence Movement and the MKDM [Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement] to the effect that the two organizations  would join forces in supporting the announcement of the  Association of Csallokoz Towns and Villages, calling upon every  Hungarian elected representative and mayor, as well as  parliamentary representative in southern Slovakia, irrespective  of party affiliation or ideological orientation, to take part in  the Komarom national grand meeting to be held on 8 January 1994.    The two organizations agree with the contents of the call  publicized by the Association of Csallokoz Towns and Villages,  and have agreed that they would participate in the political  preparatory work to organize the meeting in order to ensure the  success of this national action.    On behalf of the Coexistence Movement: Miklos Duray, Istvan  Harna, Miklos Feher.    On behalf of the MKDM: Bela Bugar, Pal Farkas, Pal Csaky.</p>

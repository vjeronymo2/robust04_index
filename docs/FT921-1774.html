			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Labour considers uniting public-sector pay bodies LABOUR leaders are giving serious consideration to transforming the way in which public-sector pay is determined and, if elected, may establish a permanent public-service pay advisory commission to decide pay awards. They have also indicated that they would not abandon the current attempt to introduce performance-related pay for 500,000 civil servants and believe that the Civil Service unions, which are sceptical about the current plans, would co-operate with a 'sensible' system of performance pay. There is less enthusiasm from senior Labour officials for devolving pay in the public sector to a more local level, something which is just starting in the National Health Service and local government. The public-service pay advisory commission, which would be fully independent of the government, would supercede the existing pay review bodies which fix pay for nearly half of the 4m to 5m public-sector employees. Labour is committed to keeping the existing pay review bodies which now cover, among others, doctors, nurses, teachers and the armed forces. It is also committed to establishing a new pay-review body for university lecturers. The commission would bring all the existing pay review bodies under one roof and develop expertise in comparability with the private sector - one of the key issues in public-sector pay. The idea was floated in a 1990 Fabian Society pamphlet by Professor William Brown and Mr Bob Rowthorn, who suggested that the body's independence could be ensured by a governing council such as that of the conciliation service ACAS, with some individuals being nominated by the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress. A Labour government would not necessarily face immediate pressure on public-sector pay and there are few unions calling for a return to free collective bargaining. For those workers covered by pay-review bodies, public-sector pay has recently been going through of a period of catching up with the private sector. Potential militancy from unions representing lower-paid public-sector workers should also be dampened by legislation on the national minimum wage. Labour officials believe, however, that the current mix of cash-limited collective bargaining, pay formulas based on the average earnings index and pay-review bodies is unsatisfactory and is in danger of creating a 'two-tier' system - with those groups covered by collective bargaining getting left behind. Even the pay-review bodies themselves, say the officials, 'produce incredible disparities'. They are also said to be in an institutional no-man's land, being neither part of government nor fully independent of it. One official said: 'We may find in practice that the current mish-mash is impossible to improve upon but it certainly has severe short-comings that we want to examine.' No decisions have yet been taken, but the Labour manifesto commits a Kinnock government to seek 'fairer and more rational ways of determining public-sector pay within clearly defined budget limits'. Deciding who should run a public services pay advisory commission would be a crucial issue and Labour would not want a repeat of the generous awards made by the Clegg Commission in 1980.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Eastern Air poised to emerge from bankruptcy Eastern Air Lines, once one of the biggest US airlines but long defunct, may start flying again following a US court's approval of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy. The New York court approved a scheme announced in September under which Eastern will emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by paying off its creditors, so clearing the way for a new Eastern Air Lines. Under the plan, unsecured creditors with claims of Dollars 100,000 or less - mostly ticket holders, employees and vendors - will get 11 cents for each dollar's worth of debt on Dollars 200m worth of allowed claims. About 150 unsecured creditors with claims of more than Dollars 100,000 will receive several distributions over a period of 12-18 months. These will probably total 9 cents to 14 cents in the dollar, but could possibly reach 17 cents. Allowable claims total Dollars 1.1bn. The plan also provides for full payment of secured creditors and reconfirms all prior payments made to various creditors since the shutdown. Eastern went into bankruptcy in March 1989 amid a bitter power struggle between its unions and its then chairman, Mr Frank Lorenzo. It was grounded in 1991.</p>

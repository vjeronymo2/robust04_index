			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE SENATOR CHANGES HIS TACTICS AND ATTACKS HIS CHIEF ACCUSER IN THE  LINCOLN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN SCANDAL.  </P> <P> Protesting his innocence and proclaiming his good intentions have not succeeded  in clearing his name. And neither has lying low, waiting for the storm clouds  of scandal to blow over. So reelection-minded U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston changed  his tactics Wednesday and hurled a fuming broadside against his prime tormentor  -- former federal bank board chief Edwin J. Gray.  </P> <P> "A publicity-hungry political hack . . . Gray lies . . . lies over and over in  the Hitlerian technique of the Big Lie," Cranston said.  </P> <P> This was the opening, and certainly the most lively, move in yet another  attempt by the beleaguered Cranston to save his political future from the angry  backlash over Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's collapse.  </P> <P> Cranston said that as his new political offensive develops in the days ahead,  he will offer something to try to help those 23,000 or so Californians who lost  their savings when they bought uninsured bonds at Lincoln branches. Details  will come soon, he said.  </P> <P> His goal is to redefine just what the fuss is all about with Lincoln, its  chairman, Charles Keating, and California's senior senator in America's most  expensive -- $2 billion -- S&amp;L failure.  </P> <P> Don't blame me, Cranston said at his Wednesday press conferences in Los  Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. Blame Ed Gray, the senator said.  </P> <P> "Gray was the man in charge when savings and loan institutions throughout the  nation were heading into disaster, and he shares responsibility for a scandal  that will probably cost taxpayers upward of $250 billion," Cranston said.  </P> <P> So far in the long-running debate over his role in Lincoln's crash, Cranston  and four other U.S. senators have shouldered plenty of the blame. The five  accepted Keating's generous political contributions and then went to federal  regulators on Keating's behalf in the midst of a federal investigation of  Lincoln. Cranston accepted more than any of them -- $850,000 in contributions  for three voter registration groups and $47,000 in direct contributions.  </P> <P> The rub comes in what Cranston and the other senators did when they intervened  for Keating at a pair of meetings in April, 1987.  </P> <P> Cranston has repeatedly said he did nothing more than prod the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board under Gray to speed up a long-running audit of Lincoln. This is  the kind of help he gives constituents and California businesses regardless of  whether they are contributors, Cranston insisted.  </P> <P> Gray, however, charged that Cranston and the other senators joined in  pressuring him to withdraw a regulation restricting how much an S&amp;L could  invest in things like junk bonds and real estate developments rather than home  mortgages. The regulation was opposed by Keating. And instead of a routine  inquiry by senators on behalf of constituents, Gray has called the episode  tense and awkward and altogether extraordinary.  </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee is now reviewing the case.  </P> <P> Politics-minded Californians are keenly aware, though, that Cranston's helping  hand for Keating has grown into a larger and stickier image problem for the  venerable senator, long the champion of the "little guy." Now, he stands  accused of having helped a "big guy," a big contributor, in a sequence of  events that ended up costing many ordinary Californians their savings and their  jobs.  </P> <P> Cranston bored in Wednesday on the narrower issues of how he disagreed with  Gray's version of their encounters and select events, casting the matter as a  debate between two politicians -- a test of credibility between Cranston and  Gray, a Democrat vs. a Republican, a senator against a former press aide to  Ronald Reagan. In short, an old-fashioned political spat.  </P> <P> "This investigation is basically premised on the falsehoods of one Ed Gray.  When it becomes clear that he is not a man to be relied upon in word or in  deed, I expect that the charges against myself, (and Sens.) John Glenn, John  McCain, Dennis DeConcini and Don Riegle will be looked upon in a very different  light," Cranston said.  </P> <P> "Gray is a public relations expert by profession. He knows he can tell just  about any kind of lie about a politician these days and be believed --  especially if he repeats those lies over and over in the Hitlerian technique of  the Big Lie."  </P> <P> Gray, who is now a Florida savings and loan executive, was on vacation,  reportedly out of the country, and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In his broadside, Cranston blamed Gray for six "lies" that have misshapen  public perceptions about the events.  </P> <P> Cranston said it is a "lie" that he pressured Gray. Gray has said he felt  pressured.  </P> <P> The senator said it is a "lie" that meeting with senators was anything but  routine. "Gray preverts that meeting, making it sound like a sinister cabal,"  said Cranston. Indeed, Gray does. "I felt a tenseness in the air, an  awkwardness that was overwhelming. Just me and five senators in a room. Nobody  else to record what was said," he has said.  </P> <P> Cranston said it is a "lie" that his intervention delayed federal regulators in  acting. Among those who have made this suggestion is House Banking Committee  Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.).  </P> <P> Cranston said it was a "lie" when Gray allegedly told an interviewer that the  $850,000 in Keating contributions were to help Cranston get reelected.  Actually, the contributions were for voter registration drives during the 1988  presidential race, not Cranston's 1986 reelection. Gray reportedly described  the voter registration groups as "phony," which Cranston said was another  "lie."  </P> <P> The senator plans to spend this week and next trying to regain the offensive  and to discourage a growing number of fellow Democrats who are stepping all  over each other -- half a dozen or more of them -- to test the idea of running  against him in the 1992 senate primary. Cranston accused them of  "ghoulishness."  </P> <P> One of the keys to his plan apparently is to offer help of some sort for those  Californians who bought bonds at Lincoln branches. Many of the buyers now say  they believed the bonds were backed by government deposit insurance. They were  not, and are now without value.  </P> <P> "When the facts get known to them, and when it becomes apparent to the bond  holders what I have sought to do, and am seeking to do, and am about to do more  for them than any other single person, expect perhaps the attorneys  representing them, I think their attitudes will change," Cranston said.  </P> <P> Polls in the state show a profound plunge in Cranston's popularity ever since  his role in Lincoln was disclosed. But he gave no quarter Wednesday, after two  weeks on vacation to brood over it.  </P> <P> "I come before you bloodied but unbowed," he declared. "I assure you I have  just begun to fight."  </P> <P> And then the 75-year-old Cranston told a fable. It was about three elderly  gentlemen who were talking about where they would like to be buried. One wanted  to be buried next to Cleopatra. Another said he wanted to be buried next to  Marilyn Monroe. The third said he wanted a plot beside Elizabeth Taylor.  </P> <P> " 'But wait a minute,' the others shouted. 'She's not dead yet,' " Cranston  continued. " 'Neither am I, the third one said.'

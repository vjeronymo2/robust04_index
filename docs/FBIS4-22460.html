			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Solih: "Critical Views of </F> Independence"]    [Text] On a spring day in 1992 we passed through Lenin  Square in Toshkent together with the Leningrad poet Viktor  Sosnora and stopped by the massive statue there.    The Russian poet, staring at the statue, suddenly asked:  "Will we ever see the destruction of spiritual tyranny?" This  question was not an unexpected one. This is a question familiar  to all the enslaved peoples in the Soviet empire.    Laughing, I gave the answer: "Sure, this statue will be  destroyed, but when it is destroyed and crashes to the ground  into thousands of pieces of cast iron and marble, then I will be  afraid."    I could not have imagined that this joke would turn into  reality before even ten years had past because the Soviet empire  was perceived as a powerful fortress which no power on earth  could destroy.    To be sure, Gorbachev did not come to the government to  dismantle the empire, nor did Yeltsin. On the contrary, they  came to reform this "fortress," to turn it into a modern empire.    In fact, as the Russian chauvinists say, not even America  could bring it down. The force that destroyed it was history, or  something controlling history, the possessor of an iron law  outside of man's will. We call this law the will of Allah.    I mean to say that today Uzbekistan has attained its  political independence, and our people are indebted to no one  for this independence. Independence is only Allah's blessing and  we are only indebted to Him.    Is our people worthy of this blessing?    Absolutely.    This people survived 135 years in Russia's bondage. Over  this  long time, Turkestan sacrificed millions of its youths for  freedom, and the bravest and most courageous of our people were  martyrs on the road to freedom.    What kind of people were these people?    What kind of bravery did these people, who would take a gun  in their hand or if they could not find a gun would take up a  club, have to rise up against an empire armed with modern  weapons?    They were brave because they had feelings of faith,  fatherland, freedom, and normal human pride in their hearts.  Thus, the empire acted to kill these people's pride and, to a  certain extent, succeeded. The lack of faith and pride today is  buried under all the spiritual, political, and economic  corruption in our life.    Let me go on and speak openly. We are now in such a state  that, if tomorrow a Russian or another government comes along  and begins to reimpose tyranny, we would not have the will to  rise up against it.    Today our mood is known. Today the government can issue any  decree it wants and impose tyranny on the people, if it wants,  and the society will not stand up and say "respected government,  you have made a mistake!"    The present government names the minister it wants, and  insults him if it wishes, but the minister does not open his  mouth and defend his honor because he has no faith, no pride.    A nation made up of such persons could easily endure the  tyranny of another nation.    The decline of man's will, the lack of honor and faith in  our  society -- this is an ugly heritage left over from the Russian  empire. The time has come to save ourselves from this  "inheritance."    Now our nation must be recognized as a nation the equal of  that of other nations and must learn to demand from every  government its own rights appropriate to this.    God knows, three years ago I said to President Karimov  "first  let us be free of Moscow's tyranny, and then if you demonstrate  tyranny, we will fight against your tyranny." These words were  half truth and half a joke. Now the joke is gone but the truth  remains.    In Uzbekistan the communist order did not change and we have  fought against it from the beginning.    We are in the opposition. We are not personal enemies of the  president. We are enemies of the old order the president is  defending. We are not demanding the resignation of the  president, we are demanding the retirement of a transgressor  order. This order does not look to the future of our Republic,  but toward the past; it is a barrier to opening up the people's  potential. Society has sunk deeply into corruption and  injustice. It has taught the people spiritual humility.  <H5>  ON UZBEKISTAN'S DOMESTIC POLICY </H5>   When I criticized this policy, I never intended to say that  the general problems, which are special to all the old republics  such as the economic difficulties, are the fault of the present  government. On the contrary, I am criticizing it for reviving  the old totalitarian order under the pretext of the problems  left over from the past.    Other republics, despite these problems, are acting with all  their capability to lay the foundations for their peoples'  future.    If Uzbekistan's order is not changed, the laughable  "democratic Russia" and "democratic Kyrgyzstan," which is always  said sarcastically, will achieve economic progress before us. At  the same time, we are sitting around and protecting our poverty  with the police.    This regime is not changing: either it resigns or the people  drive it from the government. The people's punishment will be  meted out when a new government replaces the old.    One cannot say that the present government passed to the  people when the old one disgraced itself. This suffering people  is reliving the past problems of totalitarianism.    For four and a half years now this government has been  repeating the saying: "you cannot build a new house until the  old one is demolished." It is quite true. We have grasped this  piece of wisdom now for four and a half years and hoped that as  long as there is peace, everything will be fine. But our hopes  have been dashed: it is known that our government has no  intention of building a "new house." It intends to repair the  shack remaining from the Soviet empire, and is unable to do  this. We have not gone forward, we have gone backwards.    This backward movement has not just begun. The movement  began  after the entire government in Uzbekistan passed into the hands  of one person -- after the presidential elections.    Up to the elections, the government comported itself as if  it  were somewhat liberal, and imbued with the people's ideas. Until  the election, the government had listened to the opinions of the  Supreme Assembly and the peoples deputies and its policies  advanced because of this. People's representatives could express  their recommendations on the social and political conditions in  our country, and this situation was very important in the life  of the government.    Had this mood of freedom continued, the Supreme Assembly,  the  people's deputies, and the political parties would undoubtedly  have helped the government overcome the problems which had  emerged. National unity would have turned into reality.    After the new government was elected, it began to view every  kind of opinion, but its own in a hostile manner. Its first act  after the elections was bloodshed: students who demonstrated to  show their dissatisfaction with the increase in the price of  food on 16 January 1992 were shot.    Then, attacks on the opposition parties began. Members of  ERK, BIRLIK, and religious functionaries were persecuted without  basis, and cases of imprisonment began to occur.    1992 was a bad year for the opposition: BIRLIK was banned,  the ERK party's money and printing press were confiscated  illegally. First, five viloyat newspapers of this party, then  the central ERK newspaper was closed.    Although hundreds of complaints came into the Republic  administration about these arbitrary actions, not one was  answered because it was the administration itself which was  doing these arbitrary actions.    The life of opposition members who was not imprisoned was  turned into a living hell. They constantly lived under  persecution by spies and provocation.    In brief, Uzbekistan turned into a country of spies,  investigators, and prosecutors.    At a time when our people are groaning under poverty, the  government is spending a substantial part of the national budget  for the material needs of the police and the KGB.    Certainly, our state has to have powerful and well equipped  security organs. The opposition wants this, too. But if this  equipment is not built on social justice, the people will not  respected these organs, but curse them.    In no city in the world except ours do the police rove in  bands. One of my foreign friends asked me: "Why are there so  many police on the street, was there an incident?" I was unable  to answer, because there was no incident; they were afraid that  an incident would occur.    The police are increasing because those dissatisfied with  the  government are increasing. In the same was that persecutions are  increasing, so are the numbers of people thrown in prison  increasing. This is not the fault of the police, it is the fault  of the government which is afraid of its own people.    Because of this, the government's control over this  dissatisfaction serves to increase the dissatisfaction. The  government, essentially, is afraid of its own shadow.  <H5>  THE UGLY SCENE IN THE REPUBLIC'S ECONOMIC LIFE </H5>   Although a law privatizing property has already been passed,  privatization has not even begun. All of the companies that  opened two years ago are now closed. The market did not break  down under the influence of the laws, it was closed down by the  government.    Consumer goods, including food products, are not readily  available. Foreign trade is not in the hands of the state, but  has been passed on the relatives of the mighty. The greatest  part of the income from foreign trade does not find its way into  the national treasury, but into the pockets of unknown persons.    Foreign companies will not move into Uzbekistan because we  have no unified economic policy and they have no faith in the  guarantees of the government.    The most frightening thing is that the economic mechanism in  the Republic does not operate; it is crippled by bribery,  nepotism, and corruption.    But the government is inviting foreign capitalists in,  saying: "Come to us, we have political unanimity, and bring your  capital!" But how long can one oil a rusted chain with the oil  of political unanimity? And who will guarantee that this chain  will not suddenly fall apart?    Is political unanimity held together by force secure or is  it  dangerous for the people and the government?    True unanimity is a unanimity built on the agreement of all  groups in the society, and only with this kind of political  unanimity is there a basis for a strong economy.    The time of the appropriateness of economic liberalism and  political authoritarianism has passed. Some of the newly  independent states cannot achieve economic development through  the old model, or the model of South Korea or Chile because  between the 1960s and the 1990s mankind entered into an  historically unprecedented dynamic that does not fit into the  old molds. Every political leader and every government must  understand this historical situation deeply.    Today's political repressions have done more damage to  Uzbekistan than bribery and corruption, because the capital and  credits which are a life necessity to Uzbekistan are not coming  in under these circumstances.</p>

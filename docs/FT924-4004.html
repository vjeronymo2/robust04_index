			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / The Property Market: Devaluation, lower interest rates raise hopes of industry's rescue STERLING'S devaluation and lower interest rates in the UK have raised the possibility that rising inflation will come to the rescue of the industry, as it did after the property collapse of the early 1970s. Over the long term rental growth has matched the rate of inflation, averaging 10 per cent a year since 1970. Inflation pushes up construction costs, which has a knock-on effect on values. It also erodes the real value of debts and reduces real interest rates, thereby depressing the sale of properties by overstretched companies. Furthermore, inflation enhances the standing of property compared with bonds for institutional investors. But the benefits of inflation cannot be taken for granted. Even if retail prices rise, this may not lead to asset inflation, which depends on weight of money moving into property and forcing up prices. The inbalance between supply and demand is likely to blunt the impact of inflation on rental values for several years. Moreover, it is possible that higher inflation will necessitate an increase in interest rates before the fundamental problems of the market have been resolved. The risk is that this would stifle occupational demand - ultimately the only real saviour of the property sector.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES IN PROPERTY VALUE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Properties (%)              Retail                Office                            Year to                Year to                        Oct 92   Oct 92       Oct 92   Oct 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth            -2.0     -0.4        -15.8     -2.1 Capital growth           -1.5     -0.2        -14.0     -1.3 Total return              6.1      0.4         -6.2     -0.5 Current yield levels      9.0                  10.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Properties (%)          Industrial                    All                            Year to                Year to                        Oct 92   Oct 92       Oct 92   Oct 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth            -8.3     -1.3         -8.6     -1.2 Capital growth           -6.8     -0.8         -7.3     -0.7 Total return              2.4      0.0          0.7      0.0 Current yield levels     11.3                   9.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IPD monthly index, Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

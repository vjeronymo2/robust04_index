Rees] </F>   [Text] Bloemfontein March 23 SAPA -- The National  Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] could recruit more than 4,000  additional troops next month, depending on the availability of  training bases and accommodation, NPKF Commander Gen Gabriel  Ramushwana said on Wednesday [23 March]. He said the force was  urgently looking for new bases with adequate accommodation for  the NPKF's second intake, due In mid-April. The additional  troops would be deployed after the elections if necessary.    Three battalions of troops, numbering about 3,000, have  completed training at the De Brug camp near Bloemfontein and are  undergoing evaluation before deployment next month. Another  battalion is near the end of its training at Koeberg near Cape  Town.    Gen Ramushwana said he and his commanders were not too  concerned about the looming election date or the numbers of  troops at hand, but rather concentrated on the quality of the  peacekeepers.    He stressed the NPKF was not the only security agency  responsible for a peaceful, fair election.</p>

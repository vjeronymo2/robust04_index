			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: Only the fit can travel by train Sir, Richard Tomkins must be a fit, lithe young man to imply that a train is a treat to travel on ('When fare is not fair', January 29). I am a retired doctor and occasionally go to Romilly in Cheshire, near Stockport. The thought of travelling by train is a nightmare. I phone for a taxi to the station - time to arrive unspecified. I have to carry two relatively light suitcases to the taxi and then to the station (which was built recently but could have been constructed in the last century). I queue to obtain a ticket, then climb two flights of stairs, to be presented by the pride of British Rail - the Southend to Fenchurch Street line. On arrival at Fenchurch Street, I am presented with a nice choice: a taxi to Euston, which is slow and expensive, or a walk to the Tower tube station. I battle my way on the Underground to Euston. Then to Manchester at high speed. Then what? I am, I hope, met at the station. If not, I am faced with another difficult journey. Compare this with travelling by car and enjoying power-assisted steering, automatic transmission, radio and tapes. By car, I can be in Romilly in less than four hours. Pull the other one Mr Tomkins. I simply am not fit enough to travel by rail. John H Peters, 17 Lee Woottens Lane, Basildon, Essex</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Steeled for recovery The market seems determined to bet on recovery at British Steel. While its losses have virtually tripled over the past year, its share price has risen by more than 60 per cent. Devaluation has improved the outlook. So have the price rises in the UK, which are sticking, and those in Europe, which will only stick if agreement can be reached on cutting capacity. Were that to happen British Steel could be assured of a striking recovery. Without it the prospect is for more expensive job losses and fresh disappointment on earnings. Even so, British Steel looks strong in comparison to its competitors. Despite both falling demand and weak prices it managed to contain the increase in its net debt to Pounds 71m last year. The Pounds 213m reduction in working capital - which is additional to the effect of de-consolidating the stainless steel activities - will not be repeated. But, unlike most of its European competition, British Steel can afford to cut its capital spending further. Its cash-flow should benefit from higher prices and there may even be a small boost from the sale of Ravenscraig equipment. Despite extensive rationalisation, British Steel thus boasts a stronger balance sheet than many European companies which have yet to begin serious restructuring. That should help if Europe dawdles over capacity cuts, but the uncertainty does not leave the shares looking cheap. British Steel would have to earn nearly 7p this year to put the shares on the market's forward multiple of 14.5. It will be lucky to earn half that, even with an orderly resolution of the European problem.</p>

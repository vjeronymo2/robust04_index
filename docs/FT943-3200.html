			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (9): Busy highway to Europe - A thousand cars a day pass through Larne port Some of the elderly visitors to Northern Ireland arriving through Larne might remember the port from their World War Two days, writes Tim Coone. The huge logistical task of rapidly embarking hundreds of thousands of troops and tens of thousands of vehicles for the Normandy invasion in 1944 was tackled by routing part of the invasion force through Larne, making use of its ramp loading facilities - then almost unique - which allowed vehicles to be driven directly aboard the ships used for the invasion. Today, the same technique is allowing a different kind of invasion to take place: Larne now handles an average of 1,000 cars a day - 85 per cent of Northern Ireland's tourist traffic. Last year, 1.8m passengers travelled through the port, slightly more than the population of Northern Ireland itself. Moreover, Larne is now the principal roll-on-roll-off (ro-ro) freight port for Ireland handling an average of 550 container vehicles every day in each direction. In the UK, this makes it is second only to Dover. For Ireland's food industry and the growing number of companies following just-in-time manufacturing techniques that have chosen either the province or the Republic to locate their factories to supply the European market, Larne port is a vital link between them and their customers, some of which are located in the heart of Europe. Mr Denis Galway, the port's director and general manager, said that the frequency of sailings from the port and the short sea crossings enabled a road haulier to have a 40-ft trailer load 'in Paris within 24 hours and well into Germany in 48 hours.' Four ro-ro routes now operate between Larne and the British mainland, offering hauliers a choice of 18 sailings each way daily, evenly staggered throughout the day and night. Four ro-ro jetties, three with double ramps and the fourth recently having undergone a Pounds 7m improvement, ensure a rapid turnaround for the ferries and little delay for the hauliers. Individual loads of up to 180 tonnes can be accommodated. Half of the cargo handled through the port is perishable, such as meat and dairy products and fresh vegetables - 'speedy delivery for these is essential. With the frequency of sailings from here we can ensure that these products can leave Larne in the evening and be on supermarket shelves in Britain first thing in the morning,' says Mr Galway. Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, supplies the European market from factories located on both sides of the Irish border, using Larne as its main port to Britain and beyond. Mr Tony O'Reilly, the chairman of the Heinz food corporation, has cited Larne port as one of the reasons for locating a new pizza-topping factory for the UK market in Ireland rather than in England or Wales. According to Mr Galway, more than 20 per cent of traffic through the port originates in, or is destined for, the Irish Republic. The completion of the cross-harbour road and rail link in Belfast in February next year will finally connect Larne and the north-east of the province with the rail network throughout Ireland, opening up further possibilities of attracting new freight and passenger traffic to the port from the Republic. A rail freight terminal at the port has been proposed, while the passenger terminal is already one of the best and newest on the west of the Irish Sea offering airport-type facilities for passengers. Bus and rail services operate directly from the terminal. Even the personal hygiene of sweaty lorry drivers has been catered for - a special rest and shower room has been provided for them at the passenger terminal. Adjacent to the port, and owned by it, a 100-acre site is now being offered in lots of up to 10 acres for development which Mr Galway believes will be attractive to manufacturers and wholesale distributors looking for a location from where to supply their markets efficiently. A new era of competition for Larne began recently, though, with the appearance of new shipping on the Irish Sea. The Seacat service to Belfast, with its fast crossing times, has been able to take around 15 per cent of the tourist traffic into the province in the past two years. In 1993, Stena Sealink also opened up a new Seacat service from Holyhead to Dun Laoghaire (near Dublin), with an Irish Sea crossing time of only one and half hours (compared with two and half hours from Larne to Stranraer). Mr Galway acknowledges the threat but he says: 'We are not afraid of competition. We believe we can compete on price, and the evidence shows that ferry operators here have sustained their market share.'</p>

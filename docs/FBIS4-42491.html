			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ho/has": "Economic Development Better Than </F> Expected"]    [Text] Vienna -- Industry is more optimistic about the  future than the economic researchers: This year economic growth  will easily reach the 2 percent that the experts have predicted.  Even 2.5 percent is possible, Economic Chamber economist  Christian Festa told a press conference yesterday, referring to  a poll among 300 Austrian companies. The precondition for  recovery is, however, membership in the European Union [EU].    There are positive signals from various sides: Austria is in  the "early stage of economic recovery," according to experts as  well as the fact that orders received are rising. This tender  seed of economic growth must, however, not be destroyed by new  taxes and other burdens, Guenter Stummvoll, the secretary  general of the Economic Chamber, stressed. Rather, the upward  development is to be supported by more flexible work time.    The wave of bankruptcies is also declining: During the first  five months of this year, the cost of bankruptcies reached about  10 billion schillings. During the same period last year, the  cost was almost twice as high. "We have to expect an easing of  the situation regarding the number of bankruptcy proceedings  opened and, above all, regarding the amount of the estimated  debts," Klaus Herzenberger, head of the Loan Protection  Association of 1870, says, being optimistic also for the further  course of the year.    On the labor market the situation clearly improved at the  end  of May, far more than justified by the usual seasonal decline.  The level of unemployment in Austria -- 4.5 percent -- is about  half of that in the European OECD area as well as of the EU,  which has an average unemployment rate of 11.2 percent. At the  moment 194,287 unemployed are registered at the labor exchange  offices, which is 6,943 fewer than at the end of May 1993 and  25,765 fewer than in April. At the same time, the number of  vacancies is rising: At the moment, there are 35,000 vacant  jobs. That is 2,665 more than at the end of April.</p>

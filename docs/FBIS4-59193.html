			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Hariri Stays Away and Refrains </F> From Carrying Out Any Official Activity"]    [Text] Paris, Beirut, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Informed  political sources in Beirut said yesterday that a new crisis has  emerged between (President) al-Hirawi, (Chamber of Deputies  Speaker) Birri, and (Prime Minister) al-Hariri as a result of  differences of opinion regarding the question of changing some  ministers and some portfolios in the current cabinet.    One of the first results of that crisis, according to  reports  circulating in Beirut's political and information circles, is  that al-Hariri is staying away and refraining from carrying out  his official duties.    It has been learned that the prime minister cancelled a  television interview which was scheduled to be broadcast on the  official television network yesterday evening, without giving  any reasons.    Al-Hirawi had, on his latest visit to Damascus, sought the  opinion of the Syrian authorities regarding the reshuffle issue.  It seems that Damascus does not favor a complete change of  government but has no objection to a limited reshuffle in the  interest of more effective government work to fulfill current  requirements at home and abroad.    It has been claimed that the differences between the  Lebanese  state leaders concern individuals as well as portfolios and that  what is needed is not just replacement of the some of the  current ministers with new ones but also a change of the  portfolios of some of the current ministers while at the same  time keeping them in the cabinet.    Some sources hinted that each of the three leaders wants to  improve his position in the government and increase his share in  it by having people close to him or considered loyal to him in  the cabinet. One of the declared aims and reasons for the  partial and limited reshuffle is to restore the Christians'  confidence in the government by broadening representation and  participation in the government through inclusion of individuals  so far considered to be members of the opposition.    The parties tipped to join the government include the  Phalangist Party led by George Sa'adah and the National Bloc  Party led by Raymond Iddih. It has been learned that the first  does not object but the second has reservations and might refuse  to have one of its members in the cabinet.</p>

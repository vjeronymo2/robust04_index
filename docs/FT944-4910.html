			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: CSR sees higher profits after 30% rise in first half CSR, the Australian building products, sugar and aluminium group, yesterday announced a 30 per cent increase in after-tax profits to ADollars 225.2m (USDollars 173.2m) for the six months to end-September, and forecast that full-year figures would show a 'substantial improvement over the previous year'. CSR combined news of its first-half figures with the announcement of two deals in the Asia-Pacific region. The first was the purchase for ADollars 71m of a 70 per cent stake in a timber business in China's Hunan province, and the second an ADollars 8m investment in a plasterboard company in Beijing. CSR said its aim was to invest ADollars 600m in the region by the end of 1996. Because much of the investment would be through joint ventures, the underlying asset exposure would be about ADollars 1bn, said Mr Geoffrey Kells, managing director. The company also said that it would 'vigorously defend' a legal claim by Mackay Refined Sugar, alleging that CSR attempted to force its rival out of the refined sugar market by predatory pricing. The Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, announced last month that it would look into the matter. CSR has maintained that all its sales were made at above the costs of supplying the sugar concerned. CSR achieved the profits increase on a 12 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 3.17bn. Earnings per share rose by 25 per cent to 24.7 cents, and the interim dividend was increased by 17 per cent to 14 cents. The company said that all divisions reported an improvementin profits, with timber and aluminium posting the strongest gains, of 47 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. There has been some concern that the slowdown in Australia's housing market would hurt the company's financial performance in the next financial year. However, CSR stressed that it expected further profits growth in the 1995/96 year. CSR's shares strengthened, rising 12 cents to ADollars 4.52.</p>

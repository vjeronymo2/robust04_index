			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. HIKES ITS OFFER TO KEEP RAIDERS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Coliseum Commission on Tuesday increased the value of the new  stadium it has promised to build Raiders owner Al Davis to $145 million, up $20  million from its previous offer, in another bid to keep the football team here.  </P> <P> "He said he would get back to us in the next few days," Coliseum Commission  President Richard Riordan said after a meeting between Davis, representatives  of the Spectacor Management Group which manages the Coliseum, Riordan and  Coliseum Commissioner Dominic Rubiclava.  </P> <P> "I would say I'm still a bit pessimistic (about Davis accepting the offer),"  Riordan added. "But I think the odds against it have narrowed."  </P> <P> The latest proposal is a variation on offers to Davis going back to last June.  Most of the money for the project would come from private financing.  </P> <P> Davis, who in the past has expressed dissatisfaction with offers by Coliseum  officials, currently is considering competitive offers that would move his team  to Sacramento or back to Oakland, the city in which the Raiders originally  played.  </P> <P> As has been the case with all of the offers, Davis had no comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Riordan said that under the "very detailed" proposal to Davis on Tuesday,  California would lease the land to MCA Inc., which would demolish most of the  existing stadium, which was enlarged to its present size for the 1932 Olympics.  Preserving only the peristyle end of the 95,000-seat Coliseum, Riordan said,  MCA would build a new stadium, seating 60,000 to 70,000, "with state-of-the-art  sight-lines and luxury boxes. . . . "It would be as nice as any stadium in the  country," the commission president said.  </P> <P> Riordan said that if Davis were to approve the offer with dispatch -- and the  state agrees right away -- construction would begin after the team's 1990  season.  </P> <P> "If all went well, they'd miss the '91 season, but they'd be ready for '92," he  said.  </P></p>

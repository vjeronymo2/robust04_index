			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Cautious optimism among small businesses - Small Firms BRITAIN'S notoriously hard-to-please small business community reacted with uncharacteristic enthusiasm last night to the chancellor's package of small firms measures. Small business organisations remained cautious about how some of the changes will work in practice but were generally pleased about measures to improve their cash flows, ease the transition to the Uniform Business Rate and remove the threat of Inheritance Tax. The decision to abolish the Business Expansion Scheme from the end of 1993 provoked concern, however, that this would create an 'equity gap' for businesses seeking to raise small amounts of equity finance. However, in general the Chancellor's selection of small business measures revealed a sure appreciation of the issues which have been of particular concern to small firms. Some of the changes will remove long-standing problems such as inheritance tax while others should remedy complaints created by more recent tax changes. The changes represent a finely balanced collection of measures designed to ease cash flow problems in the short term and to create an easier long-term climate for the small business. The decision to remove most family-owned businesses from the inheritance tax net is expected to provide an important psychological fillip of even greater value than the Pounds 35m that such businesses will save in tax during the next two years. British small firms groups have looked enviously at the strong family-owned business sectors in France and Germany. 'Inheritance tax has been a sword of Damocles over the head of the small family business,' said Ms Jane Lyon, managing director of Clam-Brummer, a second generation company making industrial adhesives. 'You can take steps to avoid the tax but there has always been an element of keeping your fingers crossed.' The decision to ease the transition to the Uniform Business Rate also showed a fine sensitivity towards one of the most pressing issues to concern the small firms organisations. They have lobbied ever since the introduction of the UBR for a transitional regime more sensitive to the needs of smaller businesses. By ensuring that there is no real increase in the rate next year; speeding up the reductions for businesses which gain from the new system; and allowing new tenants to inherit the transitional protection enjoyed by the previous tenant, the chancellor has met the small firms organisations' three main objections. The chancellor's proposed VAT changes will do much to ease the problems of administering what is probably the small business community's least liked tax. Allowing more firms to use the cash accounting option will improve their cash flows at a particularly difficult time. Bringing more small employers into the system for making quarterly rather than monthly income tax and national insurance payments will also help cash flows. However, it was the chancellor's move to ease Customs &amp; Excise's draconian VAT enforcement powers which was the most widely welcomed VAT change. The decision to reduce the Serious Misdeclaration Penalty to 15 per cent means it has been halved during the past two budgets. Small firms lobby groups remain concerned, however, that their fundamental objection to the penalty - that it can be applied to simple errors of tax administration as well as to deliberate attempts to defraud - remains. They hope for more far-reaching changes from the Customs &amp; Excise's promise of continuing consultations. Measures to ease the difficulties small firms face in persuading their large customers to pay their bills on time also showed that the chancellor has listened closely to the complaints of the small business lobby groups. Lobbyists wondered just how many companies would be included in the definition of 'larger companies' which will be expected to report in their annual reports just how quickly they pay their suppliers. For the government to insist that main contractors on government contracts must pay subcontractors within 30 days means that the government departments must themselves first meet this deadline. The decision to abolish the Business Expansion Scheme provoked concern. The Union of Independent Companies said that another scheme would have to be put in its place to meet the equity needs of small companies. The government appeared to be taking an unduly optimistic view of the venture capital industry, which is generally unable to provide small amounts of equity, in abolishing the BES. Inevitably the small business lobbyists' lengthy shopping list of requests has not been met in full. There was no reintroduction of 100 per cent first year capital allowances abolished eight years ago and there were no special corporation tax breaks for smaller firms. The plea from the venture capital community for BES-style tax concessions to be extended to the managers of businesses became impracticable once the decision to abolish the BES itself had been taken. Nor was there any response to the rather optimistic plea for the government to pay small businesses for the work they put into administering VAT. However, with the exception of these relatively minor blemishes, the government appears to have done a good job in making up for past neglect of a sector traditionally containing many of its most fervent supporters.</p>

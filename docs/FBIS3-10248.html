At a conference for Higher Education Ministry officials,  Rodriguez said Cuba has an ample level of certitude on imports,  exports, and other resources, in addition to its economic  planning system. He estimated that the changes introduced in  the Cuban economy can be slow according to the people's needs  but not according to the possibilities of the island.    Among the economic measures implemented since last August,  Rodriguez mentioned the depenalization of the dollar, the  opening to foreign investments, and the increase of tasks  authorized for self-employment.    The Cuban finance minister said 1994 will be better than  1993  for Cuba from the economic standpoint, "as it will break the  violent economic fall suffered from 1989 to 1993."    He based his assertion on the possibilities of having a  cheaper sugarcane harvest, the recovery of sugar and nickel  prices--two of the country's main economic sectors--and getting  tourism to grow 25 percent.    Other factors that will mark this year in the Cuba economy,  according to the specialist, will be the substitution of  imports, the discovery of new oil deposits, the recovery of  fuel, and an increase -- although not an extraordinary one -- in  agricultural production.</p>

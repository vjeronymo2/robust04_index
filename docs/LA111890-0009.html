			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, YOSEMITE!  </P> <P> I suppose it is unavoidable that the politics-for-profit element in Washington  contaminates even our National Park Service, but I commend The Times and author  Dolan for the enlightening article regarding Edward Hardy's and MCA's control  over Yosemite National Park. It makes one wonder how the National Park Service  could relinquish their responsibility for protecting the rights and resources  of United States citizens to a portrait-oriented corporation such as MCA.  </P> <P> Fortunately there are people and organizations such as Patricia Schifferle, Joe  Boland, Dean Malley and the Yosemite Restoration Trust who will challenge MCA's  self-serving agenda and force the responsible government agencies to live up to  their responsibilities.  </P> <P> CHARLES F. DOHERTY  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

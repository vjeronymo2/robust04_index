			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin"] </F>   [Text] President Askar Akayev on Thursday formed a security  council to coordinate activities carried out by appropriate  agencies in the field.    This advisory board, as the presidential decree notes, is  assigned to draft presidential decisions on republican security,  plan anti-crime campaigns, consult the president on the  republican health service, forecast and prevent emergencies and  eliminate their effects, and advise the president on everything  that concerns a state of emergency, including its imposition,  extension, and repeal.    The council comprises the prime minister, chairman of the  commission for emergencies in the rank of deputy premier, power  ministers, national guards commander, presidential  administration chief, and president's national security adviser.  The board, which will meet once a month, can invite the  Parliament's Speaker and other persons.    Conferring with the power ministers on Thursday, Akayev  pointed to shortcomings in the fight against crime and said that  after the credit of trust from the voters he would spare no  effort to restore order in the republic. He gave instructions  on drafting decrees to this effect.    Akayev also had a closed meeting with the finance minister,  taxation and custom service chiefs, and other officials to  discuss ways of collecting taxes and securing finances. It was  noted that sizable revenues were lost because many enterprises  had been evading taxes. For this reason, Akayev threatened to  deal ruthlessly with tax evaders, whose actions, as he put it,  "undermine the security of the entire state."</p>

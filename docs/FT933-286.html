			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (22): Task for foreign funders / A look at basic services NO MAIN Latin American country fell further in the 1980s than Peru. Like the others, Peru suffered from the debt crisis - low prices for its commodity exports combined with high real dollar interest rates on its bloated external debt. Its problem was made much worse, however, by the incredible economic incompetence of the Alan Garcia administration 1985-90, and by an ever increasing campaign of terrorism with which neither the Belaunde nor the Garcia governments were able to cope. Peru which today and 10 years ago had 5 per cent of the Latin American population has over the same period seen its share of the regional GNP fall from 4.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent, as real GNP fell by 115 per cent. Today as Peru turns the economic corner, the Fujimori administration has to cope with the past drastic deterioration in public services that accompanied economic decline. The answer for telephones, electricity, and ports is no doubt privatisation but other services are a more complicated issue. Peru has one of the highest infant mortality rates in Latin America (69 per 1,000 live births, only exceeded by Bolivia, Guatemala and Haiti), the result of poverty and a very poor water and sewerage system. Illiteracy is also high, exceeded only by the same three countries, plus Brazil. In basic services the government is wisely acting to privatise public electricity and telephones. The public grid had a capacity of only about 4000MW, slightly more than 11 years ago. In the meantime, poor maintenance, disastrous utility tariff policies in the period 1985-90, an over-reliance on hydropower in the drought-prone Andes, as well as frequent terrorist actions against long-distance transmission lines in isolated areas, have meant huge costs for industry and inconvenience for households. Probably 1 1/2 -2 per cent of GNP was lost in 1991 - to apagones (blackouts) and electricity rationing, but the problems continue in 1993. In the Lima area, ElectroLima estimates that 25 per cent of demand in the second half of 1993 will have to be rationed, compared with almost 30 per cent a year earlier. The electricity privatisations are scheduled for a year from now. They should be accelerated as quickly as possible so that the new steam plants on the drawing board can get financed and built. The telephone system with only three lines per 100 inhabitants is to be privatised in the next three months. The privatisers would be wise to give the new owners a decent interval before allowing competition so that the badly needed pre-approved investment programme can be properly financed. Ports should also be privatised as well as water systems for the main four or five cities, where supplies reach only half their target population. This will provide the government with the resources to tackle the huge water and sewerage deficit in provincial areas. The road system has been badly affected by years of terrorism, banditry, and neglect of maintenance. The central highway, the link to the main mining and farming regions of the central Andes has been inaugurated time after time with international agency loans: it is at present near collapse. For the main roads a mixture of partial privatisation, tolls and user charges is the only answer. Improvements to other roads are equally urgent, but have to rely on government money. The choices in health and education are more complex. Industrial countries themselves, the US especially, are wrestling with how to deliver costly social services. As government tax revenues improve - they have reached 11 per cent of GNP compared with less than half that at the end of the Garcia administration in 1990 - the public sector will be in a position to do more, although it should rely on private co-operation and incentives where it can as has happened in Chile. Where will the money come from? Obviously public utilities have to generate enough cash, which they are beginning to do after tariff adjustments in 1990-Pounds 91. Privatisation will force more economical investments, especially in electricity, where over-reliance in the 1970s on marginal and therefore expensive hydro schemes burdens the system. Beyond the cash flow and parsimony, finance will have to come from equity and borrowings. The stock market which has tripled in market captilisation to about Dollars 4.5bn in the last 18 months, will in time be able to provide some equity capital and blue chips such as the telephone companies, which will be under one financial roof after privatisation, will be able to access foreign equity for their expansion, instead of foreign investors simply acquiring undervalued assets as happens now. Water and electricity will need funding from the Washington institutions, especially the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the InterAmerican Development Bank (IADB). The IFC has the advantage over its parent the World Bank of lending dollars instead of yen and not requiring international competitive bidding down to the last screw, a process that often raises the cost of projects rather than reducing it, as is the intention. It is expanding to infrastructure lending in Latin America as its big brother looks more and more to central and eastern Europe. Earlier this year, an international group recommended to the IADB the allocation of at leat 5 per cent of new lending for privatised infrastructure. Leveraging this limited money with proper performance safeguards from governments on utility tariffs and exchange convertibility, the IADB ought to be able to mobilise sizeable funds. If utility privatisation forges ahead the fund should have plenty to do in this re-emerging economy.

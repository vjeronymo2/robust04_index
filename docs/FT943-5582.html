			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (30): A test for control systems - A look at the implications of Asia Pacific's surge in air travel In June, Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced one of the world's biggest aircraft orders. The national carrier would buy 22 Boeing 747-400 Megatops and 30 Airbus A340-300E aircraft, with a total price-tag of Dollars 10.3bn. SIA said the aircraft were needed because of expected passenger growth of between 8 and 10 per cent a year in the coming decade. Mr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, described the order as 'an expression of our faith in the long-term health of the aviation industry and the promising future of SIA.' Airlines throughout the Asia Pacific region are expanding to meet surging passenger demand. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) predicts that passenger numbers in the region will double between now and 2000. While passenger traffic is growing by 5 per cent a year in North America and under 4 per cent a year in Europe, in Asia the figure is closer to 9 per cent. Asian markets now account for about 25 per cent of world air travel. By early next century that figure is likely to exceed 40 per cent. Several factors have caused the upsurge. The main stimulus has been the economic growth of most countries in the area. China's economy has been expanding by more than 12 per cent a year. Singapore's grew by nearly 10 per cent last year. The economies of Malaysia and Thailand have expanded by more than 8 per cent in each of the last five years. Economic growth means more business activity and more business travel. It also means rising income levels, with people having greater opportunity to travel. In China alone air traffic increased by 35 per cent in 1992, and by more than 20 per cent last year. Another factor influencing traffic levels has been the lifting of various travel restrictions in many countries: citizens of Taiwan, South Korea and perhaps most significantly China no longer face severe curtailments on movement outside their countries. Business people travelling in the region face fewer immigration barriers. Intra-Asia tourism is now one of the region's key growth industries. Vietnam Airlines, the state carrier, reports that it carried 320,000 foreign passengers during the first six months of this year - more than the total carried in 1992. Most of the region's carriers have ambitious expansion programmes. However, they have not been immune to the problems that have faced airlines elsewhere. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific reported a 24 per cent drop in net earnings last year. Malaysia Airlines' pre-tax profits for the year to March 1994 fell by 90 per cent. Over the same period, pre-tax profits at Singapore Airlines, consistently one of the world's most profitable carriers, dipped 7.7 per cent to Dollars 555m. The profits slump was blamed on a combination of recession in western markets, plus intense competition and adverse currency factors. Many carriers now realise that their passenger forecasts and consequent expansion plans of a few years ago were too optimistic. Officials at Malaysia Airlines privately admit that a Dollars 10.6bn aircraft purchase programme, which started in the early 1990s, has put severe financial strain on the company. Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Philippine Airlines and Garuda, Indonesia's national carrier, have all had to defer or cancel some aircraft deliveries. Asia's carriers have met increasing competition from outside the region. Faced with tough conditions at home, carriers from the US, and to a lesser extent from Europe, have turned to the lucrative Asia market. Asia's big state-controlled carriers have also been hurt by competition from the region's new airlines, such as Eva in Taiwan and Asiana in South Korea. In partial response to the growth in competition, the region's larger carriers have improved levels of service and introduced frequent flyer programmes. Passengers who have long complained that Asia has some of the most expensive air routes in the world are relieved to find carriers undercutting ticket costs. Other problems haunt the Asia Pacific's carriers. Thomas S. Windmuller, assistant director of the Air Transport Action Group, believes the region's airline industry is in danger of 'strangling on its own success'. Mr Windmuller says that forecasts for passenger growth in the region are based on the assumption that there will be sufficient airspace systems and airports capable of handling the upsurge in traffic. However, there is an urgent need for Asia Pacific governments to standardise aerospace regulations and co-ordinate traffic-control systems. Once in the air, the passenger may be able to sit back and enjoy the service for which Asia's airlines are known. But facilities in the air are not matched by infrastructure on the ground. Iata says only two of the main air-traffic hubs in the region - Singapore and Taipei - are capable of coping with expected passenger growth. Many countries in the region are either expanding existing airport facilities or building entirely new ones. However, until these are opened there is likely to be more congestion - and more frustration among passengers.</p>

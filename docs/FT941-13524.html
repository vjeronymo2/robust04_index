			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Portuguese financial group gains control of three dairy companies Espirito Santo, the Portuguese financial group, yesterday won control of a leading dairy group in the country's first leveraged buy-out to be syndicated in Europe. The operation involved the issue of Es14bn (Dollars 79m) in acquisition debt. Laque-Industria de Laticinios e Queijo, controlled by the Espirito Santo group, bought a controlling stake in Lacto, a group of three diary companies, in one the biggest corporate buy-outs ever made in Portugal. Bankers Trust, the US investment bank, arranged and underwrote the operation in co-operation with Portugal's Banco Totta e Acores and Banco de Fomento e Exterior. The purchase price has not been revealed but the acquisition debt issued totalled Es14bn. The buy-out entailed the transfer of close to 100 per cent of the outstanding shares of Lacto Acoreana, Lacto Lima and Lacto Lusa, the companies that make up the Lacto group, previously in the hands of some 300 shareholders. The Lacto group is one of Portugal's biggest privately-held food companies, with 1992 sales of Es13bn. Laque, wholly owned by Lacto Holding, is controlled by Espirito Santo Development Capital Investors. ESDCI plans to centralise the marketing, sales, production and logistics of the Lacto group and put a new management in place. 'The structure of the buy-out is innovative in stripping out the risk portion of the funding. This makes the syndication attractive to both Portuguese and foreign financial institutions,' said a spokesman for Bankers Trust. The operation also involves an interest rate derivative to protect Laque against any rise in Portuguese interest rates.</p>

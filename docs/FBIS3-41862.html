The disclosure was made at the first  conference on ``the geology of uranium ore and the means of  detection and exploration.'' The conference is being held this  week in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA].    The conference aims to bring together geologists and experts  in uranium exploration and to assess the recent finds of  uranium. Recent discoveries have resulted in a haul of 850 tons  of uranium ore, containing an estimated ratio of 0.1 percent of  the substance.    It is known that Egyptian experts have discovered uranium  ore  in three locations: Qattar, situated northwest of al-Ghardaqah;  al-Musaykat and al-'Ardiyah, situated south of the Safajah-Qina  road; and Umm Ara, situated southeast of Aswan.    The conference, which lasts for a week, is attended by  Egyptian and foreign geologists as well as IAEA representatives.</p>

The SIP's for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas classified as moderate or higher under section 181(a)(1) are required to provide for reductions in volatile organic compounds (VOC) of at least 15 percent from baseline emissions by 1996, and areas classified as serious or higher are required to provide for reductions of at least 3 percent each year (averaged over a 3-year period) thereafter until the attainment date (section 182(b)(1), 182(c)(2)(B)). Emissions reductions from all sources may be used to meet these progress requirements, except for those reductions attributable to Federal motor vehicle programs and RACT and NSR corrections (section 182(b)(1) (C)&hyph;(D)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RACT.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An EIP may allow sources subject to the RACT requirement to attain RACT-level emissions reductions in the aggregate, and thereby trade among themselves. In designing such RACT trading programs (to implement new and/or previously existing RACT requirements), as with any EIP, States are encouraged, to the extent practicable, to meet the benefits sharing goal directly, by requiring increased emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through a traditional RACT program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, today's rules and guidance authorize emissions trading between the stationary sources subject to the RACT requirement (``RACT sources'') and any sources (i.e., stationary, mobile, and area sources) not subject to the RACT requirement (``non-RACT sources'') when such trading results in an exceptional environmental benefit, e.g., a level of reductions that is significantly greater than RACT-level amounts. With respect to the level of emissions reductions required from the non-RACT sources, the appropriate amount of emissions reductions generally should be set at a level that takes into account the severity of the nonattainment status in a given area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rules establish the statutory offset ratios for nonattainment areas as the determinant of the amount of emissions reductions that would be required from non-RACT sources generating credits for RACT sources. The offset ratios are lower for lower-classified areas (e.g., compare section 182(a)(4), with a 1.1 to 1 offset ratio for marginal areas, and section 182(d)(2), with a 1.3 to 1 offset ratio for severe areas). Looking to offset ratios is instructive because offsets are an aspect of emissions trading that is directly addressed in the Act. The offset ratios provide a suitable analogy because they represent the most substantial benefit to the environment for a given area that is required in this statutory context of emissions trading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

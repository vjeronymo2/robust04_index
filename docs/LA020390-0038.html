			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOO ASKS AGENCY TO SEIZE DEVELOPER'S BOND  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo urged a city agency Friday to seize a  developer's $250,000 bond because the developer failed to install traffic  improvements to ease congestion in Studio City.  </P> <P> The Board of Public Works took no action on Woo's request.  </P> <P> The target of Woo's anger is the developer of the 25,000-square-foot Times  Square mall at 12215 Ventura Blvd.  </P> <P> Diana Brueggemann, a deputy of Woo, said the development team, led by Mitch  Francis, was required to post a $250,000 bond with the city to guarantee that  he would install a double left-turn lane at Ventura and Laurel Canyon  boulevards and other improvements. But the work has not been done, she said.  </P> <P> Steve Getzoff, a partner in the Times Square project, complained that the  development group has spent $50,000 on traffic studies but has been unable to  get the city to decide what improvements are needed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> On the heels of the antiseptic '70s, Lynda Benglis began making free-form  spills of encaustic and latex. Subsequent hard-driving photos, videos,  glittered torsos and sexually explicit shapes embraced feminist issues and  reconnected artistic process with an instinctual base that was out of fashion.  </P> <P> In the '80s, Benglis began doing what has become her calling card: graceful,  shapely knots formed of mesh armatures covered with sprayed-on coats of  glistening metals such as bronze, silver or aluminum. When these knots fell  under the protective rubric of feminist art they were lauded; when Benglis  sifted out specific social and sexual content to concentrate on archetypal  organic forms and regenerative forces, cries of "prettified designer art" were  heard.  </P> <P> Her current show proves once again that after nine years we are still charmed  by the knots' elegance, amazed by their clean craft and myriad tactile and  symbolic allusions. Benglis' wall-mounted knots flutter, coil, crinkle and fan;  vectors of force pull up, down, then roll in spirals that turn on themselves  forming tight bundles of mass and energy. They often span more than 6 feet of  wall but look weightless as a silver trinket made to adorn an ear lobe. The  billowing accordion folds connote everything from fish fins to ripe pods, from  the dramatic flutter of drapery in the Samothrace Nike to the whole metal-junk  genre starting with John Chamberlain's metal odes to the myth of the car (many  of Benglis' works are named after classic autos).  </P> <P> The new works make it clearer than ever that, whatever her format, Benglis has  always been interested in reconnecting her art and her viewers with the  decorative, gestural and emotive wellspring at art's most basic core.

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Beggar your neighbour: The big chill faces those who depend on state welfare The growth of the welfare state in advanced economies over the past 40 years has reflected the social and political priorities of the post-war period. Increased welfare provision was seen as a grand egalitarian gesture after the privations of the second world war, part of creating a more just society. But by mitigating the human cost of economic change, it was also a form of social investment in building successful and stable economies. That vision has been blurred, however, by changes in the social and political environment which have come with intensified global competition and the growing problems of national economies. Today, the welfare state sits beleaguered - increasingly shunned by those who can afford private provision and resented by those who have no choice but to use its services. Support for the welfare state has been undermined by two factors. The first is the gradual increase in affluence, which has changed the balance between those whose interests are served by collectivism and those whose interests are served by private solutions. The second is the increasing cost of social security benefits as economic growth has faltered and unemployment has risen. In many western economies, this cost has been further amplified by the erosion of family and community forms of social support. The loss of support for collectivism can be traced in popular resistance to paying higher taxes which developed in the 1970s, initially in the US, and spread through the advanced economies. This resistance developed into 'scrounger phobia' in the early 1980s, with attacks on a culture of dependency supposedly encouraged by the nanny state. As income tax regimes have become less progressive, the rhetoric of politics has altered. The Christian ethic and socialist idealism behind the modern welfare state proclaimed an inclusive vision of society, a belief in the possibility of redemption for everyone. Now, talk of winners and losers as the natural state of affairs is more common. In the harsher economic climate of the 1990s, the idea of irredeemably evil people has been resurrected, with the invention of new categories of 'deviants', such as irresponsible single parents, who ought to be excluded from welfare support. At the same time, people have become less secure about their financial position, as the two charts show. Until as recently as five years ago, Europeans typically expected their income and expenditure to vary over their lives in the smooth and predictable pattern shown in the first chart. The much more volatile pattern of income and expenditure in the second chart is likely to be perceived as the norm today. This loss of economic security and confidence has undermined public support for collectivist welfare policies. The Planning for Social Change survey produced by the Henley Centre, a marketing and strategic planning consultancy, reveals a dramatic change in views on the most effective way of improving the quality of life in Britain. Those polled are asked to choose between two options: 'Looking after our own interests, which ultimately raises standards for everyone'. 'Looking after the community's interests rather than your own'. There has been a steady move away from the first 'Thatcherite' answer towards the second collectivist option between 1986 and 1991. But, as the recession continued and unemployment increased, support moved back to putting the individual's interests first, and this had become the majority choice by 1993. This move away from collectivism has been described by Stewart Lansley (After the Goldrush, forthcoming from Century) as 'competitive individualism'. It holds that people cannot afford to be other than self-interested. Taxpayers increasingly feel that they cannot afford to pay higher taxes because they need the income to keep themselves out of the unacceptably low-quality public services such as health, transport, education, or to maintain their security from crime. This corrodes support for the welfare state. The rise of competitive individualism also undermines the ability of other bodies to assume some burdens of the welfare state. Even the family, where co-operation was the norm, has been touched by greater individualism. One symptom of this is the increase in divorce and rise in numbers of lone-parent families across the western world. In the UK, with one of the highest divorce rates in Europe, one in three first marriages ends in divorce and one in five families is headed by a lone parent. While this may have many causes, it is arguable that the increase in lone-parent families reflects a decline in individuals' willingness to subordinate their interests even to the collective unit of the nuclear family. Another symptom is changing consumption patterns. The duplication of consumer durables such as TVs and cars within households allows greater freedom from the uniformities that might otherwise be imposed by family decisions. The most recent generation of durables, such as the video recorder and the microwave oven, seem almost to have been designed to appeal to the family that no longer plays together. Even with more mundane products such as shampoo, butter and breakfast cereals, individual family members seem to prefer to make their own choices. The household product that all the family uses is becoming a rarity. Economic and social changes such as these make it harder for societies to cope with demographic change expected over the next generation. People are less willing to contribute towards rising welfare spending resulting from the ageing of the population. Yet there are fewer alternatives to state support for the old and other disadvantaged groups. In many countries concern over exploding pensioner populations has cast a cloud over expectations of an idyllic 'third age' for the next generation of senior citizens. In Germany it began in 1989, when actuarial reports to the government rang alarm bells about the costs of supporting rising pensioner populations in the next 20 years. Employees' social insurance contributions were increased, the retirement age was raised and the level of pensions was reduced. Elsewhere, particularly where pension systems are based on state pay-as-you-go schemes, concerns are now mounting. In France, a recent report estimated that the state pension fund would be in deficit to the tune of FFr300bn (Pounds 34.3bn) by 2010 compared to FFr20bn today. Similar analyses in Spain, Greece and Italy have come to the same conclusion: more of the costs of tomorrow's elderly populations must be paid for today whilst their expectations of universal and rising benefits must be moderated. Underlying this conclusion is the assumption that social and economic change have made it impossible for the state to assume increasing responsibilities in the way that seemed natural until quite recently. At the same time, the ability of other bodies, such as the family, to take these on is hardly reassuring. New responses may well emerge from the family, or new institutional forms may fill the gap. For those with the skills to qualify as core employees, the extension of corporate welfare may offer a lifeline. The US communitarian movement has advocated new community organisations to provide local support. But for those who must rely on the welfare state, the world is becoming a colder, harsher place in the social and political conditions of the 1990s.

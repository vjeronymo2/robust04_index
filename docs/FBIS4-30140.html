The research committee will coordinate multimedia standards  for newly developed information telecommunications equipment and  is expected to submit proposals to the government concerning  deregulation and legislation necessary for building the  next-generation communications network infrastructure to be used  by multimedia companies. The 11 companies and three related  organizations including the Communications Industry Association  of Japan, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, and  the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association have just  established a preparatory committee which will decide on the  activities to be handled by the research committee.

			<p>CSO     [Text] On 30 May, the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications [MOPT] announced that it will hold hearings  in the early part of next month, involving industry  representatives, aimed at lifting the ban on "connections  between dedicated circuits leased by businesses from Type I  telecommunications operators such as Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone (NTT) and urban public circuits operated by NTT. Such  connections will have the impact of subleasing of so-called  telephone circuits. Reductions in long-distance call rates and  expansion of business opportunities can be expected on the one  hand, while an adverse impact on NTT earnings can be expected on  the other hand. The MOPT plans to use the hearings to determine  the impact on NTT operations because of the proposed lifting of  the existing ban and the necessary relief measures.    According to MOPT officials, if the ban is lifted on  connections of public and dedicated circuits, "Theoretically,  long-distance call rates should drop by about 30 percent."  Currently, long-distance call rates using NTT's public and  long-distance circuits are 180 yen for three minutes, while the  same call using NTT public circuits and long-distance circuits  owned by one of the new telegraph and telephone companies would  be 120-140 yen. These rate reductions are expected to encourage  growth in new ventures such as mail order businesses.</p>

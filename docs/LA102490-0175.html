			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOVIEGOERS NEAR 1989'S RECORD PACE  </P> <P> Movie patrons have paid nearly $4 billion so far this year at the domestic box  office, just slightly behind last year's record-setting pace, when ticket sales  reached $5 billion by year-end.  </P> <P> Good performances by action-adventure films such as "Marked for Death" and  "Memphis Belle" and the continued popularity of "Ghost" have kept ticket sales  from lagging in recent weeks.  </P> <P> The year-to-date total hit $3.92 billion over the weekend, compared to $3.97  billion for the same period last year, Daily Variety reported Tuesday. In 1988,  the total at the same juncture had hit $3.51 billion.  </P> <P> The top 10 movies of the weekend grossed a total of $33.1 million, off 9% from  the previous weekend's take of $36.3 million. The gross was also down 14% from  the $38.5 million taken in by the top 10 last year, when "Look Who's Talking"  set a fall weekend record of $14.1 million.  </P> <P> For the week, the domestic box office for all movies in release reached $75.6  million, off slightly from the $77.2 million grossed in the same week a year  ago. In 1988, the same week produced ticket sales of $54.6 million.  </P> <P> "Marked for Death," which has earned $28.9 million in 17 days for 20th Century  Fox, will face stiff competition for the top spot next weekend when Paramount  releases Stephen King's "Graveyard Shift."  </P> <P> Universal's steamy "White Palace," meanwhile, may perform well as it goes into  wide release. The romance-comedy, starring Susan Sarandon and James Spader,  grossed $1.1 million at just 99 screens in its debut last weekend.  </P> <P> "Ghost" will probably pass Disney's "Pretty Woman" around Halloween as the  year's most popular film. "Ghost" has pulled in $172.2 million for Paramount,  and "Pretty Woman" has grossed $177.2 million.  </P> <P> Five other releases have topped $100 million in ticket sales this year: New  Line's "Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles," with $133.1 million; Paramount's "Hunt  for Red October," with $120.7 million; Carolco's "Total Recall," with $118.3  million; Fox's "Die Hard 2," with $114.1 million, and Disney's "Dick Tracy,"  with $103.7 million.  </P></p>

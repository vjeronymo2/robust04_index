Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GRETZKY BOOK PRINTED IN BRAILLE  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings, long a promoter of the Canadian  National Institute for the Blind, made sure that his recent autobiography was  printed in Braille.  </P> <P> Gretzky sponsors an annual celebrity softball game in his hometown of  Brantford, Ontario, to raise money for the institute, and it was at his  suggestion that the Canadian version of his book was made available for blind  readers.  </P> <P> The bulky, three-volume Braille edition of "Gretzky: An Autobiography" was  introduced Wednesday by Gretzky during a news conference at the blind  institute's office in Ottawa. The book will sell for $24.95, the same price as  the print copy.  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds catches cold The message from chemicals companies gets bleaker by the day. Like BOC on Tuesday, Courtaulds sees no sign of an upturn. In addition to the cyclical pain, it is suffering renewed pricing pressure in some of its most profitable markets. The proximate cause is the credit squeeze instigated by the Chinese government, which has led to surplus capacity worldwide in products ranging from viscose fibre to cigarette tow. Yet it is a measure of the fragile balance that such incidents are destabilising. While consumption in developed markets remains stagnant - and price rises are elusive - chemicals companies will be vulnerable to nasty shocks. How long the China syndrome will last is unclear. On a rosy view, the credit squeeze will prove a hiccup in an otherwise uninterrupted pattern of growth. China has resumed buying acrylic fibres in recent weeks. The worry is that low-cost Asian producers which switched output into profitable markets such as US viscose will be loath to retreat even when China returns. Courtaulds would then have to live with lower margins. Exciting long-term prospects such as Tencel - Courtaulds' new fibre - cannot deliver earnings growth unsupported. Whatever the eventual outcome, Courtaulds faces a tough year. The company continues to squeeze the most out of its existing business. The proposed joint venture with Hoechst in fibres should bring another slug of turnover for Courtaulds' management to get to grips with. The hope must be that another round of provisioning will carry it through 1994, by which time cyclical recovery may at last be within reach. Yesterday's 9 per cent fall in the shares suggests the stock market is unwilling to look that far ahead.</p>

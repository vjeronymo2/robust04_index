			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Investa seeks protection from debts INVESTA, a non-listed Norwegian investment company, yesterday sought protection from its creditors which are owed NKr3.4bn (Pounds 408m) as the crisis in the country's financial sectors deepened. The move inspired a 4.2 per cent fall in the Oslo bourse which closed 14.11 down to 318.89. Den norske Bank A shares, the country's biggest bank, fell 32 per cent to NKr2.50. The decision to seek protection comes six days after Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, collapsed into the hands of state administrators with debts of NKr3.6bn. Of Investa's debt, NKr2.8bn is in short-term unsecured loans in the form of debt notes and certificates which the holding company can no longer service. Investa's domestic investments include property, shipping and listed securities, and a 34 per cent stake in Euronav, a French shipowner. Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, said it had loan exposure of NKr1.085bn to Investa companies. Of the total, Christiania has loans of NKr460m to Investa's holding company, NKr500m to Investa subsidiaries - of which it has collateral valued at NKr425m - and a commitment of NKr125m to a company controlled by one of Investa's owners, secured by stock in the Investa group. Den norske Bank said it had loans of NKr920m to the Investa group, of which NKr280m was to Investa's holding company. Mr Jarl Veggan, a DnB spokesman, said equity was left in Investa and the bank was confident it would retrieve loan payments. He said Investa had said its holding company had an estimated net value of NKr600m. Investa said yesterday: 'The background for this decision is the current crisis in the short-term money market, partly caused by Uni Storebrand's suspended payments.' Ms Janne Gro Rygg, a finance ministry spokeswoman, said the Uni Storebrand crisis could have inspired caution in the short-term lending market and influenced the financial future of other companies. Investa said debt negotiations would have no immediate consequences for its subsidiaries but several creditors had called in loans of the holding company.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by General 'Umar Al-Bashir, president of the </F> Republic of Sudan, in Shandi, marking Sudan's 38th independence  anniversary -- live]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate; praise be to God and peace and prayers be upon  the best of the prophets, our lord Mohammed, and all his kith  and kin.    My dear compatriots; my family and tribe in Shandi; peace  and  God's mercy and blessings be upon you. It is, brothers and  sisters, a unique moment in which we meet on this blessed day --  the day of the anniversary of Sudan's independence -- with the  masses of Shandi. [passage omitted]    The believer, brothers and sisters, does not seek refuge  except in Almighty God. He does not kneel except to Almighty  God. He does not ask anyone except Almighty God. Also, after  gaining real independence, we do not seek refuge or kneel before  anyone except Almighty God.    We ask nothing from anyone or from any state. It is because  we only ask this from Almighty God. We are not asking anyone or  any state for strength, because strength belongs to God the all  powerful. [passage omitted] Our slogan is self-reliance; we  should eat what we grow and wear what we make. [passage  omitted]    On this day we salute our people's valiant and victorious  forces currently deployed at the locations of operations,  presenting one martyr after another and wounded after wounded in  order to preserve our independence. Salutations to them while  they are irrigating the land of the south with their blood so  that the land may sprout dignity and honor. Salutations to them  while they are protecting our independence, land, honor, and  dignity.    Salutations on this day, brothers and sisters, to the  unified  police officers and men who in the past stood in support of the  national movement, and who are now standing with their armed  forces in defense of honor and land, and in protection of  independence. Salutations on this day to our farmers who have  liberated our decision and preserved our independence by the  cereals they produce to protect the dignity and honor of the  Sudan. Salutations to our farmers who have transformed our  slogans -- that we should eat from what we farm -- into the  reality we are living today. [passage omitted]    From this rostrum I give directions for setting up a  national  committee to review and write the history of the national  movement so that our own generation and the coming generation  will learn about the struggle of our forefathers, the leaders of  the national movement, so that they can receive their  appreciation. [passage omitted]    Brothers and sisters, our people had to make some stops  during crucial moments of their unity stand which led to the  independence of Sudan. But after independence some of our  leaders became preoccupied with worldly matters. They fought  one another and were busy gathering booty, distributing gains  and struggling for power. They squandered our independence and  they neglected our decision-making; they squandered our land to  let the mutineers sieze it. They neglected our people so much so  that they began to beg for charity and aid. But while the  leaders of this country were being complacent, the revolution  surged forward, either a revolution led by the army and  supported by the Sudanese people, or a revolution led by the  Sudanese people and supported by the armed forces. This has  been the case until, brothers and sisters, the revolution of  national salvation came to be, and it was led by the army. It  was supported by all the members of the Sudanese nation, who  stood behind it and who pushed it forward . The revolution of  national salvation came to restore the real meaning of  independence. It came in order to realise independence.    Then we began to call for self-reliance. The Sudanese people  did not fail us. Almighty God did not fail us after we rejected  all the threats of the West and its aides, after we rejected all  the temptations of the forces of haughtiness and colonialism.  We prayed to Almighty God, asking for reinforcement and help  and relief. We all looked up to Him. He did not fail us. He  provided us with ample relief and abundant production, as a  result of which we managed to realise self-sufficiency, liberate  our decision-making and realise our independence. [passage  omitted]    We recalled Almighty God's words. We remembered His words  and we said: For us, God is sufficent, and He is the best  disposer of affairs. [Chants of "God is Great"]    We turned to your sons and brothers in the armed forces,  provided them with equipment and military supplies and called  for the formation of the People's Defense Forces. All that was  in obedience to Almighty God's order to provide them with all  possible power and supplies. Your sons and brothers took part  in crossing operations [as heard]. These operations were a true  crossing over from the state of defeat to victory, weakness to  strength, degradation and defeat to dignity and pride. The  sword of the crossing pounded the rebel battalions and was the  cause of terror amongst the enemies of Almighty God.    The salvation revolution came to rebuild Sudan, to restore  the glory and dignity of the Sudanese people, to put Sudan back  into its normal place as leader and imam of the peoples of the  world. [passage omitted]    We are looking to build Sudan, a Sudan with honor and pride.  We must overcome all difficulties to achieve this noble aim  because the road to gaining self-respect and pride is not easy  but is full of hurdles, obstacles and thorns. But our honorable  people can overcome all the difficulties, all the hurdles and  all the obstacles. [chants of "God is Great," and "There is no  God but one God"] [passage omitted]    We have also gone to the oilfields which the previous  governments placed as a hostage in the hands of the American  Chevron Company. The salvation revolution came to liberate  Sudan's oil. Work has now begun in earnest to extract and  refine Sudan's oil.    Brothers and sisters, in order to build Sudan, we must also  build an infrastructure of roads in order to connect the  different parts of the country and facilitate the movement of  people and goods. The Defiance Highway, the artery of the  north, the western Salvation Highway, the Peace Highway, the  Salvation Highway from Madani to Manaqil, the Halfa-Sab'at  highway, all these, brothers and sisters, are now being  constructed with purely Sudanese efforts.    Life is also being returned to the railways, that vital  artery, and work has been carried out to build airports in Port  Sudan, Dunqula and Al-Fashir. There has also been work to adapt  ports and build new ports, like the expansion of Port Sudan and  the ports of Sawakin and Usayf. [passage omitted]    Brothers and sisters, on the anniversary of independence we  should recall the lofty stances taken by the Sudanese people, in  all its factions. The Sudanese people were united in the  realization of self-autonomy and the signing of the  self-autonomy agreement. We should salute the memory of our  leaders on that date -- the end of 1955 -- 19 December; the day  when the Sudanese people forgot all their tribal and party  differences; when the word for the Sudanese people was united,  when the decision on independence was declared from inside  parliament. These are the stances which we should recall  because all this achievement was realized thanks to the unity of  the word and the rank. Had God willed that we should continue  in that unity we would today be in a different position to our  current one, and we would be in a different situation to our  present situation.    But the leaders, following that great achievement, became  disunited. Sudan's identity was lost. Sudan's interests were  lost. We lagged behind, until the salvation revolution came to  restore national unity and reunite the Sudanese rank, and to  invite all -- after we had placed all our trust in Almighty God  and after we raised the banner of "There is no God but God" --  to unite and close our rank to build the new Sudan.    Today I call on all the sons of Sudan to forget all our old  differences, all our party, sect, tribal, and regional  differences, so that we talk together and join together behind  the banner: There is no God but God and Mohammad is the  messenger of God. [passage omitted] [Chants of "God is great"]    Brothers and sisters, on this day we must not forget peace  and the call for peace, and we must call on our brothers, whom  time and the enemies of Sudan have exposed to danger, to let us  talk together and to sit down with us to hold a dialogue for the  sake of peace in order to restore the unity of Sudan and bring  peace to all the Sudanese people. We want this day to be a day  of peace, and this year to be the year of peace in which peace  is attained, Almighty God permitting. We want peace for all the  people of Sudan and we want peace for Sudan with all its  neighbors and brothers. We do not interfere in anyone's affairs  nor do we plot against anyone. We only declared our  independence and our independent decision. We want to build our  Sudan, relying on ourselves, Almighty God permitting.    We also call on all peoples of the world to work for peace  and call for peace, to work for the good of humankind and to  assure the future of their sons, to develop humankind and  underdeveloped regions and those peoples who are bowed under the  burden of backwardness, hunger and ignorance.    Greetings on this day to our brothers in brotherly Iraq. We  praise their steadfastness and their stand against arrogance.  We praise them and pray that they become victorious. We wish  them consolidated victory, God willing.    Greetings to our brothers in the Libyan Jamahiriyah while  they resist colonialism and the new sanctions imposed on them.  We do not forget, on this day, to urge our brothers in  brotherly Yemen to forget their disputes and to safeguard their  trusteeship.    We must also remember on this day our brothers who are being  exposed to mass liquidation -- our brothers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    This is a living example of man's injustice toward his  brother mankind. This living example is an example of human  rights' violations in the heart of Europe, which accuses us of  violating human rights. Our brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina are  undergoing ethnic cleansing, not for committing any mistake or  crime other than saying: There is no God but one God, Mohammad  is the Prophet of God. And they accuse us of persecuting people  of other religions.    Also, greetings to our brothers in Somalia for their  steadfastness and stand which forced the colonizing powers to  leave Somalia.    Greetings to the people of Palestine and the sons of  Palestine, to the revolution of rocks and the children of rocks  who stood up against the Zionist enemy, made him bow, humiliated  him and made him sit down for negotiations.    You have heard through the media that we have asked Britain,  the colonizing state, to recall its ambassador in Khartoum  because he interfered in and encroached on what did not concern  him, and he forgot that today we are celebrating the 38th  anniversary of the exit of his people, who were expelled and  alienated, not to return, God willing.    Brothers and sisters, we wanted it to be a lesson for them  and a lesson that we are independent and will not permit anyone  to harm our independence. [passage omitted]    Brothers and sisters, my family and kinsfolk, I greet you  and  hope that we will continue to meet on the path of inimitable  achievement. God is great, and all power to Sudan. Peace be  upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.</p>

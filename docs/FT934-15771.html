			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Japan adapts its winning strategy to soccer: Companies such as Nissan, Mitsubishi and Sony have turned their attention to packaging the world's favourite sport. Charles Leadbeater, accustomed to the terraces of English grounds, goes to a J-League match and gets a surprise THE MASSED bank of Yomiuri Verdy fans were in full voice, waving a host of green flags, urging on their team against their bitter rivals, the Nissan Marinos. But as they chanted - 'Verdy, Verdy' - one of the oddities of Japanese soccer became fully apparent. It was not simply that their chant had a pleading, rather than a threatening, tone - it was also a question of pitch. They sounded like rejects for the Vienna boys choir. Most of the Yomiuri Verdy fans were teenage girls. In only six months, a craze for soccer has reached epidemic proportions in Japan. A year ago, hardly anyone watched the game. Now, it is threatening to dislodge Japan's stodgy baseball as the nation's most popular sport. Most matches are sold out. People have moved house to be within the catchment area for season tickets and - most alarming for Japanese men  - young housewives are reported to have become so fascinated with its fast-moving skills that they have stopped clearing up after evening meals until half-time. Amid the worst Japanese recession for 20 years, the launch of the J-League this year has created from scratch a consumer market worth perhaps Y140bn. (Pounds 87m) Soccer players have become part of the regular diet of Japan's popular weekly magazines. The rise of the 10-team J-League has been a telling demonstration of how the Japanese industrial strategies, which took it to world leadership in cars and electronics, can be applied to sports. The J-League is a case study in how a sport can be turned into a big business, through a partnership between the public and private sectors that combines entrepreneurialism and central planning. Even if Japan falls short of its ultimate goal - to become a force in the world's most popular sport - the success of soccer has turned on their head long held European assumptions about the game, as well as confirming one central truth. The truth is that the most important ingredient in professional soccer is not the players, not what happens on the pitch, but the crowd. Japan has cheerfully overturned the British assumption that soccer is an outlet for men to indulge anything from harmless obsessions and boyish fantasies to violent rages and racial prejudices. In Japan soccer matches are not tribal contests but entertainment. And most of the excitement does not come from events on the pitch - the quality of the soccer is often mediocre - but the atmosphere generated by the dancing, screaming, flag waving, horn hooting crowd. The carnival atmosphere is no accident as Hisao Kinoshita, the executive at advertising agency Hakuhodo responsible for soccer, explained: 'We set out to make a soccer game like a disco, lots of vivid colour, lights, fashion, music.' The disco atmosphere has not detracted from the game. On the contrary it has been a huge motivation according to Gary Lineker, the former England star playing for Nagoya Grampus 8: 'The crowd is the best thing about the game. Wherever we play the games are sold out and the crowd is not at all cynical. They view the whole thing as positive, even if you are three nil down they still get behind you and to be honest I have found that really refreshing.' Lineker admits that at the end of his career with London's Tottenham Hotspur, a top English team, his motivation for league games was flagging. A few months playing in Japan has revived his spirits. For anyone who has trodden fearfully through the turnstiles at a British ground, endured 90 minutes of boredom and escaped relieved to be in one piece, a trip to a Japanese soccer game would be a revelation. At the Verdy-Marinos game, the 60,000 crowd was mainly young and mixed: about 40 per cent of J-League spectators are women. They create a wall of noise and colour even when the only entertainment is the Marino's dancing mascot, an escapee from Disneyland - a giant chicken dressed as a sailor captain. The start of the game is announced by a booming American presenter and a giant video screen, which replays the most exciting moments. At half time people queue politely for the toilets and refreshments. At the end the crowd files out in good humour, without dropping much rubbish, let alone hinting at violence. In England many clubs have proudly launched 'family enclosures' to attract parents and their young children. In Japan the entire stadium is a family enclosure. The game's popularity, especially among young people, is in large part a reflection of the paucity of choices available to them. Baseball is a sport mainly for men over the age of 30. Sumo is popular but tournaments are months apart and tickets are expensive. Soccer on the other hand allows young people to get out of their cramped family homes and do things that are difficult in Japan: shout at the top of your voice and display emotion in public. The players provide unfamiliar and attractive role models. In Japanese companies people are promoted according to their seniority; in soccer it is performance that counts. The Japanese respect authority, especially when it comes in uniforms; soccer players publicly dissent from it by shouting at the referee. Sumo and baseball both promote a monosyllabic stoicism among their stars, success is underplayed and defeat suffered as humiliation. Soccer players are outspoken and revel in the publicity their love affairs and garish clothes attract. So the popularity of soccer is one more bit of evidence of the change of social values under way in Japan. Baseball symbolises the values of collective discipline that helped Japan to succeed after the second world war. Soccer represents new values, as Kinoshita explained: 'We asked young girls what soccer meant to them: they said it meant freedom. Baseball players can only play baseball and within the game they have specific tasks  -pitching, first base - which they have to stick to. Soccer players can run all over the field and off the field they are treated like film stars.' However, the J-League's success is also due to a well-planned strategy, which combines several elements familiar in Japan's rise in other business fields. At the outset there was an entrepreneur with a vision: Saburo Kawabuchi, a former player in the Japanese national team who persevered with his idea for the league when many, including Dentsu, the country's largest advertising agency, told him it would fail. Kawabuchi has done for soccer what the likes of Akio Morita of Sony did for electronics. He provided it with high ambition. He says: 'We thought that unless we aimed for a high ideal it would not be worth it. If we had attempted to achieve our goals in a gradual way it would have been natural but I do not think it would have worked.' The next step was to promote carefully planned co-operation in the name of competition. The companies that owned the 10 amateur teams increased their commitment. Toyota backs Nagoya Grampus 8; Mitsubishi the Red Diamonds, while Verdy is backed by Yomiuri, the publishing group. Most teams needed a cash injection of about Dollars 20m to improve their stadiums and to set up reserve and youth teams. But the league also insisted upon local involvement, to create a public private partnership. Kinoshita explained: 'We wanted it to be a citizens' game. Not focused on Tokyo but based in the regions.' So at Kashima, 45 miles north of Tokyo, home of the Antlers, winners of the league's first stage, the local council brought together about 20 companies, led by Sumitomo Metals, to back the team. Private money is being used to upgrade public facilities. Another vital ingredient, which played a central role in earlier Japanese successes, is an unashamed borrowing of foreign technology. The on-field technology has come in the form of balding, greying, injury prone and aging stars such as Lineker, Pierre Littbarksi from Germany and a clutch of Brazilians led by the legendary Zico. Alcindo, the Brazilian who is the league's main goalscorer, has become a national hero. But most important, the Japanese went to the US for the commercial technology off the field. The J-League is following the American National Football League, which controls the design, marketing and sales of items related to its member teams. All J-League teams have songs and mascots, emblems and a package of goods - caps, bags, waterproofs - in a homogenous style designed by Sony Creative Products and pitched at 15-25 year olds. Sony has opened 105 shops to sell the merchandise and Mizuno, the sportswear maker, has opened a further 627 mini-boutiques to sell outfits. Soccer has provided companies with a new route into the youth consumer market, while the companies have provided soccer with the chance of long term success. The J-League's corporate backing means it will probably avoid the fate of the North American Soccer League, which signed stars like Pele and Franz Beckenbauer but eventually collapsed. For the J-League to endure the standards of play will need to improve, to match world standards. That will require further investment in foreign expertise while Japanese production gets up to international standards. Yet even so the Japanese national team is still in with a good chance of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup. Japan also needs investment in better grounds. Some, such as the national stadium in Tokyo, are larger than anything in the UK premier league. Most are small, former athletic tracks, where most of the crowd stand. By 1996 work must start on 12 stadiums with a capacity of more than 40,000 if Japan is to host the 2002 World Cup. Lineker for one expects that year's World Cup final will be played in Tokyo. The patient long-termism of Japanese companies will be crucial. With the heavy investment involved, it will take at least five years for the 120 companies backing the league to start making a profit. Less certain is the commitment of Japan's new-found fans, the game's main asset. The risk is that the younger sisters of all the teenage girls going wild about Verdy will in years to come desert soccer for other crazes. The J-League's organisers claim to have age on their side. The Ministry of Education has been promoting soccer in elementary schools for 20 years so most young Japanese - male and female - have played soccer at some point in their youth, only to give up the sport for lack of a developed adult game. The J-League is designed to provide them with a focus for an adult interest in soccer. Japan's strategy is all part of its internationalisation. Sumo reinforces its sporting isolation, while baseball is a reflection of its special relationship with the US. Soccer is a way of Japan announcing it wants to be part of a wider international sporting community, just as its desire for a permanent seat on the United Nations' security council symbolises its wish to play a wider role in international politics. Those wider political responsibilities will bring risks that Japan is ill-prepared to shoulder: putting its troops in places where they could be killed, for one. Japan's international soccer ambitions could also create confrontations for which it is not ready. When the day comes, later this decade, for England to play Japan in Tokyo, what will the adolescent Japanese choir make of it when its polite chorus of 'Nippon, Nippon' is met by a rousing English war cry from the throats of thousands of fans bred in Chelsea's Shed, Arsenal's North Bank and Millwall's Den? Britain should once again be ready to learn from Japan. Not about making cars or video recorders but, this time, about soccer and its culture. World Cup showdowns Page XIV</p>

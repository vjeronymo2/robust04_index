			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Eduard Shevardnadze: `There Is No Problem Between the </F> Georgians and Abkhazians Which We Cannot Solve'" -- ITAR-TASS  headline; by unidentified GIA-TASS correspondent]    [Text] Tbilisi, 22 Jun -- The process of achieving a  peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia is, naturally,  of great significance for Georgia but, at the same time, it is  an important factor in stabilizing the situation in the northern  Caucasus as well, Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze  said at a news conference today.    As for the political status of Abkhazia, noted Shevardnadze,  we can look at any proposal by the Abkhazian side within the  framework of a united and indivisible Georgia. We are willing  to grant Abkhazia the kind of status that would be in line with  the highest world standards.    Commenting on the recent Georgian-Ossetian talks in  Vladikavkaz, Shevardnadze gave a positive assessment of their  results, which have made agreement possible on the issues of the  reopening of transport links, the movement of people on the  territory of the conflict zone, joint work to combat crime, etc.    Regarding conflicts in other regions of the Caucasus and the  Karabakh problem in particular, the head of state said that the  success of the peacekeeping mission in Abkhazia could well  stimulate positive processes in Karabakh as well.    Analyzing the causes of the tragedies that have befallen  Georgia in recent years, Shevardnadze said that they followed  from the incorrect and erroneous policy toward Russia chosen by  Georgia after the break-up of the USSR. He stressed that it was  because of this policy that the country had become totally  isolated, which had led, in particular, to the loss of Abkhazia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has disclosed a guideline for  deregulation measures to be mapped out before the end of June.  The guideline focuses on such fields as importing procedures,  authorization system, and distribution rules. As tangible  measures, the guideline calls for review of 51 regulations in 16  categories, including a step-by-step abolition of the  Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, a removal of ban on holding  companies, and expansion of farmers' direct rice supply to  consumers. The government intends to hammer out drastic  deregulation plans to relax Japan-U.S. trade frictions through  liberalization of the domestic markets and correction of  disparity in Japanese and international prices. However, some  ministries are likely to oppose implementation of the  comprehensive deregulation guidelines.    The deregulation guideline is prepared as the foundation for  intragovernment negotiations to finalize deregulation measures.  The guideline is roughly divided into two sections on  distribution and import regulations. Subjects for policy review  add up to 27 regulations in 10 categories of distribution rules,  and 24 regulations in six categories of importing rules. On 12  and 18 May, the guideline will be introduced to government  agencies by the Administrative Reform Promotion Council's  Subcommittee for Promoting Imports, Improving Market Access, and  Reforming the Nation's Distribution System.    Regarding the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, which is  provided for protecting smaller retail stores from new  large-scale stores, the government has relaxed opening-hour  restrictions for large-scale stores effective 1 May. However,  business circles are calling for abolition rather than  relaxation of the law. Under such circumstances, the government  decided to study possibilities of future abolition of the law on  a step-by-step basis. Since changes in business-hours  restriction must be coordinated with local watchdog bodies, the  government intends to remove the rule from the books. Local  legislation authority for controlling the size of new retail  stores will be limited by the revised law in this connection.    With respect to restriction on establishment of holding  companies, the government intends to abolish Article 9 of the  Antimonopoly Law so that venture companies and financial  institutions can open new businesses more smoothly. If the ban  on holding companies is lifted, companies would become able to  smoothly found or merge subsidiaries depending on their business  strategies. While the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is wary of  the system because it may give excessive market controlling  power to major companies, Western multibusiness companies are  demanding the holding company system in Japan.    The government is also planning an early abolition of resale  price support contracts for pharmaceutical and beauty products.  In 1992, the FTC reduced items for resale price support  contracts from 51 to 26. At that time, the price support system  was left for such products as lipsticks, lotion, and cold  medicine until the next policy review in 1998, but the  government intends to frontload the policy review.    In addition, the government plans to deregulate self-service  in gas stations and farmers' direct rice sales to consumers.    Before the end of June, the government is supposed to work  out a package of deregulation measures to "promote imports,  improve market access, and reform the nation's distribution  system," as well as those to deregulate the "housing and real  estate" and "telecommunications" sectors. Deregulation is being  promoted in view of not only U.S. demands for market  liberalization, but also the Japanese business sector's wish for  removal of all business restrictions.</p>

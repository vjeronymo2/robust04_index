			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "NATO Looks East"] </F>   [Text] For the first time since the Cold War began, the  American administration appears to accord greater priority to  its relationship with Russia than with the nations of West and  East Europe. This approach is embodied by President Clinton's  proposals for the future of the Atlantic Alliance, which he will  present to the NATO summit in Brussels next week. For fear of  agitating nationalist elements in Russia--and thus jeopardising  President Yeltsin's reform programme--the former Warsaw Pact  countries are to be denied any immediate prospect of the  security guarantees they covet. Instead of clear criteria for  eventual membership of NATO, they are to be offered the far  vaguer "Partnerships for Peace." This consolation prize will be  available to all former Warsaw Pact countries, irrespective of  their ultimate suitability for membership.    There are excellent reasons for rejecting the notion of  granting every East European state immediate admission to NATO.  One of the foremost lessons of modern history is the folly of  offering security guarantees which the guarantors lack both the  means and the will to implement. But, as the East European  nations emerge from the shadow of their communist past and  democratic societies evolve, they deserve every encouragement to  believe that the West will welcome them into the fold.    We have always urged that the European Community should  adopt  a more positive policy towards trade with the east. Yet  Washington's current policy, however well-intentioned, threatens  to undo many of the gains of the democratic revolutions of 1989.  Not only is it unwise to predicate the security of such  countries as Hungary upon events in Russia, where democratic  development is far less certain; it even seems unlikely to  succeed in its own flawed terms. To "defeat" Mr Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy by stealing some of his clothes--as the New Year  message from the Kremlin seemed to imply--is no basis for the  future stability of the continent.    Moreover, to concede Russia droit de regard in East Europe  will strengthen, rather than weaken, irredentist elements.  Partly because of a consistent "Russia first" policy towards  the region, hardline forces of the military-industrial complex  are now stronger than at any time since the collapse of the  Soviet Union. Yet the precedent of German re-unification within  NATO suggests that a determined American policy to extend the  zone of stability eastwards is not merely reconcilable with  Western interests; it would also enable democrats in Moscow to  tell the neo-communists and Slavophiles that Western policy  offers no choice but continued reform, or renewed confrontation.  The present American approach simply offers Mr Yeltsin an easy  way out vis-a-vis the parliament. They know that Mr Clinton will  support them, come what may.    None of this is to suggest that Russia should be  quarantined; even the Polish foreign minister has asserted that  a democratic Russia is the best guarantee for European  stability. But the question is how best to bring this about.  We have persistently argued that the example of prosperous and  free neighbouring states would do as much as anything to steer  Russia's development in a positive direction. The nations of  East Europe are far likelier to maintain this course if a  realistic prospect is opened up of eventual full partnership  with the West. NATO remains the only viable structure for  assuring their security. For, important as the European  Community is in economic terms, it is still--in the words of the  Belgian foreign minister during the Gulf war--a political dwarf  and a military worm. Mr Clinton's performance on his first  visit, as president, to Europe will be as vital as those of his  predecessors in the Cold War epoch.</p>

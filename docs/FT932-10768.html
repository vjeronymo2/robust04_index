			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Drug charges 'above costs' ABOUT HALF of the drugs dispensed to patients cost the NHS less than the standard prescription charge of Pounds 4.25, the government has admitted. Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said in a Commons written answer that 'an estimated 50 per cent' of prescribed items dispensed by community pharmacists and appliance contractors would cost the NHS less than Pounds 4.25 in 1993-94. The British Dental Association yesterday called for the re-introduction of free check-ups in response to the government's review of dentists' pay. But it would mean some people paying for treatment at rates agreed with their dentist - which Labour said could mean higher charges.</p>

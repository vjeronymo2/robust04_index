			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador to Washington,  has told U.S. Senator John Kerry that Colombia is not a  narcodemocracy and that our economy is not controlled by drug  traffickers. In a letter, Silva refutes the statements made by  influential U.S. Senator John Kerry against the Colombian  Government and legal system that were published in THE  WASHINGTON POST.    The ambassador said: The Colombian Government has made  enormous sacrifices to defend its democracy, so it is hasty to  say that Colombia is a narcodemocracy.    Referring to the Cali Cartel's alleged control over some  areas of the economy and media, Silva said organized crime tries  to infiltrate certain areas, just as it does in the United  States, but the government and legitimate businessmen in those  sectors do not tolerate it.    Another part of the letter stated: The abolition of  extradition is a sovereign decision made by the Constituent  Assembly, elected by the people.    In conclusion, the ambassador admited that the government  has  and will continue to have differences with the prosecutor  general, but he emphasized that government branches cooperate  and are independent.</p>

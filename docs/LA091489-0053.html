			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACING AT DEL MAR;  </P> <P> AT LAST, LADY LUCK SMILES ON DRAG RACE  </P> <P> Halfway through Wednesday's $372,100 Del Mar Futurity, Drag Race was in trouble  again.  </P> <P> It was nothing new for the dark brown gelding, whose recent races had been  marked by one disaster after another. His trainer, Steve Miyadi, was up in the  stands, thinking to himself, "Oh no. Not again."  </P> <P> "I had run out of excuses," said Miyadi, who was 0 for 12 at the beginning of  Del Mar's closing day. "No one was going to believe me anymore about this  horse."  </P> <P> This time, however, Drag Race proved good enough to overcome even his own bad  luck. With Futurity longshot specialist Frank Olivares in the saddle, Drag Race  ran down the tenacious filly Rue de Palm to win the one-mile event by 2 1/2  lengths at odds of 13-1.  </P> <P> Rue de Palm held on for second, a neck ahead of the fast-closing Single Dawn,  who had enough trouble of his own to keep jockey Alex Solis up nights for a  week.  </P> <P> But if any horse deserved a break, it was Drag Race. The Kentucky-bred son of  Darby Creek Road had run in five races before the Futurity, winning once for a  $50,000 claiming price and running in the money in three stakes, most recently  a second in the Aug. 23 Balboa Stakes.  </P> <P> In each of those stakes placings, fraught with traffic problems, Miyadi became  more and more convinced that not only did he have a very nice young horse, he  was also the only one left who believed it.  </P> <P> "Just me and Frankie kept the faith," said Miyadi, a former assistant to Mike  Mitchell. "I had people asking, 'Where you running him next? For $50,000?' I'd  tell them I was pointing for the Futurity and they'd just look at me."  </P> <P> Drag Race and seven other Futurity entrants were supplemented at a late fee of  $10,000, making its total purse the largest ever offered at Del Mar. With 12  running, the winner stood to earn $241,600.  </P> <P> Although the race appeared wide open, fans went for the Wayne Lukas-trained  entry of Rue de Palm, Sanford Stakes winner Bite the Bullet and the  $1.25-million Nevada, sending them off at 4-5. Jack Kent Cooke's Single Dawn,  making only the third start of his career, was second choice at 4-1.  </P> <P> Graduation Stakes winner Chime Song broke quickly from his No. 11 post and led  the field into the first turn. Rue de Palm cruised along in second, getting a  trip reminiscent of her impressive score in the Sept. 3 Del Mar Debutante.  After a quarter of a mile, Drag Race had only two horses beaten.  </P> <P> Olivares began his move on the backstretch, but he found himself behind a wall  of horses at the half-mile marker.  </P> <P> "The last thing I wanted to do was drive him up in there and then get stopped  again," said Olivares, who won the 1977 Futurity aboard the 71-1 shot Go West  Young Man.  </P> <P> "So I just eased him back a little and went around," the jockey went on. "He  never broke stride."  </P> <P> Of course, it looked a lot worse to Miyadi.  </P> <P> "Looking back, Frank made the right move," he said. "But my first reaction was,  'Well, maybe everyone will see his trouble today.' "  </P> <P> Olivares let Single Dawn sweep past on the outside and then followed the tall  chestnut into the final turn. With three furlongs remaining, Drag Race took off  and swung around Single Dawn, setting his sights on the leaders.  </P> <P> As Drag Race rambled past, Single Dawn was stopped cold by retreating horses  who had been burned out on the pace.  </P> <P> "I tried to go between horses and was shut off," Solis said. "He's such a big  horse, it took him a sixteenth of a mile to get in gear again."  </P> <P> Single Dawn did well to make it close for second, but he was no threat to Drag  Race.  </P> <P> "I get on this horse in the mornings when he works," Olivares said of the  winner. "He's always shown me a lot. It was just a matter of finally getting  lucky."  </P> <P> Drag Race paid $28.80, $7.40 and $5.20. The Lukas entry returned $2.80 and  $2.40, and Single Dawn paid $3.40. Drag Race ran the mile in 1:35 2/5, the same  as Music Merci's clocking last year.  </P> <P> "I was the underbidder on Music Merci," noted Miyadi, who purchased Drag Race  at California's 2-year-old sale in March for $21,000. "Of course, people don't  usually believe you when you say that."  </P> <P> Miyadi bought Drag Race for Kazumasa Yano, a Japanese bloodstock agent and  thoroughbred farm manager.  </P> <P> "He's my kind of owner," Miyadi said. "First he let me buy this horse, then he  let me geld him the next day. We weren't after a stallion for that kind of  money. We wanted a racehorse."  </P> <P> They got one, but it took awhile for Drag Race's luck to catch up with his  ability.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Ron McAnally wrapped up his second Del Mar training title early Wednesday when  Flippable won the third race. McAnally edged Wayne Lukas and Charlie  Whittingham with a total of 17 wins. . . . The percentage leaders of the  meeting were Bill Spawr (11 for 43) and Dave Hofmans (8 for 30), both at 26%. .  . . Eddie Delahoussaye won two races closing day to win his first Del Mar  title, 44-42, edging Laffit Pincay. . . . On the Line, winner of two stakes,  was voted horse of the meeting. . . . Survive won the $60,750 June Darling  Stakes, the closing-day supporting feature. . . . Jack Wood, who has been Chris  McCarron's valet for the last 10 years, has polished his last boot. Wood  retired at the end of the Del Mar meet, but he will stay active by training a  few horses. . . . Also retiring was color man Frank Smothers, who has kept  thousands of racing silks straight for the past 20 years. Smothers' most  cherished souvenir is the cap Bill Shoemaker wore when he broke John Longden's  record for most winners in 1970. . . . Del Mar became the first meeting of the  inter-track betting era to post an increase in on-site attendance, up almost 3%  over 1987 figures. Overall handle was up 9% at $7.3 million a day.  </P></p>

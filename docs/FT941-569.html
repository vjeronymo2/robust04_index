			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rumours of right wing win lift Milan by 3.5% Bourses rallied, but some brokers were wary about the quality of yesterday's gains, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN, with voting continuing in the general election, was boosted by unfounded rumours that the right-wing coalition had won sufficient votes to form a clear majority. Domestic buyers were extremely active, swelling turnover to near record levels, as the BCI index settled up 23.79 or 3.5 per cent at 693.52. Preliminary estimates suggested that screen trading reached a record, at L1,400bn. Screen trading currently accounts for 80 per cent of business. With exit polls not officially available until the close of voting late last night, the market's positive mood was driven by speculation, brokers said. A win for the right wing groupings would certainly provide a short term boost to equities, they added, given that such a result had not generally been forecast. Aside from election fever the only other story of interest yesterday was confirmation that Stet and Siemens of Germany had signed an accord to form a telecommunications partnership. Stet closed up L333 at L5,470 and Sip L300 at L4,638. FRANKFURT rose on domestic news, extended its gains during part of the afternoon and subsided towards the end, in line with an early wobble on Wall Street. The Dax index was 31.36 higher at 2,161.42 on the session, and hit 2,176.06 in the post bourse before closing the afternoon at 2,167.72. Turnover inched up from DM7.6bn to DM7.7bn after Friday's DM3bn fall. Mr John Blackley of James Capel said that share prices were spurred by inflation figures, first from Bavaria and then for western Germany as a whole. 'The bund future was trading 30 basis points lower, and very weak,' he said, 'then Bavaria came in with a 2.8 per cent year-on-year inflation rate, the bund future moved to 10 points up, a gain of 40 points in two minutes, and the Dax followed it higher.' The index gains were driven by carmakers, with BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen all up more than 2 per cent on the session. Siemens tried to keep up, rising DM11.50 to DM708.5 on its deal with Stet but it lost ground to close at DM706.50 in the London afternoon. AMSTERDAM recovered all of Friday's losses and then gained more ground as a number of companies came out with good news, and internationals performed well. The AEX index improved 4.10 or 1 per cent to 410.93. The chemicals stocks did well with Akzo pulling back some of last week's losses, the shares adding Fl 3.90 to Fl 218.50 and DSM improving a further Fl 1.20 to Fl 130.20. The Opec agreement gave Royal Dutch a rise of Fl 1.30 to Fl 191.80, while Reed Elsevier advanced Fl 3.10 to Fl 169.50 on news that it had acquired a French group specialising in exhibition organisation. KLM, up Fl 2.60 at Fl 46.70, was helped by expectations that its share issue had been heavily subscribed. PARIS found little to support a significant upward move and the CAC-40 index finished 7.87 higher at 2,144.49. LVMH put on FFr14 to FFr858. The group was recently upgraded by James Capel, which expected earnings growth of around 25 per cent per annum in 1994 and 1995, based on higher turnover, better operating margins in the champagne division and a drop in interest payments. ZURICH went bargain hunting and the SMI index closed 30.6 higher at 2,862.4. It was led higher by financials; there was hope that Swiss March inflation data could lift the market today, and in the meantime UBS bearers topped the active list as they rose SFr28 to SFr1,228. Chemicals rose ahead of Ciba-Geigy's annual news conference in London today, Ciba by SFr13 to SFr915, Sandoz by SFr40 to SFr4,050 and Roche by SFr85 to SFr7,090. MADRID saw some mild profit-taking by domestic funds looking for end-quarter capital gains as the general index slipped 2.07 to 327.32 in low turnover of Pta21.67bn. Banesto dropped Pta63, or 7.8 per cent to Pta750 after Saturday's shareholder approval for the Bank of Spain-sponsored rescue plan for the company. WARSAW fell nearly 5 per cent and brokers expect the downward trend to continue. The WIG index lost 873.4 to 17,646.3 with volume rising 18 per cent to 1.6m shares. ISTANBUL was encouraged by the better than expected result for the coalition of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in local elections at the weekend. The composite index added 5 per cent, gaining 678.07 to 14,214.19. The market is now waiting for the government to announce details of an austerity package. TEL AVIV's Mishtanim index rose 12.89, or 6.45 per cent to 212.68 in trading shortened by the Passover holiday, on reports of progress in peace talks with the PLO. The market peaked at almost 260 early in February but it was described then as overvalued, and subsequently upset by an investigation into alleged stock manipulations. ATHENS fell nearly 2 per cent as selling which began last week gathered pace. The general index closed at 1,040.54. in turnover estimated at Dkr5bn.

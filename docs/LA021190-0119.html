			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE EMERGENCY OF PARAMEDIC USER FEES  </P> <P> Your photo (Jan. 30) showing the women being transported from the scene of an  accident in Costa Mesa to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana via helicopter is a  perfect example of the sad state of the health-care "system" in the county.  </P> <P> If you are the unfortunate accident victim in the cities of Newport Beach,  Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, Westminster or Costa Mesa, it is likely that  you will have to be flown to Santa Ana -- not only because we lack a trauma  center here but also because the traffic system is too congested and  unpredictable. So beware to all those who travel in the northwest section of  the county!  </P> <P> PAT McCABE  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

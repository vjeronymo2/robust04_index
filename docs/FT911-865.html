			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Fumbling for the keys to long-locked doors - Political Notebook WHEN Mrs Margaret Thatcher travelled north to the Scottish Conservative party's conference in Perth four years ago it was to launch her triumphant campaign for the 1987 general election. Triumphant, that is, in England. Four weeks later her party secured a majority of 100 at Westminster. Its representation in Scotland was halved to just 10 of the 72 seats. Tomorrow, Mr John Major will follow not so much in as around her footsteps. He will pledge to preserve her legacy while defending his decision to sink the poll tax flagship she launched on the Clyde. He will be as staunch as his predecessor in his defence of the Union, but will signal that he intends, unlike her, to be a prime minister who can safely walk the streets of Scotland. After last week's local election results in England and Wales, he cannot promise a general election majority of one hundred seats. But his hope is that a different brand of Conservatism will prevent the party's extinction north of the border. There is talk that, for the first time since 1979, the Tories might, just might, actually win a few more seats in Scotland. There are risks as well as opportunities for Mr Major. Just as Mrs Thatcher's departure has allowed English cabinet ministers to peer into previously darkened corridors, so too some in the Scottish party are fumbling for the keys of long-locked doors. The most important, and most firmly bolted, is marked Devolution. It is a word that Mr Major's predecessor ordered struck from the party's political vocabularly, but one that remains on the lips of 80 per cent of Scottish voters. The mere mention of an Edinburgh assembly by some party officials - notably Michael Hirst, president of the Scottish association - provoked a storm from the loyalist right. The Young Conservatives, who seem to believe that the party has failed in Scotland only because it has not been sufficiently Thatcherite, has launched a pre-emptive 'Scotland is British' campaign. In typically eloquent language, it says that the Scottish Constitutional Convention - which the Tories have boycotted - is seeking to turn the country into a 'mini-Albania where socialism reigns supreme'. Mr Chris Patten has found himself charged by Scottish members of the No Turning Back Group (leading supporter Scottish Office Minister Mr Michael Forsyth) as the architect of a plot to persuade Mr Major to ditch the Union. Judging by the mood of some of the right-wing activists at yesterday's proceedings, that charge will be laid against anyone who admits to even thinking about the subject. But in a party which has seen its base shrink dramatically since 1979, the activists and the diehards have become almost synonymous. Evidence from the opinion polls is that Tory voters - and many more have been prepared to admit their allegiances since Mr Major entered Downing Street - believe that now the key has been turned in the lock, the door cannot simply be slammed shut again. They find it strange that in Scotland, the Conservatives are forced to suppress the sense of national identity that sustains the party south of the border. Their understanding of history is more acute than that of their more outspoken activists - the 1707 Act of Union that is supposedly so sacrosanct to the Young Conservatives provided for substantial self-government. A prime minister who has promised not to lecture but to listen to the voters will find it hard to ignore the views of the four-fifths of the Scottish population who want stronger representation in Edinburgh. Nor does Mr Major share the centralist instincts that forced Conservatism and devolution into conflict during the 1980s. Mr Ian Lang - and Mr Patten - ruled out again the assembly with tax-raising powers sought by the opposition parties in the Convention. They were careful, however, not to dismiss entirely the prospect that the reorganisation of local government in Scotland into single-tier authorities could leave a gap for some form of national representation in Edinburgh. If Mr Major wants to win votes in Scotland he might be wise to do the same. If he wished, the prime minister might even quote Mrs Thatcher: 'The establishment of a Scottish assembly must be a top priority to ensure that more decisions affecting Scotland are taken in Scotland by Scots.' Her words, spoken in Edinburgh in 1975, were probably drafted by Mr Patten, then a humble central office speechwriter.</p>

Who Is Supporting Us in International Cooperation  for Protection of Nature'']    [Text] One of the priority areas of the foreign  policy of the Republic of Moldova is international cooperation  in the area of environmental protection. Moldova is joining in  the activity of international environmental protection  organizations and is participating in the implementation of the  corresponding conventions and agreements. To do this, an  Administration of International and Social Relations has been  created under the State Department for Environmental Protection  and Natural Resources, and under the National Institute of  Ecology--a Bureau of International Programs and Projects. The  solutions to problems of international cooperation of the  Republic of Moldova in the area of environmental protection is  discussed by a chief specialist of the State Department for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Valeriy  Bricag.    The concrete results of the state department's international  activity were the ratification by the parliament of the Republic  of Moldova of the Biodiversity Convention and the endorsement of  such important documents as the World Charter on Nature, the  Convention on Crossborder Impact of Industrial Accidents, and  the Convention on Protecting the Animal Kingdom and the Natural  Environment in Europe. Moreover, in July 1993 the parliament  adopted a decree on the creation of a National Autonomous Center  of the Republic of Moldova in the International System of  Information on the Environment (INFOTERRA), which gave us access  to the World Environmental Data Bank.    It should be noted that in international cooperation in the  area of environmental protection, preference should be given to  concluding bilateral and regional agreements at the state level.  The endorsement of international conventions should take into  account, on the one hand, the republic's financial and technical  capabilities and, on the other, the interests of the state and  the world community. Both state and nonstate organizations can  enter international environmental protection organizations.  Cooperation with international funds, organizations, scientific  centers, and financial structures should include primarily the  development and implementation of national ecological projects.    As early as 1990, the State Department for Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources came out with an initiative to  conclude agreements at the level of environmental protection  organs of the Union republics. This activity has been  continued--draft agreements have been sent to all the  independent states of the former USSR. But not all of them have  shown a readiness to cooperate at this level. Only the first  protocol has been signed between the State Department for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic  of Moldova and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of  Ukraine.    The Interstate Ecological Council (MES), which anticipates  cooperation among the CIS countries, was formed in February  1992. But the Republic of Moldova did not sign the document to  enter the MES. Moldova has not been represented at a single  session of the MES. But a department worker participated in the  work of the group of experts for preparing for the first session  of the MES, and another one participated as an observer in the  work of the first meeting of the Coordination Group under the  MES for cooperation with UNEP [United Nations Environment  Program] and other international organizations. This group was  formed by a decision of the third MES session, which took place  in Tashkent in May 1993, and its goal is to coordinate the  activity of the MES member countries for creating specialized  organs for cooperation with the UNEP and other international  organizations, and also for developing and implementing joint  ecological projects under the aegis of the UNEP.    In the former USSR, the role of a specialized organ for  cooperation with international environmental protection  organizations, including UNEP and the World Bank, was assigned  to the Center for International Projects (TsMP) under the Union  State Committee for the Protection of Nature. The CIS countries  decided to take advantage of the experience of the TsMP and, on  its basis, to create a consultative-executive organ of the  coordinating group under the MES.    Thus, the CIS countries developed their own mechanism for  interstate and international cooperation, but it is too early to  judge its effectiveness. In October of this year, an official  appeal was addressed to the chairman of the parliament of the  Republic of Moldova from the secretariat of the MES, considering  the entry of the Republic of Moldova into this organization. I  think we should get rid of our excessive suspicion regarding all  structures created within the framework of the former USSR.    Representatives of Russia are working in many international  organizations. The Russian lobby is very influential there. This  could have decisive significance for us--the success of our  cause will depend on the position of one or another  representative of an international organization. Joint entry and  coordination of activity will help incline international  organizations to support our country. The TsMP is making a  commitment to render assistance in international support for  Moldovan ecological projects and is also prepared to help in the  organization of a similar center in our republic.    We are losing a great deal as a result of delay in solving  these problems, and we are being left out of the picture. Thus,  the British company Alexander Jib and Company has monopolized  the right to develop and implement the project for protecting  the basin of the River Prut, which will enable it to dispose of  funds allotted by the World Bank.    Our relations with Romania are being arranged on the basis  of  the Protocol on Cooperation between the State Department for  Environmental Protection of the Republic of Moldova and the  Ministry of the Environment of Romania. In keeping with this, a  Romanian-Moldovan commission was formed for working together in  the Prut basin. But there has been no marked success in this  area. Cooperation is limited mainly to unilateral aid from  Romania. Financial and technical aid has been rendered to the  Moldsilva Association and the National Institute of Ecology--for  forestry and radiological research on the territory of Moldova.    Following the lines of cooperation within the framework of  international conventions, we will have to solve difficult  financial problems. Thus, Moldova has not joined the Geneva  Conference on Crossborder Air Pollution over Large Areas. The  reason is the lack of hard currency to subsidize measures within  the framework of the Convention. As for the Vienna Convention on  Protection of the Ozone Layer, not joining it has entailed  serious consequences for our economy. Starting in 1994,  international sanctions and bans will be introduced on exports  and imports of freon-emitting items. The corresponding sanctions  will be applied to countries that have not joined the Washington  Convention on International Trade in Species of Wild Flora and  Fauna That Are Threatened With Extinction.    In this connection, it must be noted that countries of the  former USSR have the opportunity to join these conventions by a  simple confirmation, announcing this to the corresponding  depository with an official government note. The same thing  pertains to international organizations of the UN system. And if  we are still not cooperating with such well-known organizations  as the UN Environment Program (UNEP), the United Nations  Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the UN Center for  Human Population (HABITAT), the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO), and others, this is because of our  inefficiency and sometimes simply because of our ignorance of  the procedures for addressing, joining, and entering them.    A center for international programs and projects would help  to eliminate this information gap and establish permanent  contacts with dozens of international funds, organizations, and  centers that would be extremely useful to our country. For  example, the Regional Center for Environmental Protection in  Central and Eastern Europe (REK) in 1994 allotted $600,000 in  financial aid to nongovernmental organizations engaged in the  development and implementation of environmental protection  projects. And through the DZhYeF [expansion not given] Fund of  the World Bank, $208 million is being allotted just for projects  within the framework of the Convention on Biodiversity. In order  to participate in these projects, we must either make a request  for financing our projects or submit an application to enter the  REK, MSOP, and so on. But here, as they say, we have fallen  slightly behind.    For the sake of clarity, I will give some other facts. Just  during the past two years, Ukraine has been able to organize the  participation of its specialists in seminars financed by the  governments of the United States and Poland, and the World Bank,  for training specialists in the area of ecological projects and  programs. The United States, additionally, finances the Center  for Ecological Education and Information formed in Kiev. Canada  has allotted to the Ukraine $3 million for a program for saving  the Dnieper River. The Know-How Fund from England renders the  Department for the Introduction of International Projects  consulting aid in the implementation of 13 projects for  ecological restoration of Ukraine. The World Bank has already  allotted to the country about $1 million for carrying out  projects in the Carpathian preserves and the Danube Delta, and  the European Community is financing the development and  introduction of a system of monitoring, legislative acts, and  standards.    Summing up what has been said, I must note that the State  Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of  the Republic of Moldova has adopted a number of measures to work  in the main areas in which our country should cooperate in the  area of environmental protection. Specialists of the state  department are participating in the implementation of a program  for protecting the Danube River and a program for ecological  restoration of the Black Sea basin. Materials are being prepared  for entry into the International Union for Protection of Nature  and Natural Resources and the Regional Center for Environmental  Protection in Central and Eastern Europe. Negotiations are being  conducted with representatives of international organizations to  hold the international fair Eco-94 at the beginning of next  year, and with representatives of the international convention  for one called the ``Role of Information in Overcoming the  Ecological Crisis in Countries of the Former Socialist Camp  During the Period of Transition to a Market Economy.'' Lists of  international conventions and agreements that are of primary  significance to Moldova are being systematized and prepared to  be submitted to parliament.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Crackdown on data crime Tougher penalties for selling confidential financial information obtained by deception - such as details of a company's bank account - were approved by the Commons last night. Conviction on indictment could result in a maximum term of five years' imprisonment and a fine under a Lords amendment to the criminal justice and public order bill which was approved by MPs. However, a Lords' amendment to make selling confidential financial information a criminal offence was rejected. Mr David Maclean, Home Office minister, said the proposed amendment went beyond recommendations to counter unjustified invasion of privacy made by the committee headed by Sir David Calcutt. However, he suggested that it might be necessary to return to the rejected amendment if some of the Calcutt proposals were not introduced. The government secured a majority of 33 to reject a Labour attempt to make it an offence to provide information obtained by deceit even if it was not sold. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour spokesman on city affairs, referred to advertisements offering to find out a person's bank balance for Pounds 250. Mr Darling complained that the provisions introduced by the government would not prevent information being obtained in written form so that no infringement of the Data Protection Act would be involved.</p>

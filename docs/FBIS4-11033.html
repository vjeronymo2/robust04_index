			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza today  received a Chinese Government delegation in the South Hall of  Government House. The secretary general and the Chinese leaders  discussed the possibility of increasing our exports to China and  the decision to encourage new and constructive bilateral  relations.    Eduardo Bauza later admitted the possibility of increasing  our exports to the PRC, which is a very favorable market for  Argentina.    [Begin Bauza recording] They are in the middle of an  important opening and modernization process. This is a very  important delegation because it is headed by one of the most  outstanding members of the Chinese Communist Party. Their visit  is within the framework of this new Chinese opening to the  world. Our current trade exchange with China is not very large.  It involves about $270 million in imports from China and  approximately $250 million in exports to China per year. Their  market has great unexplored potential. China has more than 1.1  billion inhabitants compared with 30 million here, so their  market may be entirely favorable for us. [end recording]    Asked about other markets for our products, Bauza said other  countries are members of the southeastern Asian region because  of their development and their purchasing power. [sentence as  heard] Bauza said he believes Argentina is growing up and going  out into the world to offer its products.    The Chinese delegation is headed by Hu Jintao, a member of  the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo and a deputy of  the Chinese National People's Congress. The delegation includes  (Li Semin), (Tan Iongui), and (Liu Pein) who are the directors  of the Latin American International Liaison Department of the  Chinese Communist Party.</p>

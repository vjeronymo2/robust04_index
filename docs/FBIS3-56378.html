Is U.S.  President Bill Clinton Prepared To Share It with the Russian  People?"]    [Text] Moscow -- If we take a look at the outward aspect  of the visit, it was arranged in the best traditions of "warm  hat and suit" diplomacy. The "walkabout" included some curious  details: The U.S. President looked in at a store which sells, in  addition to fish and meat, the widely advertised U.S. slimming  products called Ultra Slim Fast, which fact usually perplexes  quick-witted foreigners -- if the Russians do not have enough  money for food, are they really prepared to shell it out on  dietetic substitutes? In the bakery, which the inquisitive guest  from across the ocean also visited, a mass of people were  standing in line for bread. Clinton pulled rubles from his  pocket and asked for a long white loaf. But his political  flexibility is evidently complemented by an equally quick  personal reaction, for he unhesitatingly took the saleswoman's  advice: "Take the black bread, it is fresher."    Moscow was the only stop on Bill Clinton's current tour  where  he dispensed with impromptu gastronomic shows. In Brussels  there was a visit to a cafe, and in Prague a portion of  schnitzel with a glass of beer in a small restaurant, while in  our country he had to make do with supper at "Ogarevo," where  the Yeltsins served caviar, pickled mushrooms, elk meat, and  suckling pig around the family table.    As for political delicacies, these too were provided for in  the program of the visit. Reformers of various kinds were  invited to meet with the President for the first time. Let us  leave without comment the statement by Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who was  not invited to Spaso House: "He is a coward. He is afraid of  me." On the other hand, the appearance of 25-year-old banker  Maksim Travkin, who was taken to be the representative of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, at the lofty gathering did  not go unnoticed. Nor was it a coincidence that Anthony Lake,  adviser to the U.S. President for national security affairs,  spent a whole half-hour talking with Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader  of the Russian Communists.    Finally, even after the visit to Moscow, Boris Yeltsin's  policy of reforms, which the U.S. President supported publicly  and fervently, should be expected to have a big question mark  over it with many people in America -- congressmen, scientists,  and experts. At the final news conference one of the U.S.  journalists asked Boris Yeltsin: Maybe the "shock" therapy  ought to be eased somewhat, mindful of the high price the people  of Russia are paying for this? "No," the president replied  curtly. There will be no indulgence. He implied that even the  loss of public support in the last elections will not turn the  Kremlin away from tough measures. This statement by the Russian  president was at once publicly applauded by the U.S. consultant  and adviser Jeffrey Sachs, who believes that it certainly is not  the "shock therapy" but panic that is to blame for the  calamitous situation in the Russian economy. When the panic  ends, economic stabilization will supposedly begin. But  Professor S. Cohen, the well-known political scientist, thinks  differently. "I do not know how to describe what B. Yeltsin's  government has been doing in the economic sphere since 1992 --  'shock therapy' or something foolish," Cohen said on strolling  around Tishinskiy Market with a CBS-TV presenter. "For the  people we see hear this policy has meant the loss of all their  life savings and a disastrous drop in living standards. I am  afraid that President Clinton has not discerned the real Russia  in the time he has spent in Moscow. The real Russia today is  more like this flea market." Let us stay silent on the flea  market, but it is correct that our political leapfrogging is a  kind of "shock therapy" for Washington.</p>

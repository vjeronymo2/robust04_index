			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITING A LOVE LETTER IS EASIER THAN YOU THINK  </P> <P> This Valentine's Day, try something a little more daring than a box of  chocolates. Write a love letter to someone you love, or to someone you hope  will love you back.  </P> <P> "Love letters are never out of style," said Susan Polis Schutz, co-founder of  Blue Mountain Arts, a Boulder, Colo., greeting card company. "Everyone needs to  communicate honestly. Often it's easier to do it in writing."  </P> <P> Writing a love letter -- to some, a terrifying prospect -- may be easier than  you think, Schutz said.  </P> <P> "I know I find it a lot easier to write my feelings down, especially about  love," she said.  </P> <P> A letter can be more honest; some people are too embarrassed to speak their  feelings. You can think about it in advance, and rewrite it as many times as  you want. And a letter can be saved.  </P> <P> "For the receiver, it is very nice to get a letter because it's something you  can see and hold for a long time," said Schutz. "A conversation goes into your  heart, but you can't see it later."  </P> <P> Don't sweat over trying to find just the right style, she recommends.  </P> <P> "Just write it and, if it expresses what you think, fine. Don't be afraid of  what style it is, or what others will think or who will judge it. The purpose  is to express your feelings. And that's the only purpose."  </P></p>

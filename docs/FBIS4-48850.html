			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Meles Zenawi on the third anniversary </F> of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, EPRDF,  at Meskel Square in Addis Ababa--live]    [Excerpts] Dear Ethiopian people, I would like to express  my heartfelt pleasure on this auspicious third anniversary of  peace and democracy, which has come at a time when we are close  to establishing a lasting democratic system, and when we have  reached the last phase of the transitional period. [passage  omitted]    The registration of voters and candidates for the  Constituent  Assembly has been carried out, and candidates are already in the  process of campaigning, with the help of the government media.  The necessary documents, ballot boxes, and the process for  transporting them is successfully underway. It is expected that  the elections will be carried out fairly, freely, and in a  democratic manner, in the presence of local and international  observers. 16 million people have already been registered as  voters, out of the 22 million who are eligible to vote, so  around 72 percent of our eligible voters have registered.  [passage omitted]    What remains now is the process by which the people will  elect those who will represent them in the Constituent Assembly.    A Constitution will be adopted by the Constituent Assembly,  and a new democratic government, based on this Constitution,  will be set up. this process is expected to be finalized by the  middle of next year. [passage omitted]    The government has taken steps to improve production in the  trade and industrial sectors. Those obstacles which had been  hindering the development of the economy's industrial sector  have been removed, and government institutions have been  encouraged to operate at a profit through improved management.  Our factories were saved from closure by being supplied with  adequate foreign currency from the government for the purchase  of raw materials. [passage omitted]    In this year's budget, the industrial sector has shown 9.9  percent growth: trade and transportion have grown by 3.7  percent, and the social services' sector has grown by 10.3  percent. Although the amount of land under cultivation has  increased by 11 percent, agricultural production has gone down  by 5.2 percent, due to inadequate rainfall. Since the country's  economy is dependent on agriculture, which in turn relies on  long rains, if there is inadequate rainfall in one year it will  not only affect the agricultural sector, but the entire national  economy. [passage omitted] Moreover, more than 6.7 million  citizens are faced with famine, and thousands of animals have  been affected. [passage omitted]    I would like to extend my deepest gratitude, and that of the  Ethiopian people, to various donor countries and nongovernmental  organizations, for their relentless life-saving missions.

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: Jakarta gets Pounds 65m tied loan from UK MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday signed a Pounds 65m concessional loan to Indonesia to fund a 65MW power station to be built by a UK company in Samarinda, East Kalimantan. The contract for the project has not been awarded but, under the terms of the loan, it must go to a British company. Mr Hurd rebutted suggestions that, by tying the aid, the UK government was undermining the principle of free trade. British exports to Indonesia grew 58 per cent to Pounds 312m last year, while Indonesian exports to the UK rose 29 per cent to Pounds 536m. 'Of the substantial exports markets for Britain, last year Indonesia grew faster than any other to the UK,' Mr Hurd said. Officials say the loan is a belated effort to promote UK companies in an Indonesian sector in which Dollars 30bn of new investment is planned in the 1990s. Indonesia hopes one-third of the investment will be by private companies which will build, own and operate power stations linked directly to the national grid. Mission Energy of the US is expected to resume negotiations later this month for two 600MW units, worth Dollars 2bn, of the Paiton private power project. Industry officials say British Gas is considering investing in private power schemes, possibly taking a stake in a proposed 400MW, Dollars 450m station in Serpong, West Java.</p>

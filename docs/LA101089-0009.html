			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER FEES  </P> <P> The front-page story, "Top Lawyers Get $400 an Hour as Fees, Salaries Rise" by  Ted Rohrlich (Sept. 18) may leave some readers with the impression that all  lawyers are commanding fees in the range presented by the story's headline.  </P> <P> While the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. does not object to any of the facts  cited in Rohrlich's report, the association believes that it is just as  important to let the public know that most attorneys do not earn these kinds of  salaries.  </P> <P> The association believes it is important to note, while reporting on the  salaries of the highest paid lawyers, that the number of lawyers who earn in  excess of $100,000 a year constitute a very small minority of those in  practice. The great majority of lawyers work in offices of 10 or fewer  attorneys, and a sizable portion work as sole practitioners representing  individuals with relatively small, but nonetheless real problems.  </P> <P> The association hopes to dissuade readers of The Times story from painting all  lawyers with the same broad $400-an-hour brush. Those individuals have reached  a pinnacle of success enjoyed by few, and certainly do not represent the  majority of lawyers in our country.  </P> <P> HARRY L. HATHAWAY  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> L.A. County Bar Assn.  </P></p>

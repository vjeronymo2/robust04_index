			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Govett Strategic Trust calls EGM to take vote on survival GOVETT STRATEGIC Invest-ment Trust, the small and medium companies specialist with total assets of about Pounds 400m, has called an extraordinary general meeting to propose that its life be extended. A simple resolution 'That the company continue in existence' will be proposed at an EGM on September 23, and requires a bare majority to be passed. The resolution dates from a change in the company's articles in December 1991 under which shareholders were given the right to vote on the liquidation of the trust at the 1993 annual meeting and at subsequent three-year intervals. The poor performance of small company shares and a high level of gearing caused Govett Strategic immense problems after the 1987 stock market crash. In each of the financial years 1987-88 and 1990-91 the trust's net asset value fell by 44 per cent. Shareholder dissatisfaction led to the 'smoking fuse' clause in December 1991, designed to help narrow the discount to net assets at which the shares traded. At the same time, managers John Govett were given a performance-related management fee, based on their ability to outperform the FT-A All-Share Index. Govett Strategic's board argues that the trust should continue because: the trust's performance has shown a significant improvement both absolutely and against the All-Share. signs of recovery make this an inappropriate time to liquidate the trust. In any case, the costs of liquidation would be substantial, especially given that some Pounds 95m of debentures, which are trading above par, would have to be redeemed. the management agreement with John Govett has been renegotiated and is likely to cost less than the current arrangement. Under the current arrangement, Govett gets 0.375 per cent of total assets per annum, plus a 0.125 per cent performance-related fee. The new scheme would give Govett 0.5 per cent of equity assets, but only 0.125 per cent of bond assets. the trust can use its reserves to at least maintain the total dividend for the next three years.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Country home sales revive INTEREST IN the sale and purchase of country houses revived as the recovery in the general housing market has spread, says a survey published today in Country Life magazine. The market for country homes, particularly in south-east England, fell in the late 1980s and early 1990s as recession took its toll. The magazine says losses at Lloyd's forced families to put ancestral homes on the market. Country Life says most of the houses advertised in the magazine have come on the market 'because of the three Ds: death, debt and divorce'. A study of its advertising indicates, however, that a revival may be under way. It says that after a slow start to the year the number of advertisements has risen sharply in April compared with the same month last year. The rise in advertising has continued this month and is expected to carry on in June. Studies by the magazine indicate that there has been an increase in sales. It says the rate of turnover of houses in Surrey is double that in the corresponding period in 1988, when the housing market was at its peak. Foreign buyers have rescued the market for large homes in London. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the estate agents, estimated that 70 per cent of their sales were to overseas buyers. The magazine says lower prices mean the proportion of houses for sale at less than Pounds 250,000 has risen to 28 per cent compared with 18 per cent a year ago.</p>

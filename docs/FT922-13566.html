			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / The Lex Column: ADT In one sense, ADT's 1991 annual report and accounts represent a welcome break with the group's mysterious history. Not only is there information in abundance, but it is of much better quality. The obvious inference is that Laidlaw, ADT's main and disgruntled shareholder, insisted on improved disclosure along with four non-executive directors as the price for settling their long-running dispute. In broad terms, ADT's main businesses look healthy enough, so investors may not be too shocked to learn that in a year when pre-tax profits fell by 44 per cent, the five executive directors took a 12.5 per cent pay cut and still earned nearly Dollars 1m on average. Rather less gratifying, however, is the fresh light shed on ADT's past profligacy. Its expensive stakes in Christies and Lep aside, easily the nastiest example is the group's acquisition two years ago of Britannia Security which, it appears, was based on thoroughly misleading asset valuations. For a paper deal worth a mere Pounds 105m, ADT now claims to have written off as goodwill the sum of Dollars 278m. This is the kind of mind-boggling accounting which suggests Laidlaw still has work to do.</p>

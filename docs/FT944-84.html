			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Five resolutions for the new year - In the Pink / John Train has some tips on the art of successful investing John Train is chairman of Montrose Advisers, investment counsel in New York. His latest book, The Craft of Investing, has just been published by HarperCollins. There are no sure ways to make money on the stock market - but here are some suggestions. 1. Watch the company, not the stock. A stock does not flutter hither and thither like a butterfly. When a company is prospering its profits rise, its dividends rise with them and, infallibly, its stock will rise to follow. The question is not if, only when, which is unimportant. Most investors follow the prices of their stocks anxiously in the financial pages instead of poring over each company's reports to see if its profit margins and return on capital are staying healthy, whether it has interesting new products coming down the pipeline, and if it is re-investing cash flow for growth. Some inane people hang on to a stock that fell after they bought it. Their aim is to wait until it regains the purchase price - and then sell it. You often hear someone say: 'I'm waiting to sell until I can get it even.' Unfortunately, the stock does not know what you paid for it and might not recover at all. Or, when it does, it could be a better buy - because of re-invested earnings - than it was originally. Women seem fond of this manoeuvre. I suspect they think of a disappointing stock as an unfaithful lover. After disappearing for a while, it dares to stick up its head again. 'Take that, you cur]' cries the lady, swatting it with her handbag, so to speak. Obviously, the limit of irrationality is to sell your stock in a good company just because it has gone down. 2. Take the long view. Surtout pas de zele is an excellent rule. The big money in a portfolio is usually made by a few companies that go up and up, year after year, until they have made their owners rich. There are exceptions but, basically, that's how it is done. They have to be long-term growth companies, of course, or else there is no reason for them to go up. An easy definition of a growth company is that its business is good enough so that it can re-invest its cash flow for an internal rate of return of 15 or 20 per cent. That is such an attractive proposition that its owners will not want it to pay out high dividends. Now, there are many ways to get shaken out of a good position: the stock seems over-priced; your broker calls with a hot tip; or you got discouraged by dull price action. The essential fallacy, though, is to have a trading mentality at all. Don't] You can do splendidly through inactivity within a consistent growth philosophy. 'Market timing' rarely works. You will, probably, be out of stocks at a major bottom when, amid universal gloom, the tremendous snap-back comes. The Dow doubled in six weeks in the summer of 1932 as banks crumbled and brokers falling from high windows darkened the sun. 3 Do not fret about economics. Investors who are not informed fully on the companies in which they own stock usually dwell instead on economics and Great Questions such as: 'Who will win the next election?' or 'Which way will interest rates go?' Alas, almost all Great Questions fall into one of two categories. First, many are unknowable. Second, those that are knowable are probably factored into the market price already. In the course of writing books on outstanding investors, I discovered that they rarely talk among themselves about economics or Great Questions but, instead, almost always about specific companies. I asked Peter Lynch, the prodigiously successful manager of the Magellan fund, how much time he spent on economics. 'A little less than 15 minutes a year,' he answered. Some categories of investment professional, such as Swiss bankers, are expected to know about many stocks in each of a number of different markets. That is an excessively difficult assignment, so they prefer to turn the conversation to politico-economic trends in those countries. It is a way of satisfying a client, but seldom leads to superior performance. 4. Leave currencies alone. My clients often ask me: 'Should we buy Chilean stocks on the chance of a revaluation in the peso?' or 'Is the yen overpriced?' Here are two thoughts. First, for a good company, a devaluation is essentially a unilateral wage reduction - which cannot be all bad. How does Glen McGargle Whiskies Ltd cope with a weak pound? It maintains its dollar price but fails to raise wages correspondingly. So, its margins and profitability improve. The stock price should rise to offset the weaker currency. How about just holding cash or equivalents in the currency you think will rise? Investors often forget that the interest rates paid on bank deposits or short-term bonds already reflect the market's judgment of the outlook. Suppose I think that the new Brazilian real will gain against the Argentine peso. Fine - but the interest rate on peso bonds should be correspondingly higher than on the real. Over the years, I have known very few currency services offered by banks, brokers or funds, and available to retail investors, that actually made money over long periods. 5. Remember that investment opportunity is the difference between the reality and the perception. If the prevailing view of a company or a situation generally corresponds to the truth of the matter, then there is no investment opportunity. Yet, most people forget that and buy popular stocks in good times, which means they pay too much. So, for 1995, resolve to buy only stocks that are neglected or else misunderstood for reasons that, in turn, you understand. That way, you will seldom over-pay. The odds will be on your side.

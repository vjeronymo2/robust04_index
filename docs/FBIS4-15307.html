			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 5, RIA -- "The signing of  Georgian-Abkhaz documents in Moscow on Monday laid the basis for  future full-scale negotiations in Geneva on April 19," said Igor  Akhba, Abkhazia's plenipotentiary representative in Moscow. In  the political statement signed in Moscow, the Georgian and  Abkhaz delegations acknowledged the existence of issues  "pertaining to the sides' mutual competence" and demanding the  division of powers, in Geneva, the main problem -- Abkhazia's  political status, will be tackled.    Igor Akhba confirmed that the Abkhaz side was ready to  deploy  an international un peace-keeping contingent, above all from  Russia, on its territory. But, he said, the maintenance of  security and order on our territory is the internal affair of  the Abkhaz state and will be decided by means of Abkhaz own  law-enforcement bodies.</p>

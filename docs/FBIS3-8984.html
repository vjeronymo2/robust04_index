Major, who will be making his first visit to the Bosnian  capital, is going to Sarajevo to show his support for the  British general commanding UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a  spokesman for Major's office said in London.    Major will meet Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose in  Sarajevo, and will also travel to the central Bosnian town of  Vitez -- headquarters of British UN troops serving in Bosnia --  the spokesman said.    In Split, Major was expected to meet Yasushi Akashi, special  representative of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, said  a spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    Major's visit comes a week after London announced it would  send an 900 more soldiers to the former Yugoslavia, bringing to  more than 3,000 the number of troops it has in the region.    Britain is the second largest contributor, behind France, to  UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslavia. French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur on Sunday visited the northwestern Bosnian town  of Bihac.    Major visited Bosnia previously in late 1992.    Earlier Thursday, a UN special envoy announced that the  Bosnian government and Bosnian Serbs had signed an agreement to  open roads and partially lift the two-year-old siege of Sarajevo.</p>

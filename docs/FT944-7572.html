			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Steady recovery predicted for next two years The economy is improving in an 'uncharacteristically smooth manner', with steady recovery predicted for at least two more years, according to the latest quarterly forecast from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Nevertheless, the private research group questions whether this means that the UK has achieved any real economic miracle. It suggests that the healthy combination of low inflation and fast growth simply represents 'the response that might be expected' in a recovery in an economy that has just experienced a 'deep recession where balance sheet difficulties were prevalent'. Overall, the institute has now revised its forecast for output growth for 1994 up to slightly over 3.5 per cent. This is higher than its forecast of 2.9 per cent growth made in the early summer, but still below most City forecasts. Nevertheless, Mr Garry Young, UK economist at the institute, yesterday pointed out that the forecast had been made before the publication of official figures last week which showed that gross domestic product in the third quarter of this year grew at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent. He added that the forecast would probably be revised further upwards. Growth for next year is expected to fall to 2.75 per cent, due to a presumed slowdown in the North Sea oil and gas sector. The institute's underlying inflation forecast has been revised down, and is now 2.8 per cent for next year compared with its previous forecast of 3.8 per cent. The institute notes the main reason for this was low growth in labour costs. However, it also credits the government, noting that there is an 'increase in the credibility which we expect to be attached to the commitment by the monetary authorities to keep down inflation'. Although the institute does not expect interest rates to rise to the levels assumed by the markets, it nevertheless predicts that the authorities' tight anti-inflation stance will help the exchange rate profile to stay broadly constant. This is in contrast to its previous forecast, which assumed that sterling would steadily depreciate. National Institute Economic Review, November 1994.

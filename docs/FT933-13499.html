			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Creating snow in Asia ACER SNOWMEC, a British company that has developed and patented a method of creating snow for indoor winter sports facilities, has negotiated its first international Snowcentre in Singapore. The indoor ski and leisure centre, to be built on the island of Batam, will be financed by a private developer as part of a Pounds 1bn leisure complex. Phase I of the main development is already completed and the Snowcentre is expected to be operating by the end of the year. The snow is created by firing a mixture of water and compressed air into an atmosphere of between -3'C and -10'C to produce snow crystals. A patented thermal storage system reduces capital and running costs to commercially viable levels. The project is likely to be the first phase of larger project, with negotiations for similar Snowcentres throughout the Asia Pacific region at an advanced stage.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Welcome for BP figures FOURTH-quarter results at the top end of market expectations, an impressive post-results meeting between British Petroleum management and oil sector analysts, and a fresh wave of US buying drove BP shares up to their best level for 12 months. The stock, after 20m shares traded, closed 11 1/2 , or 4.3 per cent, higher at 277 1/2 p, easily outpacing a generally buoyant oil sector, itself up 2 per cent, and the wider market, where the FT-SE 100 finished 0.6 per cent ahead. Specialists said Mr David Simon, who took over the role of chief executive last summer, delivered a very impressive performance, telling analysts that BP was meeting its recovery plan targets and that there were no plans for a rights issue until the group had reached its target of profits of Pounds 500m a quarter. Although much of yesterday's buying was again US-sourced, UK institutions were also said to have been picking up the stock to reduce their underweight positions. Some analysts, however, remain cautious about BP's rehabilitation. Mr Keith Morris at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said 'BP is a recovery story for 1994, not 1993', while long-time bear Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull, pointing out that gearing remained around 100 per cent, said: 'There is a surfeit of enthusiasm over experience; they are far too expensive.' Rank gloomy A gloomy outlook from Rank Organisation during separate presentations to two broking houses did little to help the shares, which fell back in thin trading. Rank management was said to be giving no chance of recovery in the leisure sector in 1993, with an upturn not seen until the final quarter of 1994. The remarks were considered pessimistic even by Rank's cautious reputation in the market and the shares fell 17 to 689p. However, hints that Rank would consider eventually exiting from its joint venture with Xerox brought some cheer, as did brighter trading news on the US, according to analysts. Trafalgar cash call Shares in Trafalgar House, the construction, property and shipping group, fell sharply as the market reacted to the long-awaited rights issue, a cut in the dividend and a warning of further property write-downs. The market had anticipated the one-for-two rights issue to raise Pounds 204.5m, but the warning on further property writedowns took many by surprise. Trafalgar also announced a cut in the dividend from 6p to 3.25p. Dealers rushed to sell the stock and by the close, turnover had risen to 48m, boosted by programme trading, and the shares fell 12 to 76 1/2 p. Mr Leslie Kent at agency broker Carr Kitcat said: 'The company has a huge credibility problem but there remains much potential in the group. It is up to management to restore that credibility and potential but that will take a long time.' Reuters rebounds News and information group Reuters recovered 28 to 1344p as analysts' interpretations of the company's full-year results reached clients. The buy argument is exemplified by SG Warburg, which published an overview at the end of last week. The UK investment bank argues that at 1390p Reuters was on a 1993 price/earnings relative of 145 to 150 and a price relative target of 110, which would push them to 1430p. That target looked more achievable on Tuesday, before the price tumbled 66p. Yesterday, NatWest Securities advised clients to avoid buying until the stock hit 1250p. Nikko advised selling: the Japanese house said earnings per share growth will be held back by lower interest rates and hedging last year. Suggestions that Lloyds Bank's preliminary figures may be accompanied by a full-scale bid for another of the UK banks continued to drive TSB and Standard Chartered shares sharply higher. TSB attracted exceptionally heavy activity, with 10m shares traded in the cash market and the equivalent of 5.1m shares dealt in the stock options. But there was scepticism about the likelihood of a Lloyds bid, with TSB shares underperforming the sector and the market and closing only a penny higher at 172p. Standard Chartered, where Lloyds retains a 4.7 per cent shareholding after its unsuccessful bid in the mid-1980s, closed 14 higher at 645p, after 650p. Lloyds, expected to reveal a 10 per cent increase in the dividend total, rose sharply to end 13 stronger at 528p. Royal Insurance appreciated 15 to 288p on 5.8m traded, with the market increasingly of the view that a rights issue is unlikely in the short term. Commercial Union closed at 600p ex-rights, with the nil-paid ending the session at 90p premium. The pharmaceuticals sector showed strong gains yesterday, reflecting 'bottom-fishing' in the US. Goldman Sachs was on the bid and Glaxo, the hardest hit in recent weeks, was the biggest gainer in percentage terms in the FT-SE 100 Index. The shares jumped 31 to 696p on heavy turnover of 10m. Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham improved 20 to 466p in the 'A's and 17 to 409p in the Units. Wellcome raced through the 900p level to close 20 better at 913p. Rothmans International 'B' rose 13 to 599p after the company said it has begun talks to set up a regional holding company in the Far East. First-quarter figures at the top of the range of analysts' estimates helped industrial gases group BOC rise 7 to 746p. Hoare Govett's chemicals analyst Mr Martin Evans has maintained his full-year forecast of Pounds 380m and continues to see the shares as undervalued. BT settled 3 1/2 firmer at 411 1/2 p after the third-quarter figures. Mr Jim Ross, telecoms analyst at Hoare Govett, said the slow steady upturn in inland call volumes was 'a good backdrop for the flotation of BT later this year; the shares have further to go'. A strong buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs left BPB 7 higher at 216p. Mr Mike Betts, building analyst at Goldman, said BPB's profits should grow rapidly, due to increases in plasterboard prices, both those already announced and those expected in the future. Dull retail stocks were enlivened by the debut of Motor World Group, which saw 5.8m shares placed at 210p and was quickly marked up to close 65 ahead at 275p. Dealers said the group had excited interest from private clients following a series of presentations. Burton Group eased 1 1/2 to 69 1/2 p as agency broker Cazenove was said to have crossed lines of 4m and 1m shares at 70p. Turnover reached 21m. Alexon, where bid stories were again heard, added 3 at 85p. Very heavy turnover in Asda was seen as investors speculated on the value of the nil-paid shares. They closed steady at 5p, while the ordinary edged a halfpenny forward to 58 1/2 p in turnover of 47m. VAT and competition worries again dampened enthusiasm for the leading food retailers. Although not a fund-raising event, hotel group Forte's Pounds 200m debenture issue was thought good for sentiment and the shares added 4 at 190p. Paper company Arjo Wiggins Appleton bounced 6 1/2 to 168 1/2 p after 40 per cent stakeholder Saint-Louis, of France, said the group had provisional 1992 turnover of Pounds 2.57bn, compared with Pounds 2.49bn in 1991. British Steel had a busy session boosted by a recommendation from SG Warburg and volume rose to 15m as the shares hardened 2 to 78p. Warburg was, however, reported to be negative on IMI and the stock declined 12 to 268p. Personal care and footwear group Peter Black dipped 3 to 170p as it was announced that two shareholders had sold stock and now owned less than 3 per cent of the equity.

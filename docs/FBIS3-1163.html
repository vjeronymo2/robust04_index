The ultra  right-wing organisation was reacting to the mandatory leave  imposed on Generals Basie Smit, Krappies Engelbrecht and Johan  le Roux, who had been implicated in a Goldstone Commission  report of "third force" activities.    In a statement, AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche said: (Mr  Justice) Goldstone, that Boere-hater and African National  Congress apologist has now, without corroborating evidence, used  an anonymous, paid informant to throw our senior police generals  to the communist wolves."    Mr Terreblanche pledged his organisation's support to the  police force and said his whole force would be made available to  them to ensure that the country could be a peaceful home to "our  children".    "These generals and their troops, who have under  life-threatening circumstances dedicated their lives to maintain  law and order, are now being offered by (Mr Justice) Goldstone  and Mr F W) de Klerk as criminals to the communist anarchists.    "This is typical of the new approach that murderers,  rapists,  anarchists and other communist criminals have become heroes,  while the police is being presented as thugs. How can any police  force function if its own government turns against them?"    Mr Terreblanche accused the government of having handed  Bophuthatswana over to communist anarchists in the "most  treacherous and cunning" manner, adding that it had now  seemingly become kwaZulu's turn to be sacrificed.</p>

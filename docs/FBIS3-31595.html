			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The several months of arguments in  the Slovak National Party about its priorities and directions  culminated in the National Council in December of last year. At  that time, a parliamentary National Democratic Group of the  Slovak National Party [SNS] came into being, headed by Ludovit  Cernak. The existence of two parliamentary groups under the  roof of one political party should have definitively been solved  by the sixth SNS congress in Zilina today. Anna Samelova and  Ivan Samel report:    [Passage omitted] [Samelova] The delegates slimmed down the  original congress agenda. Instead of the planned address by  Ludovit Cernak with a report on the activity of the party since  the last congress in April of last year, the report by Jozef  Prokes on the situation in the Slovak National Party, following  the birth of the SNS parliamentary National Democratic Group, a  debate on the two addresses, and the following voting on the  recall of Ludovit Cernak from the post of SNS chairman, the  delegates reduced by voting all the four points into one: And  that is recalling Ludovit Cernak. The explanation was on the  pretext of saving time. After that, however, Jozef Prokes  granted the following explanation to the journalists.    [Begin Prokes recording] This assembly was called as  extraordinary on the basis of a 15 January Central Council  resolution on the basis of the fact that the chairman does not  fulfill the resolutions of this Central Council or any other  resolutions, thus infringing upon the statutes. This congress  has not been convened to discuss the development of the whole  party or its administration, but because of his [Cernak's]  activities. For example, the actual Central Council resolutions  of 15 January presented to the deputies, members of the SNS, to  return to the SNS group. Then it [the Council] asked him to  give up the post of chairman, which he did not do. [end  recording]    [Samel] Ludovit Cernak, Vladimir Miskovsky, Anton Hrnko, and  63 participants in the congress, out of this approximately 50  delegates from 18 districts, considered the explanations  formulated in this way to be an undemocratic solution to the  problems. That is why they left the debating hall at 1230 and  moved to the Zilina House of Technology. [passage omitted]    [Samel] From this moment, two independent groups of the  formerly united SNS had talks. As to Ludovit Cernak, we were  interested in the next political steps of his group.    [Begin Cernak recording] In Slovakia political parties  cannot  be born by division like cells. On the other hand, as  politicians, we are responsible for crystallizing embryos that  crystallize on the Slovak political scene. That is why I should  like to address very briefly the other parties in the center,  right of center, possibly those on the other side of the center,  on the political orientation and to coordinate the progress.  Consistent policies are then capable of shifting those  political forces that only talk and do not act according to  their orientation. [end recording]    [Announcer] According to the latest information, a group of  Ludovit Cernak's supporters decided to form a new political  entity under the working name of the National Democratic Party  [Narodno-Demokraticka Strana (NDS)].    Meanwhile, the delegates to the original SNS congress  dismissed SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak and, after two voting  rounds, elected Jan Slota as his successor. He received 70  votes, with 59 against. [Bratislava Rozhlasova Stanica Slovensko  Network in Slovak at 2030 GMT reports a varying final total,  noting that Jan Slota was elected SNS chairman by 70 votes in  favor and 49 opposed.]</p>

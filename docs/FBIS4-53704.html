			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mun Chae-cho from Washington] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that in a meeting of the U.S.  National Security Council held early this morning at the White  House, the United States has decided to hold a third round of  high- level talks with North Korea as soon as possible. In  today's meeting, the United States has reportedly discussed the  resumption of the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level  talks in Geneva next month, at the earliest, as a result of the  International Atomic Energy Agency's report that North Korea is  cooperating on the nuclear inspections.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Abta warns of flaw in new rules PROPOSED government rules for package tours could result in disreputable companies basing themselves in European Community countries with weaker regulations, travel industry representatives warned yesterday. The government has proposed that the regulations, due to come into effect next year, should apply to packages sold in the UK, except when the company offering them is established in another EC country. Mr Keith Betton, for the Association of British Travel Agents, said: 'If the contract is concluded in the UK, then UK legislation should be the basis of customer protection. We think otherwise the system will be abused by companies searching for the weakest link in the European Community chain.' The proposed regulations are designed to implement an EC directive requiring travel companies to ensure that they repatriate holidaymakers and return their money if the operator collapses. The directive leaves it up to each government to decide how the regulations should be implemented. However, Abta is concerned that implementation of the directive will be weaker in some member states than in others, allowing companies to shop around until they find the least restrictive European country in which to base themselves. The latest version of the government's proposals, published yesterday, offers companies three options: arranging a bond with an approved trade association; taking out insurance in the form of policies issued to individual customers, giving them the right to claim themselves; and opening a designated account into which all the deposits would be paid. Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday: 'The implementation is designed to enable each operator - and there are up to 20,000 of them - to choose which of the several options are appropriate to their needs.' However, Mr Betton said the regulations would be inadequate because the government had rejected Abta's suggestion that all companies be licensed. Mr Betton also criticised the government's proposal that companies should only have to help tourists to return home when they are stranded while they are taking a holiday abroad. He said that a Scottish holidaymaker in Cornwall could find it just as difficult to return home as someone from the south of England on holiday in France.</p>

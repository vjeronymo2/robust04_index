			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lower Exchequer Levy helps LWT rise to Pounds 14m DESPITE THE recession LWT (Holdings) increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.7m in the six months to June 30, an advance of 41 per cent on last time's Pounds 9.76m. An important factor in the rise, however, was a Pounds 2.8m drop in Exchequer Levy. Profits before levy and interest increased by 9 per cent, from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 22.7m. Mr Christopher Bland, chairman, said the results reflected 'higher advertising revenue, sponsorship and programme income and continued tight control of overheads, production costs and cash'. London, and LWT in particular, has been increasing its share of television advertising. In the year to July 1992 LWT's share was 12.024 per cent, compared with 11.775 per cent in the previous year with each 0.1 percentage point accounting for about Pounds 1m in revenue. Mr Bland also said the company planned to write-off its Pounds 3.2m share of start-up costs on the London News Network and Good Morning Television against the profit and loss account. LNN is the 50-50 joint venture with Carlton Television for a seven-day London television news operation. And LWT has a 20 per cent in GMTV, which takes over the commercial breakfast licence from TV-am on January 1. LWT is also expected to sell its 5 per cent stake in Independent Television News when new shareholders are brought into the organisation. Mr Bland expected 'a satisfactory result for the year' although it remained difficult to predict advertising revenue, there being no real sign of an end to the recession. A fixed preferred dividend of 1.969p was paid to holders of preference and management shares at the end of June. The next dividend at the end of the year will reflect the previously announced 50 per cent increase in the fixed preferred dividend. The share price closed 13p higher at 254p.</p>

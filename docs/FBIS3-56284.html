In moving towards this goal, Russia and the United States,  building on the progress to date in the peace progress, are  determined to support the efforts of the parties to implement  the Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles.  Implementation of the declaration of principles is critical to  changing the relationship between the israelis and the  Palestinians.    Russia and the United States welcome progress achieved on  the  Jordanian-Israeli track of the peace process, and underscore  their determination to help the parties make progress on the  Syrian and Lebanese tracks as well. Both sides hope that in  their quest for peace all participants in negotiations will  display a high sense of responsibility, necessary flexibility  and political farsightedness.</p>

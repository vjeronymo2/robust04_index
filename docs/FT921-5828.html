			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (3): A first cuckoo in the park  -Some signs of economic revival in the region TALKLAND, the cellular communications company owned by France's Compagnie Generale des Eaux, set up in the new Banbury business park last October, becoming its first tenant. It moved its operation, servicing its mobile phone network from Isleworth in west London, and now employs 240 people. It is seen as an important catch in the drive by Cherwell District Council to gain new investment and to capitalise on the completion of M40 between Oxford and Birmingham. Other new arrivals include Alcatel Network Systems, which has set up a small operation in Banbury; Philips Car Stereos and Henkel Ecolab, a distributor of chemical products, both of which have gone gone to Bicester. North Oxfordshire is largely agricultural, undulating countryside with three small towns and lots of pretty villages. In Banbury, the main town, with a current population of 41,000 and a catchment population of 120,000, there are several multinational manufacturing concerns. By local standards, they are large employers. They include US-owned Kraft General Foods, British Alcan Aluminium, part of the Canadian Alcan Aluminum group, and Mannesman Demag, the UK subsidiary of the German engineering company. There are also some distribution companies, including the EPS group, which employs 600 people. Elsewhere, some 1,200 are employed directly and indirectly at the Ministry of Defence Ordnance depot in Bicester (population 20,000), making the town an important service centre. Upper Heyford, the US airbase, is home to 1,400 US servicemen and their families. Alcan Aluminium is the Canadian parent of British Alcan Aluminium. The British company was first established in Banbury as Northern Aluminium in 1931. The international company has been suffering in the past year because of a fall in the price for aluminium. The UK arm has not been immune from the problems. British Alcan Enterprises, which forms part of the UK subsidiary, employs 700 people in Banbury. The company feels North Oxfordshire is a good place from which to operate. Dr Mike Sporton, managing director of Alcan International, a related company, which employs 176 in a laboratory in Banbury to develop group products, points to its central position. 'On the one side there is Heathrow, and a lot of the business is international. On the other side is Birmingham University, which is very strong in materials sciences with an important interdisciplinary research centre.' Mannesman Demag, which makes travelling cranes and conveyor systems, employs 260 people, and set up in Banbury in 1969, encouraged partly by the promise of a motorway in the near future and partly by the availability of development assistance. 'All other things being equal, we probably would not choose Banbury now. Our customer base was in the south, but it has moved further north. But we run a very successful business from here. We have a good, loyal workforce and own the property freehold,' says Mr Matthew Houston, the company's managing director. Mr Houston does not see other heavy manufacturing concerns moving into the area, but he welcomes the idea of smaller technological companies arriving. Throughout the area there are already several engineering concerns with an emphasis on specialised engineering in motorsports. Mr Richard Pineo, the marketing manager of EPS, which describes itself as logistics services company, sees North Oxfordshire as a natural area for distribution companies. It has been in Chipping Warden near Banbury since 1948 and now occupies a 64-acre site on what was once a Second World War airfield. Besides warehousing, the company, which has a turnover of Pounds 25m, offers production and distribution in partnership with individual companies, including assembly, customisation, repair, refurbishment and testing. 'Companies always knew the M40 would be developed at some stage. The completion of the M40 means this area is ideal for companies like ours,' Mr Pineo says. Cherwell District Council wants to encourage more companies like Talkland to locate in the area. Mr Rob Lee, the council's economic development officer, says the strategy is to attract service companies which will create jobs. He also feels that, once the economy picks up, distribution and warehousing concerns which are not particularly labour-intensive will want to be close to the motorway. Unemployment in Banbury has risen to 9 per cent (about 2,000 unemployed). It is 6.6 per cent in Bicester and 8.2 per cent in Kidlington which is considered as part of the Oxford travel-to-work area. The ordnance depot in Bicester is apparently not scheduled for cuts, but a rundown at the US base has begun. Mr Lee estimates that around 15 per cent of the servicemen will opt to stay in the area because they have married locally, but there could still be around 600 job losses. Cherwell feels that the capture of Talkland is a good start in its drive to boost its economy, and the company itself is pleased with its move, which attracted more than 1,200 applications for the 240 jobs the company created. Mr John Barton, operations director of Talkland, says: 'We received a very warm welcome from the local authority. Among other things, they were instrumental in setting up a training programme with the North Oxfordshire College for our staff. 'When we decided to move from Isleworth, I looked at a lot of places, including Dudley and Milton Keynes. In the end, I decided I preferred the building in Banbury. It was also cheaper than Milton Keynes.' Mr Philip Dobby, managing director of Alcatel Network Systems, also looked at a number of sites. 'We needed to be close to London, because the south-east is a major customer base for telecommunications equipment. We have a small sales office in London. When it came to a servicing and repair centre I looked at various places including Milton Keynes and Bracknell, and the Oxford science park. 'In the end, we chose Banbury because we wanted engineers we took on to be able to afford houses in nice surroundings. Also, this office is cheap - less than Pounds 15 a sq ft. It is in the town and I feel we are in on the ground floor of the area's expansion.'</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / 'Barmy' tape sets rebels at PM's throat THE Conservative leadership issue took a fresh twist yesterday after it emerged that Mr John Major's remarks referring to backbench critics as 'barmy' were recorded. The tape is believed to have been made during a party at the British embassy in Tokyo, where Mr Major has just finished a four-day official visit. Some MPs, believed to be among those Mr Major was referring to, retorted in kind, suggesting it was not them but the prime minister himself to whom that adjective could be best applied. Sir Richard Body, Tory MP for Holland with Boston, said Mr Major's comments were 'rather sad'. He said: 'A number of us have been trying to get a message through to him that there is growing disillusionment in the country . . . but he won't listen.' Sir Richard, who has been tipped as a possible 'stalking horse' challenger to Mr Major this autumn, said a number of 'very ordinary' Tory MPs had contacted him since he first raised the leadership issue to say their constituents were saying the same. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay and another of Mr Major's fiercest critics, said a prime minister who did not 'listen to his own grassroots is barmy'. The tape is thought to have been the basis of an article in yesterday's Independent newspaper which claimed that Mr Major had drawn up a 'hit list' of rebels. Mr Major yesterday dismissed the Independent story as 'silly,' and said he had no idea where the suggestion of a 'hit list' had come from. Although the tape is thought unlikely to contain more damaging material, its existence could further anger the rebels, who have rebuffed a demand from the prime minister for an end to 'stupid internecine squabbling' in the Conservative party. The episode also confirms that the uncertainty over Mr Major's leadership is unlikely to fade before the party conference next month, when he is planning a showdown with the rebels. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Portillo, the Thatcherite chief secretary to the Treasury, became the latest heavyweight to call publicly for a halt to the sniping. 'We have to make it very plain to people that it is a nice luxury to be a rebel and to sound off against the government, but eventually this government has to govern,' he said.</p>

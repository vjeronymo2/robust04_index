			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Venezuela may sell 35% of airline overseas VENEZUELA, in announcing the conditions under which it will privatise its Viasa international airline, says foreign airlines will be able to buy around 35 per cent of the airline's shares. The government stipulates that although it plans to sell up to 60 per cent of Viasa, it will keep at least 51 per cent in the Venezuelan hands. It also says airline employees can own up to 20 per cent of Viasa under stock purchase plans. Viasa, which flies to Europe, the US, Latin America and the Caribbean, made a loss last year. Profits in previous years were due mainly to government export bonuses. Viasa operates five DC-10 jets (four are owned by the airline, one is leased) and three leased Airbus 300-B4s. Officials say they plan to complete the privatisation of Viasa by July of this year. Potential bidders must set up consortia that will be able to operate the airline, the government said. Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) plans capital investments of Dollars 48bn for domestic and international projects by 1996, including direct capital outlays of Dollars 34bn by PDVSA itself. In addition, Dollars 14bn is to be invested by overseas subsidiaries, partners in existing joint ventures and private companies which are developing new projects with PDVSA. PDVSA is one of the world's largest petroleum companies and has oil refining and distribution assets in the US, Germany, Sweden and Belgium. The Dollars 34bn in direct investments programmed by PDVSA represents an increase of 36 per cent - or Dollars 9bn - over the Dollars 25bn investment programme for 1991-96 announced at the end of last year. In 1990, PDVSA's total turnover topped Dollars 23bn. The company has over 60bn barrels in proven reserves of crude oil, the largest in the western hemisphere.</p>

(UMC) will transfer its advanced 0.8-  micrometer integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing technology to  the German semiconductor maker Thesys, a company spokesman said  Saturday [29 January].    It is the first time that a Taiwan company has sold its IC  technical know-how to a European firm, the spokesman noted. UMC  is Taiwan's top and the world's 31st largest IC producer.    Under a cooperative contract signed in Taipei by UMC  Chairman  Tsao Hsing-cheng and Thesys Chairman Cludio Loddo [spelling of  name as received], UMC will transfer 0.8-micrometer IC design  rules, production facilities and management expertise to the  German firm. Thesys will pay UMC millions of US dollars in  royalties.    Meanwhile, the spokesman said, Thesys will produce 2,000 6  inch IC wafers a month on an original equipment manufacturing  basis for UMC starting late this year. Thesys has technology  for producing 1.2-micrometer ICs and can turn out 30,000 6-inch  wafers monthly.    "By cooperating with Thesys, our company has gained greater  access to the European market," the spokesman noted.    UMC began to produce 7-micrometer ICs 17 years ago by buying  know-how from America's RCA Co. with a paid-in capital of NT  [New Taiwan] $6 billion (US$226 million), the company registered  a business turnover of NT$10 bill on (US$377.35 million) in 1993.    Taiwan had a 2.67 percent share of the world's total IC  output last year and the ratio is expected to rise to 10 or 15  percent in the next few years as all major local IC producers  have launched expansion projects, industry sources said.</p>

Those attending the banquet included Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the CPPCC National Committee; Wang Guangying and Cheng Siyuan,  both vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee; and Wu  Xueqian, Yang Ruidai, Qian Weichang, Sun Fuling, and Henry Fok  Ying-tung, all vice chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee.    Ye Xuanping, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,  spoke at the banquet. He said: We again gather in Beijing to  attend the annual NPC and CPPCC National Committee meetings to  discuss the state's affairs and policies, to consult with each  other, and to exercise supervision over the government's work.  This year's NPC and CPPCC National Committee meetings will be  held at a time when the country's reform and opening up are  entering a crucial stage. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee last year laid down the objective of  quickening the step of building a socialist market economic  system; against this background, I hope you would speak freely  to make more contributions toward ensuring rapid economic  development in a sustained and healthy manner, to preserving  political stability, and ensuring Hong Kong's prosperity,  stability, and stable transition. Whatever problems Hong Kong  may encounter in the future, we have confidence that we can  properly handle Hong Kong's affairs.    Ann Tse Kai, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee;  and He Houhua, a NPC deputy from Macao, also spoke at the  banquet. They said in the new year they will closely cooperate  with the mainland and will continue to work for the prosperity  and stability of Hong Kong and Macao.    The banquet was presided over by Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman  of the CPPCC National Committee.</p>

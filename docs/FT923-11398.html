			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Weak prices deepen deficit at Abitibi-Price POOR PRICES for newsprint and other papers pushed Abitibi-Price to a higher second-quarter loss, despite an improvement in sales volumes. The Canadian forestry company said losses, after unusual items, rose to CDollars 41.3m (USDollars 34.4m), or 60 cents a share, from CDollars 5.7m, or 8 cents, a year earlier. Revenues fell to CDollars 692m from CDollars 730m. Mr Don Oberlander, chairman, predicted lower losses for the rest of the year. He said demand for newsprint in North America 'has started to turn around'. Newsprint producers expect to reduce their discounts to customers by 5 per cent on August 1, and Abitibi said it would benefit from further cost reductions. Demand for uncoated groundwood paper is also expected to improve, although prices will stay under pressure. The company said it expected to post an after-tax loss of CDollars 19m in the third quarter from the recent sale of its building products division. However this would be offset by a gain from the disposal of its distribution business.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / High stakes on both sides in EU entry talks: Attitudes are hardening on the price to be paid for membership of the club Even before the European Union's foreign ministers began talking in Brussels yesterday, the vexed negotiations to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the EU had been complicated by hardline Spanish demands. Among them was Madrid's insistence that money the rich new northerners put into the Brussels budget should be spent in the poorer south of the Union. But, as what should have been the beginning of the last lap of the enlargement talks opened in Brussels, tactically ill-timed requests by Sweden and Austria that their budget contributions should be phased in served only to sharpen the money issue prematurely. The Swedes in particular, who want exemption from three-fifths of their EU payment for three years, appear to have made Spain's partners more receptive to the agenda Madrid is trying to set in the talks. 'They (the Swedes) have stirred up such a row that the Spaniards have broadened their counter-demands,' one of the EU's lead negotiators says. If membership terms for the applicants are not settled by the first week of next month, it will become virtually impossible for the four to enter the EU by January next year as planned. Missing the deadline, says the senior EU negotiator, 'could decrease their interest (in joining), and increase our lust for a bigger cake' in terms of the Nordic and Alpine countries' money and resources. The UK and Germany, which contribute most to the EU's Ecu70bn (Dollars 77bn) budget, are, for example, already positioning themselves to demand that the newcomers' net contributions - worth Ecu1.7bn on the European Commission's first serious estimates - should be used to reduce their own EU payments. Until the Swedish budget request, Spain's main concern, shared with the UK, was to preserve existing EU majority voting rules enabling relatively modest alliances within the Twelve to block measures affecting their national interests. 'We really mean it,' said one senior Spanish official recently. But the Norwegians have since propelled the fish issue up the league table and the Spanish have leapt upon it. 'They are taking the (fisheries) regime hostage,' one senior Commission official said of the Spaniards. Wherever Spain's demands settle, yesterday's lunchtime talks between the Twelve's foreign ministers left little doubt that the money and resources question is nagging away at several member states, rich and poor. Spain has German support in opposing Commission plans to make thinly populated and inhospitable parts of northern Sweden and Norway eligible for the same levels of EU regional aid as Andalucia and the eastern German Lander. Brussels yesterday backtracked and proposed an analogous, slightly less generous, and possibly time-limited aid regime, which the applicants at first sight are inclined to reject. But it is in the cost of aligning the farm subsidy regimes of the candidate countries with EU norms that blood could be spilt. Sweden's farm prices are now close to the EU's, but Austria's are about 25 per cent higher, Finland's 50 per cent more, and Norwegian prices are double those within the Twelve. The EU concedes that for a mix of socio-economic, cultural, environmental, and even security reasons, extra farm subsidies to keep the Alps and the Arctic populated are legitimate. The argument is about who pays. The latest figures from the Commission's budget directorate calculate that within the four, Ecu4.1bn is now going to farmers through high prices paid by consumers, and Ecu2.2bn in direct government aid. The EU's opening offer is for a 'big bang' price cut to Union levels immediately on entry, and then only some Ecu2bn in normal common agricultural policy price support. Formally, the Twelve are prepared to sanction both transitional and permanent extra aid so long as the applicants pay for it themselves.</p>

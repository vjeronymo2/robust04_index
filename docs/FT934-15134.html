			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux posts 8.7% profits rise COMPAGNIE Generale des Eaux, the French construction and communications group, yesterday reported net profit for the first half of this year had risen to FFr1.98bn (Dollars 35m), up 8.7 per cent from FFr1.1bn in the same period of 1992. The group said it planned to raise between FFr3bn and FFr4bn through a rights issue by the end of the year, but gave no further details. Generale des Eaux controls SFR, the only private cellular telephone operator in France (in competition with France Telecom). The rapid growth of SFR investments had created the need for a sharp increase in depreciation allowances, the group said. Generale des Eaux was recently given permission by the French government to test a new small cordless telephone in Paris, as a possible competitor to the Bi-Bop product launched by France Telecom. Generale des Eaux said its first-half turnover was little changed, at FFr70.7bn, from the first half last year. But the static overall figure masked a 'sharp slowdown' in construction and property, in spite of its continuing contract to build a new headquarters for Societe Generale, the bank, at the Defense site in Paris. This drop was offset by 'satisfactory growth' in its traditional activity of water distribution and filtering, and an even better performance in communications.</p>

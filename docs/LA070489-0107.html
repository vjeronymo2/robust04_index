			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION ISSUE QUICKLY SEGUES INTO THE TV SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> Just after 10 a.m., two runners carrying documents broke from the front door of  the Supreme Court, tore down the marble steps and raced over to the CNN and the  NBC umbrellas.  </P> <P> The crowd surged toward the lights. The competing abortion rights and  anti-abortion demonstrators, which had been staging a fierce battle of pep  squads on the sidewalk, went silent. Even the man dressed as the Pope to  protest the Roman Catholic Church's authority as an expert on sex stopped and  watched.  </P> <P> The network correspondents, after nearly a month of rehearsals and false  alarms, had three or four minutes to digest the 77-page court opinion before  going on the air.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Machinery Starts Up  </P> <P> The machinery of modern democracy, inevitably connected now to the end of a  microphone and linked by cables to the double-parked satellite microwave  trucks, began to churn.  </P> <P> If James Madison imagined democracy as a kind of outdoor flea market of  competing groups peddling their wares in a wearying, blurry cacophony, the  steps of the U.S. Supreme Court Monday on the morning of the court's decision  in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services came close to realization of the  metaphor.  </P> <P> Part of what the sellers at this flea market were selling was "spin" -- the  most advantageous interpretation on the decision from a particular point of  view. For both sides, it seemed to be to make the decision as apocalyptic as  possible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposing Views Aired  </P> <P> Thus within moments of the decision, Planned Parenthood's Faye Wattleton was  calling the court decision "an outrage" on NBC, while Dr. John Willke of the  National Right to Life Committee was in front of 36 cameras on the other side  of the court steps calling the decision the begining of a new era.  </P> <P> But there was more going on than controlling the spin.  </P> <P> 'I don't think it serves any political agenda to utter a few platitudes," said  Roger Evans, litigation director for Planned Parenthood, which brought the  Webster case to the court three years ago. Getting in front of the camera on  network television, he said, helps the interest groups to raise their  visibility and fund-raising.  </P> <P> So those from the American Collegians for Life to the National Organization for  Women had their public relations staff circulating, looking to alert anyone  wearing press passes of news conferences later in the day.  </P> <P> Among the competing interests vying to be heard, capitalism was not lost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spectator Spot Bought  </P> <P> Former used car dealer Randall Terry, director of Operation Rescue, the  anti-abortion group, wanted to be in the courtroom's public gallery so much  that he had one of his staff offer to buy the spot of anyone of the first 50  spectators waiting in line. No. 11, Patrick Baker was persuaded, went for $100.  </P> <P> But Terry had visibility in mind, too. He made sure that he was one of the  first down the steps to tell the cameras how the court had ruled, which  guaranteed his group time at least on CNN's live broadcast from the scene. He  was beaten to the press conference area, however, by Molly Yard, the president  of the pro-abortion rights National Organization for Women.  </P> <P> But even in this marketplace there are rules.  </P> <P> Demonstrators carrying placards are not allowed on the court grounds, so they  protested on the sidewalk.  </P> <P> It was here that a man calling himself Father John of the Face dressed in a  Franciscan monk's robes led demonstrators in saying the Rosary. It was here  that George Lucas, director of a small group calling itself the American Life  League, attracted TV coverage by coming to the court to protest abortion with a  swath of American flags and singing a version of "God Bless America" that  ranged over several keys.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cheerleading Battles  </P> <P> At times, demonstrators pro and con would take each other on in cheerleading  battles that resembled a high school halftime show -- "Life yes, abortion no,"  drowned by "Right to life, your name's a lie; you don't care if women die."  </P> <P> Occasionally, small debates would erupt and quickly evolve into Morton Downey  Jr. nose-to-nose shouting fests.  </P> <P> Others came simply to be a part of history. Yale undergraduate Michael Carrier  of New York had waited since 10:30 a.m. Sunday to be first in line for seats in  the public gallery 23 hours later. Jim Paul of Beverly Hills, Calif., was  second. "A decision of this importance, I had to be here," Carrier said.  </P> <P> But the biggest draw for tourists was not the court but the media. More than an  hour after the decision was announced, at least 200 onlookers remained, staring  in rapt attention as CBS' Rita Braver stood alone looking bored for about 10  minutes, part of the time with her eyes closed, waiting for her next live  stand-up.  </P> <P> For nearly a month, all three networks had been on what CBS producer Tom Seem  called a full "special events standby" status, meaning that they were ready to  break into regular programming on those days if the court had handed down this  decision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10 NBC Crews on Standby  </P> <P> NBC had five correspondents, six producers, 10 crews, three microwave trucks  and senators, congressmen and special interest group guests on standby 10  different mornings in anticipation of the decision, according to bureau chief  Tim Russert.  </P> <P> In the marketplace of ideas, interests can change quickly. Rep. Robert K.  Dornan (R-Garden Grove) showed up late -- police at first shooed him away for  illegally parking -- and promptly got into an argument with a group of college  women calling themselves Catholics for Choice.  </P> <P> But when the argument over theology and politics ended, one of the women asked  him for tickets to the White House tour. Always quick to recognize a potential  constituent, Dornan quickly consented:  </P> <P> "My office," he told her, "is fastest on the Hill with White House tickets."  </P> <P> Staff writer Michael J. Ybarra contributed to this story.  </P></p>

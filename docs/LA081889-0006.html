			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A three-alarm brush fire set by an arsonist caused minor damage to two San  Diego homes Thursday, a Fire Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> The 11:43 a.m. fire on a canyon side between Interstate 805 and Vancouver  Street was started with a device used by other roadside arsonists in the past  year, said the spokesman, Jon McDonald. McDonald declined to describe the  device.  </P> <P> The small blaze raced up from the shoulder of the interstate toward the two  homes in the 3400 and 3500 blocks of Vancouver Street, according to McDonald.  Thick vegetation around the homes, left uncut in violation of the city's fire  code, contributed to the damage, he said.  </P> <P> The fire consumed the outdoor deck of one home and flung embers onto the roof  of another. There were no reported injuries, and damage was estimated at  $7,000. The flames burned less than an acre of brush, McDonald said.  </P></p>

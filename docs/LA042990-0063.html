			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD TIME CRUISE  </P> <P> The Shirley Slater and Harry Basch story on the new cruise liner Fantasy  ("Don't Look for Subtle Decor on Fantasy Ship," March 25) does not tell the  whole story.  </P> <P> They describe the ship's decor as "frenetic," "flash" and "dazzle," "like  walking into a giant jukebox."  </P> <P> Well, what do they want? Do they want to walk into a funeral parlor, a morgue?  Do they want prison gray, a Kansas wheat field, dullness and monotony, a seedy,  shabby replica of a gentleman's luncheon club, a library reading room?  </P> <P> I, too, was on the first cruise. I found the ship bright, lively. It challenges  you to relax, enjoy and have a good time. What is a cruise for, anyway?  </P> <P> S. THOMAS FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

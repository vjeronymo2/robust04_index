			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / American Express close to deal on Thomas Cook American Express is close to acquiring the international business travel operations of Thomas Cook in a move that would strengthen its position as one of the world's two biggest travel agency groupings. The deal, which is expected to be announced early next week, would also involve American Express buying all of Thomas Cook's US travel agency operations. The purchase would be the latest and largest of a series of acquisitions in the worldwide business travel market. It signals a move by agencies to increase their negotiating power with airlines and to offer a wider range of services to the big companies whose budgets drive a large part of the international business travel market. American Express refused yesterday to confirm the deal. However, one industry executive close to the talks said it was likely to be concluded within days. The deregulation of airlines around the world is creating new markets for travel agencies. By increasing their buying power, the biggest agencies claim they can get cheaper flights for their corporate customers than would otherwise be the case. The Thomas Cook operations are expected to add about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year to American Express's travel agency billings (the spending by its customers on airline tickets, hotels and so on), which stood last year at Dollars 8bn. That would put it shoulder-to-shoulder with the US-French grouping of Carlson and Wagonlit, which agreed to combine their business travel operations in March. Between them, Carlson and Wagonlit had billings of Dollars 10.8bn last year. American Express is buying the Thomas Cook operations from Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German bank which itself bought the travel agency and travellers' cheque business from Midland Bank of the UK for DM600m (Pounds 247.9m). WestLB will retain Thomas Cook's travellers' cheque business, as well as its non-US consumer travel agency operations. In the past year, American Express has bought big domestic business travel agencies in Scandinavia, Brazil and Australia, as well as a regional US agency based in Texas. Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the business travel joint venture between the US and French companies, has made acquisitions in the Far East. The US Thomas Cook agency business, which has 385 offices, is being bought from a private US company which operates under a franchise arrangement. Under US banking laws, WestLB has not been able to own this outright. American Express is thought to have sounded out antitrust authorities in Washington on the US part of the deal, and to have received an initially favourable response.</p>

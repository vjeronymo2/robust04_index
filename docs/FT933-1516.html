			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Telekom leads bid for Hungarian phone stake DEUTSCHE Telekom, the state-owned German telecommunications company, has linked with Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Ameritech of the US in a consortium to bid for at least 30 per cent of Matav, the Hungarian national operator. This will be the one of the biggest privatisations in eastern Europe and the first sale of a telecoms utility, albeit of a minority stake. The value of Matav, and the likely size of the bids, will remain unclear until the government's pricing formula is announced. Washington-based International Technology Consultants value Matav at Dollars 3.3bn. Matav executives have quoted the figure approvingly, but bidders dismiss the estimate. Privatisation advisers said that the composition of the consortium could alter in the run-up to the submission of bids next month. Officials, consortium executives and advisers privately confirmed that C&amp;W and Ameritech agreed to join under the leadership of Deutsche Telekom. Other companies which bought the information memorandum for the privatisation are France Telecom, Italy's Stet, Japan's NTT, and US regional Bell operating companies Southwestern Bell and US West. Telekom, C&amp;W and Ameritech were regarded as strong individual bidders and rivals are concerned that their combination will be difficult to match. A group led by Telekom missed winning a digital mobile telephone concession last month despite offering the highest fee. Many suspect that the Hungarian authorities denied Telekom the digital cellular concession because they were 'saving' the German bidder for Matav. Mr Gyorgy Schamschula, Hungary's telecoms minister, rejected any connection between the cellular tender and privatisation.</p>

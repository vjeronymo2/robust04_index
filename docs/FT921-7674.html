			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / The Property Market: Landlords' common front One of the few areas of agreement between the Labour and Conservative parties in the UK in the run-up to the general election concerns legislation that will significantly curb the rights of landlords. Whichever party wins power, residential leaseholders can expect legislation to be introduced giving them the right to buy the freehold of their property under a new form of tenure called commonhold. Labour, which unveiled its proposals this week, will also allow leaseholders to extend their leases. This proposal may also be adopted by the Tory party if it is re-elected. In some respects, the parties' agreement is hardly surprising. The legislation would affect some 250,000 flat leaseholders, many of whom feel they pay too much in service charges, wait too long for repairs and encounter difficulties in selling their properties because building societies are unwilling to lend money on short leases. Moreover, the concentration of dissatisfied flat-owners in marginal constituencies in London such as Hampstead, Dulwich and Wandsworth has probably concentrated politicians' minds even more sharply on reform. Whatever the politicians' motives, the proposed reforms do not fit entirely easily with their respective political philosophies. For Labour, it means giving an unusually high priority to the the concerns of middle-class home-owners, although Mr Clive Soley, Labour's shadow housing minister, says any legislation would also affect 'coal board houses sold to Mickey Mouse companies'. For the Tory party, the proposed reforms overturn their traditional respect for the right of landowners. Not surprisingly, the great landlords, who still own large belts of property in London, are up in arms. 'It is confiscation,' says Mr Jeremy Newsum, chief executive of Grosvenor Estate Holdings, which owns huge chunks of Mayfair and Belgravia. 'It means the break-up of the Grosvenor Estate which has been held intact for 300 years. We created it and looked after it. There doesn't seem any purpose in breaking it up.' Mr Newsum believes that the government is wrong. 'We believe that contracts freely entered into should not be torn up.' The proposals are something of a sea change for the Tory party. When Mr John Patten, the housing minister at the time, guided the Landlord and Tenant (No 2) bill through the House of Commons in 1987, he defended the rights of landlords against proposals such as the right to extend leases. 'I would have to be moved a long way to be persuaded that we should break the principle of the reasonable agreement reached freely, with no coercion, between a good landlord and a good tenant,' he said at the time. 'Anyone buying a lease should not be under any illusion about the nature of the interest which she or he is purchasing,' he added. But Tories now argue, with reason, that many distressed leaseholders did not freely enter into a legal agreement with their freeholder. Some of the least reputable landowners buy freeholds of properties on which leases are due to expire. Conservatives also argue that landlords will receive adequate compensation for their freeholds, because they will receive the market value of the property. Labour says that agreement will have to be reached between leaseholder and freeholder, with recourse to an arbitration panel if necessary. But even the Tory pledges do not not satisfy institutions such as the Grosvenor Estate. The estate argues that the occupier will get a windfall gain because the 'marriage value' obtained by merging the freehold and leasehold will be split between the landlord and occupier. Landlords are unlikely to win much sympathy from the public concerning arcane arguments about 'marriage value'. But their complaints about the effect of the proposed legislation on the property rental market might receive more attention. 'If the government gets its way, there will be nobody buying residential investments,' says Mr Stuart Corbyn of Cadogan Estates. 'Housing legislation since the second world war has been impossible for private landholders,' adds Mr Newsum. Landlords fear that future legislation will make life even more difficult. They say the proposed legislation may remove many of the restrictions in the 1967 Leasehold Reform Act. (This act, which the Duke of Westminster, head of the Grosvenor Estate, fought unsuccessfully in the European Court, gave leaseholders the right to buy their freehold if they occupied houses with a relatively modest rateable value.) A future government, landowners say, is also likely to remove some of the other restrictions on leaseholders' rights to buy their freehold, such as those concerning buildings with more than 10 per cent commercial occupancy. Mr Newsum treats the government's commitment not to extend commonhold to the commercial sector with scepticism. Landlords also think it is just a matter of time before commonhold is extended to leases below 21 years. Mr Dudley Fishburn, the Conservative MP who has vigorously campaigned for commonhold, says that the right to buy a freehold should not be extended to leases of less than 21 years. However, Labour said it would consider stopping short leases being granted to evade the legislation on the right to buy. But campaigners for commonhold in the Tory party think new legislation will have the opposite effect on the rental sector to that feared by the large landlords. They say that once people are able to buy freehold flats, there will be more property available for rent. It is perhaps easy to over-emphasise the case made by the central London landowners. Although the Bedford, Cadogan, Grosvenor, Howard de Walden and Portman estates are generally well run and have an important place in London's architectural history, they are greatly outnumbered by other, less scrupulous freeholders. But it is not just the landowners which have inveighed against the new proposals. Many experts reckon that commonhold will bring a clutch of unforeseen problems. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a professional body, says it is 'totally opposed' to the commonhold proposals, partly because it would not work well in practice. The RICS said that many leaseholders were happy with their leases and should not be forced to change to a commonhold tenure simply because other flat-owners in the same block want to do it. It also thought that disagreements between commonholders will probably be difficult to resolve, whereas in a leasehold system, clear responsibility rests with the freeholder or The Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers, another professional group, also said that the government's proposals were 'seriously flawed'. It said the proposed changes would not solve any of the existing problems and would seriously jeopardise the position of the minority who do not vote for enfranchisement. Even if the new legislation helps many more people than it damages, these criticisms suggest that it will be no panacea. Most legal changes to land tenure since the second world war have had unintended and unwelcome effects. Commonhold is unlikely to be an exception.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ TOTAL RETURN (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                      Retail   Office  Industrial   All Properties  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Year to Dec 91         3.3     -8.4       6.9          -0.8 Quarter to Dec 91      2.5     -1.2       2.5           1.1 Month of Dec 91        0.9     -0.7       0.8           0.3  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Investment Property Databank  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

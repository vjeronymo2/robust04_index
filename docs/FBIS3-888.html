Officially, this was due to schedule  constraints. The High Council of Resistance took this  opportunity to hold a news conference in Libreville today. The  High Council of Resistance says it agrees with the head of state  and the prime minister on the idea of dialogue. There are,  however, several outstanding differences to be solved. The  opposition thinks discussions should focus mainly on the  progress of democracy. During the news conference, the High  Council of Resistance deputy chairman, Jean-Louis Agondjo-Okawe,  stressed that while the opposition remains open to dialogue, it  will not take part in negotiations in a state of emergency,  referring to the state of alert, which was reimposed following  recent disturbances in Libreville. Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe  spoke to Jonas Lomba.    [Begin Agondjo-Okawe recording] The situation must first of  all be eased. We can then begin negotiations in the presence of  mediators. First, we need to remove all these obstacles before  starting negotiations; not to discuss the formation of a  government or the government's program, but to hold proper  discussions [words indistinct] on the state of democracy. The  national conference democracy is still (?in its early stages).  We do not want to be told that we first have to enter a  government because that is out of the question. We want the  United States to be present at the negotiations for a number of  reasons. First, it is currently the world's greatest power, and  second, we are obliged to trade with it. It will also be a  guarantee for the Gabonese. [end recording]</p>

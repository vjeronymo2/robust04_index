			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / South-east slow to escape recession The south-east lost one in 10 of its jobs in business and financial services during the recession, according to a report from the region's local authorities. The report says that the recession has ended the traditional north-south divide, and the south-east will not lead the country out of the downturn. Essex, Bedford and west Sussex have the poorest growth, while Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Berkshire are expected to grow fastest. Women in the workforce are becoming polarised between a minority in full-time professional and managerial jobs and a majority in low-skilled, often part-time, manual or service occupations. A decline in clerical employment has removed a key stepping stone between the two. During the recession employment of those aged 16 to 25 in the south-east dropped 29 per cent for men and 23 per cent for women, while unemployment in this age group grew by 95 per cent for men and 28 per cent for women.

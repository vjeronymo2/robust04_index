			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLES AT THE JOFFREY;  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A GLITZY PREMIERE MASKS WOES  </P> <P> On the surface, it looked like another op'nin', another show for the Joffrey  Ballet.  </P> <P> Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the typical triple bill began  with some old neo-classical kitsch and ended with a spangly new ode to the  faded glories of vaudeville. Both instant crowd-pleasers were choreographed by  the official keeper of the Joffrey flame, Gerald Arpino.  </P> <P> In between came a knowing nod in the direction of dainty romanticism.  Eclecticism remains a Joffrey speciality.  </P> <P> The dancing, throughout, reflected the customary high spirits complemented by  reasonably high finesse. Although the faces in the company change, the gutsy  attitudes do not.  </P> <P> Still, it couldn't have been business as usual on this occasion. Few in the  dressy, unruly, non-capacity audience for this non-gala gala may have known it,  but the show went on while the company confronted chronic, possibly fatal,  turmoil behind the scenes.  </P> <P> Financial crises clouded the horizon. The trustees and administrators were  engaged in savage internal warfare. Loyalties were polarized.  </P> <P> Resignations and defections had begun to pile up. Accusations and  counter-accusations echoed from coast to coast. Arpino's continuing role as  artistic director languished in doubt. So, for that matter, did the immediate  survival of the Arpino-Joffrey oeuvre as we have long known and sometimes loved  it.  </P> <P> Ironically, the inaugural festivities at the Music Center accentuated the  negative in matters of repertory. Arpino's "Italian Suite," first seen in 1983,  is little more than a collection of amiable cliches. The frantic cheer is  filtered through cloying rosy lights, and propelled by speedy steps and  athletic contortions that contradict the impulses of Wolf-Ferrari gurgling in  the pit.  </P> <P> Nothing offensive can happen here. Nothing memorable can happen, either. It is  all too pat, too predictable, too eager to attract at the most obvious level.  </P> <P> At least "Italian Suite" isn't pretentious. That cannot be said of "The  Pantages and the Palace Present 'TWO-A-DAY.' "  </P> <P> Arpino's latest show-biz extravaganza is a splashy, glitzy, costly, witless  production number. Also a massive bore.  </P> <P> It looks nice, in its defiantly tasteless and nostalgic way. It lacks focus,  however. It lacks purpose. It lacks balletic interest. It lacks point, not to  mention a point of view.  </P> <P> It pretends to revere the traditions of the all-American variety show, as  sandwiched between sagas of the Silver Screen. The idea isn't original, but  there may be some life in it yet.  </P> <P> Not here.  </P> <P> Arpino can't seem to decide if he wants to glorify the past or to satirize it.  He doesn't seem sure if he wants his eager cast to dance or just to mug. He  ends up falling between most of the stylistic chairs for 40 ponderous minutes.  </P> <P> The first damaging clues come from the pit. The choreographer -- who is also  credited with the "conception" -- could have exhumed some great period ditties.  On the other hand, he could have commissioned a new score predicated on  illuminating parody. Instead, he engaged Elliot Kaplan to rework some limp  platitudes written by none other than Rebekah Harkness, a patron of the arts  who was blessed with more money than talent. Some of her money, not  incidentally, underwrote this dubious venture.  </P> <P> The proceedings begin irrelevantly with the final teary snippets of "A Star Is  Born," the 1937 version featuring Janet Gaynor. The printed program then  promises "The Voice" of "The Incomparable Mr. Tony Randall." It eluded these  ears.  </P> <P> The parade of impersonations begins as Jodie Gates invokes Sally Rand's fans  but not her bare skin. Elizabeth Parker and six attending swells do an ersatz  tap routine. Time dips back to Mack Sennett for a fatuous bathing-beauty number  in which Peter Narbutas flexes his biceps while flirting with a bump and grind.  </P> <P> Julie Janus and Tom Mossbrucker indulge in a would-be exotic harem duet in  which the hero suggests more of Valentino than Nijinsky. Beatriz Rodriguez,  eternally typecast as the sizzling Latina, leads a sort-of-Spanish  divertissement. Carole Valleskey undulates filmy butterfly wings in the manner  of Loie Fuller. Tina LeBlanc, petite and eternally innocent, descends from the  flies on a wired crescent moon in a fruitless fabrication of the sexy Marilyn  Miller mystique.  </P> <P> Finally, and not a moment too soon, everyone comes back for a valedictory  Charleston climax. It was choreographed not by Arpino but by Louis Johnson.  </P> <P> The participants give their all for their boss in the various thankless  charades. There is a lot of talent here, most of it smothered in gook. For  better and worse, Gerald Arpino may just be the Andrew Lloyd Webber of dance.  </P> <P> For at least one ungrateful viewer, the greatest satisfactions of the evening  involved the ancient lightweight charms of Arthur Saint-Leon's "La Vivandiere."  In the pas de six, the exquisite Tina LeBlanc and the mercurial Edward Stierle  were fleetly seconded by Cameron Baden, Jodie Gates, Cynthia Giannini and Kim  Sagani.  </P> <P> Here one could savor ballet without padding, without puffery, without false  sentiment and without gimmickry. It was reassuring.  </P></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech (Analysis): Hurried along the track to privatisation - British Rail IF BRITISH Rail had harboured hopes that political and practical obstacles to its long-awaited privatisation were pushing the event ever further into the distance, it must have been sorely disappointed by the Queen's Speech yesterday. The government made it clear that it was determined not only to secure a large-scale hand-over of BR's operations to the private sector, but to do it much more quickly than had been expected. Within days, the British Rail and British Coal (Transfer Proposals) Bill will be put to parliament, seeking powers to do essential preparatory work for the privatisation of the rail and coal industries. This will be a purely technical measure: but in the case of the railways, it is expected to be followed within weeks by the much-delayed privatisation White Paper, and by full-blown legislation in the shape of a Rail Bill as soon as the autumn. Cynics will say they have heard that before, only to see see the plans founder amid ministerial wrangling or the sheer impossibility of finding a buyer for such a heavily loss-making operation. But if the government has at last found a successful formula, the result could be radical change for Britain's railways - not so much in the form of the 'big bang' privatisation originally envisaged by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the former transport secretary, as in the form of a creeping denationalisation. The framework agreed by Mr John MacGregor, Mr Rifkind's successor, and the rest of the Cabinet follows the lines set out in the Conservative party's election manifesto. BR will be split into two bodies: one owning the railway tracks and associated infrastructure, and the other operating the trains. Separate accounting systems will be set up so that the track body knows how much to charge train operators for the use of its tracks. Once that charging system is in place, it will be possible to give private sector operators the right to run trains on BR's tracks provided they are prepared to pay the price. Several companies, including Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, have already expressed an interest in becoming train operators. The next step will be to start getting BR's own services into the private sector. To quell fears of line closures, ownership of the track infrastructure will stay with BR indefinitely, but the operation of the trains will gradually be handed to the private sector. The freight and parcels operations will be sold, and the operation of passenger services will be franchised to private sector operators, with subsidies to ensure the preservation of loss-making but socially necessary services. One possibility is that passenger services will be franchised in groups of routes, so paving the way for the re-emergence of regional companies such as the London Brighton and South Coast. An official regulator will be set up to award the passenger service franchises and to make sure that BR's track infrastructure body treats private sector entrants fairly. Safety, as now, will be administered by the Railway Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive. The government will also seek powers in the bill to sell stations outright to the private sector - not just to franchisees operating the trains that run through them, but to any private-sector operator which believes it can make more productive use of the assets than BR. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said Labour favoured more private investment in the railways, but he opposed the break-up of the railways and the removal of strategic decision-making from the government. Trains and tracks needed to be upgraded together to get the best out of both, he said. Dividing the ownership of tracks and trains meant that investment in the two would not be co-ordinated. The break-up of the network would also lead to a fragmentation of services, swingeing cuts in fringe routes such as those in rural areas, and big fare increases. The omission from the Queen's Speech of controversial proposals for the deregulation and privatisation of London's buses is likely to be seen as a setback for Mr MacGregor. Transport minsters had repeatedly promised the extension of de-regulation to the capital's buses early in the next parliament. The plans have met strong resistance from bus user groups, the London boroughs, the London Tourist Board and others.</p>

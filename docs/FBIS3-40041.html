			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "EU Reached Agreement on </F> Additional Support"]    [Text] Brussels -- The Swedish EU [European Union]  negotiations took a step forward when on Tuesday [22 February]  the EU countries surprisingly reached agreement to create a  completely new form of regional support, tailor-made for  northern Sweden.    According to the first rough estimates, this could give  Sweden's three northernmost provinces around 1,000 kronor per  inhabitant in EU support.    "This EU proposal represents a major step forward," European  Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel said after Tuesday's  negotiations with EU ministers.    "It is a good, even a very good basis for continued  discussions. I am convinced that on the basis of this we will  be able to reach a satisfactory compromise."    The new regional support on which the EU countries have  reached agreement is based on the proposal from the EU  Commission which was vociferously rejected by France and Spain  on Monday [21 February] evening. But on Tuesday morning these  countries were also able to back the support after its name had  been changed from Objective 1(A) to Objective 6 support and had  been adjusted on a number of points.    Objective 6 support will go to regions with less than eight  inhabitants per square kilometer. In Sweden this qualifies the  inland areas of Norrbotten and Vasterbotten provinces and  Jamtland, but not western Norrland, for which the Swedish  negotiators have also demanded support.    On the basis of the EU's own figures, Ulf Dinkelspiel  estimates that this could give 500 to 800 million kronor per  year in Swedish regional support -- a figure which can be  compared with Sweden's total regional support of around 3  billion kronor.    A snag with the EU's proposal is that it is described as "a  transitional arrangement" that will be reassessed in 1999 when  the EU reviews its rules on regional policy.    "I raised this matter and they were prepared to remove the  phrase about a transitional arrangement," Ulf Dinkelspiel said.    However, Swedish negotiators are not wholly satisfied with  the Objective 6 proposal. They still want support for a larger  chunk of Sweden and are asking for clearer figures.    On the subject of support for agriculture in Norrland, the  Swedish negotiators are also pleased with the openings that have  occurred.    "The EU's proposal goes a fair way toward meeting our  demands  even if though it is not as precise as we might wish," Ulf  Dinkelspiel said.    The EU has given the green light for the principle that  agriculture in northernmost Sweden, Norway, and Finland needs  special support. In the view of the EU this support can go to  smaller farms in areas with less than 10 inhabitants per square  kilometer, north of the 62d parallel. However, in certain cases  it will also be possible to provide this support south of this  line of latitude.    The EU has also said OK to areas north of the 62d parallel  having the right to expanded so-called LFA [less-favored areas]  support from the EU which is normally given to "mountain  agriculture" above an altitude of 800 meters.    Agriculture Minister Karl-Erik Olsson estimates that the  LFA support could cover 25-30 percent of the billion-krona  support that today goes to Norrland agriculture every year.  Sweden has also demanded that the EU must accept responsibility  for half of the sum needed to cover the rest of support for  Norrland, but the EU has said no. Sweden must meet that bill  itself, it says.    "We have not abandoned the demand that the EU must be  involved in footing the bill," Karl-Erik Olsson said, but he  seems to think that negotiations on this point will be tough.    There was also a disappointing message from the EU on  Swedish  milk and sugar quotas. Sweden has demanded a milk quota of 3.5  million tonnes. As expected, the EU is currently offering 3.1  million tonnes.    For sugar production Sweden demanded a quota of 440,000  tonnes, while the EU wants a quota of only 350,000 tonnes. This  offer is even lower than the Commission's original proposal.    At Tuesday's negotiations the Swedish demand for a  phasing-in  of its budget contributions was also discussed. In the first  few years of Swedish membership Sweden wants to pay a reduced  membership fee and then gradually increase its payments. But  the EU countries have agreed to reject this demand.    "We explained that Sweden is not demanding a rebate. From  the first day we want to pay the amount that Swedish EU  membership costs the EU. We will be paying our full  contribution in 1999," Dinkelspiel said, adding laconically:    "The reception was not enthusiastic." On two minor points  Sweden and the other Nordic countries were able to reach  agreement with the EU. A declaration was adopted to the effect  that even after EU membership Nordic cooperation will continue  for Sweden, Norway, and Finland.    In addition a special Lapp protocol recognizing the Lapps'  exclusive right to engage in reindeer farming and stressing  Sweden's, Norway's, and Finland's commitment to the preservation  of the culture and way of life of the Lapp people.</p>

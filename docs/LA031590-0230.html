			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OUT AND ABOUT: FOLK DANCING  </P> <P> The 12 members of Tchaika, a folk dance group, sounded like a swarm of angry  bees as performed a dance called the floricica olteanesca on a recent evening  at the Loma Vista School auditorium.  </P> <P> The group whipped through the Romanian line dance, hopping, stomping and  executing quick little scissor kicks to the buzzing of a jew's harp.  </P> <P> "We're celebrating," said Edith Sewell, the amateur folk dancing group's perky,  fiftysomething instructor.  </P> <P> In recognition of recent reforms in Eastern Europe, Tchaika -- it means sea  gull in Russian -- is focusing on the dances of Romania, Bulgaria and  Yugoslavia through April.  </P> <P> The group hopes that those caught up in the political excitement will be  attracted to the two-hour sessions on Thursday evenings at Loma Vista School in  Ventura.  </P> <P> "You can tell so much about a people by the way they dance," Sewell said. These  dances "have so much energy and so much sadness."  </P> <P> The sessions are open to the public with a $2 admission. They begin with a half  hour or so of instruction by Sewell. Performances from the group's repertoire,  which includes more than 100 dances, take up the rest of the evening, with  either Sewell or seasoned folk dancers leading line dances.  </P> <P> During such spirited numbers such as the floricica olteanesca, the group  splinters into several lines according to ability. Less-advanced participants  dance behind veterans so they can follow each step. Tchaika is one of five  Ventura County groups that meet regularly to learn and practice interpretations  of centuries-old folk dances from Eastern Europe, Israel, Greece, South Africa,  South America and Canada (see box).  </P> <P> "You can't trace every dance to a specific time and place," said Tchaika  regular Jackson Wheeler, 37. "But they have authentic elements, and the music  is authentic."  </P> <P> The instructors of these groups scour folk dancing festivals and clubs for  recordings. Some take folk dancing tours and cruises to learn new dances and to  record music. The search for new steps and tunes has taken Sewell, who formerly  performed modern dance, to Romania, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> On a recent evening, musical accompaniment ranged from the angelic voices of a  Bulgarian children's choir to the tinny tones of the tamburitza, a relative of  the balalaika.  </P> <P> Participants ranged in age from early 30s to mid-70s and included a grocery  store clerk, a civil engineer and a social worker. Some wore embroidered  peasant blouses and opanci, or leather-soled Macedonian slippers with pointed  toes; others, sweat pants and high tops. Few brought partners.  </P> <P> While the group occasionally broke into what Sewell called "Romanian aerobics,"  the pace wasn't always breakneck. At the evening's close, dancers threaded  through lesnoto, a Macedonian line dance so lazy, Sewell said, that "you can  gossip."  </P> <P> Olga Voltava, a 75-year-old immigrant from Poland, couldn't have been more at  home.  </P> <P> "Our parents taught us to do these sort of dances," she said. "Long before this  was recreation, it was part of our ethnic lore."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE TO PRACTICE  </P> <P> There are enough folk-dancing groups in Ventura County that an enthusiast can  polish his Floricica Olteanesca or Lesnoto practically every night of the week.

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Poll virus' threatens Pakistan's cotton ELECTION VIRUS could be one of the bugs to hit Pakistan's cotton crop this year. According to the latest assessments by the country's top cotton experts, the crop is likely to exceed 11.5m bales, coming close to the government's 12m bale target. However, farmers in the cotton belt around the city of Multan in Southern Punjab as well as in other districts of the province, have spent large amounts of money to support their candidates in the October 6 general election, leaving them with tight budgets for pesticides. Mr Zahoor Ahmed, head of Pakistan's leading cotton research station in Multan, says pesticide dealers have reported a 10 to 20 per cent drop in sales. 'The question is, how much will 'election virus' affect your production. People are short of money for pesticides due to the elections,' he says. Nevertheless Mr Ahmed is urging farmers to intensify vigilance during the next month or so, to protect their crops against possible attacks by the 'boll worm' virus. Crops have generally been good this year, after 1992's devastation, caused by heavy rainfall, floods and an attack by the leaf curl virus. In that year just over 9m bales were produced, 3m short of target. The US cotton crop is likely to be 17.65m bales, below the 17.9m bales projected this month by US Department of Agriculture, according an executive with National Cotton Council of America, reports Reuter from Scottsdale, Arizona. 'That's good news because it means our carryover will be smaller,' said Mr Mark Lange, director of economic services, told a NCC board meeting. The USDA put 1993-94 starting stocks at 4.7m bales, up from 3.7m at the beginning of the 1992-93 season. It forecast the carryover at the end of this season at 6m bales. Total US mill use for 1992-93 of 10.25m bales was up 640,000 bales from the previous year. At best, Mr Lange said, 1993-94 mill consumption would to reach 10.3m bales (in line with the USDA estimate) or remain even with last year.</p>

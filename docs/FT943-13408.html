			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Germany split over legacy of war resistance Germany's politicians are engaged in a delicate but bitter struggle over the right to claim the ideological legacy of a wartime plot 50 years ago to assassinate Hitler. Conservatives point to the aristocratic army officers who led the attempt, half a century ago today, to blow up the Fuhrer in his headquarters. Others say it is impossible to ignore the role played by socialists and communists in the resistance to the Nazi regime. Today Chancellor Helmut Kohl delivers a speech in Berlin to commemorate the July 20 plot. The ceremony will take place in the Bendler Block, the complex of buildings where the conspiracy was born and where, nine years before, Hitler told German generals of his plans to gain Lebensraum through conquests in eastern Europe. Mr Kohl has dissuaded President Roman Herzog from speaking at the ceremony, organised by the federal government and the Berlin authorities, and has shunned suggestions that Mr Rudolf Scharping, opposition Social Democrat leader, be included. His words may reveal the extent to which Germany's conservative camp wants selectively to use history and memory in the federal election campaign this year. The controversy was initiated in the past two months by conservatives led by Franz Ludwig von Stauffenberg, son of Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, one of the main plotters in the July 20 assassination attempt. The row centres on an exhibition dedicated to the families behind the July 20 plot, and shown in the Bendler Block. Franz Ludwig has insisted that this should have nothing to do with a permanent exhibition, a floor above, marking the resistance to Hitler which includes the role of communists, socialists, trade unionists and the emigres. What is more significant, Franz Ludwig, backed by members of Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union, its sister party, wants communists excluded from the permanent exhibition on the grounds that they installed a totalitarian regime in eastern Germany after the war. The permanent exhibition was commissioned during the 1980s to documentthe scope and complexity of the German resistance to help the Germans to come to terms with the past. This marked a change from the treatment of the issue in the immediate post-war years. In the 1950s, and even in the 1960s, the July 20 plotters were regarded in Germany as traitors, and no credit was given to the communists, the emigres and the German prisoners of war in Soviet camps who co-operated in the resistance. 'That attempt in the 1980s was a step towards establishing some elements of a common historical memory shared by west and east Germans,' said Mr Jurgen Kocka, professor of modern history at Berlin's Free University. 'But now the situation has changed. Re-unification makes it possible to stress the political and ideological divisions in the country. What is happening is that the debate over July 20 is about the search for a national identity. Above all, it is a fight over who should claim the traditions of July 20.' In an open letter to the German press last week, about 50 people representing a cross-section of the resistance, including Freya von Moltke, the widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a July 20 conspirator, and Stefan Heym, the east German writer and member of the resistance in exile, deplored attempts to 'separate certain groups of the German resistance from the permanent exhibition'. Mr Manfred Messerschmidt, the military historian, argued in a weekly magazine last week that the conservatives should 'not limit the resistance' to the conservatives and army, even though that was their wish in order to rally support against the left after the electoral success of the SPD and the PDS, the successor to the former east German communists, in elections in Saxony-Anhalt last month. 'The Chancellery has displayed a very close interest in the relationship between politics and history, which I deplore because of the way it uses the past,' said Professor Kocka. 'Everybody wants to claim July 20. If there is any good coming out of this debate it is that everybody recognises finally that a resistance existed. But it does not mean that all those in the resistance wanted the restoration of democracy.'</p>

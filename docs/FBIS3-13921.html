			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pe'erli Shahar, U.S. correspondent Natan Gutman, </F> Pinhas 'Inbari, and news agencies]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The establishment of the  Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho will be given top  priority in the resuming talks with the PLO and in the  preliminary contacts. Israeli sources noted that Israel has  acceded to the PLO demand to actually make it a paramilitary  force, alongside the "blues."    In recent days, the PLO leadership has given its permission  to reinstate some of the policemen who served under Israel and  who quit their jobs during the intifadah. PLO official Ziyad  'Arif met last Saturday in Khan Yunus with those policemen. He  told them to be ready to return to service on 15 April and  handed them their first salary.    The Israeli sources pointed out that this police force will  begin operating in the autonomy areas before the Palestine  Liberation Army deploys its troops and will work in coordination  with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] authorities until the  Israeli withdrawal.</p>

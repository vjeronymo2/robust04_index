			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A DAY IN THE PARK  </P> <P> Lanark Recreation Center  </P> <P> 21816 Lanark St., Canoga Park  </P> <P> Size: 19 acres  </P> <P> Facilities: Lighted tennis courts, baseball diamonds, swimming pool, indoor  gymnasium, picnic facilities, play area.  </P> <P> Hours: 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and  Sunday  </P> <P> Information: (818) 883-1503  </P> <P> Before Ray Notaro came along, Lanark Recreation Center was just another city  park.  </P> <P> But in 1986, Notaro and Frankie Goodman started the Lanark Boxing Club and  began organizing classes enabling area youngsters to learn how to box. Today,  more than 300 children, some as young as 8, have participated in the boxing  program. Safety gear is provided by the park and a nominal registration fee  pays for a mouthpiece and hand wrappings.  </P> <P> Lanark also is the only city park with a fencing program. Instructor Edwin  Hurst offers night classes three times a week to the public. Both programs have  helped bring more young people to the park, said park director John Perez Jr.  "Lanark is a place of diversity where a child can get involved in the typical  baseball, tennis or swimming," Perez said. And the atypical too. KAREN  KINGSBURY  </P></p>

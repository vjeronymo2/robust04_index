			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Sweden's markets still nervous SWEDEN'S money markets remained nervous yesterday amid continuing uncertainty over the country's economic future, as the general share index fell 2.3 per cent and short-term interest rates rose further. This followed a 4 per cent plunge in share values on what Swedes have already called 'black Monday' and a jump in market interest rates. However, there was no public reaction yesterday from the government. Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, insists that there is no crisis and no reason why the cabinet should change its medium-term strategy to reassure the markets. Market analysts remain convinced that the current uncertainties will remain unless the non-socialist minority coalition can demonstrate that it can secure a majority in parliament to push through its existing cuts programme and any other necessary unpopular measures. Yesterday Mr Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the main opposition Social Democrats, said his party was willing to co-operate with the government in creating a broad economic policy to deal with the country's rising unemployment, huge budget deficit and high interest rates but that Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, would have to drop any further plans to cut taxes.</p>

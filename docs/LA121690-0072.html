			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW FEDERAL CHILD-CARE LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO BUILD IN THE  FUTURE  </P> <P> Harry Bernstein's column, "New Child-Care Law Gets a D-Minus" (Nov. 13),  downgrades the achievement marked by the United States' first national  child-care legislation.  </P> <P> Bernstein correctly points out that compared to European countries the United  States lags far behind in its support for child-care facilities, parental leave  policies and access to prenatal care.  </P> <P> But he fails to mention that this is a beginning.  </P> <P> The law provides $2.5-billion in federal child-care block-grant funds over  three years, $1.5 billion over five years to help families at risk of welfare  dependency to purchase child care and $18.2 billion in tax relief for  low-income working families. California will receive $67.6 million of these  funds in fiscal 1991.  </P> <P> The legislation will improve the quality and availability of child care. The  safeguards and protections for those in child care will affect all children,  not just those who are publicly subsidized. Most important, the legislation  provides a base from which we can work to improve national and state child-care  services and policies in the years ahead.  </P> <P> JUNE SOLNIT SALE  </P> <P> RUTH ROEMER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Sale is director of UCLA's Child-Care Services. Roemer, a professor at the  School of Public Health, is chair of UCLA's Child-Care Services advisory board.  </P></p>

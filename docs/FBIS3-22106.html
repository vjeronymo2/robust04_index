The Tajik KHOVAR agency learned from military sources that  there was an armed clash between the border guards and the  infiltrators. There were no casualties among the servicemen.  Two smugglers were detained. Of late, this is not the first  instance of contraband deals between Afghans and locals.  Recently, Russian border guards detained about 20 smugglers who  tried to take a consignment from Afghan to Tajik territory.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Observer: Legal tangle Solicitor Bill Loveluck-Edwards was brought to book for being improperly dressed when he appeared to defend in a drink-drive case at Bridgend. Although formally clad in black jacket and pin-striped trousers, he had a shoelace undone, and magistrate Bryon Butler threw him out of court for it. Afterwards the magistrate admitted he had been a bit severe, but explained that the solicitor had previously irked him by sitting in court reading a novel. 'That makes it one-all,' he added.</p>

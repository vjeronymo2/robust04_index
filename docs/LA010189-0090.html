			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> RECRUITMENTS CALLED PHONY  </P> <P> The American Legion's top recruiter in California turned in more than 200 phony  membership registrations, including ones for a former German soldier and people  who were dead, according to a Legion report. Costa Mesa Post Cmdr. Robert  Hanson could be expelled from the American Legion, said state Cmdr. Andrew J.  Steffanic. A three-member Legion committee issued its findings in a 13-page  report signed by Steffanic. Hanson, 67, declined to discuss the report, but  said, "I am contemplating legal action." The state American Legion awarded  Hanson its Recruiter of the Year award after Hanson submitted 801 new  memberships between July 1, 1987, and the 1988 convention. But the  investigation found that only 18 of the supposed applicants paid dues by check,  while Hanson wrote about 25 checks to the Costa Mesa post for $8,249.60 from  his own account. The investigation began after national headquarters received  inquiries from people wondering why they were receiving the American Legion  Magazine. Hanson told state Legion officials that the 801 membership  applications were stolen Aug. 26 when someone broke into his car.  </P></p>

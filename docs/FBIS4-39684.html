			<p>BFN     [Text] The visit of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to  Moscow will be of non-official nature. He will come in order to  receive the Sholokhov literature award, Russian Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told Interfax on Thursday.    Karasin said that Karadzic had informed the Russian Foreign  Ministry on his visit and had asked to arrange for him several  meetings with Russian officials. "We will see how it will be.  The issue has not been solved yet since we do not know the  schedule of the officials who Karadzic wants to meet," Karasin  emphasized.    Karasin did not rule out meetings at the official level.</p>

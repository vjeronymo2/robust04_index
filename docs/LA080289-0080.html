			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENERGY DEPT. WANTS TO SPEND $19.5 BILLION BY 1995 TO CLEAN UP ITS NUCLEAR  FACILITIES  </P> <P> The Energy Department, in an effort to address years of neglect at the nation's  atomic weapons plants, called Tuesday for spending $19.5 billion by 1995 to  clean up environmental problems and safety hazards at production facilities  across the country.  </P> <P> The clean-up plan would have a significant impact on the federal budget.  Currently, less than $2 billion a year is spent on such efforts. Under the  department's proposal, spending would escalate to $4 billion in fiscal 1995.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Job to Take 30 Years  </P> <P> Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said that the "imaginative and unusual plan"  ultimately would cost far more than $19.5 billion because it would take 30  years to complete.  </P> <P> But he provided no estimate of the total cost. He said only that previous  forecasts of $150 billion over 50 years involved "too much money and too much  time."  </P> <P> In remarks at the National Press Club, Watkins said that his 30-year plan "will  seem like too long to some people and unattainable to others. But we believe  that it is as close to being realistic as we can get."  </P> <P> The secretary, preparing for what is sure to be a lively debate in Congress  over the proposed funding levels, said that the nuclear weapons system's  problems are so severe and have been neglected for so long that high costs are  unavoidable.  </P> <P> "All in all, the (Energy Department) suffers from a lack of investment in the  infrastructure and facilities that any good business must make to stay  healthy," Watkins said. "If we were graded for quality control, we would not  pass."  </P> <P> A number of facilities, including major weapons plants in Colorado and Ohio,  have been the subject of investigations by both the Environmental Protection  Agency and the FBI. Operations at some key plants have been shut down because  of safety and environmental problems.  </P> <P> Most of the $19.5 billion would be used at 17 nuclear weapons plants in a dozen  states, but some money would be allocated for clean-up efforts at more than 70  other government nuclear facilities, most of which have long been shut down,  officials said.  </P> <P> Among heavily contaminated sites targeted by the clean-up plan are the Rocky  Flats plutonium processing plant near Denver, the Savannah River weapons plant  in South Carolina, the Hanford Reservation in eastern Washington state, the  Fernald uranium processing plant in Ohio, the Oak Ridge Reservation in  Tennessee and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls.  </P> <P> Officials estimated that about $1 billion would be devoted over the next five  years to repairing equipment and correcting conditions to bring the facilities  into compliance with federal and state environment and health laws. An  additional $9 billion would be earmarked for cleaning contaminated sites of  radioactive or otherwise hazardous wastes. And another $9 billion would be used  to develop future waste management operations.  </P> <P> Watkins called for states to work with the Energy Department in reaching  compromise agreements to clean up hazardous waste at weapons plants that are  not in compliance with environmental and safety laws.  </P> <P> "We have to do it in a fiscally responsible way and not put everybody in jail  because we're out of compliance today with the law," he said.  </P> <P> He hailed recent compliance agreements that the Energy Department has reached  with top officials in Washington state and Colorado to clean up the Hanford and  Rocky Flats facilities.  </P> <P> Although the Energy Department is developing plans to move nuclear waste to new  sites in Nevada and New Mexico for storage, Watkins said he hopes that  eventually most of the waste could be stored at production sites.  </P> <P> "We intend to do everything scientifically feasible to solve (waste) problems  in place and not transfer problems from one hole in the ground to another hole  in the ground," he said. "Previously, the principal waste management strategy  has been to leave contaminants in the ground until the money or muscle could be  found to dig them up in one place and then move them somewhere else . . . .  This is very expensive and only postpones the long-term storage of these  toxics."  </P> <P> Watkins said that his "highest waste technology priority, one I am challenging  our national labs to solve, is how to treat such contamination without moving  it."  </P> <P> Watkins disclosed that the controversial Rocky Flats plant came within hours  last Friday of being forced to shut down because radioactive wastes were found  stored in violation of EPA regulations. But an agreement was reached on how to  deal with the drums.  </P></p>

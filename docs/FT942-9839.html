			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / NatWest enters Hong Kong broking venture National Westminster Bank is to re-establish an equity broking operation in Hong Kong three years after closing its broking arm there. It is setting up a Dollars 100m (Pounds 68.4m) joint venture with Wheelock, the local merchant house. The venture, which will initially employ about 100, is the latest attempt by European and US investment banks to expand in Hong Kong and China. Although NatWest Markets, National Westminster's corporate and investment banking arm, already has lending, structured finance and fund management operations in Hong Kong, the venture re-establishes a stockbroking presence. The partners are to announce the deal in London today. They are each investing about Dollars 50m and expect that the operation, to be called Wheelock NatWest, will not require further capital unless it expands greatly. Wheelock, which already has links in China as a Hong Kong trading house, has wanted to expand into financial services. At the moment, it has a small broking operation with a seat on the Hong Kong exchange. Mr Martin Owen, NatWest Markets chief executive, said that the bank believed that setting up a joint venture would help it to overcome any local scepticism caused by its decision to close down in loss-making broking arm in 1991. Mr John Howland-Jackson, deputy chief executive of NatWest Markets, said that it considered buying a local broking house, but 'we believed that we would either end up paying through the nose or buying something of questionable quality'. Mr Nicholas Sibley, managing director of Wheelock CIC, who will be deputy chairman of the venture, said it was the only venture 'which marries a heavyweight bank with a local house which has as good connections in China as anybody'. Wheelock has already applied for a seat on the Shanghai stock exchange, which would be transferred to the joint venture if approved. Mr Owen said that while NatWest Markets could distribute equity globally, it believed that it would have been 'a long, hard struggle' to establish a strong underwriting arm in Hong Kong without Wheelock's connections.</p>

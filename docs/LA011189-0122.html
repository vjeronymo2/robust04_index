			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCC COMES OUT FIRING IN SECOND HALF TO WIN  </P> <P> Southern California College came back from a sluggish first half Tuesday night  to defeat California Baptist, 96-78, in the Golden State Athletic Conference  opener for both teams at SCC.  </P> <P> "It was like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde game," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "We  just didn't have the intensity the first half, but really got things together  later."  </P> <P> SCC (12-2) is ranked second in the latest National Christian Collegiate  Athletic Assn. poll.  </P> <P> "We didn't come out very hard. Maybe we were in awe of their jumping ability,  but I let (the team) know I was disappointed," Reynolds said. "We needed to  play Vanguard defense, a little more tenacious with a lot more intensity. "  </P> <P> The Vanguards did just that. Trailing, 37-32, they came out from what Reynolds  called his shortest halftime speech ever to score 8 unanswered points, sparked  by a steal and layup by junior Terry Scruggs, to take the lead, 40-37.  </P> <P> "I really didn't say all that much to them. I just spoke for 3 minutes and told  them what everybody here already knew, that we played poorly in the first half.  I don't know what they said and decided individually or collectively, but they  came out and played the style we needed to to beat quality teams, " Reynolds  said.  </P> <P> Cal Baptist came within 3 points, 48-45, with 15 minutes to play after SCC's  Jeff Bickmore, who finished with 21 points and 9 rebounds, traded baskets three  times with four-time All-Conference player Michael Banks. But SCC was able to  pull away for the victory.  </P> <P> Banks had a game-high 26 points, despite picking up 3 fouls guarding Bickmore  in the first 10 minutes.  </P> <P> "Bickmore did a great job of faking and played outstandingly on defense, but we  didn't try to foul Banks, it just happened," Reynolds said.  </P> <P> SCC trailed, 23-13, 6 minutes into the first half, but managed to cut the lead  to 37-32 at the half. Cal Baptist outrebounded the Vanguards, 13-10, during the  first half, but SCC forced 12 turnovers and pulled down 18 rebounds in the  second half.  </P></p>

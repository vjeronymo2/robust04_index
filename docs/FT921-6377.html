			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (12): VAT helps to rob gold of its magic - Krugerrands KRUGERRANDS HAVE not received any promotion or advertising support for seven years. Yet there can be very few readers who do not recognise their name. They are the coins launched by South Africa in 1967 to provide investors with the opportunity to buy gold in small quantities. As the world's biggest gold producer, South Africa had a vested interest in this attempt to turn small investors into big 'gold bugs'. During the following 18 years, Krugerrands dominated the gold coin market. More than 44m troy ounces of gold was used to make them (about 1,400 tonnes), and sales spurted to a peak of more than 6m ounces, or 170 tonnes, in 1978. But demand had dropped to 1m ounces by 1985, the year sanctions were imposed against South Africa by the US and the European Community. Sanctions recently have been removed - the EC's as recently as January 28 this year - and the South Africans have been working on a detailed marketing strategy to re-launch the Krugerrand. But they won't say when. Their reluctance is understandable. Many private investors have lost all interest in gold, and this is an exceptionally difficult time in the gold coin market. Demand is at the lowest level for many years, and forecasts suggest that the combined sales of the five best-selling coins last year reached only about half the 2.4m ounces sold in 1990. The position is even more disastrous in the UK, because since 1982 investors have had to pay value added tax, currently 17.5 per cent, to take delivery at home (this cannot be reclaimed when the gold is sold). The imposition of VAT virtually killed off investment by private individuals in physical gold in the UK, even though the tax can be avoided if the metal is delivered offshore. Today, a UK private investor has tremendous difficulty trying to find someone to deal with if gold bars or coins are on the shopping list. All the big bullion houses have dropped out of the business, and will only look after long-standing private customers. There are other deterrents, apart from VAT, to investment in physical gold: no interest is paid on the cash invested; there are storage and extra insurance costs; there is a currency risk, because gold's price is denominated in dollars. Gains on its price will often be offset by losses on the dollar. But the main reason gold has fallen out of favour with private investors is that it simply has not lived up to its reputation of being 'a store of value' over time. The price has been falling steadily for more than three years. Over the past 10 years, gold has given up about 70 per cent of its value in real terms. Gold bought 10 years ago at Dollars 459.25 an ounce should now be valued at Dollars 823 just to match an investment netting a modest compound 6 per cent rate of interest. Last year gold's price averaged Dollars 362, and many analysts suggest that it may manage Dollars 400 or thereabouts in 1992. There are signs that the market's structure has changed. In the past 10 years, a host of gold-backed financial instruments, such as gold options, has eroded the importance of the physical gold market and helped to curb the price volatility which used to attract short-term speculators. Moreover, the market is being dampened by the behaviour of the gold producers themselves, who seem to have little faith that the price will recover substantially. Every time the price rallies there is a rush by producers to sell forward - that is, to fix future delivery at a determined price and 'lock in' a profit. Edwin Arnold, a vice-president and metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, says the vast bulk of private and institutional money that would have gone into gold or gold futures 10 years ago now goes into financial futures or derivative gold option products instead. He adds: 'Gold is not some magical store of value. There is nothing mystical about gold. It is really nothing more than a high-priced industrial metal.'</p>

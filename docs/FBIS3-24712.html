			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The interim government says it will not tolerate any  attempt to stir political division or sow seeds of ethnic  discord in war-torn Liberia due to the selfish acts of  ethnically bound political aspirants. The government issued a  stern warning to all those who may want to cause ethnic and  tribal problems that the government, in the interest of peace  and the resolution of our devastating conflict, will spare no  legal measures in preventing any such individuals from  sabotaging the concrete steps being made towards peace.    The government said it would take action against any narrow  ethnic trend that would prefer to put tribal ambition over and  above the national interest, especially when that ambition is  not supported by the totality of the Liberian people.    The government was reacting to newspaper reports of a  statement said to have been filed by Mr. Melvin Nguaya and  approved by Mr. Joseph Kononia, alleging to have been issued on  behalf of Bong County citizens. The interim government noted  that the statement issued threats and [word indistinct] to whip  up ethnic-based frenzy in the safe haven that has been created  by ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group].    Government noted that the statement has no motive but to  create ethnic divisions among Liberians, especially at a time  when every effort is being made by the interim government,  ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States], and the  international community to bring to a close the war in which the  ethnic factor has been so prominent.    A press statement issued yesterday said the interim  government is indeed disappointed because at a time when ECOMOG  has successfully created a safe haven in Monrovia and its  environs and one which reflects the largest ethnic diversity  ever, Mr. Kononia and official of government, and his  collaborators will choose to use that same safe haven to fall  back on base ethnic sentiments to promote a political  personality.    The interim government says it would prefer that Mr. Kononia  and Mr. Nguaya use the safehaven -- that is Monrovia and  environs -- more constructively to advance the cause of peace  instead of pursuing narrow political goals based solely on  ethnic division. Mr. Kononia and his like, the statement said,  seem to have forgotten that Mr. Kuyon was elected by the interim  government not because he is a Tele man and that one of his  accomplishments made under the promotion of the IGNU [Interim  Government of National Unity] was based on the fact he was Tele.    The interim government believes that if individuals like Mr.  Kononia and Mr. Nguaya are truly committed to the promotion of  the political fortunes of Mr. Kuyon, they will do well to  organize a political campaign at the appropriate time to promote  Mr. Kuyon's candidacy for any elected high office in this  country rather than make an ethnically based claim on a position  to which the interim government had earlier appointed Mr. Kuyon  in the first place.    The release said they should also be reminded that the IGNU  is currently actively preoccupied with working closely with  ECOWAS and the international community to bring to an end such  ethnic dissensions that are being manifested in the formation of  the so-called Lofa Defense Force and now the Bong Resistance  Movement. The government wishes to emphasize that no one should  mistake its resolve to protect the with all the resources at its  disposal the safe haven that has been created for our war-weary  people in Monrovia and its environs.    Meanwhile, the interim government has called on Mr. Kuyon to  demonstrate his avowed statesmanship and love of country by  ensuring that no ethnic-based organization uses his name or  otherwise put him in complicity in an effort to sabotage the  peace process and the national good. The statement concluded by  saying that there is no more room in this country for tribally  based politicians.</p>

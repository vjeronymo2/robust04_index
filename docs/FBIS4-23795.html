			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The cease-fire concluded in Rwanda should have  already come into effect. Until now the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic  Front] was hostile to the principle of a truce: it considered  that the fighting and the massacres had to be stopped at the  same time. [passage omitted]    Dominique de Courcelles met with Theodore Sindikubwabo, the  interim president of Rwanda. She asked him how this cease-fire  will be implemented:    [Begin recording] [Sindikubwabo] The peace agreement was  proposed by a facilitator and a mediator assisted by the OAU  secretary general. So it is for them to announce it -- the OAU  or the United Nations.    [De Courcelles] Today?    [Sindikubwabo] Today or perhaps tomorrow. They must announce  that there is a cease-fire that has been agreed on. So they are  to show the instruments of the cease-fire, in other words the  documents, countersigned by both sides. Then we, as the  government, will give orders to our troops and orders to the  members of the government to ensure that this peace agreement is  respected. [end recording]</p>

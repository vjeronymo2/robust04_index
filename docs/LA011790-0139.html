			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IBM'S EARNINGS TUMBLE 74%  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp. today announced that its fourth-quarter  earnings fell 74%, largely because of previously announced restructuring costs  aimed at making the world's biggest computer company more profitable.  </P> <P> IBM said earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $600 million, or  $1.04 a share, compared to $2.3 billion, or $3.97 a share, a year earlier.  </P> <P> Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $20.5 billion, up 2.3% from $20 billion.  </P> <P> The company attributed the decline mostly to a previously announced  $2.4-billion charge against its fourth-quarter results to reflect the expenses  of restructuring its U.S. business, which has been in a prolonged slump.  </P> <P> IBM's earnings are scrutinized because they reflect broader trends in the  computer business. The company is the largest manufacturer of of information  processing equipment and systems and is a historical leader in shaping the  direction of the industry.  </P> <P> For the year, IBM said earnings fell 40% to $3.8 billion, or $6.47 a share,  from $5.8 billion, or $6.47 a share, in 1988.

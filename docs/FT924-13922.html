			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Lucas hits the brakes Lucas has been looking optimistically over the horizon for economic recovery almost since the recession started. Yesterday's annual figures finally included an Pounds 84m restructuring package, but Lucas still seems to take the notion that an upturn will cure its basic ills. The management talks of aiming to pay the full Pounds 49m dividend from operating earnings in 1992-93, when in the year just past it came entirely from reserves. Given that the company admits the first six months are unlikely to be much better than 1991-92, that implies quite a turnaround in the second half. Cash is also a headache. When the company scooped up its Pounds 90m windfall from the pension fund last year, it expected gearing to fall from 40 per cent to below 30 per cent. It is now 44 per cent. The new finance director, Mr John Grant, will have to get a firm grip on working capital to prevent gearing rising further. The new programme for disposing of non-core businesses may not produce much by the way of profits above book value. It is probably more important that it will bring in cash. Perhaps comparison with the likes of GKN, which battened down the hatches early in the recession, is a little unfair. Lucas has good products too, but its markets may be more competitive. Capital spending is needed to keep up. Nonetheless, a poor long-term record for cash generation is just the type of problem the likes of BTR enjoy sorting out. Unless Lucas addresses the issue itself, it may find that keeping shareholders sweet with their own money is not enough.</p>

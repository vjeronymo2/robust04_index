			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Much has been said this week about the suspension  of Russian oil suppplies to our country. According to the latest  reports from Moscow, everything is all right now. Ambassador to  Russia Roman Paldan, with whom our permanent correspondent to  Moscow talked this morning, has more details.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Smihula] I know that you  held intensive talks this morning with the senior staff at  relevant ministries and offices. A while ago you spoke on the  telephone to (Valeriy Chernayev), president of the Russian  company Neftetrans. Ambassador, what is the latest development?    [Paldan] The end result is that oil supplies to Slovakia  will  be resumed at 1200 hrs today.    [Smihula] Do you mean our time or Moscow time?    [Paldan] Moscow time.    [Smihula] This means then that Russian oil should have begun  traveling toward our country when the lunchtime edition of  Radiozurnal is on the air.    [Paldan] It is expected that the throughput of 27,000 tonnes  in 24 hours will be achieved shortly. This is close to the  normal throughput, I would say. Available at the present time  are 150,000 tonnes of oil, for which documentation has been  issued. Work on further quantities is going on in order to  ensure a continuous flow and subsequently also continuous  production in Slovnaft [Bratislava-based refinery working on  Russian oil].

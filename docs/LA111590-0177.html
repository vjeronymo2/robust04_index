			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> PIERCE CALLS AUDIBLE TO AVOID PAC-10 CLASH  </P> <P> Pierce College will play a rare Friday night football game this week against  Bakersfield. Asked why, Brahma Coach Bob Enger gives a seven-letter answer:  USC-UCLA.  </P> <P> The Trojan-Bruin rivalry, which will be renewed at 12:30 p.m. Saturday at the  Rose Bowl, has caused Enger much grief over the years.  </P> <P> "Because the 'SC-UCLA game is usually on during the day, junior college players  are never focused for their games later that night," Enger said. "I don't want  to compete with that. Therefore, I've tried for years to schedule our games for  Friday. That way, the players are focused."  </P> <P> Enger came to his conclusion in the mid-1960s when he was coach at East Los  Angeles College. The Huskies were expected to crush Rio Hondo one year but were  nearly upset.  </P> <P> "It was bad," Enger recalled. "The 'SC-UCLA game started late, and the kids  were on the bus on the way to the game listening to it on radios. . . . We  turned what should have been a blowout into a very close game."  </P> <P> Victory showers: Of the handful of Valley-area coaches who received celebratory  dousings after important victories last weekend, credit Enger with extra credit  for style points.  </P> <P> It took Pierce players two tries to drench Enger, who avoided the first attempt  with a nifty sprint down the sideline that he punctuated with a somersault onto  the field in the final minutes of the Brahmas' 35-14 decision over archrival  Valley.  </P> <P> "They didn't get me the first time," Enger crowed. "I was too quick for them.  But they came back five minutes later when I was watching the game.  </P> <P> "I thought you had one attempt to get the coach and that was it. But they were  playing by a different set of rules."  </P> <P> Glendale football Coach John Cicuto and Master's soccer Coach Mark Schubert  weren't as nimble-footed or nimble-minded. They both got doused on the first  try.  </P> <P> But neither complained: Glendale upset Moorpark, 45-21 and Master's defeated  Westmont, 3-2, in overtime to win the NAIA District 3 soccer championship.  </P> <P> Mired in obscurity: Like Rodney Dangerfield, the Cal State Northridge men's  basketball program gets little respect. So little that two of the nation's  leading college basketball magazines are unaware that the Matadors now play at  the NCAA Division I level.  </P> <P> CSUN is not listed with the other Division I independents in either Street  &amp; Smith's College/Prep Basketball magazine or The Sporting News College  Basketball Yearbook.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Basketball Times is aware of the Matadors.  </P> <P> Its comment: "Welcome aboard."  </P> <P> Quotebook: Northridge basketball Coach Pete Cassidy on Todd Bowser, the  Matadors' 6-foot-7 center who has steadily been taking weight off his 300-pound  frame: "It is hard to see the weight in Todd. It is like throwing a deck chair  off an ocean liner."  </P> <P> Pirates' U-turn: After losing its first six games, Ventura has turned its  season around with three consecutive victories and will, believe it or not, be  playing for a possible bowl berth when it meets heavily favored Moorpark on  Saturday.  </P> <P> A victory would give Ventura a 4-1 record in the Western State Conference  Northern Division, good for second place behind Glendale. If Glendale chose to  go to another bowl, Ventura would receive the Northern Division's berth in the  WSC Bowl.  </P> <P> "As crazy as that sounds, I suppose that's possible," Ventura Coach Dick James  said.  </P> <P> James attributes the turnaround to several factors, among them a decision five  weeks ago to delete the option from the offense.  </P> <P> Also, two key Ventura offensive players have increased their production. In the  past three games running back Tony Williams has rushed for 470 yards -- 36 more  than he gained in the first six games. Quarterback Tim Albrent, meanwhile, has  completed 32 of 58 passes for 415 yards after completing 56 of 102 for 737 in  his first six outings.  </P> <P> In addition, wide receiver Chris Thomas has caught 11 passes for 93 yards after  grabbing 17 for 214 in the first six games. Thomas had more than 200  all-purpose yards last week in a 29-26 win over Harbor.  </P> <P> Three's a crowd: Three teams -- Pierce, Ventura and Cuesta -- have tied for the  Western State Conference women's volleyball championship with 16-2 conference  records. But because only two WSC teams automatically qualify for the state  tournament, the tie will have to be broken.  </P> <P> Pierce will play Ventura tonight at 6 at Moorpark College, and the winner will  play Cuesta on Friday at 6 p.m. at Santa Barbara City College.  </P> <P> The winner of the Pierce-Ventura match will qualify for state, as will Cuesta.  The Friday match will be held for seeding purposes.  </P> <P> All is not lost for the Pierce-Ventura loser, however. The third-place team  also usually receives a bid.  </P> <P> Statwatch: The two teams that have defeated Moorpark in football have a  combined record of 16-2; the seven teams Moorpark has defeated have a  cumulative record of 24-39. . . .  </P> <P> Freddie Bradley had only 90 rushing yards against Glendale, marking the first  time since last season's Orange County Classic that Bradley failed to gain 100  yards. In that game, Rancho Santiago held him to 68 yards. . . .  </P> <P> Antelope Valley intercepted five passes against Mt. San Jacinto. That gave the  Marauders 20 interceptions this season, five shy of the school record set in  1974. . . .  </P> <P> Tailback Bobby Webster of Glendale has set school single-season records for  touchdowns (19) and rushing touchdowns (19) this season. He is also closing in  on the rushing mark of 1,343 yards, set by Henry Longoria in 1975. Webster, who  has rushed for more than 100 yards in seven consecutive games, has gained 1,235  yards this season. . . .  </P> <P> Going the distance: Marcial Beltran expected a change in the academic  atmosphere after transferring to Occidental College from Fullerton College.  What he didn't expect was a change in his cross-country running tactics.  </P> <P> Beltran is undefeated against NCAA Division III competition this season, but he  says racing five miles -- a mile more than he did in junior college -- was a  learning experience.  </P> <P> At the Fresno Invitational in September, Beltran bolted to the lead midway  through the race before fading to eighth place. But at both the Southern  California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championships two weeks ago and  the Division III Far West regional last Saturday, Beltran held back until the  later stages before breaking away and setting course records.  </P> <P> "I'm starting to get used to racing five miles," said Beltran, the national  junior college record-holder in the marathon at 2 hours 17 minutes 26 seconds.  "You have to think about your strategy and when to make your move. The extra  mile makes a big difference."  </P> <P> The Occidental men and women will compete Saturday in the Division III national  meet in Grinnell, Iowa.  </P> <P> Staff writers John Ortega, Theresa Munoz, Brendan Healey and Kirby Lee  contributed to this notebook.  </P> <P> ONE-MAN GANG  </P> <P> When it comes to touchdowns via the rush or on special teams, Moorpark College  turns to Freddie Bradley. In two seasons, Bradley has scored 49 of the 70  touchdowns the Raiders have scored in the aforementioned manner.  </P> <P> 1989 Regular Season  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.89IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rushing  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Returns  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bradley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Others  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 46*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> 1990 Regular Season  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.89IN:1.56IN:1.78IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rush  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Return  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bradley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 24  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Others  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 43*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Includes passing touchdowns and  </P> <P> touchdowns scored by the defense  </P> <P> RUSHING TOUCHDOWNSWith one regular-season game left, Bradley already has rushed  for more regular-season touchdowns than any other junior college player in  history.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:3.32IN:1.45IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Player  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> School, Years  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> TDs  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Freddie Bradley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Moorpark, '89-90  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 45  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> O.J.

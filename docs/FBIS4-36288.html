			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with "South Yemen Prime Minister" Haydar Abu-Bakr </F> al-'Attas by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] [Abu-Husayn] Sanaa has announced its commitment to  halting the fighting since the adoption of the Security Council  resolution. In fact military operations have escalated. What  is the situation and how do you view it?    [Al-'Attas] On my arrival in Cairo I received a report from  Aden on a telephone conversation intercepted between President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and commanders of the military units, in  which he literally says: "The military situation must be  settled within 14 hours." So he wants to occupy Aden. And he  is currently hitting strategic installations and civilian  installations. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Yemen  [DRY] has announced its acceptance of the cease-fire and  committed itself to implementing it. So northern forces have  exploited the situation and begun to launch their attacks on  vital facilities. As is known, they have shelled oil refineries  in the south, in addition to the extensive artillery bombardment  of residential areas to kill more people and abort the  resistance in the DRY.    The present military situation is a serious escalation. I  openly declare that Sanaa is resorting to evasion even in the  statement issued by it. This statement does not offer open and  clear acceptance of the Security Council resolution. They are  always lying. We believe that this lying to the international  community will result in very disastrous consequences.    [Abu-Husayn] In your view, can northern forces occupy Aden  within 14 hours on orders from the general command of the units  on the various fronts?    [Al-'Attas] I say this from a position of confidence: Let  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih himself and the world around him be assured  that Aden will not fall, nor will he occupy it. Aden fighters  will struggle to defend it. I admit that Aden could suffer  heavily and be exposed to destruction, but it will not fall into  the north's hands. We say to the international community that  the DRY has complied and implemented the cease-fire. But the  north has exploited the situation and is trying to occupy, and  we are now in a position of defense.    [Abu-Husayn] Have you requested international forces from  the United Nations to protect Aden?    [Al-'Attas] Yes, we requested that early on, as we know the  intentions of the north. And now the Security Council is  responsible for implementing its resolution. We informed the  Security Council the day before yesterday of the military  escalation by Sanaa. We have also briefed the United States and  all the parties exerting efforts to halt the fighting on  developments in the situation.    [Abu-Husayn] With the arrival of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi  in Yemen, do you expect the fighting to be halted?    [Al-'Attas] We hope so, and once Sanaa complies, we will end  the state of defense.    [Abu-Husayn] Do you have specific demands for Lakhdar  Ibrahimi?    [Al-'Attas] Our demands are known. They are summed up as  follows: First, a halt to the fighting. Second, send  international forces to disengage the forces. Then we would  continue to implement the Security Council resolution without  any reservations or conditions. We are willing to engage in a  dialogue, negotiations, and anything else except the imposition  of unity by force of arms or the wish to achieve personal  interests for a partisan alliance, as is currently happening  between the [General People's] Congress and the [Yemeni] Reform  Grouping in the north.    [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the positions of Britain and  France on safeguarding Yemen's unity and nonrecognition of the  new state?    [Al-'Attas] We have made contacts with them. They support  the Security Council resolution, to which all states, including  the DRY, have agreed.    [Abu-Husayn] Are you thinking of visiting a number of Arab  capitals? What about the results of your visits to the Kingdom  of Saudi Arabia and Egypt?    [Al-'Attas] They were very good. They were designed to  exert all efforts and pressures to halt the ongoing war. I also  intend to visit a number of Arab capitals. Especially as the  military escalation by Sanaa is exposing the region to great  dangers. Because the war is currently taking place on the  borders of some fraternal countries, as in the northern area in  Shabwah. At the least, the result is the emigration of huge  numbers of homeless people and victims of war.    [Abu-Husayn] Foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation  Council [GCC] issued a statement tacitly recognizing the DRY.  What is your opinion?    [Al-'Attas] We welcome the statement issued by the GCC  foreign ministers. We consider it a good start for establishing  distinct and special relations. We also thank them for their  supportive and strong stands aimed at securing a cease-fire.  They must be given the credit for their resolution, which is  nothing but the voice of reason. Because unity cannot be  imposed by force of arms. Besides, reason prompts us all --  including Sanaa -- to respond to the Security Council  resolutions in order to safeguard what is left of Yemen and to  safeguard the region's security and future.    And finally, we must thank all the Gulf states, as well as  Egypt, Syria, and Morocco, for their courageous stands regarding  safeguarding Yemen's unity and their eagerness to spare it  destruction -- something President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has not  done.    [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the present U.S. position?    [Al-'Attas] The U.S. position is similar to ours. It  supports the Security Council resolution, a halt to the  fighting, and the call for a dialogue. We welcome that. The  question of recognition is a formal matter, because we were a  state in the past, and all is needed now is restore the  situation to its previous status.</p>

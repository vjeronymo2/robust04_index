			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY PACIFIC LIKELY TO BUY MERCURY S&amp;L  </P> <P> Federal regulators are expected to announce today that they have sold insolvent  Mercury Savings &amp; Loan to Security Pacific Corp., which outbid several  other institutions for the Orange County thrift.  </P> <P> Industry sources said Thursday that the Los Angeles-based holding company for  Security Pacific National Bank earlier this week won the bidding to acquire  Huntington Beach-based Mercury's 24 branches and most of its $2 billion in  assets.  </P> <P> The branches are expected to be reopened Monday as offices of Security Pacific.  Deposits will continue to be insured by the federal government up to $100,000.  </P> <P> Mercury was declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators in February. It  has been operated since then under auspices of the Resolution Trust Corp., the  federal agency charged with selling or liquidating government-run S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> If the sale is completed today, it would mark one of the quickest sales of a  thrift under RTC supervision. The agency is overseeing several hundred S&amp;Ls  nationally, including 18 that have been offered for sale in California since  June.  </P> <P> Edward Carpenter, a banking consultant with Southport/Carpenter Group in Santa  Ana, said several of his firm's clients were active bidders for Mercury and  valued the thrift for what is widely considered one of the industry's better  branch networks and customer bases.  </P> <P> Other bidders reportedly included Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly  Hills, American Savings Bank of Irvine and Santa Monica-based First Federal  Savings Bank of California.  </P> <P> Officials at Security Pacific confirmed Thursday that the company, with nearly  $95 billion in assets, had submitted a bid for Mercury. They declined further  comment.  </P> <P> Security Pacific has been shopping for troubled thrifts this year. In June, the  company acquired 83 branches of Simi Valley-based Gibraltar Savings.  </P> <P> At RTC regional headquarters in Denver, spokesman Kevin Shields would not  identify the winning bidder.  </P></p>

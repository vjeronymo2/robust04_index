Cermak, ODS executive  deputy chairman, said "the ODS is convinced that the issue could  be solved relatively quickly."    ODS Chairman and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that the  council had not discussed the restitution of gentry's property,  but would deal with it later. He added that the party would not  like all property relations in the Czech Republic to be  complicated due to pure legislation.    Some 200 restitution claims have been made by the gentry,  including 75 cases which reportedly fall under the Benes  decrees. The decrees of 1945 provided for the expropriation of  Germans, Hungarians, and other collaborators with the Nazis.    ODS Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach said that the ODS staff in  charge of the local elections, slated for the autumn, had  convoked a meeting of all regions' representatives in Nymburk,  central Bohemia, on January 31."</p>

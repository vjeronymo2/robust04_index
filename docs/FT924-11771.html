			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T turns in record income AT&amp;T, the US telecom-munications giant, yesterday reported a 16.1 per cent rise in third-quarter operational income, despite the weakness of the US economy, helped by solid results from long-distance telecommunications and financial services. The company reported record quarterly net income of Dollars 963m, or 72 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.79bn, or Dollars 1.40 a share, in the same period of last year when it took Dollars 4.2bn of charges. Excluding special charges, operational income totalled Dollars 829m. Revenues were Dollars 16.18bn, up from Dollars 15.63bn. The results were broadly in line with expectations. Wall Street's mean estimate of earnings per share, as tracked by the IBES information service, was 73 cents. The company said that NCR, the computer company AT&amp;T acquired last year and merged with its own computer operations, had operating income of Dollars 49m. It said the figures were not comparable to the subsidiary's pre-merger financial results. 'NCR continues to report strong orders in the US, but orders outside the US weakened as a result of the computer industry's slump worldwide,' it added. AT&amp;T's telecommunications services revenues grew Dollars 315m, or 3.2 per cent, from Dollars 9.8bn to Dollars 10.2bn, as long-distance calling volumes rose about 6 per cent. The company's credit card unit reported its first profitable quarter since it was launched two years ago and helped produce a 35 per cent increase in financial services revenues, up from Dollars 358m to Dollars 485m. Sales of products and systems saw a 1.7 per cent rise in revenues, to Dollars 3.87bn from Dollars 3.81bn, led by higher sales of micro-electronic components and business phone systems. For the nine months net income was Dollars 2.81bn, or Dollars 2.11 a share, on revenues of Dollars 47.4bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 113m, or 9 cents, after charges last year on revenues of Dollars 46.63bn.</p>

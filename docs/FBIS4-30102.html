			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- A seminar on "1. The  Origin of the Chuche Idea" from "On the Chuche Idea", a famous  work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, was held by the  group for the study of the idea and theory of Comrade Kim  Chong-il in Lebanon.    Saying that the chuche idea raised man's position and role  in  the world as the fundamental question of philosophy and  elucidated the philosophical principle that man is the master of  everything and decides everything, the reporter noted: "The  Korean people have built a powerful socialist country of  independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence on  the land of Korea on the basis of the chuche idea."    A seminar on the work "Our Socialism Centred on the Masses  Shall Not Perish" was held at the Secretariat of the  Agricultural Hydraulics of the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation  Front] Party of Mozambique.    Noting that Korea's socialism is strong because the leader,  the party and the masses form a harmonious whole, speakers said:  "The imperialists are trying to destroy the socialism of Korea,  but it is a foolish dream."    A seminar on the work "Young Men and Women, Be the Vanguard  Unfailingly Loyal to the Party and the Leader" was held at the  society for the study of Kim Chong-il's works in Hwazana  District, Harare Province, Zimbabwe.</p>

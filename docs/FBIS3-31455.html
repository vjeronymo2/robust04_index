			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zvornik, 17 Feb (TANJUG) -- Major General Manojlo  Milovanovic, chief of general staff of the army of the Serb  Republic [in Bosnia-Herzegovina], told TANJUG today that the  Sarajevo cease-fire agreement is mainly being observed, but that  the Muslim side has called into question an important part of  the agreement, which was reached at Sarajevo Airport on 9  February.    This morning, without any explanation, the Muslim side  refused to send its representatives to participate in the  continuation of the work of a tripartite commission, which has  already shown results, Milovanovic said. The task of the  commission, made up of representatives of the Serb and the  Muslim sides and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] officers, is to  draw up a solution for the control of the cease-fire.    The commission should have reached practical solutions on  the  basis of a direct insight into the situation in the field, which  for the most part has been done, between 10 February and today,  Gen. Milovanovic explained.    Due to the discontinuation of the work of the joint  commission, it is necessary to hold a meeting as early as today  between Serb and Muslim corps commanders and UNPROFOR troops in  Sarajevo, Milovanovic said.    He added that by hampering the work of the tripartite  commission the Muslim side has shown how much importance it  attaches to the control and observance of the cease-fire in the  Sarajevo area.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Lebanese-Syrian Summit Held </F> Suddenly in Damascus After U.S. Message to President al-Hirawi"]    [Excerpts] Beirut, London, Damascus -- Yesterday attention  was focused on the Lebanese-Syrian summit held in Damascus and  the investigation of crimes committed against the state's  internal security and related reactions. [passage omitted]    The arrangements for the summit were made after a meeting  held between Lebanese President al-Hirawi and U.S. Ambassador in  Beirut Mark Hambley.    Responsible Syrian sources in Damascus have stated that the  two presidents discussed and held consultations on the new  developments in the region and the results of Christopher's  visit and the Israeli proposals and ideas he brought with him on  the peace process, withdrawals from the Golan, dismantling of  the settlements, and especially the Lebanese question. They  also discussed the position of the two countries regarding the  current contacts for the resumption of the negotiations in  Washington, which is what Christopher is now working for,  particularly since the final signing of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement.    The two sides also reviewed the situation in Lebanon and  bilateral relations. The arrival of President al-Hirawi,  Speaker Birri, and Prime Minister al-Hariri was sudden and came  after a meeting in Beirut between President al-Hirawi and the  U.S. ambassador who delivered a message to him from Washington  on the peace process. According to Lebanese sources, the  message dealt with the situation in southern Lebanon and called  on Lebanon to seek a settlement with Israel, disarm Hizballah,  and put an end to the Lebanese resistance against Israel and its  collaborators.    Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi reaffirmed coordination of  their positions and effective moves to face the negative  consequences of the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    The sources believe that the U.S. message upset the Lebanese  leaders who immediately went to Damascus to discuss the  situation. The message warned that Israel might continue its  scorched-earth policy and carry out more score-settling  operations unless the Lebanese officials quickly cool the  situation in the south and unless they rejoin the peace process.

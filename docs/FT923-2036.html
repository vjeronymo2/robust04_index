			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Algerian rebels' conditions The spokesman for the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Mr Rabah Kebir, who three weeks ago fled house arrest in Annaba and took refuge abroad, has reiterated his movement's willingness for 'dialogue' with the Algerian authorities, writes Francis Ghiles. However, four conditions would have to be met. All those arrested since the electoral process was suspended and the FIS banned last January, should be released and 'arbitrary arrests' stopped. FIS municipal councillors elected in the June 1990 poll should be reinstated and all those arrested 'compensated'. The second round of the elections, whose first round last December 26 gave FIS candidates 48 per cent of the popular vote, must be allowed to proceed.</p>

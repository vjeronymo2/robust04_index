			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOO FEELING HOLLYWOOD HILLS HEAT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: HOMEOWNERS IN THE SCENIC AREA BITTERLY OBJECT TO THE COUNCILMAN'S  INTERVENTION THAT WOULD ALLOW A HOME BUILDER TO CHOP 80 FEET OFF PART OF A  RIDGE.  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo has come under sharp attack by some Hollywood Hills  homeowners for his efforts to help a corporate campaign contributor obtain  special exemptions it is seeking to build $192 million worth of mansions  overlooking Hollywood Reservoir.  </P> <P> The opposition to Woo and the project appears to be increasing, according to  several factions of area homeowners. They say that so far, they have collected  signatures from more than 1,300 residents and visitors to the reservoir area  who oppose Woo's actions on behalf of the Jefferson Development Corp.  </P> <P> The opponents' objections are many. They say the massive development project  will bring traffic and pollution to the wealthy neighborhood, and that it will  encroach on wildlife habitat and mar the scenic views.  </P> <P> Most of all, they object to the developer's plan to flatten a portion of a  ridge, reducing its elevation by 80 feet to create home sites.  </P> <P> Such a ridge cut would be in direct violation of a sweeping environmental  ordinance, the Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan, which after 17 years of  preparation is expected to come before the City Council for a vote within  weeks. In anticipation of this, Woo introduced an amendment to the Mulholland  plan early this year that would exempt Jefferson.  </P> <P> Jefferson executives say it would be feasible to build the subdivision without  the exemption, but that building it on a flattened ridge would make it more  attractive and, in many respects, environmentally more sound. They also say  that they have taken pains to seek out the opinions of nearby homeowners and  address their concerns, and that the project as a result is extraordinary in  its environmental sensitivity.  </P> <P> Indeed, some area homeowners have rushed to the defense of Woo and Jefferson.  They say a few disgruntled homeowners with hidden agendas and a well-organized  propaganda machine are attacking the councilman and the developer.  </P> <P> One of Woo's colleagues on the City Council, Zev Yaroslavsky, has gotten  involved, accusing Woo of "stooping to the very gutter of politics" because one  of his aides solicited and accepted a campaign contribution from Jefferson.  Seeking contributions from developers who have major projects pending is not  illegal, but Yaroslavsky has said he is one of several council members who take  pains to avoid such a relationship with developers when the project is in their  own district.  </P> <P> What is so sharply dividing the affluent neighborhoods high in the Hollywood  Hills is a project being touted by Jefferson and its Japanese backers as  "Bel-Air East."  </P> <P> In all, Jefferson wants to build 64 estate-sized homes, to be priced as high as  $3 million each, on a 172-acre parcel. The site, on the north side of the  reservoir and not far from Universal City, is the largest and last remaining  open canyon in the hills surrounding the reservoir, which also is known as Lake  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Arguments over the project's effects on traffic, pollution, wildlife and scenic  views, as well as issues of governmental process, have incited various  homeowner factions in recent weeks into something verging on war.  </P> <P> Heated disputes have erupted at meetings. Neighborhood organizations have been  snooping on each other, trying to determine who is allying themselves with  whom. Flyers from anonymous people and mysterious groups are being slipped  under doors and windshield wipers. Groups are accusing each other of  circulating misleading propaganda and unfairly worded surveys and of engaging  in smear tactics.  </P> <P> But neighborhood activist Victoria Cubeiro says the opposition can be boiled  down to one simple complaint: "The bastards are trying to cut our ridges," she  said of the developer. "And what we're shaking our heads at is, why is (Woo)  sticking his neck out so far to help them do it?"  </P> <P> Woo's intervention on Jefferson's behalf occurred March 27, as the council's  Planning and Land Use Committee was wrapping up discussions on the Mulholland  ordinance before passing it on to the council. Woo successfully inserted an  amendment to exempt Jefferson from the plan.  </P> <P> Jefferson's original development proposal called for knocking more than 100  feet off the ridge. After negotiations with Woo and local homeowners, it scaled  back its plans to a cut of 80 feet. Jefferson officials contend that in their  efforts to respond to the concerns of area homeowners, they have redrawn their  plans for the project more than a dozen times.  </P> <P> "It would be folly for us to despoil the ridge," Jefferson said in a letter to  area residents. "Who, then, would want to purchase our homes, or yours?"  </P> <P> If the ridge cut is not permitted, Jefferson executives argue, the homes would  be built on the steep hillside. This would cause the homes to be built closer  together and would substantially reduce the overall aesthetic appeal of the  development, they contend, not just for the new buyers but for other area  homeowners who will have to look at the homes.  </P> <P> In any event, Woo's actions on behalf of Jefferson, particularly in light of  the campaign contributions, have sparked a growing outcry.  </P> <P> Some of the homeowners who oppose Woo's intervention have joined forces to form  Save Our Ridges and the Hollywood Hills Homeowners Coalition, and they are  pressing Woo to withdraw his amendment exempting Jefferson from the Mulholland  plan.  </P> <P> Such special treatment, they maintain, never could have come about without  Woo's help. "We didn't know you could do that -- cut such a ridge," Cubeiro  said in an interview. "But if you've got a councilman behind you, you can."  </P> <P> City records show that Thomas P. Sullivan, Jefferson's president, personally  contributed $500 to Woo's reelection in spring of 1989 and $500 to Proposition  H, the ethics reform bill spearheaded by Woo that was designed to curtail  influence-peddling in City Hall. The ballot measure was approved by Los Angeles  voters in June. In addition, Jefferson itself gave the maximum $1,000 allowed  to Woo's 1989 campaign, and $4,500 to the ethics measure.  </P> <P> An additional link between Woo and Sullivan is that Sullivan has acknowledged  being a longtime friend of the parents of Woo's top aide, Gary Townsend.  Townsend said in a recent interview that he had had little contact with  Sullivan over the past 20 years until he became Woo's top assistant a year ago.  </P> <P> Since then, Townsend said, he has spoken several times with Sullivan regarding  the Jefferson project. One of the times was when he solicited a corporate  campaign contribution from Sullivan for the ethics bill. Following the  discussion, the development company on May 10 donated the $4,500 to the  Proposition H campaign.  </P> <P> When asked how the contribution came about, Townsend responded that he told  Sullivan it was an important initiative: "I said, 'Hey, why don't you  contribute to Proposition H?' The timing made it look like a quid pro quo when  there wasn't."  </P> <P> Accompanying the ethics provisions of Proposition H was a 40% pay raise for  City Council members.  </P> <P> Councilman Yaroslavsky, who vigorously opposed the measure because he objected  to the pay hike, last May accused Woo at a council meeting of "stooping to the  very gutter of politics" because his staff had solicited and accepted the  Jefferson contribution. Although other lawmakers solicited contributions for  the ethics measure, Yaroslavsky singled out Woo as being "unethical" because  his office had sought funds from a developer with a pending project over which  Woo had considerable influence.  </P> <P> In all, developers and other corporate givers donated nearly $100,000 to the  initiative.  </P> <P> Woo has said such donations do not make him feel "especially obligated" to help  contributors.  </P> <P> Another link between Woo and Jefferson is provided by Steven Afriat, a  well-connected lobbyist who has been retained by Jefferson to help guide the  Hollywood Hills development through the city approval process. Afriat also  works for Woo as a paid fund-raiser.  </P> <P> Afriat said he believes Woo is helping the developer not because of any  political favors, but because the project is a good one.  </P> <P> "Mike has voted against my clients more than he has voted for them," said  Afriat, who has argued Jefferson's case in meetings at Woo's office. "I don't  get favorable treatment from him. He's real careful about what he supports."  </P> <P> Woo vehemently denies being influenced by campaign donations or political  relationships. In fact, despite his sponsorship of the exemption from the  Mulholland plan, Woo contends that he has still not decided whether to support  the project as it goes through the City Council approval process.  </P> <P> Proof of his independence, he said, lies in the fact that he is taking heat  from all sides.  </P> <P> "While some homeowners think I'm doing too much for Jefferson," Woo lamented,  "Jefferson doesn't think I'm doing enough for them."  </P> <P> Sullivan, Jefferson's president, agreed, complaining that Woo has demanded too  many concessions. "He has been tougher than anybody," said Sullivan, "in trying  to get something done that is environmentally sensitive."  </P> <P> Sullivan described critics of the project as a handful of "mad dogs" with no  actual base of support.  </P> <P> Woo, some homeowners and the executive board of one area group, the Hollywood  Knolls Community Club, say the community's interests are best served by  exempting Jefferson from the Mulholland plan because it encourages Jefferson to  continue "good-faith negotiations" with homeowners and to listen to their  concerns about the proposed development.  </P> <P> Such negotiations, they said, have led to major concessions over the last two  years. The biggest was a reduction in the ridge cut from more than 100 feet to  80 feet; Jefferson also has agreed to install a $250,000 gating system and  build public hiking trails in the area.  </P> <P> Complicating matters are the sharply differing views about the project and  about Woo among various community groups in the Hollywood Hills.  </P> <P> Four board members of the Hollywood Knolls Community Club, including President  Dan Riffe, have issued a statement saying they "have supported -- and continue  to support -- Councilman Woo's prudent amendment."  </P> <P> In the statement, they urge neighbors, "Please don't be swayed by the  histrionics of those who haven't bothered to put their efforts into serious,  thoughtful planning for the betterment of our neighborhood."  </P> <P> But some members of the Hollywood Knolls group complained that their leaders  threw their support behind Woo and Jefferson without consulting with the  membership.  </P> <P> Riffe, in fact, wrote to Woo on the community group's stationery last March to  urge him to give Jefferson the exemption without polling his members or board  of directors.  </P> <P> When Woo later asked Riffe to poll his membership, the board of directors met  in emergency session and approved Woo's actions, 10 to 0 with two abstentions  -- again without telling the rank and file. A majority of the rank and file  have since said in survey responses that their board was wrong for holding such  a vote, and that Woo should rescind his amendment, according to Cubeiro.  </P> <P> Another supporter of the exemption for Jefferson is Terry Canfield, president  of the Lake Hollywood Estates Homeowners Assn. She contends that if the  exemption is withdrawn and Jefferson is prohibited from making the ridge cut,  the result would probably be a worse, more environmentally destructive project.  </P> <P> But her group's rank and file, she admits, said in survey responses that they  are split "right down the middle" on whether they support Woo and the project.  </P> <P> And some have accused Canfield, a real estate agent, of supporting the project  for personal gain -- a charge she denies. Canfield says she is no longer  involved in her group's activities regarding Jefferson, to avoid any conflict  of interest, because she hopes to make money when the company's homes are  built, listed and sold.  </P> <P> Less divided are two other community groups, the Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn.  and Hollywood Hills Improvement Assn. They have called on Woo to rescind his  amendment.  </P> <P> Woo says he is now asking all neighborhood associations to poll their members  and report back to him on where they stand prior to the final vote by the  council.  </P> <P> "If I am going to stick my neck out," said Woo, a media-conscious politician  who is widely regarded as a prospective mayoral candidate, "I want to see if  the neighbors really want this."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, two independent, outside groups -- the 54-member Federation of  Hillside and Canyon Assns. and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy -- have  weighed in against Woo. Leaders of the groups say his actions undermine the  landmark Mulholland plan and its mandate to preserve the views along the 26  miles of scenic roadway from Lake Hollywood to Topanga Canyon.  </P></p>

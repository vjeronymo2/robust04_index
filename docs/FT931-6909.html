			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Royal Dutch results depress chemicals FEBRUARY inflation numbers from three of western Germany's four largest states exceeded forecasts from most economists but neither this, nor a flat beginning for the Dow on Wall Street did more than moderate a good rise for the Eurotrack 100 constituents, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM was weaker in chemicals following results from Royal Dutch which featured a disappointing performance in that division. While Royal Dutch showed a slight 20 cent gain on the day to Fl 154.20, DSM slipped Fl 1.70 to Fl 71.80 and Akzo Fl 2.10 to Fl 147.80. The CBS Tendency index was unchanged on the day at 99.8. Mr Marcel Bokhove, analyst with ABN-Amro in Amsterdam, commented that fourth quarter earnings for Royal Dutch came in better than expected, although mainly due to high currency exchange gains and less extraordinary losses. However, the chemical division's loss of Pounds 182m against Pounds 85m in the same 1991 period further illustrated the depressed state of the sector. Unilever remained solid following its results earlier this week, closing at another record high, up Fl 2.50 at Fl 205.10, while Heineken put on Fl 4.20 or 2.4 per cent at Fl 181.20, partly on expectations of good figures next week. VNU also rose to an intraday high of Fl 108 before closing 80 cents up at Fl 107.30 as rumours continued that it was to sell the majority stake in its printing division. FRANKFURT recovered after two days of losses, the DAX index closing 14.67 higher at 1,658.91. Financials maintained their relative strength, led by a DM10 gain to DM693 for Deutsche Bank, and one of DM24 to DM2,235 for Allianz. Turnover fell from DM7.4bn to DM5.4bn. Carmakers recovered some of their recent losses, with Volkswagen exceptionally strong as it put on DM5.40 to DM276.70. Chemicals were mixed with Bayer recovering from pressure associated with its pharmaceuticals interests, rising DM3.20 to DM270.70. But Hoechst eased 60 pfg to DM258.70 following an explosion at one of its chemical plants in a Frankfurt suburb this week. MILAN was again alive with rumours and Fiat rose a further 8 per cent after a newspaper report that Renault was to buy a 40 per cent stake in the Italian group's core car and truck business. The Comit index rose 4.05 to 506.80, also lifted by indications that the privatisation programme might soon move ahead after news that Iri had set criteria for the sale of Sme, the food group, which would protect the rights of minority shareholders. Fiat shares fixed L262 higher at L5,780 and continued up to L5,980 after hours, in spite of denials of the report from Renault and Fiat. Mr Matteo Amoretti, of Albertini in Milan, said it was the detailed nature of the newspaper report - which indicated that an announcement would come between March 10-13 and even suggested a price - that had sparked the renewed buying. However, he doubted whether a sale to a foreign, state-controlled company could go ahead without the approval of the Italian government, and questioned the logic of such a disposal after Fiat's government-backed investment in production capacity in southern Italy and the former eastern Europe. PARIS shed most of Wednesday's gains with the CAC-40 index down 8.75 at 1,944.64 in turnover of some FFr2.9bn. Casino declined FFr6 or some 4 per cent to FFr152 following 1992 results after Wednesday's close which disappointed the market. Axa gained FFr16 to FFr1,159 after announcing a 16 per cent rise in 1992 turnover. MADRID featured another sharp rise in Nissan Motor Iberica, heavily involved in commercial and off-road four-wheel drive vehicles, closing Pta42, or 15 per cent higher at Pta324 after a Nomura buy recommendation which said that new model introductions will allow NMI to double its current revenues by 1994. The general index rose just 0.10 to 228.00. STOCKHOLM was stronger following recent weakness as the Affarsvarlden general index gained 11.4 to 989.2 in turnover down to SKr973m from SKr1bn. SKF, which said that it would pay no dividend on its 1992 results, the first time in 70 years, was unchanged in the B shares at SKr76.50. Astra recovered some of this week's losses although the announcement that the finance director was to resign did remove part of the gains and the B's finished SKr11 higher at SKr661. COPENHAGEN saw a late rush to sell the March index future, and the KFX index fell 0.94 to 82.08. Den Danske Bank fluctuated after announcing a DKr1.74bn net loss, closing DKr7.50 lower at DKr290.50. TEL AVIV recovered from a fall of more than 4 per cent on Tuesday with a gain in the index of 5.26 to 194.18.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- February 25                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes             Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1124.81   1124.80   1122.74   1124.57 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1176.41   1174.62   1174.18   1176.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1126.04   1125.63   1125.14   1125.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1177.26   1177.17   1178.92   1178.13  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 24    Feb 23    Feb 22    Feb 19    Feb 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1116.05   1119.41   1132.76   1136.60   1132.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1172.14   1178.69   1190.84   1191.09   1191.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1126.78 ; 200 -  1180.21 Low/day: 100 -  1122.64  200 -  1173.24  .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

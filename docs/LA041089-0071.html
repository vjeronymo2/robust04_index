			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: THE ART OF ECONOMIZING  </P> <P> The view from Aerojet's office building in La Jolla is breathtaking. But a view  of Torrey Pines Golf Course and the Pacific Ocean won't be the only thing  missing when Aerojet moves its corporate staff to Sacramento in a cost-cutting  move later this year.  </P> <P> Aerojet plans to auction off a 220-piece corporate art collection that,  according to Hugh Davies, director of the nearby La Jolla Museum of  Contemporary Art, ranks as one of San Diego County's finest privately held  collections.  </P> <P> The art collection -- including "Obliquequestionofaturtle," "Tri-Axial Rotation  of a Floating Volume of Light" and "Desert out of Cadillac Window" -- is an  integral part of Aerojet's high-style, contemporary building in La Jolla,  according to spokesman Tom Sprague. It just wouldn't fit in, he said, at the  firm's new home in Sacramento: a mundane office building that only overlooks  another office building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dog Owners Thrown a Bone  </P> <P> Next time your dog is too lazy to go out and forage for his own food, you can  hand him your American Express card and the telephone.  </P> <P> At the other end of an 800 number somewhere in Connecticut these days is a  Carnation Co. operator taking orders for a line of gourmet pet food called  Perform. Already the maker of such grocery store standards as Friskies and  Mighty Dog, the company figured that home delivery would set its high-priced  fare apart.  </P> <P> But the healthy-sounding Carnation division responsible for direct-marketing  Perform -- the Center for Animal Nutrition -- carries its convenience pitch one  step further than most food-by-mail firms. In his introductory letter, director  Lloyd Miller says his recipe uses rice instead of other grains because it is  more digestible -- leaving "the people who clean up after our dogs much  happier."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warhol Met the Challenge  </P> <P> The year was 1981, the scene a dinner party in Heerbrugg, Switzerland, hosted  by industrialist Alexander Schmidheiny -- who two years before had bought Napa  Valley's Cuvaison winery. Proudly opening a bottle for an American guest, the  late pop artist Andy Warhol, Schmidheiny asked: "What do you think?"  </P> <P> "What a lousy label!" Warhol replied.  </P> <P> Schmidheiny's wife and partner, Christina, recalled that Warhol accepted a  challenge to design something better. But somehow the resulting clump of  colorful grapes sliding off a white background was to languish in a drawer  until 1986. Then, wine marketer Manfred Esser, recruited to head Cuvaison,  stumbled upon Warhol's work.  </P> <P> The winery finally used the label recently to adorn 84 magnum bottles of  Cuvaison's 1984 Merlot to be auctioned for charity. Two bottles raised $3,200  at separate auctions. And a single bottle this year went for $2,300 --  outperforming a prize Bordeaux, a 1949 Chateau Petrus, which fetched $1,400.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Next Deal: Real Estate?  </P> <P> Australian businessman Christopher Skase enjoyed a degree of privacy before his  recent $1-billion deal to buy MGM/UA Communications. Now all that is out the  window, thanks to accelerated press exposure -- plus the legendary zeal of the  Beverly Hills real estate sales battalions.  </P> <P> During his visit here last week, the Qintex Group chairman stayed at the  Bel-Air Hotel, as he has off and on for four years. His presence has increased  since his fledgling U.S. entertainment operation -- Qintex Entertainment -- was  launched last year.  </P> <P> Asked if he expects to emulate other Hollywood studio owners by getting a  Beverly Hills mansion, Skase said: "I really haven't had time to think about  it." Thinking a moment, he added: "Plenty of people are trying to sell me a  house, though."  </P></p>

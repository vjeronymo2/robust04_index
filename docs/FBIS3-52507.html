The Chinese feelings over the Kashmir  issue were conveyed to Islamabad prior to the India-Pakistan  foreign secretary level talks which concluded yesterday.  Reports say that China had made it clear to the Pakistan prime  minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, when she visited Beijing last  month, that China would like a negotiated solution of the  Kashmir issue and is opposed to any form of independence which  some separatist groups desire.</p>

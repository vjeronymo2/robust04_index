			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Poles strike in protest at falling living standards POLAND'S fragile coalition government yesterday faced the most serious industrial action since the demise of communism. An estimated 2m Solidarity trade union members mounted a one-hour nationwide strike in protest against the imposition of higher energy prices and lower living standards. Solidarity members outside Warsaw's FSO car plant, which is seeking western investment to finance a modernisation programme, said that 'people were tired of price rises and wages which failed to match.' The impact of the protest, to be followed by a full one-day strike on Thursday by OPZZ, the former Communist trade union, was heightened by the endorsement of President Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity leader. Mr Walesa, who opposed until the last moment the formation of the new government under Mr Jan Olszewski, said the strike might lead to 'wise programmes' and again hinted that he was prepared to become prime minister himself, although not immediately. Mr Andrzej Drzycimski, his spokesman, said the stoppage showed people were tired of the present political situation but that 'democracy would decide' when a change of government was necessary. Mr Drzycimski said that 'for the moment there was no need for the president to take over as prime minister as well'. The centre-right coalition government, formed just before Christmas, has tried to present itself as being more aware of the social and economic consequences of the IMF-backed economic stabilisation policies associated with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, finance minister in the first post-communist governments. However, Mr Olszewski's government is constrained by a tight budget drawn up by its predecessor to restrain a runaway budget deficit. The inherited measures included a sharp reduction in energy subsidies on January 1. This led to a 70 per cent rise in energy prices, which sparked off the latest round of labour unrest. The government has little room for manoeuvre, as the budget deficit over the first quarter of this year is expected to reach Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 894m) even after the cut in energy subsidies. Last year the IMF suspended disbursement of its Dollars 1.7bn extended loan facility because the government had failed to hit agreed targets, including the budget deficit which, at Dollars 2.8bn last year, was seven times higher than originally planned. The steep fall in production by state enterprises, widespread tax evasion and the slow progress of privatisation cut tax revenues sharply at a time of rising demand for unemployment pay and other government services. Mr Olszewski's tough stance on energy prices is designed to show the IMF that his government, which criticised previous administrations for allowing industrial output to fall by more than 30 per in two years, is determined to control the budget deficit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Some 500 students  affiliated with the "South Korean Federation of General Student  Councils" (Hanchongnyon) staged an anti-U.S. demonstration in  front of the 8th Army Command of the U.S. imperialist aggression  forces in South Korea on Saturday evening, according to a radio  report from Seoul.    They continued the protest for more than one hour, shouting  "We oppose the deployment of Patriot missiles" and "Yankee go  home".    Meanwhile, an estimated 2,000 students, at the second  congress of deputies to Hanchongnyon held at Pusan National  University on April 2 and 3, unanimously resolved to check a  "parliamentary ratification" of farm market opening, accusing  the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique of opening the market.    They decided to hold a mass rally in Seoul, stage a boycott  at all universities and colleges across South Korea and launch  into an indefinite hunger sit-down of some 200 Hanchongnyon  cadres in front of the puppet National Assembly hall, with the  "extraordinary National Assembly session" due in mid-April, to  carry their resolve into practice.    It was also decided at the congress to hold an all-citizens  rally against the farm market opening.</p>

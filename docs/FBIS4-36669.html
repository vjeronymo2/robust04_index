The source said all  democratic Yemen's airports with the exception of that at Ataq  were operational. The source expressed amazement that it was  Israel radio which had carried the report by the military  spokesman in Sanaa that northern forces yesterday evening  allegedly shelled al-Mukalla's airport.

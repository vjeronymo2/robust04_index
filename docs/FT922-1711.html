			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Books: Sheer madness on the margins IMAGE ON THE EDGE: THE MARGINS OF MEDIEVAL ART by Michael Camille Reaktion Books Pounds 25/Pounds 10.95 176 pages IN THE British Library, there is a beautiful and precious manuscript called The Luttrell Psalter. Made sometime in the 1320s for Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, a wealthy Lincolnshire lord, the text of the Psalms was written by just one scribe. It took a team of artists to illustrate it. For the Psalms themselves, they made some fine historiated initials. But when it came to the margins and foot of each page, they went mad. One scholar has suggested that the best of the Luttrell illustrators, known as 'Hand A', was mad. What sane person, he marvelled, could have come up with such a bevy of fantastic, brilliantly-coloured monsters? But it was not just monsters which were permitted to disport themselves around the edge of King David's sacred words. The margins of the Luttrell Psalter stand as a kind of visual encyclopaedia of late medieval culture. It swarms with a bizarre medley of images: religious scenes, birds, flowers, beasts, wild men and unicorns, heraldic devices, knights at combat, and now-famous scenes of everyday life: toiling peasants, the Luttrells feasting, singers, dancers, and mummers. Scholars find it very difficult to account for the riot of marginal images which irrupted in northern European books between about 1230 and 1400. How can such a love of complexity, of the parodic and grotesque, be reconciled with texts which were generally of a devotional nature, and were commissioned by pious men and women? And still more surprising, to a modern eye, are the 'rude' images of love-making, bare-arsed figures and defecation. In Image on the Edge Michael Camille opens up this fascinating and problematic subject for a non-specialist audience. Slim and seductively designed, this book appears with only the most rudimentary acknowledgement of the sober reality of the medieval paleographer's world. There is no index, and only confusing notes and references - Camille appears less than keen to acknowledge his debts to other sources. His approach is slapdash. From the margins of the page, Camille swiftly extends his scope to corbels, gargoyles and misericords - the semi-hidden images on the edge of peoples' bottoms, a subject in which he takes a keen interest. Of all the myriad types of marginal image, Camille dwells longest on the 'rude' ones. How important, quantitatively, are these obscenae? Were they standard fare; more common in England than in France; in one period than another? These are exactly the kind of down-to-earth questions which do not interest Camille. He does not blush to describe the Rutland Psalter as if it were distinguished, above all, for its anally compulsive artists. And yet, I have it on good authority that only a tiny percentage of its playful illustrations show arrows up bums. With great ingenuity, Camille reads sexual inuendoes into apparently innocuous images. Snails, he suggests, were popular in manuscripts and carvings not because of their formal appeal, but because they symbolise female genitalia. A woman in a strange head-dress is a 'conscious' phallic reference. The flaccid turban was 'perhaps' inspired by the Latin word conturbata in the text. But would an English artist in 1300 have known the Persian word, turban? The fundamental problem with this book is that behind all the superficial cleverness, the flitting hither and thither across the 'sexiest' topics of medieval historiography, it rests on an obsession with a flawed metaphor. Years ago, sociologists and anthropologists fell in love with the notion of 'the marginalised'. Every society thrusts on to its margins those ideas, forms of behaviour and social groups which constitute a threat to social order. To marginalise something is, then, to reaffirm the dominance of the centre. Camille strains away at this metaphor: for example, beggars appear in the margins of books just as in medieval Paris they tended to live by the walls. Marginal art constituted, therefore, the zone where medieval society permitted artists - themselves a 'marginal group' - to let rip. The text alone had meaning: outside it, artists were free to create images of those whom he claims were 'marginalised' - prostitutes, peasants, fools, vagabonds, cripples, beggars, sinners, lovers, the entire female sex. Unfortunately, Camille displays no real grasp of the role of any of these groups within medieval society. The result is a book which exemplifies the arrogance, pretentiousness and anachronism which characterise post-structuralist thought at its worst. We may applaud the deftness with which he turns his argument at the end into an attack on the Moral Majority. But on the way, he has produced a travesty.</p>

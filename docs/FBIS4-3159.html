			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Visiting former U.S.  President George Bush today called on the Clinton administration  to maintain good relations with China.    Bush said Washington should not suspend the  most-favored-nation status to China.    Bush made the statement when meeting with South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam in the presidential house.    Turning to the Korean peninsula, Bush said the situation was  not as tense as he thought when he was in his own country.    Kim, on his part, accused certain "irresponsible" people of  exaggerating the situation on the Korean peninsula.    Bush arrived here earlier today to attend the 43rd Annual  Conference of the Pacific-Asia Travel Association (PATA),  scheduled for April 18-20.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: AB Foods pleases Good results from Associated British Foods sent the shares upward, although profit-taking clipped the gain before the close. Turnover, however, was a below-par 330,000, with the shares adding 4 to finish at 479p. Pre-tax profits came in at Pounds 338m, well ahead of the market range of Pounds 300m to Pounds 320m. Most of the excess was down to one-offs, with operating profits only marginally in front of last year's figure. For this reason, most analysts retained their forecasts for the 1993-94 financial year, with Strauss Turnbull staying at Pounds 310m. Analyst Mr Carl Short said: 'The shares are worth holding on to for the eventual improvement in milling and baking.' However, most food specialists agreed that the short-term problems in the bakery division will probably continue to overshadow the stock.</p>

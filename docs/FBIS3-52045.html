This will cause coffee prices  to rise on the international market. A Brazilian and Colombian  ministerial meeting was held on 22 January during President  Itamar Franco's visit to Leticia, Colombia. The Brazilian  Government reported that stocks of coffee in its 20 leading  cooperatives amounted to 629,000 sacks, which is more than the  required 20 percent withholding established by the Association  of Coffee Producing Countries (APPC).    This information was disclosed by Ailton Barcelos, the  acting  industry, commerce, and tourism minister. He said the news  caused "euphoria" among the Colombians -- who are the  administrators of the APPC, which groups together 33 countries.  He said the price of a sack of coffee plunged from $70 to $45  during the last four years.    He estimated that the information provided by Brazil, which  is the group leader, will prompt coffee producers to increase  the price from $0.74 the pound to $0.85. Barcelos said: "This  would have an extraordinary international impact."    Barcelos will hand over his portfolio tomorrow to Senator  Elcio Alvares (PFL-ES) [Liberal Front Party-Espirito Santo], but  will remain at the Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ministry as  executive secretary. He recalled that in the fourth quarter of  1993, Brazil failed to keep its commitment to withhold 20  percent of its coffee production.    Brazil exported 3,913 sacks during that quarter and, in  keeping with the agreement signed with the APPC, should have  withheld 20 percent to trigger a rise in coffee prices. Owing  to the absence of a reliable information system, Brazil thought  it had failed to honor its commitment with the international  market, but a survey last week confirmed that there is more than  enough in stock to meet the required withholding. "In other  words, we are honoring our international commitments."</p>

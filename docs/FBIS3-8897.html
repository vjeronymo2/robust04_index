There was talk about a  need to set up a 100-person constituent assembly and also about  the possibility of legal experts from the President's Office  preparing a Constitution, assisted by presidential councils to  be set up by Walesa or in cooperation with extraparliamentary  parties. which are working on their own drafts. "The president  will present the new Constitution directly to the nation, and  the nation will adopt it in a referendum," Lech Walesa's  associates announced.    All significant extraparliamentary parties and blocs have  been trying to come up with their own ideas on what kind of  constitution Poland should have.  <H5>  According to the ZChN, the PC, the RdR, the PL, and the KK </H5>   The most popular constitutional commission outside of the  Sejm was established by a coalition comprising the  Christian-National Union [ZChN], the Center Accord [PC],  Movement for the Republic [RdR], and the Peasant Accord [PL].  The commission's proceedings are coordinated by Walerian  Piotrowski, chairman of the National Assembly's Constitutional  Commission of the previous term. During the previous term of  parliament, he was a senator for the ZChN. The commission  includes as its members leaders of all of the parties forming  the alliance, among them Wieslaw Chrzanowski and Marek Jurek of  the ZChN, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Ludwik Dorn of the PC, Romuald  Szeremietiew and Lech Jeczmyk of the RdR, and Gabriel Janowski  and Henryk Bak of the PL. Recently, as the right-wing camp was  joined by the Conservative Coalition [KK] (a group formed after  a split within the Conservative Party), the commission began to  also include KK leaders Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski and Lech  Mazewski.    Proceedings by Piotrowski's Constitutional Commission began  on 17 January, and the basis for the commission's work was  determined to be made up of two drafts: a Senate draft of 1991  and the PC draft from 1992. Actually, both of these  propositions suited the views of the PC leaders in the various  periods of the party's activity. The Senate draft, whose main  promoter and coauthor is Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak of the PC,  who is also a member of the Senate club of Solidarity and of the  current National Assembly's Constitutional Commission, proposes  strong presidential power, whereas the PC's draft is more  cautious when it comes to defining the powers of the head of  state. Leaders of the parties that are working on the draft do  not hide the fact that a "too strong presidential power may lead  to authoritarian rule, similar to anarchy."    The PC-ZChN-RdR-PL coalition has made a suggestion, on  Ludwik  Dorn's initiative, to the parties in the parliament, that a  constitutional "Roundtable" be formed. A constitutional draft  would be adopted by a National Constitutional Council, which  would include proportionate representations by parties that  gained at least 1 percent of the vote in the recent  parliamentary elections. A draft agreed upon by such a  commission would then be adopted by the Sejm on a "gentlemen's  agreement" basis, just like the "Roundtable" agreements of 1989.  But the governing coalition rejects the idea.   <H5>    According to Solidarity and Secretariat </H5>   A Social Constitutional Commission under the patronage of  the  Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity has been  working on a constitution from scratch. The commission was set  up during a congress of center-right-wing parties that took  place in Krakow on 5 December 1993. The idea to establish this  commission was put forward by the Secretariat of  Center-Right-Wing Parties, which, among others, includes  Christian Democracy-Party of Labor (of Tomasz Jackowski),  Movement of the Third Republic (of Jan Parys), and the Polish  Association (of Andrzej Anusz). Noninvolvement in politics is  the commission's basic rule of action. Even though after  Solidarity assumed patronage over the commission the trade  union's chief, Marian Krzaklewski, became the commission's  honorary chairman, the commission primarily includes different  kinds of experts, including legal ones. In fact, the commission  is chaired by Andrzej Rosciszewski, dean of the Warsaw Bar  Association. The commission's sessions also include  participation by members of the Senate club of Solidarity, such  as Piotr Lukasz Juliusz Andrzejewski, Zbigniew Romaszewski, and  August Chelkowski. Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak has also declared  her willingness to participate (she is already a member of two  other constitutional commissions). Among others, Jan Olszewski,  Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Kazimierz Barczyk, and Jozefina  Hrynkiewicz debate as experts in four groups: human and civic  rights and duties; general constitutional principles as well as  the defense system and extraordinary emergencies; political,  social, and economic system; and sources of law and justice  system's institutions. The commission's groups often conduct  tours financed by Solidarity; the most recent of those took  place this past weekend in Rynia, in the Zegrzyn lagoon area.    The Secretariat's politicians are hopeful that the law on  proceedings for preparing the Constitution will include a  citizens' constitutional initiative. After the rejection of  Lech Walesa's draft, a similar proposition was suggested by  Jerzy Jaskiernia of the Democratic Left Alliance. According to  him, a group of half a million citizens should enjoy the  possibility of submitting their own constitutional draft. "Only  Solidarity is capable of gathering half a million signatures,"  one of the Secretariat's politicians says.  <H5>  According to UPR, the PChD, the PK, the SLCh, and the SND </H5>   "The Accord of 11 November," which includes the Union for  Real Politics [UPR] of Janusz Korwin-Mikke, the Party of  Christian Democrats [PChD] of Pawel Laczkowski, the Conservative  Party [PK] of Aleksander Hall, the Peasant-Christian Party  [SLCh] of Jozef Slisz, and the National-Democratic Party [SND]  of Jan Zamoyski, does not intend to set up a constitutional  commission of their own, even though a team is already working  that is supposed to present "constitutional theses" of the  economic right wing by 1 May 1994. "Out of the existing drafts,  we feel that the Senate draft fulfills our expectations the  most," the coalition's leaders say, but they also emphasize that  the draft is not perfect.  <H5>  Who With Walesa? </H5>   Lech Walesa counts the most on cooperation with Solidarity  and its Constitutional Commission. The president, while himself  being in a dispute with the government, is looking for an ally  in his dispute with parliament (the trade union is also in a  dispute with the government). Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of  the President's Office, stressed several times that the  presidential proposition of a citizens' constitutional  initiative was a cordial gesture addressed precisely at  Solidarity. The trade union's activists and the Secretariat's  politicians do not rule out a tactical alliance with Walesa  during the fight for the Constitution, but they want to remain  very cautious when it comes to any kind of wider cooperation.  Right-wing activists of the other two blocs outside of the Sejm  do not see a chance for cooperation with the president, while  almost everyone agrees that the completely extraparliamentary  way of adopting the Constitution suggested by Lech Walesa is  unacceptable to them.</p>

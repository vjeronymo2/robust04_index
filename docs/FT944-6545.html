			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Salvesen to sell pollution control and brick units: Distribution and hire group looks at disposals as profits flatten Christian Salvesen, the distribution and specialist hire company, is looking to sell its pollution control and brick manufacturing divisions by the end of this financial year, raising around Pounds 60m to invest in its core businesses. The disposals would almost halve its Pounds 129m of net borrowings and Salvesen is looking at acquisitions in European distribution, after the success of its Pounds 84m purchase of Swift, the industrial distribution company. The group's results, however, were less upbeat. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September rose by 1 per cent to Pounds 41.4m, despite the impact of Swift, which was purchased in October 1993. Salvesen issued a profits warning last February, after a rapid downturn from Aggreko, its specialist plant hire business. Aggreko's latest figures reveal a turnround in the US, which achieved 23 per cent growth. Generator hire for the World Cup helped, but it also benefited from large cost cuts. However, Aggreko's European businesses offset most of this improvement. Light &amp; Sound Design, acquired for Pounds 7.6m in 1991, slumped into loss, and Salvesen plans to trim its operations. This could lead to second-half write-downs, which will offset likely profits from the sale of the brick business. Overall, the specialist hire division saw operating profits fall 4.5 per cent to Pounds 14.8m. Distribution now accounts for almost half of Salvesen's Pounds 319.3m (Pounds 262.3m) turnover, and the division's profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 21.6m, boosted by a Pounds 5.7m contribution from Swift. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said Swift had been fully integrated into the division, and performed better than expectations. It has given Salvesen a substantial push into distribution for industrial companies, which he sees as a growth area in the UK and Europe. The group won new contracts during the period, from Texaco Oils, BASF and Lucas Industries. The UK food sector remains competitive, but Salvesen has renewed distribution contracts with Safeway and Haagen-Dazs, on 'reasonable' terms. However, profits at the US division fell 15 per cent to Dollars 6.1m (Pounds 3.7m). Food Services profits fell 13 per cent to Pounds 6.5m, while the brick manufacturing division more than doubled to Pounds 3.6m. Interests payments rose from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 4.7m, reflecting the impact of the Swift acquisition, added to a further Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 40.4m) of capital expenditure for the interim period. The company is paying a 3.4p dividend, up from 3.3p. Earnings per share were 10.5p (10.29p). Details, Page 24</p>

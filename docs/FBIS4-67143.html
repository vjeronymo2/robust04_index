			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said  that the DEA works and must continue to work in a coordinated  manner with the national institutions and abiding by the  Bolivian laws.    In response to the concern expressed by several sectors  regarding the alleged interference by foreign agents or  organizations in domestic affairs, the president explained: "We  are getting the DEA to work in a coordinated manner with the  Bolivian institutions, abiding by the national laws."    The chief of state said that at a personal and diplomatic  level he clearly stated that the orders must come from Bolivia,  as we are waging a great joint struggle against drug trafficking  and for this need U.S. support.    The president said: "We need U.S. assistance, but it should  be granted within a framework of mutual respect and the  effectiveness that stems from adequate coordination."    In Sanchez de Lozada's opinion, the DEA has heard the  criticisms from various sectors of the country, and he believes  it has understood the rules of the game.    He stated, however, that as a result of these criticisms he  is not going to adopt a chauvinist attitude nor seek to easily  gain popularity by criticizing the United States for what has  happened.    The DEA's work in Bolivia is being questioned by political  and social sectors, among them the Church, which believe that  the DEA is violating Bolivian sovereignty.    U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Charles Bower was the first U.S.  Government authority to answer these expressions of concern,  stating that there are no signs of interference in domestic  affairs.</p>

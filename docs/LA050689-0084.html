			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE FOCUS SHIFTS TO GILLESPIE;  </P> <P> BIAS FOR INDUSTRY ALLEGED; SHE MUST QUIT, NADER SAYS  </P> <P> Just 24 hours after the state Supreme Court upheld most of Proposition 103,  state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie was already caught in a cross  fire Friday between consumer activists and the insurance industry as insurer  requests for exemptions from the measure's rate rollbacks began flowing into  her office.  </P> <P> Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, charging that Gillespie is biased in the  industry's favor, demanded that she step down and urged Gov. George Deukmejian  to appoint "someone with an impeccable background of impartiality and  competence."  </P> <P> "Commissioner Gillespie should tender her resignation and step aside, because  she has irreversibly prejudiced herself against any fair implementation of the  refund provisions," said Nader, Proposition 103's best-known supporter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Outright Hostility'  </P> <P> He charged that Gillespie had sought to discredit the initiative before voters  passed it in November and has displayed "skepticism, if not outright hostility,  toward her obligations to implement those provisions which were not stayed by  the . . . Supreme Court."  </P> <P> Gillespie spokeswoman Carey Fletcher said Gillespie will not resign.  </P> <P> "She is not going to resign. She has no reason to resign. . . . She is the  consumer commissioner," said Fletcher, who related that Gillespie once said, "  'Being criticized by Mr. Nader is a little like being criticized by Mother  Teresa. What are you going to do?' "  </P> <P> Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt, the organization that sponsored  Proposition 103, said Friday that in his view Gillespie "will not dare" exempt  too many companies from the rollbacks provided in his initiative.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reduction Mandated  </P> <P> Proposition 103 says that unless they are granted exemptions by the state  insurance commissioner, insurers must roll rates back 20% from what they were  charging for the same coverage in November, 1987 -- a year before the  initiative was approved by voters.  </P> <P> Under Thursday's court ruling, insurers who apply for exemptions can charge  higher rates, but if the commissioner eventually orders them to implement  rollbacks, they will have to refund, with interest, any premiums they have  collected above the allowable levels.  </P> <P> Rosenfield predicted that Gillespie ultimately will order insurers who have  charged higher rates to make sizable refunds.  </P> <P> "She's going to fight this tooth and nail for about an hour and a half, and  then there will be a firestorm," Rosenfield predicted. "There's going to be so  much pressure on her to come through for the people and give the rollbacks."  </P> <P> Noting that Gillespie was in Greece Thursday when the high court rendered its  decision, Rosenfield remarked, "She ought not to come back from Greece if she's  going to take the approach that all of these companies have a right to charge  the rates they're charging."  </P> <P> Rosenfield's statements drew a quick rejoinder from industry lawyer Allen M.  Katz, who pointed out that the Supreme Court in its decision had instructed  Gillespie that the insurance companies should earn a "fair and reasonable"  return on their business.  </P> <P> Even if insurers decide not to appeal the court's decision to the U.S. Supreme  Court, Katz said, they will certainly appeal to the courts any Gillespie  decision not to exempt companies from the rollbacks, if those companies can  reasonably justify their rates.  </P> <P> "Our right of appeal from these administrative decisions is explicitly pointed  out in the court's opinion," Katz declared.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for several companies reiterated Friday that they feel confident that  their present rates will be upheld in hearings that Gillespie is expected to  order soon after returning to her office on Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insurers' Comments  </P> <P> Jeffrey Byers of the Farmers group of companies declared: "Certainly we feel  fairly positive about the opportunity to present documentation on our rates and  that they will meet the standards of fair and reasonable return which were  confirmed by the court. Our rates have always been fair, and we welcome the  opportunity to provide information to support them."  </P> <P> Kathleen Hogan of Allstate said, "We feel the rates we're going to file are  fair and reasonable, and we think the insurance commissioner will also find  them fair and reasonable."  </P> <P> Alan Morris of the Automobile Club of Southern California said, "We feel very  confident that the rates we're currently charging, which have been in effect  since January, 1988, are not excessive."  </P> <P> Morris pointed out that last year Gillespie began requiring that companies  increasing their annual premiums by 10% or more file advance notice with her so  she could challenge the increases if she felt they were unjustified.  </P> <P> "We filed and were not challenged," Morris said. "So in effect the (Insurance)  department has already given approval to the rates that were filed and are  currently in use."  </P> <P> But an Insurance Department spokeswoman said Friday that the Supreme Court  decision sets new procedures for establishing rates, and any company seeking an  exemption will have to be evaluated anew.  </P> <P> Despite insurers' confidence that they will prevail, some political observers  said Friday that insurance has become such a politically charged issue in  California that both Gillespie and Deukmejian, who appointed her, are unlikely  to favor the companies.  </P> <P> "I feel she will bend toward the consumer view on the rollbacks," said state  Sen. Alan Robbins, chairman of the Senate's Insurance Committee, "and I think  the guidance she's going to get from the governor will also lean in that  direction."  </P> <P> But Nader painted a much darker picture.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big Issue for '90 Election  </P> <P> "She comes from the insurance industry to her post, and she's likely to return  to it. The people should know she's likely to return to it," Nader said,  predicting that if the Republican governor allows Gillespie to remain in office  he would be handing Democrats a potent issue in the next gubernatorial  election.  </P> <P> "If Commissioner Gillespie performs like an executive of Aetna, the refunds  will not be forthcoming and the issue will become a dominant factor in the 1990  gubernatorial election," he said.  </P> <P> Others predicted that political considerations would give way to legal and  administrative factors, pointing out that, under the law, Gillespie will have  to establish intricate procedures and conduct extensive hearings before she can  do anything about the rollbacks.  </P> <P> "Politics right now is the least relevant issue," said Steven Miller, head of  the Insurance Consumer Action Network. "It's an administrative task. There are  a host of regulatory decisions to make.  </P> <P> "Gillespie must articulate those standards by which she will review the rates  the companies are charging. She must define what data she'll require and most  importantly what will be, in her mind, the standard by which to judge a fair  rate of return. She has to do all that before she can judge the applications  for exemptions."  </P> <P> Miller expressed the view that some rollbacks and rebate checks will be ordered  by Gillespie, particularly in the areas of homeowners and renters insurance. He  said that any lengthy delays by the insurance commissioner in ordering these  would only "further disadvantage consumers."  </P> <P> Harry Snyder, West Coast director of Consumers Union, said the method of  Gillespie's deliberation must be fair and meticulous.  </P> <P> "I think these are not the days of Robespierre," said Snyder in a reference to  the French revolutionary who liberally used the guillotine against political  opponents. "The due process supported by the court means the insurance  companies and the consumers get due process."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Action Taken  </P> <P> Snyder noted, as did Miller, that Gillespie had balked, while the Supreme Court  was considering the insurers' lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of  Proposition 103, at writing any administrative regulations looking forward to  enforcing provisions of the measure, particularly the key ones on rate  regulation.  </P> <P> "We've been asking the commissioner for a long period for action on this," he  said. "She refused. . . . Now she must act quickly to establish the  procedures."  </P> <P> Gillespie was reported en route home Friday and was not available for comment.  But Fletcher, her spokeswoman, said she expects some announcement on rate  hearing standards and procedures as early as Monday.  </P> <P> "Our legal department has been working on these," Fletcher said. "They will be  ready on the commissioner's return."  </P> <P> In the meantime, she said, the Insurance Department does not expect a flood of  exemption filings for a few days.  </P> <P> "Any kind of filing requesting an exemption would have to provide extensive  information," Fletcher said. "They wouldn't be waltzing through the door this  morning."  </P> <P> However, Fletcher said late in the day that 10 companies had filed letters  seeking exemptions and "the department is reviewing them to see if they qualify  as valid applications for rate relief."  </P> <P> The companies included four big insurers -- Allstate, 20th Century, Mercury and  Prudential.  </P> <P> It was clear Friday that extensive administrative hearings, for perhaps  thousands of separate rate filings, will eventually have to be held.  </P> <P> "We've been discussing here at State Farm who won in the Supreme Court  decision," said Kim Brunner, an attorney at that insurer's Illinois  headquarters Friday. "I guess the way I read the decision is that the  government bureaucracy wins."  </P></p>

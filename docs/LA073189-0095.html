			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> USA TODAY STAFF AFFRONTED;  </P> <P> 'NEANDERTHAL,' NEUHARTH TOLD ON 'SKY GIRLS' PLEA  </P> <P> Today's edition of USA Today carried a letter signed by more than 175 of the  newspaper's 426 newsroom employees, saying they were "offended, outraged and  embarrassed" by USA Today founder Al Neuharth's suggestion that airlines should  make the skies friendlier by bringing back shapely, young "sky girls."  </P> <P> The newspaper also carried an interview with the head of the Assn. of Flight  Attendants, who said union members were "stunned" by the former Gannett Co.  Inc. chairman's comments.  </P> <P> "My feeling was that Al Neuharth is either a Neanderthal or some sort of court  jester," said Susan Bianchi-Sand, 42, who added that she has been a flight  attendant for 20 years.  </P> <P> In a column last Friday, Neuharth said he began taking commercial flights for  the first time in 19 years after his recent retirement, and did not like what  he found.  </P> <P> "Many of the young, attractive, enthusiastic female flight attendants -- then  called stewardesses -- have been replaced by aging women who are tired of their  jobs or by flighty young men who have trouble balancing a cup of coffee or  tea," he wrote.  </P> <P> If he were running an airline, Neuharth said he would "ease today's cabin  pressures" for passengers by insisting on old-fashioned vital statistics for  "sky girls": unmarried female nurses, under age 25, measuring 5-foot-4 or less  and weighing under 115 pounds.  </P> <P> "We say this is bigoted and insulting -- not only to flight attendants and  nurses, but also to the women and men who work for Gannett," the employee  letter said.  </P></p>

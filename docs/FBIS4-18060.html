The agreement stipulates  that these companies will participate in the development of the  Western Caspian oil-fields.    A representative of SOCAR said that companies will conduct  geological and research on several oil fields of that region as  well as an increase in oil output of two oil fields already  developed by SOCAR.    SOCAR has two agreements concerning creation of joint  ventures to develop offshore oil fields. One of them has been  concluded with the Turkish company "Atilla Dogan".

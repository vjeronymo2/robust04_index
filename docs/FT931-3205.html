			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Tax burden increases - The Main Points The net result of the changes increase total tax revenues by a modest 0.1 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to 36 1/2 per cent of GDP. But the delayed effects of the government's tax changes mean that the Budget measures eventually add 1.7 per cent of GDP in tax rises by 1997-98 by which time government revenues will have risen to 39 1/4 per cent of GDP. PSBR here to stay ..: The PSBR this fiscal year will be Pounds 35.1bn, Pounds 1.9bn lower than the Autumn Statement forecast. But general government expenditures of 44 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 mean a PSBR of Pounds 50.1bn, 8 per cent of GDP, and Pounds 55.6bn excluding privatisation receipts.   .but maybe not for ever: The government's objective remains 'to bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium term'. But the government's projections still expect a PSBR of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 by which time net public debt will have almost doubled since 1990 to 50 per cent of GDP. Full-funding rule modified: No news on interest rates, but the government relaxed its funding policy. Sales of gilts to bank and building societies will now be counted as a non-inflationary funding source. The government has increased its upper limit for broad money growth next year in part to accommodate the boost to M4 that relaxing its full-fund rule which should allow. The target range for M0 in 1993-94 is widened from 4-8 per cent to 3-9 per cent. 'Budget for sustained growth': The chancellor said that the British economy 'enters the year in a more favourable position than most of our main competitors' having 'won' the battle against inflation over the last two years. Highlights of the recovery include: Growth accelerates: Economic recovery is expected to start slowly but accelerate next year. GDP grows by 1 1/4 per cent in 1993 but by 3 per cent in the first half of 1994. Inflation sticky Underlying retail price inflation remains stuck at 3 3/4 per cent until the middle of next year, near the top of the government's 0-4 per cent target range. Trade deficit grows Rising imports means the current account deficit is expected to rise to Pounds 17 1/2 bn this year and Pounds 18 1/2 bn in the first half of next year, 2 3/4 per cent of GDP, in spite of projected export growth of 10 1/2 per cent next year.</p>

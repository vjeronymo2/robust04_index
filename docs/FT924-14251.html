			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: A new twist for old rugs - A dealer's fresh look at tradition FOR MOST lovers of Oriental rugs old, traditional designs, handed down from mother to daughter and from father to son, are an essential part of their appeal. Anything new-fangled or, heaven forbid, avant-garde, is regarded with grave suspicion, on a par with altering the pageantry of the Changing of the Guard or tampering with the recipe for Bath Olivers. Received wisdom has it that you do not mess with ancient hallowed crafts. Christopher Farr, a painter who also deals in Oriental rugs and who especially loves fine old, traditional ones, has dared to do just that - he has found a way of combining some of the best Western design talent with the craft traditions that are still alive in many of the Turkish villages that lie around the ancient pre-Ottoman capital of Seljuk. He found, to his great surprise, that many of the carpet-makers were longing for something a little new and challenging to work with. Many of them were giving scarcely any thought to what they were doing; they were simply repeating the designs handed down through the years without any great engagement of their interest or their feelings. Farr thinks the quality of the rugs is threatened not by the introduction of new designs but by the increasing reliance on cheap wools and harsh dyes and the evident boredom of many of the carpet-makers. 'A design is not automatically great simply because it is old,' says Christopher Farr, 'I could not build a business on the finest quality old rugs alone - they are now too expensive for this market - so I decided to try to encourage the carpet-makers to make fine new ones. 'I insist that they use only hand-spun wool. It is very labour-intensive and time-consuming but it gives light and depth to the carpet and takes colour in a way that no machine-spun wool ever does. For his first venture three years ago he got two young designers, Sian Tucker and Kate Blee, to produce a few designs that fitted into the Turkish weaving traditions and used the colours that were available to the weavers. Encouraged by what he describes as the limited success of the venture last year he brought together a group of six students at the Royal College of Art to turn their creative talents to the problem. 'It was a huge success, about five hundred top designers came to the opening exhibition, including luminaries such as Christian Lacroix, and we sold all the eighteen designs on display.' His latest venture has been to get another eight designers (including the original pair of Sian Tucker and Kate Blee, as well as Maxime de la Falaise, who designs for St. Laurent and Tiffany, Cressida Bell and Sally Greaves-Lord) to see what they could come up with. 'The weavers seemed to love having new designs to tackle and were intrigued by the range and diversity of the them. ' The range of designs is very varied - some, like Cressida Bell's, photographed left, clearly draw on traditional oriental rug design whilst infusing it with new life and fresh colours, while Sally Greaves-Lord's design, photographed right, is much more abstract, a real break with accepted ideas of what Oriental rug design is all about. Sian Tucker has produced a very painterly design - a dark chestnut frame or 'mount' with an inner square alive with smaller squares of rich colour, while Maxime de la Falaise has produced a much more fanciful flat-weave kelim, all ochres, blues and browns. The rugs are coming into Christopher Farr's shop at 115 Regent's Park Road, Primrose Hill, London NW1 now but there will have a more formal, big exhibition of the complete range running for six weeks, starting on November 4. Prices start at Pounds 750 and go on to Pounds 2,250. Each rug is produced in an edition of 10. Christopher Farr has lots more ventures in the pipe-line - particularly exciting is the interest of Romeo Gigli, who is likely to be designing some of the next range.</p>

He did not play last season.  </P> <P> Washburn, a 6-foot 11-inch center/forward, may appeal his suspension after two  years.  </P> <P> John Drew, who played for the Hawks and the Utah Jazz, was the first player  banned for life under the anti-drug agreement, in January 1986. The next month,  it was Micheal Ray Richardson of the New Jersey Nets, and in January 1987, they  were joined by Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell Wiggins of the Houston Rockets. Duane  Washington of the New Jersey Nets received the same punishment in September  1988.  </P> <P> Washburn's contract was terminated, which meant he lost at least $1.6 million.  </P></p>

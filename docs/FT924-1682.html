			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Major 'misled EC partners over HDTV' MR John Major, UK Prime Minister, is facing charges that he misled his EC partners after Britain this week blocked funding for a Brussels-backed strategy to market high-definition technology to the European public. The UK veto at a meeting of EC telecoms ministers on Tuesday astonished France, the Netherlands, and the European Commission, which thought Mr Major had signalled he was ready to drop opposition to spending Ecu500m (Pounds 400m) on HDTV over the next five years. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President, has written to Mr Major reminding him of the 'understanding' which both reached on HDTV during last weekend's EC summit at Edinburgh. EC officials yesterday complained Mr Major had at worst broken his word, or at best been 'slippery' in his dealings with Mr Delors, President Francois Mitterrand of France, and Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch premier, the plan's chief supporters. The row over HDTV pits Britain, with its distaste for Brussels-backed industrial policy, against the continental desire to support national champions, in this case Philips of the Netherlands, and Thomson of France. Both Philips and Thomson have invested millions in the D2-Mac and HD-Mac technology. The UK argues these could be overtaken by more advanced digital TV technology being developed in the US. During the Edinburgh summit, both Mr Mitterrand and Mr Lubbers tried to persuade Mr Major to agree to a firm commitment to HDTV funding in the final summit declaration. But Mr Major resisted, saying this was 'detail'. He pointed to the upcoming meeting of telecoms ministers in Brussels, according to Dutch and EC officials. These words were enough to persuade some delegations, including the Dutch, that Mr Major had shifted ground. 'He gave the impression of movement, but he did not give a solid commitment,' said one Dutch official. At Tuesday's meeting in Brussels, Mr Tim Sainsbury, UK industry minister, opposed the Commission plan and offered a 'compromise'. This involved Ecu80m funding, plus a review of all HDTV technology and digital technology by spring next year; but it was rejected by all 11 partners who reaffirmed their commitment to press ahead. The EC funding would go to consortia for satellite broadcasting, as well as to producers for conversion of programmes for use in high definition TV sets. Money may also go to other widescreen TV services such as Pal Plus, and for modifying studios making programmes for broadcasting using HDTV technology.</p>

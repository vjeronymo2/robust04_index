			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo 'backsliding' on chips accord - Trade relations in jeopardy, US manufacturers warn Clinton Japan is backsliding on efforts to open its markets to foreign semiconductor manufacturers, the US semiconductor industry has warned in a letter to President Bill Clinton ahead of his meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa this week. US-Japanese trade relations are in jeopardy because of deteriorating results from the 1991 US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement, the chip makers said, noting that the accord had become a 'litmus test' as to whether real progress could be made in the troubled US-Japan trading relationship. 'If this agreement fails, given all the priority and effort given to it by both countries' governments and industries, there is little reason to believe that any other negotiations can succeed,' the chip makers said. 'We can't help but feel that we are drifting toward an era of confrontation and recriminations. This is unfortunate because it is completely avoidable,' said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group representing US chip makers. 'The US semiconductor industry wants sales, not sanctions,' said Mr Daryl Hatano, SIA vice-president. 'But we feel that we are being pushed in that direction.' The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market rose above a 20 per cent target established in the trade accord in the fourth quarter of 1992, encouraging the Clinton administration to site the agreement as a model for other sectors because it established 'measurable results'. However, over the past three quarters, the foreign semiconductor market share figure has fallen to 18.1 per cent. Emergency talks between the two governments last month in Tokyo failed to produce any agreement on stemming the decline. 'The forward momentum has been lost and we are very worried about backsliding,' said Mr Procassini.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, the agency discussed a specific test criterion in which the container would be permitted to rupture only if there were no fragmentation. The container industry refers to this situation as ``leak before burst.'' Containers that leak before bursting are designed to release their contents through the sidewall without explosive fragmentation when the container becomes overpressurized. The industry tests for this characteristic by piercing the pressurized container with a gunshot. The area around the container is then examined for fragmentation. The container is supposed to be designed so that no fragments will break off during this failure. In the NPRM, the agency requested comments about how to define the term ``without fragmenting'' for regulatory and compliance purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brunswick, NGV Systems, PST, EDO, CNG Pittsburg, and AAMA commented about container fragmentation. These commenters stated that in the event of a rupture, the CNG fuel containers should be designed to release their contents through their sidewalls without fragmentation. Brunswick, AAMA, NGV Systems, EDO, and PST commented about how to define the phrase ``without fragmenting.'' EDO recommended that the container be required to remain ``in one piece.'' NGV Systems stated it should be defined as ``no separation of parts such that projectiles are possible.'' AAMA stated that it should be defined as ``no separation of pieces exceeding one gram in mass from the fuel tank.'' Brunswick stated that it should be defined as loss of small pieces not exceeding 30 grams (one ounce) in weight. PST also indicated that 30 grams (one ounce) is an acceptable size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments and other available information, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 304 to include a gunfire test similar to the one set forth in NGV2, with some modifications. The agency believes that if a CNG container is punctured in a crash, the failure should result in a controllable situation, e.g., fuel leakage, rather than a catastrophic explosion of the container. A catastrophic failure would present a much more serious failure mode than fuel leakage through the sidewall, since fragments could be propelled in all directions at high speeds and with tremendous force. Such fragments could pose a significant safety risk to vehicle occupants and others near the vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the performance criteria for the gunfire test, NGV2 states that ``The tested container shall reveal no evidence of a fragmentation failure'' and ``Loss of small pieces of composite material which would not have sufficient momentum to penetrate sheet metal typically found in automobile construction shall not constitute failure of the test.'' Under the second phrase, NGV2 allows the fragmentation of small pieces, even though the gunfire test is intended to prevent fragmentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has tentatively concluded that some of NGV2's performance requirements and test conditions are insufficiently objective for use in a FMVSS. In order to establish objective, safety criteria, NHTSA has decided to propose incorporating the recommendations by Brunswick and PST to prohibit fragments exceeding 30 grams (one ounce) in mass. Although the intent of the gunfire test is to demonstrate no fragmentation, the agency understands that small composite pieces or fragments are considered normal. Therefore, the agency has tentatively concluded that to prohibit all fragmentation, as recommended by EDO and NGV Systems would not be practicable. Similarly, the agency believes that AAMA's recommendation to prohibit the separation of pieces exceeding one gram (0.035 ounce) would not be practicable and would involve very small pieces that could be difficult to measure. NHTSA has tentatively concluded that prohibiting pieces in excess of 30 grams would provide for a practicable, objective, and safe performance criterion for the gunfire test. However, the agency requests comments on the proposed size, and whether the standard should prohibit all fragmentation or whether some smaller level of fragmentation would be measurable and safe. What is the lightest container fragment that would be readily measurable and would not pose an unreasonable risk to the safety of motorists? NHTSA also seeks comment on whether the container should be pressurized with nitrogen or air, since only one gas should be used to assure consistency of testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has tentatively determined that it is necessary to depart from certain aspects of the gunfire test in NGV2 to make the agency's proposed requirement objective and ensure repeatable test results. As proposed in this notice, these modifications include specifying the precise muzzle velocity, the projectile's path, and the precise distance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Damage Tolerance Tests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NGV2 addresses damage tolerance with three separate tests: a flaw tolerance test, a pendulum impact test, and a drop test. In general, the damage tolerance tests serve to evaluate damage caused by incidental contact with other objects. Such contact can occur in a variety of ways. For instance, containers mounted underneath the vehicle could be damaged by road debris. Similarly, containers mounted in the bed of a pickup truck could be damaged by cargo or tools being thrown on them. The flaw tolerance test evaluates abrasive damage to composite overwraps such as scratches and small cuts on the container. If the overwraps are cut or gouged, they may unravel or delaminate, possibly causing container failure. The pendulum impact evaluates sharp blows to the container. The drop test evaluates blunt impacts to the container. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA did not address damage tolerance in the January 1993 NPRM. Nevertheless, CGA, Tecogen, Comdyne, ARC, and Brunswick commented that a container's resistance to mechanical damage from incidental contact or road debris should be tested. Of these commenters, only Brunswick suggested a specific test procedure to determine container damage tolerance. Brunswick stated that NGV2 adequately addresses resistance to mechanical damage with the flaw tolerance, pendulum impact, and drop tests. In addition, it stated that the effects of more severe damage, such as a puncture, are addressed with the gunfire test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has decided to propose the three damage tolerance tests in NGV2 because the agency has tentatively concluded that, during normal use, CNG containers may be exposed to each type of external damage addressed by these tests. This may be especially true for containers sold in the aftermarket, since vehicle manufacturers would presumably be more likely than vehicle converters to design their vehicles to protect containers from exposure to road debris and other damage. This is so because vehicle manufacturers can design a CNG vehicle with container placement in mind. Converters are not involved in the original designing of the vehicles they convert and may have to place a container in a relatively vulnerable location given space limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA is proposing to subject Type 1 containers to the drop test, but not to the other two tests, since noncomposite metal containers are generally not affected by the proposed damage evaluated by those tests. Type 2, 3, and 4 composite containers would be subject to all three damage tolerance tests. The agency requests comments about the appropriateness of applying the proposed damage tolerance tests to the different types of CNG containers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In NGV2, the criterion for each damage tolerance test is that the container, after having a cut made into the container or being impacted, must sustain 1,500 pressure cycles without evidence of failure such as distortion or leakage. The only exception to this is the drop test. The drop test in NGV2 requires two alternative sets of cycling tests. If the container sustains damage that would cause its rejection at a three year inspection interval specified by NGV2, the container is tested for 1,500 cycles. In contrast, if the container sustains damage that would cause it not to be rejected at a three year inspection, it is tested for 18,000 cycles. The 1,500 cycles in NGV2 apparently corresponds to the maximum number of fills expected during the three year inspection interval. Because NGV2 requires reinspection every three years, it is structured to permit a level of damage to the container that would keep it in service until the maximum inspection interval of three years is completed. In contrast, NHTSA has no statutory authority to require container inspection after the first consumer purchase of the container. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The agency is proposing labeling requirements to encourage the periodic inspection of containers every 12 months, as explained below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Books: Dangerous obsession - Fiction POET AND DANCER by Ruth Prava Jhabvala John Murray Pounds 14.99, 199 pages BREACH CANDY by Luke Jennings Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 254 pages CLEOPATRA'S SISTER by Penelope Lively Viking Pounds 14.99, 282 pages WRITERS are often offered stories by strangers. When Ruth Prava Jhabvala is asked by a distraught old woman to write her daughter Angel's story, she is dubious but not surprised; though she knows too little about the girl to make a biography possible, and there are few papers, letters or tangible remains. I am not sure that the mixture of fact in this prologue and fiction in the rest is needed. A novel without pretence of factual authenticity seems perfectly in order and indeed one plunges into it with immediate belief and commitment. It deals with love as obsession, in human terms as madness: the total devotion of saint to sinner, of innocence to depravity. Angel and Lara, first cousins, are as diverse as two people can be. To say that Angel is plain and good, Lara electrifyingly attractive and bad, is too simplistic. Lara is not just capricious, promiscuous, impossible, but sick, identifiably mad. Beside that, Angel's mystical sense of Lara's importance is an 'absolute' emotion, making a relationship like that between worshipper and deity. Angel sacrifices everything for Lara - her own beloved mother, her close friend, her way of life, finally life itself. The story is told with great clarity, beauty and strength; it echoes much else, means more than it says, has resonances which have something, but not everything to do with style. It shows Ruth Prava Jhabvala at her peak. Breach Candy is a first novel full of zip and promise. Two narrators alternate in telling their parallel tales: June, a ballet dancer and Stanley, a director of television programmes, both, after burning their professional boats in England, have landed in Bombay, neither knowing quite which new way to take. In the Nepean Sea Bathing Club for ex-pats they meet, become friends, exchange confidences, talk of things never told before. He, of how he left his world at the age of seven, when his parents were killed in an accident; she, of how she failed on the night she was given her first starring role in ballet and never got a second chance. He tells, too, how the girl he loved betrayed him: is physical betrayal which doesn't mean much, worse than unphysical infidelity which does? As they say on exam papers, discuss. The future of fiction seems in good hands when a first novel packs so much in and at the same time leaves plenty over. There is fizzy dialogue, varied and sharp; an ear for English as spoken by Indians, not at all Peter Sellers-style; a powerful sense of weather, heat, physicality; an intimate knowledge of ballet and how things are done in it, an equal familiarity with India. The ending seems abrupt, but never mind. Much more must lie ahead. Strangers thrown together in stress or danger is a favourite fictional device, heightening feeling, speeding up relationships, magnifying everything; there are plenty of models. Hostages after a forced landing is the obvious present-day example. In Penelope Lively's Cleopatra's Sister they are seized in a Middle Eastern country where a Gadaffi-like dictator has just taken power. His enemies, having fled to Britain, he grabs the British passengers on a flight to Nairobi. Swap my enemies for them, he tells the British government. In the mounting horror and occasional hysteria, two people fall in love, and their subterranean happiness in spite of all the rest is credibly put across. The modern capital city, where Cleopatra's sister is said to have ruled, is gruesomely vivid, and its regime of capricious terror seems sinisterly familiar.</p>

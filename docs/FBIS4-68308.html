This was the first by the head of South Korea's  military department in Russia. Besides the problems of further  development of bilateral ties in the military area, discussion  of the problems of security of the Asia-Pacific region, and  chiefly that of nuclear weapons proliferation on the Korean  peninsula, occupied an important place in the talks. The Russian  defense minister expressed concern over the possibility of North  Korea's abrogation of the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation  Treaty. On his part, the Korean defense minister emphasized that  the world community's task is to prevent worsening of the  situation on the Korean Peninsula.    Pavel Grachev turned his counterpart's attention to the idea  of creating a system of collective security in Asia. And this  idea was accepted with interest. As a result of the negotiations  the defense ministers of the two countries signed the  Declaration on Military Cooperation and the Memorandum of  Understanding Between the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense  and the South Korean Ministry of National Defense on Military  Contacts.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / No bite without teeth: Europe needs its own troops and the will to commit them Last week I gave you the worm's eye view of Europe, from the Balkans. Now look at the continent (or subcontinent) from the other end of the telescope: the privileged centre, looking out. This week I was invited to a cosy little get-together in Paris, organised by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, one of those well-endowed 'foundations' associated with German political parties (in this case Chancellor Helmut Kohl's own CDU.) Only six countries were represented: the Big Three of the European Community (Germany, France, the UK) and the Hopeful Three of central Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland) - the latter being countries which have made a convincing transition to democracy, are well on the way to becoming market economies, and are directly contiguous either to the existing EC or (in the case of Hungary) to the EC as it should be after Austria joins in about 1995. We were there to talk about 'integrating the states of central and eastern Europe into western structures'. But the structures discussed were mainly those concerned with security, rather than the EC as such. The keynote speaker was Karl Lamers, the CDU/Christian Social Union spokesman on such matters, who proposed that the 'Visegrad countries' (the Hopeful Three plus Slovakia) should be admitted to the Western European Union, as a step on the way to full membership of both the EC and Nato. Everyone appreciated Mr Lamers's good intentions, but this specific proposal did not arouse much enthusiasm. WEU is prized by some for its strength and seriousness on paper, but despised by others for its weakness and frivolity on the ground. At present it has only 10 full members, all of whom also belong to both the EC and the Atlantic alliance, and are bound by treaty to come to each other's assistance if attacked - a stronger commitment than that which binds Nato members, whose treaty leaves each member to decide for itself how to respond if one of the others is attacked. At Maastricht, WEU was formally designated as both the 'European pillar' of the alliance and the 'defence component' of the future European Union. All of which makes it quite a serious affair: not so much a step on the way to either body as an inner sanctum where both overlap. But when it comes to military hardware and organisation, WEU is at best a pale shadow of Nato. Its main area of practical activity in the last year or so has been the enforcement of sanctions on Yugoslavia, and it has done little to make the operations more effective. If anything, it has got in Nato's way, by duplicating the chains of command through which forces belonging to the same group of countries are controlled. Both Nato and WEU have sought to involve central and east European countries in their activities, realising that if they did not contribute to the integration of those countries with the west they would appear completely irrelevant to Europe's post-cold war security problems. But neither has yet been able to satisfy the main demands of those countries, which are for full integration and security guarantees. Nato has set up NACC (pronounced Nack-Cee), the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, which has done some useful work but is devalued in the eyes of central Europeans by the fact that it includes a lot of remote ex-Soviet republics, in whose security Nato clearly has at most a marginal interest. (Some are already up to their necks in warfare.) WEU has avoided that mistake, confining its attentions to countries it sees as eventual candidates for EC membership: the Visegrad four plus Bulgaria, Romania and the three Baltic states. But short of full membership, with the explicit security guarantee that that would bring, it has little of practical value to offer. Central Europeans have looked carefully at western security structures. They have no doubt that for the foreseeable future Nato is the one worth dealing with, and if possible belonging to. 'Consequently,' said a Czech speaker in Paris this week, 'we do not agree with some west European countries which try to seek in WEU an alternative to the Atlantic alliance.' That dig was aimed not at Mr Lamers, who genuinely sees WEU as binding the EC and Nato closer together, but at the French - who, even while claiming to want a continued US presence in Europe, constantly warn that it is not to be counted on, and stress WEU's link to the EC while playing down its link to Nato. Yet within the west that argument has cooled down a lot in the last year. France, of course, remains outside Nato's integrated military command. But the Germans did succeed in brokering an agreement on the circumstances in which the Franco-German 'Eurocorps' would be available for Nato service, and neither in London nor in Washington is it any longer seen as a dire threat to the alliance. At the same time the US's firm refusal, despite European pleas, to put troops on the ground in Bosnia to back the Vance-Owen plan has given some substance to the French argument. Clearly there are contingencies where Europe will need a capacity to do something military, but where the US, without being strongly opposed, will not feel its own interests sufficiently engaged to be willing to commit troops. Enter, presumably, WEU. But brandishing those three magic letters will not help unless Europe itself has the troops needed and is willing to commit them. And that will not be the case unless Germany can overcome its political and constitutional inhibitions about deploying troops in a peace-enforcement role. Mr Lamers, the ball is in your court.</p>

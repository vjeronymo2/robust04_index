			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Smithfield traders step up protests Traders at London's Smithfield meat market took their protest over the rents they are being charged to the ballot box and the High Court yesterday. They are in dispute with their landlord, the Corporation of London, which is carrying out a Pounds 60m refurbishment of the market. Traders have appealed against the rents, and have run as candidates to sit on the City's general council. In council elections held yesterday, 12 of the City's 25 wards were contested, a far higher number than usual. Smithfield candidates were standing in 10 wards, and were guaranteed to provide at least two council members. Final results of the elections should be known today. Traders also began their High Court application for judicial review of rents yesterday. They said the market would cease to exist if they were not offered better terms. Mr Andrew Collins QC, appearing for Mr John Brewster, chairman of Smithfield Market Tenants' Association, said the corporation's proposals would 'render it impossible for any tenants to be found to operate in the market, so the market will cease to exist'. The corporation, he argued, had long ago conceded that it was under a duty created by the 1860 Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act to provide a market, and it would require new legislation to close the market down. In March the corporation made a 'final offer' to Smithfield tenants on rent, rates, and the nature and size of accommodation. The tenants' association said the offer was unacceptable on both finance and space grounds.</p>

In a republic with an ethnic Russian population of more than  half a million, "the diminishing number of Russian groups and  classes in kindergartens and educational institutions is bound  to cause concern in the Russian Federation," Grigory Karasin  said at a news briefing in Moscow on Tuesday.    He said this state of affairs "is on conflict with the  agreement on cooperation between the Ministry on the Affairs of  Nationalities and Regional Policy of the Russian Federation and  the State Department of Ethnic Relations of Moldova, signed in  Kishinyov [Chisinau] in November 1993."    Russia's Foreign Ministry has been receiving "numerous  appeals" from Russian-speaking citizens of Moldova and their  organizations, "expressing deep anxiety about the possibility  that, as a result of the forthcoming exams (in Moldova's  official Romanian language to be held as of April 2 by decision  of the government), non-ethnic Moldovans will be fired from  their jobs on a mass scale merely because they have not yet  mastered the Romanian language," Karasin said.    He said the Russian Foreign Ministry hoped that Moldova's  leadership would take a "well-considered decision conforming to  international standards of human rights and taking full account  of the demographic, cultural and linguistic factors that have  taken shape in the republic in the course of history."</p>

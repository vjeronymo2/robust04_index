			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Brooke hesitant over ITV ownership rule changes MR PETER BROOKE, the national heritage secretary, will tell the Commons today that he has yet to make up his mind on whether ITV ownership rules should be relaxed. There are growing signs, however, that the government is unenthusiastic. Speculation that the government might allow the nine largest ITV companies to take each other over - at present forbidden by the 1990 Broadcasting Act  -has led to rocketing ITV share prices. The expection of change lay behind Granada's recent decision to spend about Pounds 84m acquiring a 20 per cent stake in London Weekend Television. Mr Brooke will make it clear today during national heritage questions that he is being very cautious. A formal decision is unlikely before September. The National Heritage Department is reluctant to make fundamental changes to the rules covering ITV just seven months after the new 10-year licences took effect. Mr Brooke is conscious that the ITV companies are split on the issue, with Anglia, Meridian and HTV resolutely opposed to such a change. The row over the botched attempt to move News at Ten has also tended to make parliamentary opinion more negative on relaxing the takeover rules. MPs believe the government will decide against taking early action partly because of legislative difficulties. Meanwhile the ITV companies may have given the Commons national heritage committee potentially misleading information on their finances and the net amount of money they must now pay the government. The committee was told that this year the ITV system will pay the government about Pounds 367m in addition to normal company taxation, consisting of the bids for new franchises plus a slice of advertising revenue. The figure would have been Pounds 150m under the old levy system, ITV said. Yet when the Independent Television Commission announced the franchise winners in 1991 it estimated that overall the ITV companies would end up paying only Pounds 40m a year more over the life of the franchises. The apparent disparity is largely a result of the ITV companies comparing this year with 1992, the last year of the old franchises. Last year the government announced a one-off reduction in levy designed, partly at least, to give ITV a breathing space to prepare for the new system. As a result the ITV companies benefited by about Pounds 105m last year. The underlying rate of levy payments was considerably higher. The ITV companies have also saved Pounds 66m a year because they no longer have to fund the Welsh fourth channel, as well as saving about Pounds 20m in the transmission costs of Channel 4 and a further Pounds 11m because schools programmes have moved to Channel 4. Overall the ITV companies would appear to be in a better relative financial position than they indicated to the national heritage committee. US stakes, Page 18</p>

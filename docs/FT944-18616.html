			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Keep India plague in perspective Sir, I warmly congratulate you on the sensitivity and practicality of your editorial, 'Don't panic' (September 28). Would-be travellers can feel reassured, and many Indians will be glad to see the image of 'pestilence-stricken multitudes' put for once in a proper perspective. Shobhana Madhavan, 28 Newburn Street, London SE11 5PJ</p>

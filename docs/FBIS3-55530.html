			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Lillevyali from Moscow; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast]    [Text] The communist faction, one of the largest factions  of the new parliament, held a working meeting seminar in the  Moscow parliamentary center today in the run up to the start of  the work of the parliament.    [Correspondent] On the agenda of the meeting which was held  behind closed doors were issues connected with the running of  the State Duma. During the very first days of the work of the  parliament's lower chamber the communist deputies intend to give  a political assessment of the October 1993 events in Moscow and  of the referendum on the new constitution.    Replying to a question about the election of the State Duma  chairman, Deputy Viktor Zorkaltsev said that the four largest  factions: Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Russia's Choice,  Communists, and the Agrarians have decided not to put their  candidates forward for the position of speaker. He underscored  that if a faction is powerful enough it can exert its influence  in other ways. That is why representatives of the four largest  factions have decided to allow a candidate from the smallest  factions run for the post of chairman of the chamber.    [Zorkaltsev] The largest factions will put forward their  candidates for the positions of deputy chairmen. In all there  will be candidates for chairman and four deputy chairmen and  they should be put to the vote as a package. Resolving that  issue in this way provides an opportunity to elect the  leadership of the Duma in a matter of a few hours, to elect and  approve the composition of the Duma committees, and elect the  leadership of those committees without having to drag out the  resolution of the organizational matters for two to three months  as used to be the case in the past.    [Lillevyali] According to Zorkaltsev, the main bone of  contention to emerge in the Duma will concern the accomodation  of the Duma and not the election of the speaker.</p>

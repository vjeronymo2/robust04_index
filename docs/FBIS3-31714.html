			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miodrag Dundjerovic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Feb 22 (TANJUG) -- Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman who has, "through a third party", apologized to  the Jews for having minimized the number of their victims in the  Second World War, could have shown a similar gesture of good  will towards the Serbs, too, because he had grossly falsified  the data also on their pogrom in the same historical period.    "Serbs and Jews like to have lots of dead," said Tudjman and  in line with this thesis he stated the figures on their  persecutions, adjusting them to the current "home policy".    The ustashi, Croatian fascists, whose symbols have been  adopted by the new Croatian authorities, during the Second World  War killed about one million Serbs, Jews and Romanies on the  soil of the then Nazi puppet "independent state of Croatia"  (NDH).    Tudjman's apology has been purely a formal letter  communicated "through a third party" in Washington last Monday  to representatives of a few Jewish organizations.    Not only that it was long overdue and not sent to all  addresses, but it was also obvious that Tudjman's letter had  been prepared for daily political requirements.    The apology was written at the point when the announced  sanctions against Zagreb were being prepared and when the  deadline set by NATO to withdraw Croatia's regular army troops  from Bosnia-Herzegovina was expiring. The apology proved to be  "a success" as there were no sanctions, nor have the Croatian  regular army troops pulled out of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In his letter, Tudjman repented of having expressed a doubt,  in his book "Wastelands of Historical Reality," that six million  Jews had been killed during the Nazi holocaust in the Second  World War .    As a historian, Tudjman asserted that "no more" than 900,000  Jews were killed in the Second World War.    Tudjman stated in his apology that he had written a  "scientific" book while he was a political convict (is it a  justification) and that (only now) he understands the  "detriment" of some chapters in his book.    Tudjman is the author of the allegations that about 30,000  people had been killed in the ustashi death camp of Jasenovac on  the soil of the "independent state of Croatia" (NDH). Tudjman  communicated this "knowledge" in 1991, on the occasion of the  50th anniversary of the NDH.    According to reliable data, in the Jasenovac concentration  camp, Croatian fascists had killed 700,000 Serbs.    According to Jewish sources, 20,000 Jews had been killed in  Jasenovac and according to Romanies' sources, about 80,000  Romanies were killed in this camp.    Tudjman arrived at the figure on the victims in Jasenovac on  the basis of the Nazi documents issued in the days of the Third  Reich -- the German state responsible for the crimes against  humanity.    But, if he had consistently adhered to all German documents,  he could have easily found the data by the German commander for  the southeast, Lt.-Gen. Alexander Lehr who stated the figure of  400,000 Serbs killed in the NDH territory in April 1943.    Tudjman could have also found a statement by Edmund Gleiz  von  Horsten, who, from the reports received from Jasenovac had  inferred that the "number of the slaughtered Serbs was 750,000."    Finally, in order for the apology to be really sincere and  taken as well-intentioned, Tudjman should have shown by his  deeds that he had given up state symbols and state policy of the  Nazi NDH.    The continuity of the NDH has not been interrupted even  today  as may be confirmed by international organizations' data saying  that 300,000 Serbs have been expelled from Croatia and 10,000  Serb houses destroyed in the latest war.</p>

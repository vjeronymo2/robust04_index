			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / EC and US reach partial agreement in trade dispute: Breakthrough is hailed but Washington still plans some sanctions THE US and European Community last night reached partial agreement in their trade dispute over public procurement contracts although Washington still planned to impose reduced trade sanctions. As part of the agreement both sides agreed to open their government procurement markets in a move that will be worth billions of dollars to both in bidding opportunities in goods, services and heavy electrical equipment. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said in Strasbourg that the EC and US had 'withdrawn from what could have been the brink of a trade war'. But he said he and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, had failed to defuse completely the trade dispute and that the US could still ban EC telecommunications companies from competing for US government procurement contracts. The EC has reserved the right to retaliate. 'I think we have achieved a breakthrough but not a full solution,' Sir Leon said. Mr Kantor said the deal fell short of US demands. He said the sanctions, which had been due to come into effect today, would be smaller than threatened to reflect the compromise. The US has to submit new formal proposals if it wants to impose a ban in the telecommunications equipment sector alone. It is estimated that any sanctions could be less than Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.50m) while the EC stands to gain Dollars 5bn to Dollars 10bn in bidding opportunities in heavy electrical equipment alone, and the US Dollars 20bn. Sir Leon said a process had been started through which he was sure the 'indefensible and pernicious' Buy American provisions, which give preference to US contract tenders, would be eliminated below federal level - in areas such as public transport, waterways, ports and airports. The European Commission will recommend that provisions in the EC's new utilities directive, which discriminate in favour of EC bids, should be lifted for heavy electrical equipment. However, the provisions will be retained for telecommunications equipment and Sir Leon said: 'We fully reserve the right to react in whatever way we think proper when we see what the Americans actually intend to do.' The Commission would have to submit a proposal for reprisals to member states, which are said to be divided on the question. Sir Leon said that problem would be considered only when the US had decided what reduced measures to take in the telecommunications sector. The UK, Germany and the Netherlands are concerned to avoid a possible trade war with the US, but the new French government may take a more aggressive attitude on sanctions. Last night Britain's Department of Trade, expressing full support for the line taken by the EC, said it was pleased there had been at least a partial result. The US will remove its Buy America preferences on the Tennessee Valley Authority and the five federal power administrations of the Department of Energy. Sir Leon hailed US agreement to ask all 50 states, as well as big cities and utilities, whether they would withdraw Buy American provisions in local procurement rules. He said 33 states had said they would abandon such provisions. Sir Leon said the consultation with states on the Buy American clauses would not go on indefinitely. The agreement between the two trading partners could be revoked after a year. Following fierce disputes about the statistical assessment of the two very different public procurement markets, the two sides have also agreed that an independent study should be conducted, to compare the openness of EC and US public contract procedures. Sir Leon and Mr Kantor met in Washington earlier this week for talks but failed to resolve their differences, although officials said they came close. 'You wouldn't believe the number of offers we have put to them,' an EC official said yesterday. 'No stone has been left unturned.' American business welcomes EC pact, Page 7</p>

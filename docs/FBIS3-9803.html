			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Albanian Helsinki Committee] </F>   [Text] The 21-year-old Fredi Muca has been added to the  number of Albanians killed on the border. During 1993 and 1994  the number of Albanians killed along the border with the  Republic of the Former Yugoslavia amounts to 14 and eight have  been injured; along the border with The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia [FYROM] one has been killed and three injured; and  along the border the Republic of Greece we note the latest case,  dated 22 March 1994, which resulted in one person killed.    Albanian official sources report that in the Greek village  of  Kostinec, 3 km into Greek territory, 21-year-old Fredi Abaz  Muca, a resident of Bubullime village in Lushnje, was shot by an  automatic rifle pointed at his chest.    The Albanian Helsinki Committee asks the Greek authorities  to  take the necessary measures to investigate the incident that  occurred and eventually convict in a court of law the person who  caused the crime, on the basis of Greek laws currently in effect.    The committee simultaneously requests that such cases be  stopped and not repeated as they flagrantly violate human rights  and create tension in the friendly relations that exist between  the Greek and Albanian Republics.</p>

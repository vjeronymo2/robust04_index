			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> SCHOOL EMPLOYEES TO KEEP PICKETING  </P> <P> Negotiators for about 800 non-teaching employees who are locked in a contract  dispute with the Anaheim City School District say they will continue to picket  meetings of the Board of Education until a state mediator arrives next month.  </P> <P> At issue are this year's pay increases: The district has offered the employees  a 6% raise and the employees are holding out for 7%.  </P> <P> An impasse in negotiations was declared at the end of January, and a state  mediator is scheduled to conduct three meetings with the two sides in April.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the employees say they plan to demonstrate -- as they did last  month -- with picket signs and bullhorns at the twice-monthly board meetings.  </P> <P> "We're very hopeful that the board will be personally involved with the  mediator in settling this," said Jack Ashley, a field representative for the  California School Employees Assn. "After that process is followed, I won't rule  out anything. The employees are upset."  </P> <P> District Supt. Meliton Lopez said he feels confident that the pay issue will be  resolved quickly with the help of the mediator, and that the employees will not  feel a need to strike.  </P> <P> "I like to think we have a good relationship with our employees," said Lopez.  "I hope we're not at the point where there would be a work stoppage." LISA  MASCARO  </P></p>

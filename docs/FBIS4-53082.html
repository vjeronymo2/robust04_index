			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Two senior members of former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP)  proposed Monday [16 May] disbanding a four-party parliamentary  group called Kaishin (Innovation), political sources said.    JNP legislators Satsuki Eda and Satoshi Arai filed the  proposal with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the sources said.    Kaishin comprises 130 members in the House of  Representatives  of four coalition parties -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  JNP, the Democratic Socialist Party and Jiyuto (Liberals) --  plus five independents.    The April 25 establishment of Kaishin led to the departure  of  the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] from the  ruling coalition, forcing Hata to form a minority government.    Kaishin ranks second in terms of strength in the lower house  only after the main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic  Party.</p>

No one, for instance, seems to be able to work out whether Helmut Kohl's re-election is good or bad news for John Major's European policy. The European editor of The Times, George Brock, writing on the Op Ed page, has Kohl pushing 'European unification as hard as he can', while the leader on the next page has him beginning to 'champion the decentralisation of power away from the Commission'. At least the ubiquitous Josef Joffe, editorial page editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, who managed chunky pieces yesterday in both The Independent and The International Herald Tribune, is saying pretty well exactly the same thing in both organs.</p>

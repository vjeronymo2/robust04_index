			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: Thumbs down from grain traders in US US GRAIN traders yesterday expressed disappointment about President Bill Clinton's Russian aid programme, even though nearly half the Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) package is earmarked for concessionary grain sales. They said it had not normalised the lucrative grain trade with Moscow, which stalled in November due to Russian arrears. Traders voted with their wallets yesterday morning, pushing futures prices for wheat, corn and soyabeans lower at the Chicago Board of Trade. Mr Clinton has offered Dollars 700m for grain sales to Russia under the food for progress aid programme. However, exporters say only about Dollars 500m will be available for grain purchases, and the balance will have to be used to pay for shipping it. US food aid programmes are subject to cargo preference provisions, a concession made long ago to US longshoremen's unions. The provisions require food aid to be transported on US-flagged vessels, which can be as much as Dollars 50 per tonne more expensive than other ships. There had been some hope Russian food aid would be exempted from the law. 'Clinton has clearly lost the battle with the unions' on the cargo preference issue, said Mr Richard Feltes, senior grain analyst with Refco, the Chicago-based trading firm. The summit package will provide for about Dollars 70m per month in bulk grain shipments to Russia over the next seven months, well below the Dollars 200m to Dollars 250m per month exported to the country before its debt problems stalled sales under US-guaranteed commercial loans, Mr Feltes said. About 40 per cent of grain exported under the aid package will be wheat, with the balance corn and soyabeans. Another Dollars 194m has been designated for sales of value-added products. Exporters said much of that will be vegetable oil, which is in short supply in Russia.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US bans EC from bids on Dollars 20m contracts THE Clinton administration yesterday imposed a ban on bids by EC companies for Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) worth of US government contracts. There has been a long transatlantic dispute over the Community's utilities procurement rules. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's top trade negotiator, said the move was 'neither justified, wise or necessary'. The EC could not ignore the 'wholly unjustified action.' The US move was was nevertheless expected. In April the US and EC resolved part of the dispute over procurement of heavy electric power equipment by allowing each other's companies to bid on government contracts without receiving special preferences. But because the two sides could not agree on telecommunications rules, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, was forced to act to satisfy both Congress and US law. Mr Kantor originally threatened about Dollars 45m in sanctions just as a first step. The ultimate Dollars 20m action could be seen as no more than symbolic. The US and EC agreed to a process which they expect to lead to an accord in negotiations on the procurement code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

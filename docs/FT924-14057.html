			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Schroders considers Wertheim takeover Schroders, the City merchant bank, confirmed yesterday that it is considering taking full control of Wertheim, the Wall Street securities house in which it has held a 50 per cent stake since 1986, writes David Barchard. However, the bank denied that active negotiations for a cash sale had got under way. 'The future of our relationship with Wertheim has been under discussion for some time, but there are no negotiations in progress,' the bank said. To acquire 100 per cent control of Wertheim, which made Dollars 30m profits last year, would probably cost around Dollars 100m.</p>

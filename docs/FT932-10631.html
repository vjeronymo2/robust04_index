			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US demand boosts oil prices DEMAND FROM US refineries for North Sea oil pushed prices through the important Dollars 19-a-barrel barrier this week as refiners went on a buying spree. Estimates by the International Energy Agency, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's oil monitoring body, of a rise in second quarter demand yesterday underlined the bullish sentiment in the oil market. The IEA said it expected demand to rise by 500,000 barrels a day in the second quarter, or about 1.5 per cent, over the same period last year with moderate gains expected in all regions. In addition, the IEA estimated that production by Opec slipped to 24.1m b/d in April from 24.4m b/d in March. The second quarter is traditionally a time of weak oil demand when prices decline. But last year, prices actually firmed towards the end of the period and some buyers want to book their supplies in case that happens again. 'There are not many cargoes of wet crude left at the moment and refiners are buying ahead of maintenance shutdowns in the North Sea in June,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney. North Sea prices were up 5 cents a barrel yesterday at Dollars 19.25 a barrel. The IEA said that Russian oil production averaged 7.24m b/d in the first quarter, a fall of 14 per cent from the same period a year ago. But the agency said in its latest monthly oil report, that monthly figures to March confirm a slowing of the decline in Russian output.</p>

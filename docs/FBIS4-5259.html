			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article: "Laos... The Gold Mine on the Mekong River's </F> Bank"]    [Summary] "Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice chairman of the  Laos Commission for Cooperation and Planning, confirmed that the  LPDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] is quite rich in natural  resources compared to other countries in this region. At  present, forests cover 47 percent of the total area of the  country. Geographically speaking, Laos can build as many as 18  hydroelectric dams with a combined production of electricity of  14,000 megawatts. Forty percent of the water in the Mekong River  comes from Lao territory." French geologists have confirmed  that huge deposits of over 10 precious minerals were found in  different parts of the country.    Dr. Wiraphong Ramangkun, former economic advisor to the Lao  Government and secretary of the Thai-Lao Friendship Association,  disclosed that the lignite deposit discovered in the area of  Hong Sa Special Zone "is three times larger than that of  Thailand's Mae Mo mine and sufficient for electricity production  for up to 60 years"    Moreover, zinc, tungsten, and gypsum can also be found in  large quantities in Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, and Xieng  Khwang Provinces while blue sapphire is also plentiful in Bokeo  Province. Phadaeng Industry Company of Thailand reported the  discovery of additional huge deposits of zinc and other minerals  in southern Laos, while a French oil exploration company is  considering the commercial viability of tapping the country's  petroleum resources.    "Speaking about the advantage of Laos' geographic location,  Somnouk Khaiy-gnavong, deputy secretary general of the Lao  National Trade and Industries Council and former director  general of Laos' National Economic and Social Development  Planning Department, said Laos shares common borders with five  countries namely Thailand, China, Burma, Vietnam, and Cambodia.  Therefore, it can serve well as a trade center for this region."    Laos' first four-year economic development, covering the  period from 1981 to 1985 was designed to heal the wounds of war.  The second economic development plan, 1986 to 1990,  concentrated on promoting the free trade system and establishing  a strong currency. The year 1989 saw bright economic prospects  as a result of the influx of foreign investment. The current  third development plan, according to Somphong Mongkhonvilai,  emphasizes the endeavors to tap and fully exploit the country's  natural resources and bring about self-sufficiency to Laos.  Under this development plan, 1991-1995, Laos will find ways to  attract more foreign investors and promote production of goods  for domestic consumption to alleviate the country's dependence  on imports.    "The drafting of the fourth economic development plan  (1996-2000) is complete. The blueprint is currently under  scrutiny by the National Assembly. The major contents are  likely to be left untouched. The plan must pass through the  National Assembly before its promulgation."    Somnouk Khai-gnavong, also a member of the committee in  charge of drafting the development plan, revealed that "the  fourth plan opens the door wider because the Lao Government's  objective is to turn the country into the energy and free trade  center of the region. The LPDR will use Singapore as a good  example in doing trade."    "Under this development plan, Laos will divide the country  into five development zones. The northern region with Xieng  Khwang Province as its center will emphasize animal husbandry.  The central region including Vientiane Municipality will  concentrate on tourism and industrial development. Khammouane  Province will stress electricity production and processing  industries while the two southern provinces -- Savannakhet and  Champassak -- will pursue agricultural development and trade."    Moreover, the economic development programs for the  northern region comprising Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang,  Oudomsai, and Phong Saly are also designed to be compatible with  the Northern Quadrangle Economic Development Scheme. Bokeo,  Phong Saly, and Luang Namtha are classifed as trade zones,  whereas Luang Prabang and Oudomsai will become a special zone  for tourism and mining industry.    Following the opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge,  Vientiane Municipality will be turned into a trade and  investment center. A cultural and arts center inside the  municipality will help promote tourism. A business area will be  located in Tha Naleng near the bridge. The industrial zone will  be in Saithani District along Road No. 13 from kilometer markers  18 to 27. The industrial area in the southern region will be  located at Nakai in Khamouan Province because of its proximity  to the seaport in Vietnam.    Savannakhet Province will become the free port town, a  transit point for the transportation of goods from Danang port  to Thailand and vice versa. Savannakhet's trade system will be  similar to those of other free port towns elsewhere. There will  be tax-free shops, wholesalers, and retailers. Champassak  Province, after the construction of Pakse Bridge, will be able  to trade with both Thailand and Cambodia.    In its attempts to review economic management, the LPDR has  passed an economic law for the promotion and protection of  foreign investment in the LPDR.    However, common shortcomings observed by business people who  went to explore investment opportunities in Laos are:    1. Laos has no laws for protecting the operation of  financial institutes, insurance, and real estate businesses.  The revenue of financial institutes in Laos comes from fees  collected from loan transfers and related services.    2. Investors are left to face inconveniences caused by  bureaucratic red tape, bribery, and a sluggish attitude among  officials concerned.    3. The country lacks a quality work force and has no  business administration schools to produce qualified graduates.    4. Public facilities such as roads, electricity, and running  tap water are insufficient.    5. The government is unable to control the unrealistically  high cost of living. The cost of living is incompatible with  the people's income and may later become a major problem in the  country.    "The present LPDR might resemble Thailand 30 years ago. But  in 2000, Laos might be able to compete with Brunei in terms of  per capita income. But this depends on how well the Lao  Government can build the country's economy. If everything  proceeds as planned in the fourth economic plan, the realization  of such a dream is not beyond the reach of the Lao Government.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Crown Life: Correction The criticisms by Lautro reported in Tuesday's Financial Times under the heading 'Lautro raps life company's pension deals' related to CCL Assurance, not to Crown Life as inaccurately stated in the report. Century Life has acquired the pensions business both of CCL Assurance and of Crown Life and there has been no criticism by Lautro of Crown Life. We apologise for any confusion caused by the error.</p>

Chairing the first working session with the commissioner,  general directors, and area directors of the National Institute  To Combat Drugs [INCD], Valades Rios remarked: "Present here are  many of the leaders who will make a victory in this area really  happen."    Speaking before Raul Campos Rabago, commissioner of the  National Institute To Combat Drugs, the head of the institution  of federal justice declared that the public servants working for  it are the initiators of a new institutional project in the  country. "Many doubted that the creation of an institute of this  type was possible, and many are now admitting their mistake in  doubting the chances for success of an agency such as this. Our  achievements are being demonstrated every day."    Addressing the personnel comprising the aforementioned  institute's top-level administration, the attorney general  indicated that the programs already established will be  continued, and that none of what has already been gained will be  left unfinished.    The official asserted: "The commitment is not one for  changing, but rather for intensifying and carrying even further  what has been done with enormous effort. Expanding the results  accrued is a commitment to the nation, the president, and  ourselves."    Diego Valades claimed that it was now necessary to spur the  efforts already expended, "not only to halt the large volumes of  drugs circulating in the country and contribute to the health  sector's activities, but also to restore to our society the  confidence that others are attempting to deny it." [passage  omitted]    Diego Valades added: "At times, we must exert great patience  in surmounting the limitations on such fundamental resources as  our physical facilities. However, I know not only your problems,  but also your capacities and potential. We shall solve your  problems, because that is our responsibility. And you will be  assigned to solve the country's problems insofar as drugs are  concerned."    The official stressed that the training and refresher  courses  for both agents of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office and  those of the Federal Judicial Police have made it possible to  form a professional group to investigate this type of crime. He  commented: "We have a great professional capacity, and a great  individual and collective will. I am sure that, day by day,  intense efforts will be expended on work as well as collective  intelligence exercises, that will make it possible to provide  solutions for the problems arising every day."

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Two deals shake Italy's banks: Takeover and merger proposals could tighten banking ownership The shape of Italian banking altered sharply yesterday following two moves which will tighten ownership of the industry in the private sector. Following days of speculation within the industry, Ambroveneto is to be taken over by Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) to create the country's second-largest banking group while Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna-based bank, plans to merge with the Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna group (Caer) the regional savings institution. Rolo's merger plan is an attempt to fight off a hostile bid by the recently privatised Credito Italiano. The Comit takeover of Ambroveneto has been market gossip for several days; but the Rolo-Caer merger came as a surprise. It would create Italy's 10th largest bank and comes less than a month after the two had abandoned talks on a smaller-scale merger. Comit said it wanted to purchase 51 per cent of Ambroveneto but would aim initially for 29 per cent of the stock held by the core of controlling shareholders. It offered L7,000 per share for the 144.4m shares among these shareholders. The defensive move by Rolo, controlled by a core of shareholders led by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, will have to overcome some complex legal considerations. These centred upon whether a merger could occur while a takeover bid was in progress. The formal takeover by Credito Italiano cannot be launched until the prospectus has been approved by Consob, the stock exchange watchdog and this is unlikely to be complete until November 15. This could mean that the first extraordinary meeting of Rolo shareholders will hear not the takeover offer but the merger. The L2,010bn (Dollars 1.3bn) Credito bid for 48.2 per cent of Rolo's stock valuing each share at L19,000 was launched last Wednesday, and was the largest in Italy since new takeover rules were introduced in 1992. It followed three weeks of heavy trading in Rolo shares which rose in price by more than 30 per cent. Rolo's merger decison comes after the appointment of foreign advisors, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to assess the takeover. Rolo said the merger would be on the basis of 1.31 of its nominal L1,000 shares for every nominal L10,000 Caer share. Rolo has a market capitalisation of L4,895bn. This is a premium of some L3,000 per share on that offered by Credito and applies to all the shares. Caer was valued at L2,397bn. Caer is a holding company with 76.4 per cent of the Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna (Carisbo), the savings bank. Caer in turn is controlled, like most savings banks, by a foundation which has 93 per cent of the stock. If the merger were to go through, the foundation would possess 30 per cent of the new group, probably to be called Rolo-Cassa. The two have discussed a limited merger for the past year. The deal collapsed partly because it was too narrow in scope and applied only to a share-swap with Carisbo. Faced with the threat of being gobbled up by Milan-based Credito, they appear to have quickly overcome these reservations and broadened the scope of the original merger. Rolo called extraordinary shareholders meetings on December 19 and 20 to approve the defensive deal.</p>

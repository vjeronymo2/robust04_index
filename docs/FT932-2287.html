			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Surge in orders for cremator makers MR PAUL HAYWARD does not often reveal his profession at parties. But as one of Britain's longest-established cremator makers he has reason to be decidedly upbeat. With Britain's crematoria due to replace their 700 cremators over the next few years, the country's tiny cremator making business is experiencing a boom. Mr Hayward, cremator director of Cheshire-based Furnace Construction said: 'Britain has been leading the way in cremation and cremator making for some time - this can only help.' The company, like the handful of other cremator makers, is expecting orders to rise by at least 40 per cent next year. Mr Hayward said that in the 50 years he had been in business his cremators had changed considerably. When he started the cremation rate was only 10 per cent. Now the rate is nearly 70 per cent, handling nearly 500,000 incinerations a year. The construction process demands extensive research and development to cope with the demand for environmentally friendly, computerised cremators. As uncertainty over environmental legislation triggered a fall in domestic demand during the 1980s cremator makers tried to expand overseas - Australia, with a 47 per cent cremation rate, has been a fruitful market, while Germany and the Netherlands have also been buyers. In Britain the industry seems set for several years of steady expansion. Mr Max Kingsland, chief executive of the cremator division of Evans Universal, said: 'There aren't many industries where Britain is still strong at home. But this is one of them.' His comapny has a turnover of about Pounds 4m a year from its cremator business.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Heavy futures trade magnifies erratic price movements Europe's government bond markets saw another day of erratic price action, with price swings magnified by heavy trading in the futures pits and low turnover in the cash market. After a directionless morning, most markets closed higher on the day, lifted by stronger US Treasuries and rumours of much lower-than-expected preliminary inflation numbers in Germany's four largest states. German government bonds rose sharply in the afternoon after the December bund futures breached important chart-technical resistance at 88.50, triggering a flurry of short-covering. In late trading, the contract was up 0.70 point at 88.82. Rumours that the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia would release favourable inflation numbers today also lifted bunds. While general market expectations have been for a year-on-year western German inflation rate of around 3.0 per cent for the month to mid-September, some traders yesterday were talking of a rate as low as 2.3 per cent. Bunds derived some relief from the publication of the Bundesbank's bond issuance calendar for the remainder of the year, which indicated the government plans to issue only two more long-dated bonds in the final quarter. 'There isn't that much long-dated supply left in the pipeline - the funding situation looks better than a lot of people have feared,' said a London bund dealer. UK gilt prices staged a late rally, rising nearly a point as the market digested a rumour that today's CBI monthly trends survey, not due to be published until after midnight, contained good news on inflation. Gilts' increase was helped by a rise in bunds and on Liffe, the December long gilt future reached 99 1/16 in late trading, a rise of 15/16 points on the day. The yield spread over bunds was around 146 in late trading. Mr John Shepperd of Yamaichi said traders believed the CBI survey, which is one of the factors taken into account by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England at their monthly monetary meetings, would show that the proportion of companies reporting higher prices had fallen. After outperforming most of Europe this week, Italy's bond market lagged gains elsewhere amid growing worries that the budget package under discussion may not be finalised before its end-September deadline. All eyes are on meetings between government and trade union leaders over the government's pension reform plans, and traders said the market would remain nervous until some hard facts emerge. The Italian December bond future on Liffe fell 0.08 point to 98.32. US Treasury bond traders took a measure of encouragement yesterday from comments by a former Federal Reserve policy-maker. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/4 better at 96, with the yield slipping to 7.78 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 19/32 , to yield 6.456 per cent. In the absence of any attention-grabbing economic data, the morning brought some subdued buying at the bedraggled long end of the maturity range. There was no fundamental shift in sentiment, which remained decidedly negative in view of recent evidence of accelerating inflation. With yields on the 30-year issue now at their highest level in two years, the market simply made a slight correction in long-term rates. Speculation over the timing of the next increase in short-term interest rates continued to dominate activity. A day earlier, comments by Mr Wayne Angell, a former Fed governor who now serves as chief economist for Bear Stearns, had helped push bond prices lower. Mr Angell predicted the central bank would decide to lift short-term rates by an aggressive 50 basis points at next week's meeting of its policy-making arm. Yesterday, however, comments by Mr David Mullins, a former Fed vice-chairman, served to ease tensions over the rate outlook. The Washington Post quoted Mr Mullins as saying the economy would achieve equilibrium with a rate increase of just a quarter point. All the chatter over policy kept up the pressure on the short end, which would feel the direct impact of any rate adjustment. Still, the two-year issue managed to improve slightly in the late afternoon. Congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan proved to be a non-event for bonds. With traders listening intently for any hints about policy, the Fed chairman confined his remarks to banking issues. The market ignored news that initial claims for unemployment benefit had fallen by 7,000 last week - anecdotal evidence that wage pressures were building in the labour market.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix_Evaluation and Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On November 5, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was issued to Richardson X-Ray, Inc. (Licensee) for violations identified during an NRC inspection conducted on July 29 and 30, 1993. The Licensee responded to the Notice in a letter, dated November 30, 1993. In its response, the Licensee admitted the violations but requested remission of the penalties, based on its corrective actions and its alleged inability to pay. The NRC's evaluations and conclusion regarding the Licensee's requests are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Licensee admitted the violations, but requested remission of the proposed civil penalties, in whole or in part, on the following bases: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In response to earlier violations of state radiography requirements, the State of California had required the Licensee to obtain the services of a consultant to provide radiation safety training and perform unannounced job site surveys of each radiographer. The cost of hiring the consultant was $10,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Corrective actions taken by the Licensee after the Enforcement Conference included appointing a new RSO and terminating the prior RSO, and implementing a disciplinary policy for radiographic personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The imposition of the civil penalties would cause a financial burden on the licensee to the point of possible forfeiture of its radioactive materials license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Request for Mitigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has evaluated the Licensee's response and has determined that an adequate basis was not provided for full remission or reduction of the civil penalties, however mitigation of the civil penalties is warranted based on the Licensee's corrective actions is warranted. In particular: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Earlier inspections by the NRC and the State of California had identified similar violations by Licensee personnel during the two years preceding the July 1993 NRC inspection. For example, in December 1991 Licensee was cited by the State of California for: (1) Failure to perform surveys of the radiographic exposure device, (2) failure to recharge a pocket dosimeter at the beginning of the shift, and (3) failure to perform quarterly audits of radiographic personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In April 1992, the Licensee was cited by the State of California for: (1) Failure to wear personal monitoring devices, (2) failure to perform surveys of the radiographic exposure device, (3) failure to post the restricted area and high radiation area, (4) failure to maintain surveillance of the restricted area to prevent unauthorized access into the high radiation area, (5) failure to maintain records of surveys, source usage, and training, and (6) failure to perform quarterly audits of radiographic personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In May 1992, the State of California held an Enforcement Conference with the Licensee to discuss the violations identified during the April 1992 inspection. As a result of the Enforcement Conference the Licensee was required to hire a consultant to perform radiation safety training and audits of radiographic personnel. The Licensee's hiring of a consultant in May 1992 did not prevent recurrence of the same types of violations in July 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Costs incurred by licensees to ensure compliance and implementation of their radiation safety programs are not considered in determining the base civil penalty, nor in escalating or mitigating the civil penalty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Licensee cites additional corrective actions in its response that include appointing a new RSO, terminating the prior RSO and implementing a disciplinary policy for radiographic personnel. The NRC recognizes that the Licensee took immediate corrective actions following the inspector's identification of the violations which included retraining of all radiographers and assistant radiographers, monitoring with regular unannounced job site audits, ensuring radiographers have the needed equipment prior to leaving for the job and ensuring that the radiographers are trained on all equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The November 5, 1993, Notice stated that based on the repetitiveness of the violations, the Licensee's 1992 corrective actions were inadequate and that additional corrective actions needed to be considered to prevent further repetition. Given that the Licensee's more recent corrective actions were timely and extensive, these actions support a $5,000 reduction of the $25,000 civil penalties proposed in the November 5, 1993 Notice, based on mitigation consistent with the Enforcement Policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Based on its review of the financial information provided by the Licensee, the NRC determined that the Licensee possesses sufficient financial resources to pay the proposed civil penalties over a period of time, including interest. Accordingly, a payment schedule has been developed and is enclosed in the form of a Promissory Note in Payment of the Civil Penalties (Note). The Licensee, however, may pay the civil penalties in full, if it so desires. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the above, the proposed civil penalties should not be reduced based on the Licensee's alleged inability to pay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Based on its evaluation of the Licensee's response, the NRC concludes that the Licensee's timely and extensive corrective actions support a $5,000 reduction of the $25,000 civil penalties proposed in the November 5, 1993 Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice, based on mitigation consistent with the Enforcement Policy. Accordingly, civil monetary penalties in the amount of $20,000 should be imposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12497 Filed 5&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

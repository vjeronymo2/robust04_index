			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L CHIEF DIRECTED FRAUD, MCKINZIE JURY TOLD;  </P> <P> TRIAL: DR. DUAYNE CHRISTENSEN MASTERMINDED THE SCHEME TO LOOT NORTH AMERICA  SAVINGS, USING JANET FAYE MCKINZIE ONLY AS A DRUGGED TOOL, HER LAWYER SAID.  </P> <P> The dead man did it.  </P> <P> So concluded defense attorney Richard (Racehorse) Haynes during closing  arguments Thursday in the seven-week trial of Janet Faye McKinzie, who is  accused of looting North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana with the help  of the thrift's president, Duayne D. Christensen.  </P> <P> Haynes told jurors in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana that Christensen -- a  former dentist who died in a mysterious car crash just 9 1/2 hours before  regulators seized the institution -- was the mastermind of a plot to steal tens  of millions of dollars from North America.  </P> <P> Christensen and McKinzie lived lavishly, spending freely on everything from  extravagant parties with Sammy Davis Jr. as entertainment to trinkets such as a  $500 gold paper clip.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Paul Seave portrayed the couple in his closing arguments  as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, working together to carry out complicated  schemes to defraud the thrift. The jury is expected to begin deliberations  today.  </P> <P> McKinzie, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to 26 counts of  racketeering, bank fraud, wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen  property. If convicted, she faces a sentence of more than 200 years in prison.  </P> <P> But Haynes characterized McKinzie as "a washed-out zombie" simply taking orders  from Christensen, who was allegedly plying her with massive doses of  prescription drugs, including anti-anxiety medications such as Xanax.  </P> <P> Haynes, one of the nation's leading defense attorneys, called Christensen the  Jim Jones of the savings and loan industry, a reference to the cult religious  figure who led more than 900 followers in a mass suicide in Guyana.  </P> <P> Christensen "was able to make people believe things that weren't true," Haynes  contended. "He could make them put the cyanide in the Kool-Aid. That was Dr.  Christensen."  </P> <P> But prosecutor Seave balked at the notion that North America's 1987 collapse  was only Christensen's doing.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is Dr. Christensen was a crook," Seave said, "and the  defendant was his right-hand man."  </P> <P> He told jurors that McKinzie was completely aware of what she was doing, taking  the lead in two schemes to defraud North America of more than $16 million. He  produced document after document that the prosecution has said were falsified  at McKinzie's instruction to cover up the schemes.  </P> <P> "For her counsel to suggest she was insane at the time," Seave said, "is  preposterous."  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors showed jurors a memo allegedly from McKinzie that  supposedly ordered the forging of some bank documents.  </P> <P> "Put in sealed envelopes so it looks professional and I'll open. Be sure to  sign good," McKinzie allegedly wrote.  </P> <P> "Does this sound like someone who has a bad memory, is confused, intoxicated,  acting like a robot?" Seave asked jurors. "Dr. Christensen was not there,  behind her, moving her arms, moving her lips. . . . The evidence is  overwhelming (that) the defendant knew exactly what she was doing."  </P> <P> Haynes appealed to the jury to acquit McKinzie. "Take the manipulative hands  (of Christensen) off the body and soul of this woman and let her go home," he  said.  </P> <P> The North America trial represents the government's first use of RICO (the  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) against a failed S&amp;L on  the West Coast. RICO was used so that the government could freeze the proceeds  from a $10-million life insurance policy that Christensen had bought for  McKinzie.  </P> <P> North America was shut down in 1988, costing taxpayers $120 million.  </P></p>

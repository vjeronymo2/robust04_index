			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: If it's good enough for teachers, it's good enough for MPs Sir, The government is busily abolishing the minimum wage and you report education secretary, John Patten, as rejecting the teachers' current pay claim on the basis that 'students are queueing up to be teachers' ('9 per cent choose teaching as their first choice of career', September 21). Is it not time, therefore, to adopt a similar approach to MPs' (and ministers') pay? There is, after all, no shortage of candidates for election to Parliament or appointment to ministerial office. Why should there be a statutory minimum wage for these posts, which also carry regular increases? Candidates should be asked to state, before election or appointment, what salary they require: electors, etc, would then have the chance to consider cost as one among the factors influencing their choice. Moreover, assessment of performance would be introduced to Parliament: it is quite apparent that some MPs work harder than others. Considerable savings might well result. Government might conceivably become more efficient. Or is competitive tendering and performance-related pay only for others? Colin G C Tite, 12 Montagu Square, London W1H 1RB</p>

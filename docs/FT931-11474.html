			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Frankfurt airport puts freeze on recruitment THE Frankfurt airport authorities yesterday announced a recruitment freeze until April 1 in an effort to cut labour costs and stem losses. Mr Wilhelm Bender, who took over as president of Flughafen Frankfurt Main last month, warned that the company's net loss for 1992 would be 'as high as the previous year'. The airport recorded a DM29.4m (Dollars 18m) loss for the fiscal year ending December 31 1991. Mr Bender blamed mainly increasing labour costs, which accounted for 43 per cent of the company's overall expenses in 1992. 'We are faced with a drastic erosion of our basic capital if we don't change direction,' he said. He did not expect the airport to return to profits in the near future.</p>

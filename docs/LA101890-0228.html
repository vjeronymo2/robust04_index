			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT SIDELINES TITAN DEFENDER  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton cornerback Nuygen Pendleton, victim of a hit-and-run  accident in the parking lot of a Lakewood restaurant-nightclub last Saturday  night, will miss the Titans' final five games because of a knee injury.  </P> <P> Pendleton, a senior, was examined Wednesday by team physician Dr. Joseph  Cummings, who determined that Pendleton had torn both medial collateral  ligaments in his left knee. Surgery won't be required, but Pendleton will have  to wear a brace for about five weeks and then rehabilitate his leg.  </P> <P> Pendleton said he had dinner with some friends Saturday at the Red Onion at  5117 Lakewood Blvd., then remained at the club until about midnight for  dancing.  </P> <P> On his way out, he said, he met some more friends and was talking with them in  the parking lot when a car struck his leg. Pendleton said he flipped on top of  the hood and was thrown to the pavement as the driver sped off.  </P> <P> Pendleton said a friend, Vincent Williams, chased the driver in another car.  According to Michael Fields, a Lakewood Police Department deputy, Williams  detained the driver about two miles from the restaurant and held him until  police arrived.  </P> <P> The driver, identified as Jeffery Pete, 32, of Cerritos was charged with felony  drunk driving and felony hit and run. Fields, who is investigating the  accident, said Pete was driving 15 to 20 m.p.h. at the time of impact.  </P> <P> "As soon as I got hit, I thought I'd never play football again," said  Pendleton, the third Titan starter to sustain a season-ending injury and the  12th to be sidelined for at least a game. "This is so frustrating. Everybody's  getting injured, and nothing is going well for the team."  </P> <P> There is some question as to what Pendleton was doing there in the first place.  In the wake of a shooting outside a Fullerton nightclub that involved several  football players last April, Titan Coach Gene Murphy made his players sign a  code of conduct that placed nightclubs off-limits.  </P> <P> Murphy wouldn't reveal specifics of the agreement, but Pendleton said it  pertained only to Orange County nightclubs. Lakewood is in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "Guys have gone to clubs outside the county, in Riverside or Los Angeles,"  Pendleton said. "The coach didn't seem to have a problem with that."  </P> <P> Asked if he would take disciplinary action against Pendleton, Murphy, who as of  Wednesday hadn't discussed the incident with him, said, "I don't even want to  talk about that."  </P> <P> Pendleton said he plans to file suit against the driver. He said Saturday night  was the first time he had gone to a nightclub in several weeks.  </P> <P> "I obviously picked the wrong time," Pendleton said. "I shouldn't have been  there, but that's something I have to live with."  </P> <P> * TITANS HOLD HEADS UP  </P> <P> Despite a 1-6 record, players don't appear to have lost their esprit de corps.

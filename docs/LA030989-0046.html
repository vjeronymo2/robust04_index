			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Actor Buddy Rogers was at the new Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in  Griffith Park Wednesday to dedicate the Mary Pickford Education Center and  Library. The center features three classrooms, a docent library and the  administrative complex for the Western museum's education department. The  center was funded by a $225,000 grant from the Mary Pickford Foundation, a  donation made "because programs at the museum will emphasize the role of women  and minorities, something about which Mary felt strongly," said Rogers, husband  of the late film star. He said that only once before has the Mary Pickford  Foundation awarded funding at that level. A similar amount was given for the  Mary Pickford Theater at the Library of Congress.

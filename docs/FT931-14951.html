			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Safer hands at the wheel A Scottish company has developed a car horn switch using membrane technology that provides more space for an airbag in the steering wheel centre. It will allow airbags to be fitted into any model and eliminate the possibility of dangerous fragments flying about when they are activated. The strong, flat, safe switch from John McGavigan Automotive Products can be made for any wheel design. With few components and easy to assemble, it should save costs. The switch will enable more controls, such as radio and light switches, to be fitted in the steering wheel, allowing the driver to keep both hands on the wheel while using them.

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> WATER LAW GOES INTO EFFECT TODAY  </P> <P> Does a drippy faucet keep you up at night? Does your broken sprinkler head  create a front-yard geyser?  </P> <P> Now is the time to take care of those troublesome, water-wasting problems  because the city's tough new water conservation ordinance goes into effect  today.  </P> <P> The water-rationing law, adopted after a severe water shortage caused  near-panic in the community last summer, is considered the strictest in the  county and contains fines and a provision to shut off water use to chronic  wasters.  </P> <P> But as the hot summer months proceed, city officials hope that residents and  business owners will take the spirit of the law to heart, altering lifestyles  to save millions of gallons of drinking water.  </P> <P> Most of the changes simply involve leaky spigots, resetting automatic sprinkler  systems or buying a $2 hose nozzle with a spring-loaded shut-off valve.  </P> <P> "The intent of the ordinance is really to sensitize or help people be aware of  the need to conserve water," utilities manager Greg Morehead said. "Our goal is  to work in a partnership with people to promote conservation."  </P> <P> In fact, the city has hired Lois Curtis to spot the thousands of everyday  problems that translate into water waste and to consult with residents who are  interested in correcting them.  </P> <P> Her job, as the city's "water cop," is also to cite water wasters who  repeatedly defy the new law.  </P> <P> "I hope we don't have to give any (citations) out," Curtis said this week as  she patrolled the city looking for telltale signs of wasted water. "That's not  my purpose."  </P> <P> But as the "Water Conservation Period" of the ordinance begins, residents and  business owners will face a set of new restrictions, including when they can  water their lawns. The water conservation period lasts from today to Sept. 15,  when the weather is expected to cool again.  </P> <P> The ordinance, the only mandatory one in the county, is designed to prevent a  repeat of last summer's water shortage. At that time, the Palisades Reservoir  dipped from 44 million gallons to half that amount.  </P> <P> Unlike water conservation policies and laws in other Orange County cities, the  San Clemente law includes fines for violations.  </P> <P> During the water conservation period, households with even-numbered addresses  will be allowed to water lawns only on even-numbered days, and households with  odd-numbered addresses on odd-numbered days. Violators face fines of $100.  </P> <P> Additionally, 400 businesses, neighborhood associations and others hooked to a  city-owned irrigation meter can be fined $500 for using more than 623 gallons  of irrigation water per week if they fail to notify the city of the total  square footage they are irrigating, according to the ordinance.  </P> <P> For a second offense, water service could be cut off after a city hearing.  </P> <P> Residents who use more than 650 gallons of water a day will face a surcharge on  their bimonthly water bill.  </P> <P> If the reservoir water level dips to 35 million gallons or below, another  restriction will go into effect: Spraying sidewalks and exterior structures and  washing cars, trucks and boats with hoses not equipped with an automatic  shut-off nozzle will be prohibited. Commercial carwashes will be exempt.  </P> <P> In addition, residents will be prohibited from filling or emptying swimming  pools.  </P> <P> If the reservoir dips below 30 million gallons, further restrictions will be  considered, according to the ordinance.  </P> <P> Curtis said she has received about 30 calls a day in the past week from  residents alerting her to water waste and asking her questions about how to  conserve.  </P> <P> "Most of them are pretty good," Curtis said. "They really are interested in  conserving water."  </P> <P> The city also is giving away water conservation kits, which includes two  displacement bags for conserving toilet water, four flow restricters for  faucets or shower heads, dye tablets to detect any toilet leaks and a booklet  of water-saving tips, Curtis said.  </P> <P> "People are really aware," she said. "They are ready to participate." JAMES M.  GOMEZ  </P></p>

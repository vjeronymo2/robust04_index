			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Salinas may stand as world trade chief President Carlos Salinas of Mexico is considering competing to be head of the World Trade Organisation, which is to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. A spokesman for Mr Salinas said yesterday: 'The foreign ministry has recognised the pronouncements in favour of President Salinas, and is exploring to see whether there is a consensus for his candidacy. This does not imply a decision has been taken.' The Mexican government is understood to have taken soundings at senior level in the US State Department and the office of President Bill Clinton's trade representative about how Washington would respond if Mr Salinas stood. If he did, he would be the most heavyweight political figure yet to enter the contest. The two declared candidates so far are Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister, and Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister. However, Mr Salinas' entry might divide political opinion in Latin America and upset the Brazilian government. President Salinas is obliged to stand down as Mexican president at the end of his six-year term in December, when he would be free to assume the WTO post. However, for domestic political reasons, he cannot be seen to campaign too openly for the job before the presidential election in late August. The decision on the WTO leadership is expected to be taken in late autumn, after consultation among Gatt's members. As leader of an important emerging economy, who has strongly espoused liberalisation and reform, Mr Salinas would be likely to exercise wide appeal. Although Gatt has been headed until now by Europeans, most of its members are developing countries which would like the WTO to be headed by one of their own. Mr Salinas' interest in the WTO post also seems likely to be viewed sympathetically by the Clinton administration. However, support from Washington might prove a mixed blessing. There has long been speculation that Mr Salinas, who is 46, would seek a senior international post after leaving the presidency. He also appeared to attract some support from Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's finance minister. In practice, however, the Spanish government is likely to go along with the choice of other European Union governments, since it wants their support for the candidacy of Mr Enrique Baron, former speaker of the European Parliament, as secretary-general of the European Union. At present, Mr Ruggiero is clear favourite as the EU candidate for the WTO post.</p>

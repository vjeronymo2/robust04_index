			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thierry Lucas: "A Technological Bound in </F> Malfunction Analysis"; L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction is "A new,  more powerful program to better pinpoint the combined causes of  breakdowns"]    [Text] What do an automobile, an airplane, a chemical  factory, and a satellite have in common? The answer: All of them  are complex, multicomponent systems whose reliability engineers  must be able to gauge from the moment of their design. To carry  out these calculations, manufacturers have been using  "malfunction tree" analysis software for many years. Now, a  wholly new technique developed by Bull researchers makes it  possible to boost the complexity of systems analyzed in this way  by a factor of 100 or 1,000! The new technology has been  incorporated into Metaprime, a malfunction-tree-analysis  software program marketed by Simulog. Metaprime is offered on  Unix stations, in conjunction with the program Open Modline,  which supplies the graphics tools for modeling and interpreting  the results.    The method's basic analytical principle has not changed:  Starting with their knowledge of the system's architecture (a  car is composed of an engine, a gearbox, steering, etc.),  engineers systematically deduce all the combinations of causes  that could trigger a breakdown. The major undesirable event  (plane crash, environmental accident in a chemical plant, and so  on) can be broken down in this way into basic events such as the  failure of an electrical circuit, the malfunctioning of a valve,  etc. The various elements are represented in a tree graph that  shows the link between each malfunction and its causes and  consequences. "Qualitative analysis of the malfunction tree can  already identify the combination of causes that suffice to  create a failure," explains Duc Duong, Simulog's technical  director. "But to go farther, engineers must assign a  probability value to each basic event and calculate the system's  resultant overall reliability. Metaprime is especially good at  this quantitative analysis of malfunction trees." Indeed, once a  tree has grown to several hundred "branches", the systematic  calculation of probabilities quickly eats up prohibitive amounts  of computer processing time. What makes Bull's method, which  employs a complete set of new algorithms, superior is its  ability to manipulate data in a comprehensive way, without  causing an explosion in combinations. As a result, engineers  will be able to rigorously analyze the reliability of the most  complex systems, without resorting to always-tricky  approximations.</p>

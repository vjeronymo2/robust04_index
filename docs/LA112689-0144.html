			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10% OF E. GERMAN COMMUNISTS QUIT PARTY  </P> <P> A surprising 10% of East Germany's 2.3 million Communist Party members have  quit the party in the past two months, the official party daily Neues  Deutschland reported Saturday.  </P> <P> Since the exodus of East Germans began over the past few months, the  beleaguered Communist Party has been wrenched by a shake-up of the leadership,  and charges of corruption and misrule are now being leveled against such people  as former party chief Erich Honecker. The party newspaper quoted Central  Committee member Heinz Mirtschin as telling an East Berlin meeting, "Since the  end of September, 200,000 members have left the SED (Communist Party)."  </P> <P> Mirtschin said that 70% of those who had quit the party were workers -- the  core of its strength.  </P> <P> Neues Deutschland said the report of the party's diminishing numbers came as no  surprise and warned the membership that such erosion could be deepened by  public hearings on corruption charges.  </P> <P> Politburo member Werner Eberlein told the paper that all German leaders guilty  of abusing power will face punishment. Eberlein, who is investigating  corruption, suggested that many former top officials will be accused of  misusing their power and enriching themselves.  </P> <P> Roland Woetzel, a party official in Leipzig, said the party needs "a new  program, new charter -- and maybe even a new name."  </P></p>

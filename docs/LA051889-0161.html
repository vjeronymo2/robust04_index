			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES AGAINST 3 IN BABY DEATH DROPPED  </P> <P> A South Bay Municipal Court judge on Wednesday dismissed criminal child  endangerment charges against a husband, wife and teen-age daughter who  allegedly operated a Lomita day-care home where a 16-month-old girl strangled  to death last year.  </P> <P> Judge Thomas P. Allen Jr. ruled there was insufficient evidence to try Robert  and Linda Zieger and their daughter, Laura, in connection with the death of  Michele Heasley.  </P> <P> Allen did order, however, that Linda Zieger, 47, and Laura Zieger, 19, stand  trial June 19 on a lesser charge that they did not have a state license to  operate a day-care business at their home.  </P> <P> The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum six-month jail sentence, compared to a  six-year prison for felony child endangerment charges.  </P> <P> Allen said he was "deeply, deeply bothered" by the case, but felt the district  attorney's office had not proved gross negligence, the standard required for a  felony conviction.  </P> <P> Michele died last November after being found unconscious in a crib where she  had been left napping.  </P></p>

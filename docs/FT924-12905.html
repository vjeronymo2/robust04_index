			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (3): Slim-down speeds up - IRI, now a joint stock company, looks under-capitalised NUMBERS, when spelled out in Italian, can produce words of extraordinary length. In the new statutes of IRI, the state holding which became a joint stock company in August, you need 83 characters to spell out the registered capital - nearly one and half lines of text. But when it comes to figures the L1,873bn capital looks less impressive for a company whose holdings make up for nearly 5 per cent of Italy's GDP. If it is to remain the holding company for the largest conglomeration of industrial and financial interests in the EC, IRI is under-capitalised. Before its change of status, the annual turnover of IRI companies was almost L80,000bn; debts stoods at L61,000bn and some L71,000bn was planned in investments over the next three years. However, the entire Italian public sector is now under review, and IRI's basic role as the prime promoter and financier of industrial development, since it was first formed in 1933 under Mussolini, is set for a thorough transformation. At one extreme, IRI could simply have the function of managing the sell-off and break up of its portfolio of holdings, so that eventually it would wind itself up. At the other end of the scale, IRI could become a slimmed-down industrial operator with a rationalised portfolio still controlled by the state. Here, future funding would have to come from borrowing in the market, sell-offs and stock market floatation, with consequently greater private sector involvement. Already the change to a joint stock company, with the Treasury as sole shareholder, has removed IRI from the direct control of the political parties. IRI was traditionally beholden to the parties in government and always dominated by the Christian Democrats. This control was exercised directly through the appointment of the holding's president and an advisory board of political appointees. The latter was eliminated in August and, although the Andreotti government's appointee as president, Mr Franco Nobili, remains, he is unlikely to stay beyond November, when proposals on IRI's role are scheduled to be completed. In the meantime IRI is being run by a small team headed by Mr Michele Tedeschi, the 52 year-old managing director who has spent his entire career as a manager in the state sector. Since 1980 he has been with the IRI management and from 1989 he has been chief executive with specific responsibility for coordinating the holding's strategy. He has also been involved in two of the most important areas of IRI operations: Finmeccanica, the holding which coordinates engineering activity and high technology, and STET, the telecommunications holding, which accounts for more than a quarter of IRI's sales. Mr Tedeschi was responsible for IRI's strategic plan, released in May. The philosophy behind this was an acceleration of the slimming process, in evidence over the past decade, in which some 100,000 jobs have been shed - over a fifth of the workforce. IRI would have sold off by 1995 assets worth L11,000bn. But these would have been mainly minority interests, although full sell-offs were mot excluded to rationalise the state presence in specific sectors. Earlier this year IRI sold its cement interests in Cementir, which controlled 10 per cent of the Italian cement market. Also as part of the strategic plan, IRI's steel subsidiary, Ilva, reduced its involvement in long products by forming a 40/60 venture with Lucchini, the private steel group. IRI management would feel most comfortable following this strategic plan, becoming in the process an industrial operator. This would also entail consolidation of the group's involvement in high technology areas and the extension of international alliances such as Finmeccanica's 45 per cent stake in France SGS Thomson. Finmeccanica itself is scheduled to float its shares later this year, making it less directly dependent upon IRI. A critical issue to be addressed will be the future shape of Finmeccanica. If IRI is really set to slim down, or even disappear, Finmeccanica could well form the core of a mixed state-private engineering group or, alternatively, form the basis of a more coherent state presence in engineering and high technology. Finmeccanica had already begun an attempt at rationalising the state presence in the engineering sector through an agreement in principle with some of the complementary interests of Efim, the loss-making industrial state holding. Efim was placed in liquidation in July, overtaking this outline agreement. Finmeccanica - in the short term at least - may be obliged to take on some Efim assets. But this in turn could affect Finmeccanica's floatation. All this merely emphasises the opportunity now available for a thorough rationalisation of what had become an ungainly hybrid organisation. The old holding acted as the umbrella organisation, financier and strategic planner for an enormous variety of industrial activities, from aerospace, civil engineering, and electronics, to foodstuffs, information technology, ship-building, steel and transportation, through to financial services, banking and control of state television. These different sectors lacked integration and made little use of synergies. Subservience of IRI to the politicians has dictated the irrational accumulation of holdings and loss-making activities in recent years. This was especially so in the case of investments in the south, which have latterly been absorbing a third of all investments. Political linkage was reinforced by the nature of IRI's funding. It had no capital; it had a small endowment fund - until 1984 it simply received cash handouts from the government. Since 1990, as the government cut back on transfers, IRI had been increasingly obliged to seek ways of raising its own cash and permitting more of its subsidiaries to seek external funding in the market - although this practice could only apply to profitable operations such as STET. Thus IRI's identity was split between politically motivated investment/financial operations and those determined by the market. This played havoc with the accounts, with 'cash cows' such as the autostrada operations and telecommunications on one side, and loss-makers such as Fincantieri (shipping) and Iritecna (civil engineering) on the other. IRI will receive a welcome cash injection from last month's government decision to permit the sale of the holding's 67 per cent stake in Credito Italiano, the country's sixth largest commercial bank. But the search for cash will not end here. This month IRI announced the controversial sale of its stake in Finsiel, its software holding, to STET for L700bn. The move provoked an outcry from the stock market, which saw the operation as a crude means of raising cash with STET paying an excessive price for an asset it did not need. IRI claimed there was industrial logic behind the deal: telecommunications groups needed to forge alliances in the expanding services sector. Despite the polemics, the Finsiel deal underlined that the determining element in IRI's future will be its own financial health. The burden of debt is high. The state is pledged to guarantee existing IRI obligations. The market is unlikely to view kindly any further accumulation without a clear strategy of sell-offs.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Tory anger at Portillo attack on foreign corruption Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday embroiled the government in another embarrassing row after launching an attack on corruption in foreign countries. Speaking in Southampton, Mr Portillo contrasted the integrity and honesty of public life in Britain with corruption and dishonesty overseas. He quickly backed away from his remarks with an apology, saying he had made a mistake in 'grossly exaggerating' the level of corruption in foreign countries. He said his comments to students were designed to rebut the allegation that Britain was descending into sleaze. However, his remarks infuriated some Conservative backbenchers who questioned the chief secretary's judgment in making a controversial speech a day after the prime minister had called for party unity. Robert Hicks, a pro-European, said: 'This is ridiculous. I wonder if he lives in the real world. Where is the evidence in our community partners that such practises exist.' A senior Tory MP said Mr Portillo's remarks were 'a severe embarrassment to the government'. In his comments to students, the chief secretary said: 'If any of you have got an A level it is because you have worked at it; go to any other country and when you have got an A level you have bought it.' He went on to say: 'When you go into business you will win contracts because you are good at what you do. Go to a number of other countries and you would win contracts because your cousin was a minister or because you have lined the pocket of some public official.' His comments follow his recent speech lauding British institutions. Downing Streetthen blocked a speech which would have emphasised the chief secretary's Euro-sceptic credentials. A spokesman at the German Embassy said: 'There is no question that our students cheat. It is ridiculous to make such a comment.' A Japanese Embassy spokesman said: 'We certainly do not buy our qualifications.' Labour attacks Tory 'sleaze', Page 5</p>

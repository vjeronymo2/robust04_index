			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: FIRING ADVICE RIGHT BACK AT MAGAZINES  </P> <P> As a working mother for the last 30 years, I still stop dead in my tracks when  I read a headline, "How did Wanda Ferragamo do it? Build a $46-million shoe  empire while bringing up six kids?" With all my heart I want to believe that  Wanda had some magic timetable for balancing home and career, but the harsh  reality is, she was probably heavily sedated.  </P> <P> Mothers who work outside of the home are probably the most misunderstood women  in the world. All you have to do is to leaf through the rash of magazines  designed to target their problems.  </P> <P> Do I really need to know it is time to move away from big boards and start  trading over the counter? Am I motivated to share with my family the new  recipes of the great chefs in executive dining rooms? Do I need help addressing  the problem of becoming a fitnessaholic?  </P> <P> Magazines that target baby boomers with careers act as if they've just  discovered fire. The mothers who work today are no different than the mothers  who worked 30 years ago. There are just more of them, and the terminology is a  little different.  </P> <P> I bonded when it meant ironing on a hem instead of using a needle and thread.  Today it refers to children. Same guilt. In my day, stress was simply called  kids. Is that all there is? translates to I want it all. Quality time to me  meant hiding out in a bathroom that locked.  </P> <P> I don't need to know if Wanda breaks out in hives when she reads about a great  exercise mat for $35. I don't care if she tapes on her mirror 35 ways to tie a  scarf and not make it look like a tourniquet.  </P> <P> What I really need to know is what do you do when you're late for work, your  preschooler throws up, your baby-sitter has the flu and your mother has an  unlisted number?  </P> <P> How do you keep it together when your child calls for the eighth time during  dictation from the boss to announce his brother is bleeding again on the sofa  that is not Scotchgarded?  </P> <P> How do you cope when someone fed the last piece of bologna to the dog and the  last piece of bread to the goldfish on a Sunday night when there are three  lunches to pack?  </P> <P> How do you put on damp panty hose and still walk with your knees together?  </P> <P> How do you explain that on your resume under religion, you listed guilt?  </P> <P> How do you get through to editors of these magazines that if you had time to  read, you wouldn't need the advice in the first place?  </P></p>

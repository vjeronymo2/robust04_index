			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOUSE OKS ANTITRUST EXEMPTION FOR TV TO HELP CURB VIOLENCE  </P> <P> The House today voted to give an antitrust exemption to the TV industry so it  can try to adopt voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing violent programming.  </P> <P> The 399-18 vote sent the measure to the Senate, which passed a similar bill May  31.  </P> <P> The bill would give television networks, local stations, producers and the  cable TV industry a three-year antitrust exemption to work up guidelines for  depicting non-news violence on television.  </P> <P> At present, such discussions would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, which  caused the demise of previous industry self-regulation under the Television  Code of the National Assn. of Broadcasters.  </P> <P> The Senate version of the bill was approved with an amendment by Sen. Jesse  Helms (R-N.C.) that would also allow the TV industry to discuss ways to curb  scenes that glorify drug use and portray sexually explicit material.  </P></p>

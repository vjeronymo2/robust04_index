			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186): "Rights </F> and Interests Are Not Costs--Report on the Question of  Labor-Capital Relations in Foreign-Funded Enterprises"]    [Text] Thoughts on 61 Young People    In December last year, following the extraordinarily large  fire on 19 November in Shenzhen, another major fire broke out at  the Gaofu Company in Mawei, Fuzhou, in which 61 teenage girl  workers were burned to death. The arsonist, surnamed Dong, who  had been dismissed by the company for theft, pleaded guilty and  was executed. However, more and more people are beginning to  wonder: Why did the arsonist take such an extreme action of  revenge? Why did so many innocent people lose their lives when  the accident occurred?    A person in charge of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions pointed out penetratingly: The fires in Mawei and  Shenzhen have fully exposed some problems in the labor-capital  relations of foreign-invested enterprises, such as the  intensification of labor-capital contradictions, the indifferent  attitude toward production safety, and so on. These problems  are attracting extensive attention from various circles of  society.    Labor-capital relations are also called labor relations.  They refer to the various kinds of relations between the  possessors and users of labor, which involve the interests of  the laborers, such as working conditions, wages and other  remuneration, labor insurance, and so on. It cannot be denied  that foreign-invested enterprises have provided more jobs and  have established a new mode of labor relations for us. On the  whole, most foreign-invested enterprises can operate according  to the law, and their labor-capital relations are relatively  stable. However, recent surveys show that there really are  problems in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of  staff members and workers in some foreign-invested enterprises.  This is even more conspicuous in some medium and small-labor  intensive enterprises invested by ROK, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and  Japanese businessmen. The problems are manifested in:    --The system of using laborers. Some foreign-invested  enterprises privately and indiscriminately recruit laborers  (including child laborers), dismiss them at will, do not sign  contracts with staff members or workers, and replace contracts  with "factory rules" of a domestic disciplinary nature, so that  the employment of the staff members and workers is not  guaranteed. Even if contracts are signed, the contracts are not  standardized. They contain only "responsibilities" and do not  contain "rights and interests," or they contain inappropriate  clauses which are imposed on workers. In Shantou, Zhuhai, and  Fuzhou, more than 70 percent of foreign-invested enterprises  have not signed contracts with workers. The Chinese and English  versions of the contract of a certain major restaurant in  Shanghai are entirely different, so that the restaurant can use  the contract "to deal with" the staff members and workers at any  time.    --Wages and other remuneration. It is only right that the  income of staff members and workers of foreign-invested  enterprises should be higher, but, in reality, this is not true  of all such enterprises. According to a survey on 75  foreign-invested enterprises in three special economic zones in  Guangdong, the number of enterprises whose minimum wages for  workers are below the minimum wage standard set by local  governments is 41, accounting for 55 percent of the total. The  minimum wages of 17 of these enterprises are below 200 yuan, and  the lowest are only 140 yuan. Some enterprises have illegally  lowered, reduced, delayed the payment of, or absorbing the  remuneration for the workers' labor. They, for example, have  made it a rule that two days' wages should be reduced for making  a mistake in punching time cards and one day's wages should be  reduced for going to the toilet without a permit, and so on. A  Macao contractor of the Zhuhai Huahui Toy Plant fled outside the  border after embezzling and absorbing workers' wages amounting  to 1.4 million yuan. In 1992 alone, foreign-invested  enterprises in Shenzhen delayed the payment of workers' wages  amounting to more than 3.2 million yuan.    --Labor time. A considerable number of foreign-invested  enterprises have asked workers to work extra shifts or extra  hours. These workers universally work 10-12 hour days, and they  seldom have days off. Their overtime pay is very little,  usually 0.5-1.0 yuan an hour. In several foreign-invested  enterprises in Guangdong, the workers have had no holidays for  11 months running, and the workers sometimes work as long as 36  hours at a stretch. Some foreign businessmen have purposely set  very high quotas for the workers and have set very low payment  for each piece of a product. As a result, the workers are  compelled to work long hours -- some have fainted at their  machine tools because they could not cope with the excessive  workload. Some foreign-invested enterprises simply ignore the  new work hour system which was promulgated not long ago.    --Labor protection. Some foreign businessmen have  increased labor intensity, shifted high-pollution and obsolete  industries to the mainland, and ignored safety and sanitation.  Consequently, the labor conditions are very poor, and incidents  leading to injuries and deaths often occur. In a 400-worker  company solely owned by a foreign businessman in Xiamen, 40  workers have had their fingers squashed in four years since the  company was established, because the machines of the company  have no protective devices. Many medium and small enterprises  do not have ventilation devices or toxic gas discharge devices.  Their working environment is dark and damp, and more and more  workers have suffered from occupational diseases. Some  enterprises (such as the Gaofu Company) have located their  workshops, storehouses, dormitories, and canteens all in one  place. Even passageways are full of goods, the gates of plants  are locked, and production is carried out in sealed-off areas.  In the event an accident occurs, the staff members and workers  cannot escape.    --Insurance and welfare. Some foreign-invested enterprises  have evaded their due responsibility for the social security of  staff members and workers. In some localities, the insurance  coverage of foreign-invested enterprises is very limited. Some  of these enterprises have refused to provide pensions, medical  insurance, and accident insurance for workers and have not duly  provided welfare services for workers. In particular, women  workers, who account more than half of the total number of  workers in foreign-invested enterprises, are seldom given  reasonable maternity leave, and some have even been dismissed  during their pregnancy or after giving birth to a child. A  Taiwanese businessman once said with a straight face: "Do you  not talk about `to each according to his work'? How can I pay  her if she wants to give birth to a child and does not work?"    --Personal rights. Some foreign-invested enterprises do not  respect staff members or workers. Their ways of management are  rough and brutal, and they even mete out corporal punishment to  workers, beat them, curse them, and insult them. Some  enterprises have established rules forbidding workers to drink  water or to go to the toilet during work hours. They even  illegally make body searches of workers.    Since the legitimate rights and interests of staff members  and workers have been repeatedly infringed upon, the number of  labor-capital conflicts and labor disputes have increased.  <H5>  Is This Simply a Management Issue? </H5>   The reason why these problems have emerged in the  labor-capital relations in foreign-invested enterprises is that,  on the one hand, the capital side of some enterprises have  concentrated on seeking higher profits, have made serious  mistakes in their short-term behavior, are not willing to make  necessary inputs in labor conditions, have ignored the relevant  laws and regulations, and have one-sidedly stressed "employment  relations," thus causing various hidden troubles and undesirable  effects. On the other hand, local governments have a biased  understanding of the investment environment, have paid much  attention to introducing foreign capital, equipment, and  technology while neglecting management, and have excessively  tolerated acts of infringement upon the rights and interests of  staff members and workers of the Chinese side, thus making it  difficult for the judicial departments to smoothly carry out  their work.    As a matter of fact, foreign-invested enterprises must abide  by local laws and regulations no matter which countries they are  located in. Only this conforms with international norms. The  crux of the issue is whether our legal system concerning labor  is sound.    Some comrades from the Ministry of Labor have said: China  has been implementing the reform and opening up policy for more  than a decade and has obtained remarkable results in introducing  capital, technology, and advanced management techniques.  However, the building of the legal system where work is  concerned has failed to meet the needs of the development of the  situation. The departments concerned have formulated and  promulgated a series of rules and regulations on labor  management involving foreigners, but most of them only have  administrative effects, not legal effects. Moreover, these  rules and regulations were drafted in the 1980's, and they  embody provisions which safeguard the rights and interests of  the investors more than those of the staff members and workers  of the Chinese side. In particular, since some great changes  have been made in the labor system of state-owned enterprises,  provisions on foreign-invested enterprises have evidently been  inappropriate. The fact that legislation has lagged behind has  led to a lax enforcement of the law. Some localities have  simply used rules and regulations only as a reference, and  foreign businessmen have made use of the loopholes.    Besides, the strength of trade unions in foreign-invested  enterprises is still quite weak. According to incomplete  statistics, by the end of last year, of the more than 80,000  foreign-invested enterprises which have been put into operation  or production, about 8,000 have set up trade unions, accounting  for only 10 percent of the total. Director Tian of the  Grass-roots Work Department of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions said that most of the foreign-invested enterprises where  labor-capital disputes occur do not have organized trade unions.  Some foreign businessmen have regarded trade unions as their  opposites and have stood in the way of the establishment of  trade unions. Some trade union cadres have been dismissed for  defending the rights and interests of staff members and workers,  and others are in an "underground" state. The workers from some  foreign-invested enterprises in Shenzhen and other cities have  spontaneously organized "associations of fellow townsmen" and  "federations of workers." However, whenever major labor  disputes occur, these non-trade union organizations often adopt  radical measures which exacerbate the labor-capital relations.    The sense of self-protection is also very weak among the  staff members and workers of foreign-invested enterprises. Most  of them come from rural areas, and their cultural quality is not  high. They are eager to make money and do not know how to  defend their own interests and dignity. A female worker was  slapped twice by her boss for no reason at all. The next day,  the boss gave her 50 yuan wrapped in red paper and the other  female workers watched with admiration. Several workers in  Shekou were compelled to work overtime in midsummer. They fell  ill and were dismissed at once, and each was given only 100 yuan  for working in the heat of summer. These workers shed grateful  tears. We cannot but feel "pity for their misfortune, and angry  at their lack of protest."  <H5>  What Should We Do? </H5>   In the course of making this report, we deeply feel that  harmonious and stable labor-capital relations are important  conditions for ensuring social stability and the healthy  development of investment made by foreign businessmen. Of  course, foreign businessmen should be allowed to make money, and  the legitimate rights and interests of laborers should also be  sufficiently guaranteed. We should not make use of foreign  capital at the expense of the rights and interests of staff  members and workers.    It has been learned that numerous foreign investors not only  have paid much attention to the rich labor resources in China,  but have also have paid greater attention to labor management in  foreign-invested enterprises and hope that labor management can  be put in the orbit of the legal system as quickly as possible.  It appears that strengthening labor management according to the  law in foreign-invested enterprises will not drive away the  "foreign gods of wealth" (only those who are eager for quick  success and instant benefit will be driven away), whereas  unprincipled accommodation will inevitably harm the interests of  the state and the rights and interests of the staff members and  workers and will eventually affect the improvement of the  investment environment.    According to comrades from the Ministry of Labor and the  All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the pressing task at  present is to speed up labor legislation. In view of the  characteristics of foreign-invested enterprises, it is advisable  to formulate the "Law on the Labor Management of Enterprises  With Investment Made by Foreign Businessmen" as quickly as  possible. Otherwise, work in this respect will be in a dilemma  in which there is no law to go by and no rule or regulation to  follow. There should be a clear and unified definition for  minimum wages, a labor contract, labor protection, social  security, basic rights and interests of workers, and so on, and  there should be a sound monitoring mechanism. We should  strengthen the functions of trade unions and urge  foreign-invested enterprises to set up trade unions so that  trade unions can truly become bridges between the labor side and  the capital side. Besides, we can also use as reference the  experience of the Beijing Jeep Company Limited and institute the  system of holding collective talks (reaching agreements) so that  labor-capital relations can be normalized and standardized.    Local governments should also combine the work of attracting  foreign capital with labor management and in examining and  approving contracts or projects. They should include in these  contracts or projects sections on the legitimate rights and  interests of staff members and workers of the Chinese side.  Since the number of foreign-invested enterprises is increasing  in various localities and their scales are expanding, they  should also further ensure that safety and sanitation monitoring  work is carried out in order to avoid the recurrence of  tragedies like the fire in Mawei. They should spread publicity  and education on the legal system, enable foreign businessmen to  understand the relevant Chinese policies and laws on labor, help  staff members and workers strengthen the sense of  self-protection, draw lessons from the crimes of the woman  worker surnamed Dong of the Gaofu Company, and establish a sense  of the legal system.    Some people predict that, with the gradual deepening of  reform, the gap between the income of workers of state-owned  enterprises and that of workers of foreign-invested enterprises  will narrow day by day. This will play the role of checking and  balancing labor management throughout society.</p>

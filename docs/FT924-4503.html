			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Regulator accuses British Gas over sale to generators SIR JAMES MCKINNON, the gas industry regulator, yesterday accused British Gas of selling large quantities of gas to power generators at below the cost of new supplies, so precipitating the 'Dash for Gas'. In strongly-worded evidence Sir James told the trade and industry committee that British Gas underestimated the likely demand from power generators in 1990. In its keenness to win a share of the power market British Gas set the first of its two pricing schedules for generators too low. While the average cost of North Sea gas delivered to the shore to British Gas in 1990-91 was 18.2p per therm, the company set its first schedule for generators at 16.1p per therm. Compared with the later, 'more market-orientated' price schedule of 19.6p, Sir James said, it could be argued that the initial price represented an 'opportunity cost to the company of 3.5p per therm'. 'On the 1bn therms sold at 16.1p per therm over 15-year contract lives this represents a cost to British Gas of some Pounds 525m,' he said. 'British Gas set a price . . . which was lower than the delivered cost of new gas supplies and hence considerably lower than appropriate to balance supply and demand . . . The pricing policy of British Gas thus created demand for gas for electricity generation that might not otherwise have been economically justified.' British Gas told the committee last month Sir James had forced it to supply four more power generating projects than it wanted to, by compelling it to lower its second price schedule, which it had set artificially high to try to choke off excess demand from generators. Sir James said Ofgas had merely fulfilled its legal obligations, following guidelines issued by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after its investigation into the industrial gas market in 1988. 'It was British Gas that decided to enter the power generation market, and set the price at incorrectly low levels. Ofgas, as regulator, simply ensured that British Gas then treated all customers the same despite its attempt to revert to the discriminatory policies it practised before 1988.' British Gas said last night it had not had time to study Sir James's evidence and could not comment. It suggested that his comments demonstrated the lack of understanding between British Gas and the regulator and justified the decision last August to refer the UK gas market to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation.</p>

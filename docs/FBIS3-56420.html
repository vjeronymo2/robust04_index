The Goals of the Prime  Minister and Those of the President Diverge Again"]    [Text] After Boris Yeltsin appointed Anatoliy Chubays  deputy prime minister, bypassing a lengthy process of forming a  government, the question of differences between the prime  minister and the president has taken on a new intensity. Did  the prime minister know about Anatoliy Chubays' appointment? If  not, then the war of position inside the executive branch is  becoming clearly threatening in nature: The president is  betting everything, and this suggests that the old cabinet's  volatile balance will remain in the new one. Apparently, soon we  should expect Boris Fedorov's appointment. This, in turn, will  mean the reemergence of characteristics of the old confrontation  -- the Finance Ministry against the Central Bank and the  government against the parliament ("Russia's Choice" will not be  able to take the budget commission under control).    The only thing one can state with assurance so far is that  the prime minister's line toward forming a manageable and  effective government will depend on his consultations with the  president that are to follow Anatoliy Chubays' appointment and  will be under way until Monday. The goals of the president and  those of the prime minister have somewhat diverged.  Chernomyrdin needs hard-working, not politicized, executives.  Yeltsin, apparently, needs a steady reform course.    Boris Fedorov's fate will be a decisive indicator at this  stage.</p>

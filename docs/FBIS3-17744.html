I was  told at the Central Electoral Commission that 1,873,805 people  -- 58.83 percent of those included on the lists -- participated  in the voting. According to preliminary data, candidates for the  "Russia" bloc are leading in single-seat districts. The bloc's  nominee, incidentally, is Yuriy Meshkov, Crimea's current  president. Representatives of the Crimean Communist Party are in  second place.    Regarding the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Council,  also announced for 27 March, it is too soon to speak even of  their preliminary results. As of 1600 on that day, voting  papers had been issued to 52 percent of Crimea's citizens. This  certainly does not mean, however, that they all ended up inside  the ballot boxes: On the eve of the elections many Crimean  parties and movements were actively encouraging their supporters  to obtain voting papers but not to take them away rather than  casting them.    On Yuriy Meshkov's initiative a poll of Crimeans on their  attitude toward a treaty basis in relations between the Republic  of Crimea and Ukraine, dual citizenship, and imparting the force  of law to a number of Crimean presidential edicts was held  simultaneously with the parliamentary elections. As is known,  the idea of such a poll elicited a highly negative reaction from  the Kiev authorities, being deemed by them to run counter to the  Ukrainian Constitution. Therefore, the Crimean Central Electoral  Commission was not involved in organizing the poll. Nor is it  involved in counting the votes -- presidential power structures  have taken on the fulfillment of this task. I have learned that  the majority of those who came to vote replied in the  affirmative to the questions put to them, thereby voicing  confidence in the president's program for extricating the  Republic from the crisis.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Morse warns on bank bad debts SIR Jeremy Morse, Lloyds Bank chairman, warned yesterday that UK banks' bad debts were unlikely to fall in 1992. He was disclosing that his bank had made a record charge of Pounds 885m to cover the risk of losses on its loans to UK companies and individuals. 'Banks' bad debts are at their worst since the 1930s,' he said. 'My prediction is that bad debts in 1992 will be about level with 1991.' Lloyds still made pre-tax profits of Pounds 645m in 1991, up 9 per cent on the previous year and higher than City analysts expected. Faced with difficult economic conditions the bank has cut costs. It reduced staff by 8,500 last year and Mr Brian Pitman, the chief executive, said there would be '2,000 or 3,000 job losses this year'. Lloyds was the first English clearing bank to disclose its 1991 results. Analysts expect it will be the most profitable, even though it is far smaller than National Westminster Bank and Barclays. In 1991, the four clearers are thought to have suffered bad debt charges of about Pounds 4.5bn in aggregate. Lloyds' total bad debt charge was Pounds 918m, up from Pounds 778m in 1990. Sir Jeremy said there had been a trend of falling losses on loans to big companies, but losses on exposure to smaller businesses had been increasing. More recently a rising proportion of loans to personal customers had been going bad. The trend has been obscured by the collapse of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire. Lloyds made provisions against its Maxwell exposure of at least Pounds 80m, according to analysts. Sir Jeremy warned that even when an economic recovery came - and he stressed there was no sign of one yet - bad debts would continue to rise. The profits race, Page 10 London stocks, Page 15</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / People: Oxford picks from its own Clark Brundin, vice-chancellor of Warwick University, has been appointed to head Oxford University's new school of management studies - which promises to be a bright addition to management education in Britain when it admits its first batch of MBA students in 1994. The post goes with the presidency of Templeton College, the university's existing management institute where the new school will be built. After headhunting for more than a year, Oxford has, as ever, resorted to one of its own. Brundin trained as an engineer in the United States, but most of his academic life has been spent as a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. An assiduous committee man, he ended up as chairman of the university's Board of Faculties before decamping to Warwick in 1985. Until recently he was also chairman of Anchor Housing, England's largest charitable provider of sheltered accommodation for the elderly. Brundin has a demanding job ahead. Templeton needs some Pounds 40m to get its management school off the ground. As yet it has only Pounds 5m - a sizeable chunk of it from Peter Moores, son of the pools supremo, after whom the directorship of the school is named. ***** David Kaye, a retired partner of Andersen Consulting, has been appointed Dean of the City University Business School in London. ***** Alan Brew has been promoted to be executive director of Landor Associates, the international design consultants, and based at Landor's headquarters in San Francisco. A former Financial Times journalist, Brew joined Landor from the FT in 1985 as marketing director of the newly-opened London office. Peter Farnell-Watson is to become managing director in the UK.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rockwell to take over Swiss controls company SPRECHER &amp; Schuh Holding, the Swiss electrical engineering group, is selling its low voltage electro-mechanical controls company and the Sprecher &amp; Schuh name and trademark to Rockwell International of the US. Terms of the transaction were not revealed, but Mr Hans von Werra, managing director of the Swiss company, said it was a cash deal. The business accounted for roughly half of the group's turnover and profit. Turnover in 1991 was SFr494.9m (Dollars 323m). Mr von Werra said the business, which is active mainly in European markets, was not large enough to succeed in the future on its own. Attempts to make an acquisition had failed so the group decided to sell it. It will become part of Rockwell's Allen-Bradley controls division. Mr Don Davis, president of Allen-Bradley, said the acquisition would strengthen the US group's global market position. The S &amp; S low-voltage control business, with factories in Switzerland, Italy, the UK and South Africa, will continue under its current management. Mr Davis foresaw joint development of new products by it and Allen-Bradley. Mr von Werra said that a condition of the deal was that S &amp; S would change its name by the end of 1994. The proceeds would go into industrial investments.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Dividends on scrip I have taken cash for the immediate sale of enhanced scrip dividends but am not clear as to the basis of assessment for capital gains tax. I have read comments that enhanced scrip dividends are to be treated as full-paid rights issues and pooled. If they have been sold immediately, however, will a sale come under the provisions of the 10-day in-and-out rule? Yes, UK scrip dividends are treated in much the same way as rights issues. No, the 10-day rule does not apply (it applies only 'if, within a period of 10 days, a number of securities are acquired and subsequently a number of securities are disposed of.' Section 127 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says that a scrip dividend 'shall not be treated as involving . . . any acquisition of the new holding or any part of it'). The fact that the market value of scrip cannot be determined until after it has been sold does not matter - any more than the fact that the indexation relief due on a profit-making sale cannot be calculated until the middle of the following month, when the relevant RPI is published by the Central Office of Information. CGT is calculated according to arbitrary rules laid down by MPs, with scant regard for logic or equity. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13 (the indexation allowance for quoted shares). You could also write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB for a free copy of Budget press release IR28 (Capital gains: indexation allowance and capital losses). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

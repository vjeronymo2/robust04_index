			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Winterflood to trade gilts Winterflood Securities, the smaller companies marketmaker owned by Close Brothers, plans to move into trading UK government bonds this August. The company has already started hiring gilt traders and is hoping to obtain permission from the Bank of England to join the ranks of gilt-edged market makers (Gemms). Mr Brian Winterflood, chairman of Winterflood Securities, said the intention was to specialise in private client business and 'smaller deals'. At present, only a handful of the Gemms carry out small deals for private investors, and many gilt market participants claim the business is uneconomical. 'It doesn't pay them to do these small bargains: some Gemms quote (prices) to miss, but we'll be quoting to deal,' claimed Mr Winterflood yesterday. Mr Adrian Ireland, formerly at SG Warburg Securities, has become head of trading.</p>

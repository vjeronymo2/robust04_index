			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Exchange reverses move on trade rules THE BOARD of the London Stock Exchange yesterday approved in principle a relaxation of its rules on publication of trades, heralding a reduction in the level of transparency in the stock market. The decision - part of a three-year plan to overhaul the exchange's markets  -marks a reversal of the move a year ago to increase transparency by forcing details of all trades to be published within 90 minutes. Marketmakers - whose willingness to quote firm prices at which they will buy or sell stocks lies at the heart of the market - had complained that the 90-minute rule exposed them to loss. The exchange also agreed to increase trade publication in its international share market, which has thrived on a lack of disclosure of trade details. Large trades in both the domestic and the international markets will not be published, but an hourly indication of trading volumes will be disclosed, along with next-day prices to show at what levels stocks were traded. The changes are expected to take effect later this year. They are part of a move to bring together the UK and the international share markets in London to create a single European market. Details of the changes will not be adopted officially until April. The board also approved a trial of a method of trading shares in smaller companies, to be handled by 'matching principals', brokers with a monopoly in the shares of a particular company.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: UK Euro-sceptics step up referendum calls MR John Major's firm rejection of a British referendum on the Maastricht treaty failed to deter Euro-sceptic Tory MPs yesterday from stepping up their campaign to make him change his mind. Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend east and secretary of the Conservative European Reform Group, said he was asking the prime minister to meet a delegation of MPs to discuss a UK referendum, in the light of a public opinion poll showing two-thirds in favour of one. Not to grant a referendum would, he said, be a 'denial of democracy' and having one would be a way of relieving tensions with the Tory party. There are signs that some Tory dissidents who originally opposed the idea of a referendum on constitutional grounds have now become reconciled to it, and that if the demand for one became the main thrust of the Euro-sceptic campaign, it would not cause it to splinter, as it would once have done. Mr Bill Cash, another Tory MP, said it was a 'disgrace' that there had been no British referendum, and that the treaty should be renegotiated whatever the result of the French vote. Mr Michael Spicer, the Tory MP who organised the House of Commons motion calling for a 'fresh start' on Europe, called for renegotiation of the treaty of Rome, to remove the European Commission's law-making capacity. And he warned that given yesterday's newspaper poll showing that three-quarters of the public would not vote for closer ties with Europe, it was 'very worrying that the political leaders of all parties are getting increasingly out of touch with what the people want on this matter.' About Mr Major's speech itself, there was little enthusiasm. 'Mr Major cannot ride more than two horses at once,' Mr John Biffen, a former Tory cabinet minister, said, adding that it did not suggest he had 'a clear and decisive European policy'. Another senior Euro-sceptic commented: 'The UK presidency is obviously a constraint on what he can say.'</p>

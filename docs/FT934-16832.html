			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Sweden plans big company tax package SWEDEN'S centre-right government yesterday announced a big package of corporate tax reforms designed to encourage business expansion and lower a record 13 per cent unemployment rate. Under the proposals, to be put to parliament later this month, the basic rate of corporate tax will fall 2 points to 28 per cent, taxes on dividends from Swedish companies will be scrapped for Swedish residents, and capital gains tax on equities will be halved to 12.5 per cent. Tax rules for small non-incorporated businesses will also change to bring about lower rates on capital yields and retained profits. 'The idea is to make it profitable to expand businesses and to start new businesses,' said Mr Bo Lundgren, deputy finance minister. 'We are taking away obstacles to growth.' With the budget deficit set to rise next year to 15 per cent of gross domestic product, the changes are to be fully financed. Just over half the SKr3.3bn (Pounds 273m) cost of the tax cuts - to take effect from next January - has already been accounted for in the 1993-94 budget. The balance will be financed mainly by raising employer contributions from 30 per cent of employees' salary to 30.2 per cent and partly by cuts in individual tax allowances for days spent working abroad. The package is the most far-reaching change in the corporate tax regime since 1991 when the then Social Democratic government cut the basic corporate tax rate from 52 per cent to 30 and largely dismantled an elaborate system of tax write-offs. The Social Democrats, now in opposition, persuaded the present government last year to postpone the reforms because of the severe pressure the recession has placed on welfare programmes. But Mr Lundgren said he was confident parliament would approve the proposals.</p>

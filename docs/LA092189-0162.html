			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: INSIDE INFORMATION GOES A LONG WAY  </P> <P> Ever wish you could call the shots at a sporting event?  </P> <P> In "The Winning Horseplayer," a book by the Washington Post's Andrew Beyer,  racing expert Paul Cornman describes what happened after he noticed a track  bias at Hialeah that favored front-runners on the rail. Only the names have  been changed:  </P> <P> " 'I liked a horse named Sib's Future, who had some speed and had the ability  to get the lead on the rail. But the jockey was Brian Long and he had shown  through his riding that he didn't understand the track. I wanted to tell him  but I knew I couldn't yell at him or I'd just sound like another one of the  irate fanatics. So when he was going out to the track from the paddock I said  as calmly as possible, 'Every winner has been on the inside. You're 20 to 1,  but if you hustle to the rail you'll win.' "  </P> <P> "Long hustled, got Sib's Future to the rail and led all the way, returning a  $43.20 payoff that got Paul out of the doldrums. As Long walked back to the  jockey's room he gave Paul a little nod, as if to acknowledge that he  appreciated the advice."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What countries have won the most World Cup soccer titles?  </P> <P> Ode-ious: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post on the start of the Redskins'  season:  </P> <P>  First it's the Giants on a long field goal,  </P> <P>  Then it's the Eagles in a game they stole.  </P> <P>  Who'd have predicted without real malice,  </P> <P>  The Skins 0-2 heading into Dallas?  </P> <P>  I know you thought nothing could be finer,  </P> <P>  Than to hand off the ball to Riggs and Byner.  </P> <P>  Though Gerald's the gaining-est back around,  </P> <P>  He's gotta stop laying the ball on the ground.  </P> <P>  But it could be worse, all could be dross.  </P> <P>  The Skins could be coached by Bobby Ross.  </P> <P> Add Redskins: Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun reports that Redskin  quarterback Mark Rypien and his wife were invited to dinner at the home of Vice  President Dan Quayle Sunday night.  </P> <P> The only problem was that Rypien wasn't feeling sociable after the Redskins  blew a 20-point lead in losing to the Philadelphia Eagles, 42-37.  </P> <P> Because he didn't know how to get in touch with Quayle's press secretary after  the game, Rypien and his wife simply didn't show up for the dinner.  </P> <P> "I guess I left him hanging," Rypien said. He said his wife called Quayle's  secretary Monday to explain what happened.  </P> <P> Unbridled criticism: Paul Moran of Newsday, on Easy Goer's victory in the  Woodward Stakes Saturday: "Not since Easy Goer's overpowering victory in the  Belmont, which followed severe and justified criticism of (Pat) Day's judgment  during his ride in the Preakness, has the sensational chestnut 3-year-old been  handled in a style complementary to his ability."  </P> <P> Add Moran: It appears that Easy Goer may race again before the Breeders' Cup at  Gulfstream Park Nov. 4. Said trainer Shug McGaughey: "I'm more inclined to run  now than I was before (the Woodward). For one thing, I've had more time to  think about it. And I thought that the Gold Cup was three weeks before the  Breeders' Cup, but it's actually four."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Brazil and Italy each has won three.  </P> <P> Quotebook: After quarterback Joe Montana patiently waited for Jerry Rice to get  open for a 58-yard touchdown pass that gave the San Francisco 49ers a  season-opening 30-24 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, radio commentator and  former all-pro linebacker Wayne Walker said: "Montana was as cool as the other  side of the pillow."

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Swedish poll shows rise in support for EU entry Support for Swedish membership of the European Union has moved ahead of anti-EU opposition for the first time in more than two years, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. In a welcome boost for the main government and opposition parties campaigning for a Yes to EU membership in a referendum to be held on November 13, the Gallup poll in the daily newspaper Expressen showed support for joining the Union running at 40 per cent, up from 38 per cent in a similar poll early in the month and three points ahead of the No camp. The No side slipped three points from 40 per cent, with 23 per cent undecided. The poll was further evidence of a trend since the July summer holiday running in favour of the pro-EU campaign, which is backed by the leadership of four right-centre governing coalition parties and the opposition Social Democratic Party. Another poll last weekend showed a 41-37 lead for the No camp. But it also showed a four-point fall in the No vote, which during most of this year and last year has held a strong lead. If the trend continues, it will brighten the hitherto doubtful prospect of all three Nordic EU applicants - Finland and Norway as well as Sweden - joining the Union on schedule at the beginning of 1995, along with Austria. The Yes camp leads the opinion polls comfortably in Finland, where a referendum will be held on October 16. The No side still holds its longstanding lead in Norway, which votes on November 28. However, a poll in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten last weekend showed a three-point rise in support for the EU to 31 per cent, while the No lead fell four points to 48 per cent. Significantly, respondents, when asked how they would vote if Finland and Sweden vote to join, produced a No lead of just 43-42.</p>

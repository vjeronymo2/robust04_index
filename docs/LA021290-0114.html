			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT: OIL ON THE BEACH;  </P> <P> BIRDS IN PERIL  </P> <P> Here are descriptions of five birds threatened by the oil spill off Huntington  Beach, shown above from left.  </P> <P> Western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis)  </P> <P> Because it spends most of its time on the surface of coastal waters, this  wintering bird is among the most vulnerable to the early effects of a spill.  </P> <P> California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni)  </P> <P> This endangered gull-like bird nests on the sand in wetlands such as Bolsa  Chica. Now wintering farther south, its nesting grounds would be threatened if  oil enters the wetlands.  </P> <P> Brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis)  </P> <P> This endangered bird flies along the surface and dives for fish; at least two  have been found with their feathers covered with oil.  </P> <P> Common murre (Uria aalge)  </P> <P> Like the grebe, this sea bird bobs on the water's surface, diving occasionally  for fish.  </P> <P> Light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes)  </P> <P> More than half of the state's population of this sedentary marsh bird lives in  the dense cordgrass stands of Upper Newport Bay. Any damage to this nesting  site would be devastating to the bird's future prospects.  </P></p>

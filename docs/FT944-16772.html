			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Reopened colliery heads for profit A colliery which closed more than a year ago is heading for a profit just three months after being reopened following a management buy-out. Managers at the Betws mine in Ammanford, Dyfed, said yesterday it would be in profit by Christmas. They said the colliery had already reached full production of 2,500 tonnes of anthracite each week. The pit reopened in a Pounds 3m buy-out in June after being closed by British Coal last January with the loss of 114 jobs. Betws now has orders for every tonne of output for the next five years. Betws Anthracite was reopened in a management buy-out by four former British Coal managers who now employ 91 miners and 14 staff.</p>

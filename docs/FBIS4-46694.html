			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Holovatyy, president of the Ukrainian </F> Legal Foundation and people's deputy of Ukraine, conducted by V.  Ye. Anisimov, under the rubric "Anniversaries"; date and place  not given]    [Text] The Ukrainian Legal Foundation is 2 years old.  Its appearance in a country of homeless judges, intimidated  procurators, and exhausted lawyers is more remarkable than  accidental. So many fervent reformers, legal rights activists,  and democrats "burned out" in the heroic and ineffective  struggle against the reigning nomenklatura! And finally, the  understanding has ripened that without reforming the very system  of legal relations in Ukraine, all attempts to build a free  society are doomed to failure. This process is a fairly long  one, since popular legal sophistication is extremely low and  this situation suits the prevailing regime perfectly: legal  nihilism is the bulwark of their power. And to prevent this from  happening, a person continues to seek protection and patronage  from illustrious dignitaries, stands at the front entrances to  ministries with placards, and makes the rounds of editorial  offices, and only at the last remembers the judge and the main  defender of his civil and human rights, the lawyer.    Turning the situation around and bringing Ukraine  closer to the civilized democratic states by providing  assistance in conducting reform in the country is the goal which  the Ukrainian Legal Foundation [UPF], which was created in May  1992, has pursued. We asked its president, People's Deputy of  Ukraine Sergey Holovatyy, to tell about the activity and  prospects of the UPF.    [Anisimov] Sergey Petrovich, two years of activity have  shown  that the UPF is not a phantom. It has acquired prestige and  influence, its opinion is taken into consideration, and a great  deal is being written about it. But first I would like to ask  about the magic of words. Words such as "democracy," "human  rights," and a "law-governed state." Only the lazy do not speak  them today. And it seems that they have become a reality.    [Holovatyy] That, as you remember, is an old and tested  device of the nomenklatura. The Kravchuk's and Plyushch's and  others use them very successfully. They devalued the meaning of  these concepts very quickly by repeating them all the time but  doing nothing. Slogans are for the sake of slogans. The creation  of the UPF did in fact pursue the goal of moving from grating  appeals to real concrete work.    [Anisimov] Whose idea was it to create the Foundation?    [Holovatyy] Its roots come from back in the time of the  Union, in 1990. At that time a group of jurists (Nikazakov,  Ayvazyan, Holovatyy, Muzychenko, Kisil, Shishkin, and others)  was the initiator of the creation of the Association of  Ukrainian Jurists. We understood very well that the state, and  that means the bureaucratic apparat, was not interested in  reforming itself. Bureaucrats understand that any reforms--in  the economy (the market, private ownership), a multiparty  system, jurists, the bar, or the court becoming  independent--will inevitably lead to the loss of bureaucratic  omnipotence and the loss of status. And although following that  Ukraine became an independent state, the system remained as  before: It was nurtured and lives under the laws of the Country  of the Soviets. In such a society, a jurist was part of the  mechanism for serving the nomenklatura's interests, and for that  very reason could not be a supporter of reforms and  democratization. And even now most of Ukraine's jurists do not  realize what the independence of the legal profession is. They  do not know how to be a jurist and not perform a servile  function, to be a lackey. Do you recall many cases where jurists  defended a citizen in his suit against the state? On the  contrary, they defended the state from people.    So the first thing that we wanted was to change the jurist's  role and position in society, to eliminate the servile essence,  and to achieve complete independence of his professional  activity. The natural human right to life, freedom, and private  ownership should be a law for him. But jurists work in different  systems: Some go to court to defend a citizen's rights, while  others (judges) apply the law created by the state. If the first  are independent, the others should be as well. Judges should not  be in the chain of corrupted power (judge, procurator, raysoviet  chairman, rayon administration chairman, and so forth). We  decided to break this chain and understood that a comprehensive  program of reform of Ukraine's legal system was needed.    [Anisimov] And the state ordered the Association of  Ukrainian  Jurists to develop such a program?    [Holovatyy] Of course not. The Association had no money, but  it had an intellectual charge. And in order to obtain money, a  plan was needed. A plan for reforming Ukraine's legal system  whose ultimate goal was to create a free society where human  rights and freedoms, above all the sacred right of private  ownership, were guaranteed. Such a plan was formulated together  with foreign jurists. It interested George Soros and Karl  Lopper's Zurich Foundation, which supported it materially. That  is how the Ukrainian Legal Foundation emerged.    [Anisimov] We have acquainted our readers with the child of  the UPF, the Ukrainian Center for Human Rights, and covered the  first all-Ukrainian human rights hearings conducted by it. Let  us talk a little about other areas of the Foundation's activity.    [Holovatyy] The creation of the Ukrainian Center for Human  Rights is 1 of 10 programs of the Foundation. They are  interrelated and no particular one of them can be considered the  main one or another one--secondary. Let us take the program  "Codification of Ukrainian Legislation." The program is supposed  to assist the lawmaking process in Ukraine in order to change it  and bring it closer to European standards. The basic codifying  enactments, civil, criminal, administrative, and so forth, must  constitute a system of legal enactments, be reconciled with one  another, and be based on the Constitution. We conducted two  international symposiums on the draft Constitution with  involvement of Western experts, and many of our recommendations  were taken into consideration by the working group. Conferences  on the Civil and Criminal codes were also held. At the  suggestion of the UPF conference held in Kharkov in December of  last year, the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine  created a national Codification Commission. Overall the  effectiveness of this program is very high--many of the  proposals are being adopted by the groups which are formulating  legal enactments.    The next program is related to a problem we already talked  about. You must agree that no matter how democratic the codes  are, they must be applied. And to do this a lawyer is needed, an  independent lawyer who is in no way linked to the state.  Associations of lawyers which are based on self-government and  have their own codes of honor exist in all civilized countries.  A lawyer can be expelled from the association for accepting  bribes or other violations. This decision will not depend on  whether he is a friend of the procurator or a functionary from  the ministry of internal affairs. The creation of an independent  professional organization of jurists as well as an independent  judicial system in Ukraine are extremely important problems.  Tell me, if a judge receives an apartment from the state (or  functionaries), how can we speak of his independence?    [Anisimov] But just who should offer this apartment to him?    [Holovatyy] A judge must be able to buy it as a free  citizen.  And his material support must guarantee that for him. Of course  this is difficult today, but after all we are speaking of a  long-term program of reform of post-totalitarian society. It is  very difficult to change this system in 5-10 years.    Moreover, can we speak of the independence of the lawyer and  judge when legal cadres in our country are still trained on the  Soviet plan? Soviet jurists were trained in two specializations:  Soviet development and legal scholar. The goal of instruction  was to train jurists for repressive functions and to support the  system. But we want a jurist to protect, as in any democratic  society, higher values, life, and property, rather than the  system. A person should call only on him in all situations.  Especially now when we are moving toward the market. In the West  a jurist is 90 percent involved with civil law and private law  relations. And we must have such jurists trained under the  standards of democratic countries, as the colleges of the  Western universities do. So the next program envisioned the  founding of the Center for Legal Studies. It was created on the  base of the Kiev-Mogilyanskiy Academy University and will train  highly qualified cadres of jurists for the country's scientific  and educational institutions and will also be involved in basic  and applied research in the area of the state and law. On its  basis, VUZ instructors will be retrained and improve their  skills, and it will develop textbooks and aids on questions of  law, translate foreign literature on legal questions, and engage  in publishing. An understanding has been reached with foreign  partners that in the fall of this year, the first graduate  students will go to study in the universities of England,  France, and Belgium.    The fifth UPF program envisions the creation of a Center for  Universal Minimum Legal Education of the Public. People must  abandon legal nihilism and find out how they should live in the  new legal system. However this is impossible without law  literature. But in Ukraine there are no publishing houses which  produce legal information. In Soviet Ukraine there was  Politizdat, which published laws in the Ukrainian language. In  the 2 years of our independence, not a single law has been  published in brochure form. The Ukrainian Legal Foundation  published the first Law on the Election of Deputies of the  Supreme Soviet in a half million copies. Coming soon, and in  large runs too, are the laws on Election of the President of  Ukraine and on Election to the Local Organs of Power. The  publishing house Pravo founded by the UPF is handling these  publications and in the future should become a powerful national  publisher of law literature. The first issue of the  scientific-practical journal UKRAINSKE PRAVO published by the  UPF will come out soon as well.    A separate program of ours envisions help in organizing and  financing conferences and symposiums on timely legal issues  conducted by state and other organizations. The last such  conference on the principles of the Criminal Code was conducted  by the Internal Affairs Academy. We allocated the money for it  and invited experts and specialists.    Stipends and on-site training for our legal specialists in  foreign VUZes and colleges (from 2-3 weeks to 3 months) are an  important program. A few days ago we selected, based on  interviews, six people for on-site training at London  University. And finally, there is a program to create a national  law library in Ukraine. The library has already been set up on  Kostelnaya Street and teachers, graduate students, and students  of Kiev VUZes visit it. At present its collection consists of  4,000 books, the universities of Canada gave 500 books, and it  subscribes to 6 foreign legal journals and has ties with foreign  libraries.    [Anisimov] And do state structures help your Foundation's  activity?    [Holovatyy] I already said that the state as a system of  bureaucracy is not interested in reforming itself. But  bureaucrats constitute 5 percent of the population, while  society makes up 95 percent. Moreover, there comes a time when  the bureaucrat becomes a pensioner and an ordinary citizen and  enters into those legal relations where he needs to go to court  and protect his rights as a person and a citizen. He will not  always be able to utilize the "telephone right" and contacts.  And then he too begins to think that the system should  apparently be changed. We do not receive any help at all from  the state. We seek money and find it abroad. Even our requests  for space for a publishing house and library were ignored. They  distribute space to anyone you like, but not to us.    But come what may, it seems to me that the Ukrainian Legal  Foundation has taken its first steps quite confidently. And no  matter what, I am certain that independent Ukraine will become a  law-governed state, since there is simply no other way.</p>

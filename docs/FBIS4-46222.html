			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Japanese Government is  exaggerating the threat from North Korea over its refusal to  allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities, the  Japanese Red Army claims in statements reaching Japan on  Wednesday [1 Jun].    The statements, sent to the Red Army's contacts in Japan,  mark the May 30, 1972, Red Army machine-gun and grenade attack  on passengers at Lod Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel.    That attack was carried out as a mark of solidarity with the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.    This year's statement claims the United States is creating  tensions by using the threat from North Korea to promote its own  plans to achieve nuclear exclusivity.    "The Japanese Government also accepts this and, in line with  the United Nations, is agitating over whether or not to  introduce sanctions," the statement says.    The statement also says Japan should reflect on its  aggression during World War II and observe the spirit of peace  enunciated in Article 9 of its constitution.    It says the Red Army opposes Japan's bid for a permanent  seat  on the UN Security Council.</p>

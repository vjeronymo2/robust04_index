			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Seiha: "When Pailin Is Captured"] </F>   [Text] Pailin fell into the hands of the royal government  at 1800 on 19 March. No one in Phnom Penh could hear the  clandestine Khmer Rouge radio transmission anymore. However,  most people believe that "the Khmer Rouge problem is not over  yet."    According to a preliminary report, only 22 Khmer Rouge  soldiers have been shot dead in fighting at Bar Ya Kha, mid-way  between Pailin town and the Thai border. Where then have the  many other Khmer Rouge troops been hiding?    The loss of Pailin certainly puts an end to the considerable  inflow of revenue for the Khmer Rouge. But it does not mean  that the Khmer Rouge have been economically strangled. The  Khmer Rouge still possess several hundred million dollars in  stocks abroad, especially in Thailand, and they also hold large  amounts of shares in various Thai companies.    Therefore, the remaining Khmer Rouge troops of about 9,000  and their economic assets will enable them to carry on their  activities, and whenever the forces of the royal government  lapse, the Khmer Rouge will strike back.    Nevertheless, the capture of Pailin by the royal government  forces is a big blow to the Khmer Rouge. It will force them to  get out of the trenches and return to the negotiating table.  Foreign analysts have said that if negotiations are still  deadlocked the negotiations are still deadlocked up to this  point, the royal government must be prepared to be immersed in a  general guerrilla warfare with the Khmer Rouge. If this were  the case, the Khmer Rouge would become the most urgent problem  for the royal government to solve.    If this were the case, the royal government should  immediately declare the Khmer Rouge outlaws. Then, all the  assets of the Khmer Rouge would also be outlawed and all  countries would have the obligation to return these assets to  the legal government as in the case of the United States, which  has agreed to return the amassed fortune of Marshal Lon back to  the royal government. Only then will the Khmer Rouge be truly  strangled.</p>

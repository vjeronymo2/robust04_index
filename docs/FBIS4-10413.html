			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Graciela Guadalupe: "Politicians: A Majority in </F> the Constituent Assembly"]    [Text] Pact: The two leading parties prefer to take  "loyal" delegates to the convention in order to secure the  Olivos Pact. Fewer than 10 percent will be specialized  jurists.    Nearly half of the 305 delegates to the Constituent  Convention will be lawyers, the lists of candidates from the  nation as a whole reveal.    However, jurists specializing in constitutional law will  comprise less than 10 percent of the total number of attorneys.    The projected profile of the future convention, based on the  votes obtained by political forces in the most recent elections,  will also include a large number of teachers and doctors,  followed by trade unionists, engineers, clerk/secretaries, and  businessmen.    They will be joined by economists, accountants, farmers, and  journalists, plus dentists, former military men, housewives, a  bishop, and possibly a poet!    However, the list would not be representative if it were not  observed that a very large percentage of these professionals--no  more than a dozen of the likely conventioneers have no higher or  university degrees--have not toiled in their profession for  years, having devoted all their efforts to politics.  <H5>  Members </H5>   Therefore, it is not surprising to find provincial or  national lawmakers, intendants, officials from various areas,  and party presidents who, by virtue of their charisma, their  distinguished political careers, because they are in positions  of leadership, or based on strictly numerical considerations  will supply more votes for the partisan mills.    The party affiliation of most candidates would seem to  indicate that the convention will have more of a political than  constituent tint. The points of greatest interest to President  Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin, head of the UCR [Radical Civic  Union], were put together in a "package" that will be voted upon  without being opened! Which explains the concern of the leaders  of the two majority parties over taking delegates to the  convention who will be faithful to the Olivos Pact rather than  ones who might contribute to reform.  <H5>  Insurance </H5>   It is the Justicialist Party (PJ) that is most interested in  the business of election insurance. Many of those heading the  lists are in fact provincial governors, followed by deputy  governors and even former governors.    Ramon Ortega (Tucuman), Adolfo Rodriguez Saa (San Luis),  Nestor Kirchner (Santa Cruz), Eduardo Duhalde (Buenos Aires),  Carlos Reutemann (Santa Fe), Ruben Marin (La Pampa), Mario Moine  (Entre Rios), and Federico Puerta (Misiones) head the PJ lists  as well as the governments of their respective districts, while  Radical Carlos Maestro does the same in Chubut.    Deputy Governors Gildo Insfran (Formosa), Julio Diaz Lozano  (Tucuman), Eduardo Arnold (Santa Cruz), and Miguel Robles (Santa  Fe) will back their chiefs from the next, although no less  predictable, posts. Also enjoying every chance at a convention  spot are former Peronist governors Arturo Puricelli (Santa Cruz)  and Jorge Escobar, removed from his stewardship of San Juan.    Two governors will have the inestimable presence of their  wives in the assembly: Evangelina Salazar de Ortega (former  actress) and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (attorney) are  certain to represent Tucuman and Santa Cruz respectively at the  convention.    Because of its legal status, the capital could not fall back  on the governor, but the ruling party found a way to make sure  the assumed insurance would be just as important as in the rest  of the districts. The names topping that list belong to five  officials from the Central Government: Carlos Corach (legal and  technical secretary), Raul Matera (Science and Technology  secretary), Matilde Menendez (head of PAMI [Comprehensive  Medical Assistance Plan]), Claudia Bello (Civil Service  secretary), and Adelina Dalesio de Viola (president of the  National Mortgage Bank).    Justicialists Alberto Pierri and Eduardo Menem, who head the  Chamber of Deputies and Senate, will be convention delegates  from Buenos Aires and La Rioja, while the UCR will send former  President Raul Alfonsin to the assembly, also for Buenos Aires.  <H5>  Bishops and Poets </H5>   Few convention candidates are from unusual professions (no  value judgment intended). Among them, Jaime de Nevares, bishop  emeritus of Neuquen, will very likely have a seat, representing  the Grand Front, along with poet David Gatica (PJ, La Rioja).  However, the latter is an alternate on the party list.    The names of farmers Oscar Paz (Republican Force, Tucuman)  and Jose Piccinato (UCR, Santiago del Estero) and journalists  Jose Mantilla (PJ, La Pampa) and Domingo Schiavoni (PJ, Santiago  del Estero) are sure to go down in history.    Formosa Deputy Governor Insfran is a veterinarian, a  profession he shares with La Pampa Radical Carlos D'Amico.    Susana Sanchez (UCR, La Pampa) is a housewife, while the  first candidate for the Cordoban UCR, Ramon Mestre, is a dentist  and the former intendant of Cordoba.    One important fact for possible future mothers who might be  active in the Constituent Convention: They will be able to rely  on the presence of delegate Ada de Liggerini (PJ, Entre Rios),  who is an obstetrician.</p>

Thus, they are dealing  with the outside world as if it is blind, deaf, and mute. In an  interview with CNN, the Israeli prime minister said he did not  directly or indirectly hear that Syria is prepared for full  peace, adding that he knows, however, what Syria wants from  Israel in return for peace.    TISHRIN continues: Although Syria never conceals its resolve  to restore the occupied Golan, it has for years stressed  adherence to the establishment of a just, comprehensive Middle  East peace. Since the convocation of the Madrid conference,  Syria has renewed this assertion hundreds of times. The recent  Geneva summit was one occasion when Syria clearly explained its  concept of peace and its nature. It also voiced its readiness  to honor all peace requirements. Moreover, through President  al-Asad, Syria called for concluding the peace of the brave. It  also urged the Israeli leaders to rise to the level of the cause  of peace and to have the necessary courage to establish a just,  comprehensive peace in the region and remove the Middle East  from the cycle of war and conflicts.    TISHRIN continues: It sounds odd that while the entire world  is convinced of Syria's credibility and honest quest for peace,  praises its efforts and initiative, and values its stands, the  Israeli rulers find no reason to be convinced. The paper notes  Rabin's recent statement in which he said: We do not know what  kind of peace will be agreed on, and to where we will pull out.  The paper says: It must be reasserted that Syria is looking  for a just, comprehensive peace; a durable, stable peace; a  genuine peace that ends occupation and restores rights to their  owners; a peace that is acceptable to the current Arab  generations and worthy of being maintained by future  generations. Such a peace must be honorable and must uproot  injustice, oppression, and occupation.    TISHRIN explains that such a peace requires Israel's full  withdrawal from the Golan. It says that Syria has frequently  asserted that it will never bargain over an iota of the Golan  soil nor will it relinquish an inch of it. Any compromise,  which Israel wants, is absolutely out of question. The Golan  Heights are Syrian and have been since time immemorial. They  should be returned to the motherland and to their evacuated  population, who are awaiting the establishment of peace to  return to their homes.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace in the Middle East is no  longer exclusively a Syrian or Arab issue. Rather, it is a  world issue. The world will not allow that a unique peace  opportunity be destroyed. Two years of Israeli intransigence  have so far failed to destroy this opportunity.</p>

It Will Soon Have a President"]    [Text] One of the latest pledges of Buryatia Supreme  Soviet deputies to the population, which has slowly been "coming  to the boil," has been acted upon. The parliament session has  adopted a constitution in whose first chapter the republic near  Lake Baykal recorded its adherence to the idea of constructing a  democratic, rule-of-law state as part of the Russian Federation.  Buryatia's political circles have generally proclaimed, and are  proclaiming now, their loyalty to Moscow while not concealing  their recent dissatisfaction with the correction of the  president's and the federal government's economic course. In  its turn, the emergence of "quiet opposition" in Ulan-Ude is  connected with the so far blurred, after the adoption of the  republic's new Fundamental Law, political prospects. Under the  Constitution, state power shall be exercised in Buryatia by a  nationally elected president, a numerically small (55 persons)  professional parliament (People's Khural), government, and  courts of law. Future presidents shall be elected by popular  vote for four years. The deputies insisted that future  candidates should know the republic's economy well and be able  to speak two state languages -- Buryat and Russian. The future  head of state shall form the government team, but unlike the  team, he shall not be accountable to parliament.    In addition to the Constitution, the session, which is  continuing, will pass republican laws "On Presidential  Elections," "On Elections for the People's Khural," and "On  Organs of Self-Government." According to observers'  assessments, however, the main struggle between parties,  movements, and blocs is still ahead. Shortly before the  Constitution was adopted, the founding congresses of agrarians,  young people, and athletes, who stated their preferences, took  place in Ulan-Ude. It was not for nothing that there was a stir  in Ulan-Ude around the court examination of a 50-million ruble  libel suit brought by Buryatia parliament speaker Leonid Potapov  against the parliament-government newspaper BURYATIYA.  Incidentally, the newspaper filed a countersuit last Monday  accusing Leonid Potapov of lying, and demanding that he pay 100  million rubles.</p>

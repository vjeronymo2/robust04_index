			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / D-Mark Issues: Bundesbank guidelines set to give boost to sector THE MARKET for debt issued in D-Marks, long shackled by cumbersome regulations, is at last catching up with comparable sectors. The new Bundesbank guidelines on issuing D-Mark paper, which come into force at the beginning of August, are set to provide a further boost to the market's recent development. Because of the importance of the German economy, there is a natural appetite for D-Mark paper among international investors, but in the past concern about liquidity and reluctance to deal with different market practices have proved a strong deterrent. While bunds have become increasingly broadly held, other types of securities have remained largely domestic instruments until recently. Meanwhile, foreign borrowers wishing to issue paper denominated in D-Marks have been kept out by complex rules and restrictions. But in the last couple of years, growing supply and demand, and a gradual easing of rules by the Bundesbank, have boosted the D-Mark bond and commercial paper markets and their improving liquidity has encouraged greater international participation. The latest move by the Bundesbank is set to accelerate that process and enhance the competitiveness of German capital markets; but German bankers say it will not necessarily improve their profits. The main thrust of the change is the abolition of the two-year minimum maturity requirement for foreign companies. The requirement still applies to banks or other financial institutions. The new Bundesbank regulations have also done away with a number of other inconveniences - and expenses - involved in issuing D-Mark paper: the requirement to appoint a German paying agent; to use the German clearing system; to list on a German stock Exchange; and to use German law. In addition, German branches of foreign banks can now arrange debt offerings. In the first half of 1992, volume in the D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market leapt to Dollars 14.8bn (equivalent), compared with Dollars 9bn for the same period the previous year. The jump is accounted for not by the growing number of issues but by a substantial increase in the average size of D-Mark Eurobonds, which this year have included DM2bn issues for Finland and Spain. 'In the past, we could not persuade these issuers to borrow in size,' said the syndicate head of one German bank, who added that it is the growing international investor base which has allowed the market to develop in this way. German banks have had to make a more concerted effort to sell to foreign investors since, until earlier this month, uncertainty on German tax rules had undermined their traditional German retail investor base. One German banker estimated the cost savings on a Eurobond at about 3 to 4 basis points, which could bring some business to the sector, 'but it is marginal'. These savings, however, are for the borrower and, unless volume is increased substantially, German banks could lose out, due to greater competition from foreign houses. But it is the D-Mark commercial paper market which stands to benefit most from the latest changes by the Bundesbank. The CP market, which only opened in February last year, has already attracted more than 40 issuers, and the total value of programmes exceeds DM30bn. Bankers predict that programmes could reach DM50bn by the end of the year, up from DM16.3bn at the end of 1991, as the pace of expansion accelerates following the abolition of the minimum maturity of two years for foreign non-bank issuers. These means that foreign companies will now be able to incorporate D-Mark options into their existing Euro-commercial paper and Euro-medium-term note programmes. 'This will save costs and result in a much wider use of the D-Mark because it is so easy to do such issues,' says Mr Christof von Dryander in the Frankfurt office of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, international lawyers. Until now, large companies such as France's Alcatel have had to set up special German subsidiaries in order to issue D-Mark CP. "The move is a significant boost for the DM's role as a fully-fledged investment currency ,' says Mr Mark Houghton-Berry of Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. 'Obviously the DM has been the most important reserve currency for decades, but because of a number of restrictions many more companies have wanted to raise D-Marks than have found it simple or convenient to so.' The Frankfurt Stock Exchange said last week that it welcomed this liberalisation, 'as a matter of principle'. Privately, officials recognise that the move will force a fundamental reassessment of the listing procedures which are widely criticised as being complex and expensive - out of fear that the liberalisation will drive business away from Frankfurt to other financial centres, especially London and Luxembourg.</p>

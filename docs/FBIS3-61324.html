			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rustam Narzikulov under the rubric "Expert </F> Opinion": "The Liberation From Superliberalism; the  Decommercialization of the Russian State"]    [Text]  <H5>  Institutional Changes </H5>   Two main features have shaped Russia's economic development  during the last decade of the twentieth century, during which  the country was trying to create normal market institutions. The  first was a complete absence of private capital at the initial  point of the economic reform started in 1992. From this  standpoint the 1990's may be called the era of post-Soviet  initial accumulation of capital. The second characteristic trait  of the economic and political system of the country was an  extremely weak state, completely destroyed during the  post-communist period.    The combination of these two features created in Russia an  extremely peculiar economic environment that did not exist in  any country implementing reforms. Other former socialist  countries also encountered the absence of private ownership, but  in none of them was the deterioration of state ties so  all-encompassing. Therefore in Russia, despite the attempts to  apply canonical and overall correct methods for creating a  market, the result was the emergence of a unique economy.    In general terms it may be characterized as liberalism  pushed  to the extreme and made possible by the powerlessness of the  state, or superliberalism. In whichever economic sphere the  state attempted to operate (prices, money, the budget system,  privatization, foreign trade, and so on), at best it was able to  set general directions for development, but all attempts at  purposeful regulation were unsuccessful. This happened because  the old mechanism of macroeconomic management, which went under  the name of "bargaining over a plan" or "bureaucratic  capitalism," did not disappear as the old state disintegrated;  it only transformed itself.    Some state bureaucrats, who retained control over production  links, budget means, and the ability to distribute (not goods,  as before, but this time subsidies) began to swell the ranks of  the fast-growing entrepreneurial class. Others, who stayed in  the service of the government and local authorities, for all  practical purposes commercialized the state mechanism, for their  interaction with business predominantly occurred in the form of  remunerative relations. The state apparatus turned into one  gigantic commercial company or, to be precise, a whole system of  companies linked together by complex interconnected interests  and mutual obligations.    The all-out commercialization is that superliberalism by  whose laws Russia lived and which immediately scared the  foreigners terribly. The subjects of developed Western countries  were used to competing within the framework of rules established  from above, in which whoever finds the best combination of  utilizing these rules, wins. In the Russia of the beginning  1990's, the winners were those who could maneuver the state into  rigging the rules in their favor. Russia also began to scare the  West by its new penetration of world markets since, having  gotten used to the conditional nature of any imperative, Russian  businessmen began to break the established rules of the game in  this area as well (first and foremost by engaging in massive  dumping).    Today the situation is beginning to change. The era of  initial accumulation of capital has practically come to an end;  a class of proprietors has formed who are becoming increasingly  unhappy about the commercial nature of relations with the state.  They are sick and tired of engaging in unlawful contact with all  bureaucrats, from tax inspector and Central Bank teller to prime  minister. A powerful social force has emerged--class solidarity  of the new bourgeoisie in their struggle against a specific  government business. On the other hand, after the "great  reshuffling" of property had been completed, the state lost the  underpinning of its commercialization. Bureaucrats'  opportunities for business activities declined sharply. The  state is beginning to increasingly engage in what should be its  principal business: setting the rules of the game in the market.  This arbiter, however, still does not shy away from a bribe and  whenever possible will not miss the opportunity to profit from  the problems of others. It is quite risky to engage in it now,  however, since most businessmen believe that it is more  expedient to complain about a bureaucrat than to bribe him.  <H5>  The New Economy </H5>   At first glance the current sectoral structure of the  Russian  economy is less progressive than 10 years ago. The share of the  primary sector has increased (mainly due to the growth in the  mining industry while the proportional share of agriculture  remained unchanged); the share of the processing industry has  declined, among other things at the expense of complex,  science-intensive production sectors. This, by the way, has been  taken up by the political opposition, which maintains that the  fathers of the economic reform are leading the country into  deindustrialization.    Upon closer inspection, however, it turns out that the  situation with respect to the economic structure is not that  bad, to say the least. True, the primary sector's share has  increased, but is it bad for the country to expand production of  oil and gas, which until now had produced the bulk of our hard  currency earnings? Moreover, market reform made it possible to  attract gigantic foreign investment into the mineral deposits so  difficult to develop that it is unlikely they would have been  utilized under the old system. Besides, expansion of the primary  sector is a temporary phenomenon; it is just that initially for  both domestic and foreign capital it was the most attractive  sphere of investment.    The proportional share of the processing industry has  declined, but not because the country took the road of technical  regression. The reason is that in the former USSR between 70 and  80 percent of this segment one way or the other was linked to  the military-industrial complex. And it is quite natural that  sharp cutbacks in military orders could not help but result in  closings of gigantic plants producing all sorts of armaments.    And, finally, the most convincing argument against all talk  about "moving backwards" is the fast-growing tertiary  sector--first and foremost the banking and finance segment, and  information and transportation sectors.    The real problem, however, is that now, after the initial  structural shifts, which have led to a normal sectoral  equilibrium, economic development faces two alternatives. Russia  will either begin pulling itself up toward the models of  developed countries of the West (reduction of the primary and  secondary sectors as a result of the fast growth of productivity  in them, the growth of the tertiary sector due to general  computerization, a growing service industry, etc.), or the  current, not the most advanced economic structure, will be  preserved and Russia will land for a long time in the category  of medium-developed states of the "Third World." This is where  the new Russian state should say its word in the environment of  rejecting that very "superliberalism"--state mechanisms should  facilitate fast technological development.    We should count among the obvious achievements of the reform  radical changes in the monetary sphere. They may be briefly  characterized as follows: "Russia now has real money." Of  course, in the past, too, the Central Bank issued national  currency, but its periodic and unpredictable devaluation by tens  of percentage points a month caused people to mistrust it. Let  us recall 1995 [as published], when dollarization of the country  and the flight of capital abroad have reached an apogee, foreign  assets of Russian commercial banks exceeded by a factor of two  all exports from Russia, and the total volume of hard currency  in the hands of the population exceeded by the same factor the  ruble aggregate M0 [cash money in circulation]. Today the  inflation figures are quite presentable--a modest 15 percent a  year. One does not have to explain how it has affected the  entire economy.    On the other hand, strange as it may be, a stable ruble and  the success in combating inflation aggravated the Ministry of  Finance's problems. While in the past a budget deficit could be  covered by excessive monetary emission, now the Ministry of  Finance is experiencing great difficulties, since the Russian  "middle class," not used to honestly paying taxes, is trying to  evade this unpleasant procedure by all possible means. As a  result, tax evasion reaches 60 percent. The minister of finance  said angrily that if his compatriots "do not like paying taxes,"  perhaps they will consider deductions into the budget as  charitable contributions to the treasury.    Tax evasion also is linked with the shadow economy, which  has  remained in place to a great extent. A considerable number of  small- and medium-size businesses still combine legal and  semi-legal forms of business activities. And only major  industrial giants such as Gazprom, YuKOS, LUKoil, and old  foreign trade companies (Moskva-Nafta, Uraneksportprom, and  others) attempt to work Western-style, which, by the way, is  what attracts Western investors to them. At the same time, the  confidence of partners and consumers is beginning to be seen  increasingly as a serious intangible asset of a company, which  creates certain preconditions for the decline of shadow business.    The unemployment picture presents a paradox. Contrary to  expectations, its perceptible growth fell not in the years of  greatest structural shifts, when armaments production was being  cut at a fast rate and previously subsidized enterprises were  closing (1994-1996) [as published] but in later years, by the  end of the century, when, it would seem, the main structural  problems had been resolved. Unemployment "arrived late" due to  an initial extremely low level of the national wage. In  1993-1996 [as published] the average wage was no more than $50 a  month: at this kind of wage one does not need to invoke the  Phillips curve to explain low unemployment rates. Extremely  cheap labor made it possible for the authorities to forget about  employment problems in those years.    Then the situation changed, however. A fast rising standard  of living in the society plus hired labor's awareness that wages  should include all social costs--in the past borne by the state  (housing, education, child rearing, health care)--caused an  unprecedented rise in the national level of income. Today the  average wage is $450 a month, and the young people's  expectations are much higher. Simultaneously with the growth of  income, unemployment began to rise. From the initial 1.2 percent  (the lowest in the world) it rose to 5.7 percent--not too high  to speak of a catastrophe, but not too low to ignore it.    It is unlikely that local methods (paying allowances,  retraining, public works) will help in combating this social  ill. A more effective method is increased investment and better  competitive standing of the Russian economy, which actually  coincides with the general goals of future economic development.</p>

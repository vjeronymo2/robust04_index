			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSMEN HAIL SANDINISTAS' DEFEAT AT POLLS;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: VALLEY-AREA REPRESENTATIVES PRAISE VOTING RESULTS BUT ARE SPLIT ON  THE CAUSE OF PRESIDENT ORTEGA'S DOWNFALL.  </P> <P> San Fernando Valley-area congressmen who serve on foreign affairs committees  cheered the surprising electoral defeat of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua on  Monday and said the United States has a responsibility to supply limited  foreign aid to the newly elected government.  </P> <P> At the same time, they voiced concern about the Sandinistas' willingness to  transfer power peacefully and the ability of the disparate National Opposition  Union (UNO) led by Violette Barrios de Chamorro to forge an effective  government and invigorate the faltering economy.  </P> <P> Democratic Reps. Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and Anthony C. Beilenson of  Los Angeles and Republican Reps. Robert J. Lagomarsino of Ojai and Elton  Gallegly of Simi Valley differed, however, over the causes of the Sandinistas  apparent demise and who deserves credit for the leftist revolutionaries'  defeat.  </P> <P> Berman and Beilenson praised diplomatic efforts. Lagomarsino and Gallegly said  military and economic pressures were largely responsible.  </P> <P> Gallegly, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was in Nicaragua as  one of the 2,000 accredited election observers. Among other activities, he  helped count ballots at polling places in the city of Esteli, near the Honduran  border.  </P> <P> Gallegly said that although he "didn't trust" Sandinista President Daniel  Ortega, he was "optimistic he will step down" peacefully.  </P> <P> "But I'm not optimistic," he said, about cooperation by Interior Minister Tomas  Borge, "a very powerful man and a very feared man."  </P> <P> Gallegly said he was amazed at the determination of Nicaraguans to vote in the  election, even in war-torn areas around Esteli.  </P> <P> "Some of them walked as much as 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) and as long as five  hours" to get to the polls, he said. "Some of them waited in line as long as  two hours; they were in high spirits and they were calm."  </P> <P> "I am delighted by the outcome and by the opportunities," said Berman, also a  member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. This includes the possibility of  a negotiated end to the military conflict in neighboring El Salvador that has  left 70,000 dead, he said.  </P> <P> "We should normalize our relations with the newly elected government" in  Managua, said Beilenson, who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.  "We should end as quickly as possible the economic sanctions, which have hurt  the economy greatly and we should bring an end to this chapter of support for  the Contras and make arrangements to bring them back home."  </P> <P> Lagomarsino, the ranking Republican on the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of  the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a strong supporter of U.S. aid to the  Contras, called the defeat of Ortega a vindication of hard-line tactics that  former President Ronald Reagan, Lagomarsino and other conservatives had  espoused.  </P> <P> "A lot of it had to do with our policy," Lagomarsino said. "One of the primary  purposes for Ortega reaching agreement" to hold elections "was to end the  Contra war."  </P> <P> Berman, in contrast, said President Bush had moved quickly after his  inauguration in 1989 to end military aid to the Contras as part of a bipartisan  foreign policy. Beilenson, however, said, "I think the credit mainly goes to  the other nations of Central America" who had "insisted on this process of  reconciliation and open elections."  </P> <P> Berman, Beilenson and Lagomarsino roundly criticized the Sandinistas for  failing to tolerate dissent or political opposition. Lagomarsino said the  Nicaraguan vote was the latest striking reversal worldwide proving that "people  don't want to live under Marxist-Leninist systems."  </P> <P> None of the three lawmakers was ready to estimate how much economic assistance  would be warranted if the Sandinistas permit power to pass to Chamorro and the  newspaper publisher's allies in April. Nicaragua, whose economy the United  States helped cripple during the past decade, joins Panama and Eastern European  nations clamoring for additional foreign aid.  </P> <P> Beilenson said: "We have a certain amount of responsibility in helping these  people get back on their feet. I hope it's not too much money and it doesn't  last too long."  </P> <P> All three lawmakers expressed varying degrees of surprise at the outcome.  Berman, however, said he was "no more surprised that the Soviet Union, after 40  years of controlling Eastern Europe by military force, would allow those  countries to evolve on their own."  </P> <P> Beilenson was co-chairman of the official congressional observer delegation  that disbanded earlier this month after the Sandinistas refused to grant them  visas. "It came off fine," Beilenson said of the election. "That's all that's  important."  </P></p>

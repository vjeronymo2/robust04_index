			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- The fact that the leaders of North  Ossetia and Ingushetia have sat down at the conference table is  no small contribution of the Russian interior troops who are  carrying out peacekeeping functions in the region, their  commander, Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov believes. He was  meeting Russian and foreign journalists at a briefing at the  Russian Internal Affairs Ministry today.    Kulikov noted that the presence of the interior troops in  the  emergency situation zone has not only stabilized but also, to a  considerable extent, improved the crime situation. The number  of people who have been killed in North Ossetia and Ingushetia  is substantially fewer than in neighboring republics and oblasts  with the same population, and the crime level is an average of  20 percent less.    Describing the activities of the troops in the hot spot,  General Kulikov cited the following figures: Last year troop  details confiscated over 600 fire arms, about 30,000 pieces of  ammunition, hundreds of grenades and explosives, 16 artillery  systems and grenade-throwers, and nine armored vehicles. This  year seven special operations to disarm illegal formations have  been carried out. The troops' catch includes 62 firearms, over  240 grenades, mines, and explosive devices, and over 20 kg of  explosive substances.    In the time the troops have been in the emergency situation  zone over 100 special operations have been carried out in which  not a single local inhabitant has been killed, Kulikov stressed.    Unfortunately, he went on, the servicemen are constantly  risking their lives in fulfilling combat and service tasks in  the region. Last year, the temporary quarters of units and  sub-units and also troop details were subjected to shelling and  armed attacks on 126 occasions, as a result of which seven  people were killed and 133 wounded. This year there have  already been over 20 attacks and shellings. There have been no  losses among the men of the interior troops.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yun Ho-chin, counselor of the North Korean embassy  in Vienna and chief delegate to the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA], said in an interview with REUTER on 2 June that  the IAEA is making an unreasonable demand for inspections and,  as a result, North Korea will definitely be compelled to  withdraw [taltoerul kangyobatchi annulsu opta] from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Stressing that North Korea's  intent is revealing its nuclear transparency, Counselor Yun said  that he is scheduled to have a discussion with IAEA officials  this afternoon to defuse the nuclear crisis.</p>

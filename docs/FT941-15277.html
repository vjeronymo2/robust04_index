			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Playing safe with the big bonuses - Sara Webb asks the City slickers how they are using their rewards The recession has instilled a sense of caution among City employees, and while bonuses for the last financial year are likely to be more generous than in the recent past, many of the people working in the financial sector are saving rather than splashing out. The rally in the stock and bond markets last year meant that many City firms made bumper profits from their trading activities and are expected to reward their staff accordingly at bonus time. 'The feeling is that 1993 was a pretty exceptional year and people know they are unlikely to see the same kind of profits in 1994, because it was a one-off,' said one trader. 'Whatever it is I get eventually, I won't be buying a round-the-world holiday, I'll be saving it.' Some City firms will not pay their staff bonuses until the end of January or even later in the spring when the company's accounts have been done. At the top end of the league, Kaveh Alamouti, a trader at Tokai Bank's London operation, attracted considerable attention when he reputedly earned Pounds 9m in 1992 combining his salary and bonus. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which was one of the first to award its bonuses for 1993, paid 70 of its London-based executives Dollars 1m or more. With sums that many in the City are keen to use whatever tax shelters are available, although highly-paid individuals rue the fact that certain tax schemes have been closed. One arbitrage dealer said he has ploughed much of the money back into the markets in which he specialises, although he added that he is unusual, since 'many people who work in the City are not particularly good at managing their own financial affairs'. 'The bonus' is a sensitive subject, and not one that people like to be quoted on, as it can draw unwanted attention to a firm. 'People tend to be a bit reticent about how they are spending their bonus, although you find that someone is likely to just let it slip into conversation if they have made some money in an emerging market,' said one trader. Anecdotal evidence from the trading floors suggests that while one or two might be thinking of buying a yacht, many are choosing to regard this as a one-off reward, to be saved or invested carefully. 'I know it sounds boring, but I'm just going to use the money to help pay off my mortgage,' said one senior economist at a Japanese bank in London. This seems to be a common approach, particularly by those in their late 20s or early 30s who may have come into the financial sector too late to enjoy the fruits of the 1980s bonus bonanza. 'I expect I shall use the money to redecorate my house - I've just moved, and the previous owner had dreadful taste and painted everything battleship grey,' said an economist at a UK bank. Investment advisers support the view that those in the financial sector are erring on the side of caution this year. 'They've all suffered a little, these are the good times after the bad and there's a degree of prudence,' said David Major, tax partner at Touche Ross. In many cases these private clients are following the basic principles of financial planning. That means taking advantage of the tax-efficient plans such as Tessas, Peps and National Savings. While the ceilings on these schemes are low, Major says considerable tax savings can be made, especially if both husband and wife use the schemes. John Bridel, an adviser at Towry Law, says husbands and wives can double up their National Savings holdings by each using their respective Pounds 10,000 maximum and then writing a further Pounds 10,000 in trust for each other. Another City favourite - the Business Expansion Scheme - which offered tax relief as well as considerable risk in some instances, was laid to rest at the end of last year. One trader at a US bank groaned at the mention of BES: 'God, the amount of talk there used to be on the trading floor about BES was positively boring'. Its successor, 'Son of BES' is the Enterprise Investment Scheme announced in the November 30 Budget, though advisers say investors should wait to see what kind of schemes are launched. Equities and collective investments such as investment trusts and unit trusts are popular with City employees. Some traders and sales staff said they liked the idea of investing in the European privatisation investment trusts launched by Kleinwort Benson and Mercury Asset Management recently, while others prefer the high-growth economies in Asia. 'If the Pacific rim economies are set to grow by about 8 per cent a year, and EC countries by 2 per cent a year, I know which area I think is the most attractive,' said one equity salesman. One senior manager at a US bank admitted that the subject of where to invest had become a topic of debate among City slickers in his train carriage: 'There's a fair amount of discussion among people coming into work in the mornings about the emerging markets - the Philippines seems to be one that everyone talks about with interest.' An economist at one of the UK banks said the emerging markets were popular last year and might have been overbought, but added: 'I might put a small amount in a Latin American fund.' However, he said that if the pound strengthens this year, then it might be better to concentrate on sterling-based investments, rather than take the currency risk.</p>

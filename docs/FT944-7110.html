			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Japan's tax reforms clear Diet: Measures aim to encourage purchases of imported goods Japan's upper house of parliament yesterday gave final approval, as expected, for tax reforms to stimulate the weak recovery in the short term and restrain growth in state borrowing after 1997. This fulfils a promise made by prime minister Tomiichi Murayama at the Group of Seven summit in July to cut income tax as a means to encourage more Japanese to buy imported goods and lower the world's largest and most politically contentious trade surplus. The first part of the package consists of Y16,500bn (Pounds 107bn) of income tax cuts spread over the next three years, worth Y5,500bn annually. Of the annual total, Y3,500bn will continue after 1997 as a permanent reduction. In the second stage of tax reform, starting in the fiscal year beginning April 1997, sales tax will rise from its internationally low 3 per cent to 5 per cent. This is needed to finance the tax cuts, and over the longer term compensate for the shrinkage in the income tax base caused by Japan's fast-ageing population profile. The sales tax rise is smaller than the fiscally conservative finance ministry had wanted, because of its obvious political unpopularity. However, a clause in yesterday's tax bill empowers the government to raise sales tax by more than 5 points, depending on the state of the economy and administrative spending. To win support, even for the smaller figure, from members of the three-party ruling coalition, Mr Murayama promised to cut spending on the public administration. His government reiterated that pledge yesterday. It planned to produce by the end of March a list of state bodies due to be slimmed, merged or closed, said Mr Masahiko Komura, director general of the Economic Planning Agency. Consumer prices in Tokyo, an early indicator of nationwide inflation, rose 1.1 per cent in November from the same month a year ago. However, most of that was caused by a freak rise in food prices. Taking out food, the core Tokyo inflation rate was a mere 0.5 per cent year-on-year, down 0.1 per cent on October, confirming inflation continues to be almost non-existent. One reason for this is the pressure on prices from bargain-conscious consumers, shown yesterday by a 2.6 per cent year-on-year fall in department store sales in October, the 32nd consecutive month of decline. Business, meanwhile, is expanding fast at discount supermarkets, opening up at a rate of 80 per month nationwide.</p>

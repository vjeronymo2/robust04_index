			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael Bond: "The Green Watchdog With No Bite"] </F>   [Text] It was hailed by enthusiastic environmentalists as a  sort of "Green police force." Instead, the European Environment  Agency, based in Green-conscious Denmark, has materialised as a  toothless watchdog.    Copenhagen has finally been designated the Agency's  permanent  home after three years of bickering. But it faces an uphill  struggle, thanks to widespread disillusionment over its role.    Its lack of real bite is becoming increasingly embarrassing  as some individual states seek to reclaim responsibility for  Green issues from Brussels. That is a dramatic change from the  idealistic days of 1989, when the idea of the Agency was first  put forward. Then, environmentalists saw it as a tough  enforcement agency, knocking into line any state dragging its  feet on Brussels's environmental rules.    At the very least, it was hoped, it would pull together the  disparate strands of EU environmental legislation and  co-ordinate policy.    Today, with those hopes shattered, it is clear that for the  first couple of years at least, the Agency will be little more  than a monitoring centre. It will have virtually no powers to  police Green laws, and it will play no part in framing European  environmental policies.    According to Phillip Bourdeau, director of the task force  which has set up the Agency, its main task will be to provide a  continuous assessment of Europe's environment -- gathering  statistics on issues like air pollution and the quality of river  water -- and report to the Brussels environment division and  European Parliament.    Bourdeau says it will be useful in monitoring how effective  the directives are -- although it will rely on member states to  provide the necessary statistics.    Environmental groups claim that the toothless agency  reflects  a growing trend in the European Commission to allow member  states more flexibility in meeting environmental standards.  They accuse Brussels of "going soft" on the environment. Many  in the governments of Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands  agree. A recent accord on the Commission's packaging directive  -- which considerably reduces targets on the recycling of  household waste from those in the original proposal -- was  strongly opposed by these countries. Hans Alders, the Dutch  environment minister, claimed the directive had been so weakened  it had "nothing to do with the environment."    Alders had already complained that there was a "malaise in  environmental policy-making" in the European Union [EU]. He  said: "Within the last year the Council of Ministers has made  virtually no important environmental decisions."    Ironically, the Maastricht Treaty gave the Union  considerable  new powers over the environment, leading many to believe that  the environment would become one of the Union's most important  areas for action.    Indeed, two weeks after the Maastricht Treaty came into  force, Yiannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, said:  "An enormous amount still remains to be done if we are not to be  accused by our children and grandchildren of handing down a more  polluted environment than the one we inherited." Two months  later, it is clear that the Commission is prepared to sacrifice  environment for subsidiarity. In the face of considerable  pressure fron Britain and France, Brussels officials have  already announced that drinking and bathing water directives are  to be replaced by framework directives.    Both London and Paris have complained that the Commission's  tough environmental stance was proving politically disastrous  for governments at home. France's water companies predicted  that prices would have to double in ten years to meet EU  standards.    The environment is fast becoming Europe's newest political  battleground. The Dutch government is insisting that the wider  use of subsidiarity must be accompanied by increased monitoring  of how member states use their new-found freedom.    Giving the European Environment Agency more power would help  to redress the balance. Victoria Gonzalez of the World Wide  Fund for Nature in Brussels, said: "We think the Commission is  unlikely to grant it much power at all. But the agency would  still make some sort of impact if all it did was provide good,  detailed information on the environment."</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Council reforms block Pounds 36m order for trains THE impending reform of local government in Scotland is blocking a Pounds 36m order for new trains because the council that wants to place the order is due to be abolished. Strathclyde Regional Council has also found that Treasury guidelines on leasing appear to make it impractical for the deal to be saved by a government guarantee. The council, which runs the Strathclyde passenger transport executive that covers the greater Glasgow area, wants to obtain 21 diesel multiple units from Hunslett TPL of Leeds. Because of Scottish Office reductions in the council's capital borrowing consent, it decided to obtain them through an operating lease. It discussed terms with Lombard North Central, a leasing subsidiary of National Westminster Bank. But after Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, announced in July that Strathclyde was to be broken up into 10 new councils in 1996, the bank decided there was inadequate security for the deal. Strathclyde said the bank was concerned that transfer arrangements involving a joint committee of the new councils might be less reliable than the region. After legal advice the bank concluded that the deal could be open to a successful legal challenge from one of the new councils. Lombard suggested that Strathclyde ask the government to act as guarantor of the deal. But the council found that if the risk were underwritten with public money it would breach Treasury guidelines on operating leases, and would have to be considered a financial lease. The full capitalised value of the lease would then have to come from the council's capital borrowing consent, thereby defeating the object of leasing. Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of Strathclyde's transport committee, said yesterday that, after long discussions with Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, he had 'to concede that our hoped-for leasing deal may not now happen'. The council fears it may receive a claim from Hunslett, which is retaining staff in anticipation of the order being confirmed. Yesterday Mr Freeman, who was in Glasgow, said he was sure the problem could be solved. He thought other assurances could be provided by the government to meet the problem of the lenders. Mr Waugh is to meet Mr Freeman and Mr Lang in London next week to try to resolve the issue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian police will not permit armed Jews  to enter the ancient synagogue in Jericho. This was stated  today by the Palestinian police commander during a visit to the  site. The supreme coordinating committee on security affairs  visited Jericho today to get a first-hand impression of the  problems at the ancient Shalom 'Al Yisra'el synagogue. Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports:    [Begin recording] [Amir] The Palestinian police have so far  been unsuccessful in carrying out their duties in Jericho and  the Gaza Strip. This was reported this evening by security  sources. The sources assert that the situation is far more  serious in the Gaza Strip. In addition to the security  problems, the area is also in the midst of a crime wave with the  victims being the Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and Israeli  citizens inside the Green Line. The situation is far from  satisfactory in Jericho either. The supreme coordinating  committee on security affairs headed by Brigadier General  Yom-Tov Sami' and General Ziyad al-Atrash held a meeting at the  coordinating committee offices near the entrance to Jericho.  They were accompanied by the commander in chief of the  Palestinian police, Nasr Yusuf, who, speaking near the ancient  synagogue in Jericho, said that his men would not permit armed  Jews to enter the synagogue because according to the Cairo  agreement the Palestinians were responsible for security in the  vicinity of the synagogue.    The Cairo agreement does not permit armed people to visit  the  area. We are responsible for security in this area, Nasr Yusuf  stressed. We will protect anyone visiting this place, he said.  While Nasr Yusuf was speaking, armed yeshiva students were  inside the synagogue. The Palestinian police commander was  apparently expressing his opinion on the matter and it will be  brought up for discussion before the coordinating committee on  security affairs.    It should be noted that since the entry of the Palestinian  police force into Jericho on 13 May, several disagreements have  arisen between them and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  representatives on the coordinating committee with regard to the  routes followed by the joint patrols and the interpretation of  the Cairo agreement with regard to responsibility for the  ancient synagogue. Joint patrols have deviated from their  scheduled routes. Stationary patrols, which were meant to  intervene only in specially defined cases, drove up to the gates  of Jewish settlements such as Elisha' and Na'ama. Jordan Valley  settlers have complained that since the inception of Palestinian  Autonomy there has been a wave of thefts of agricultural  equipment and produce, a mini-tractor, and even an Uzi  submachine gun was stolen from the home of a resident of Tomer.  Palestinian Police Commander Nasr Yusuf appealed to the  residents of the Jericho autonomous area and asked them to help  the Palestinian policemen to uphold law and order now that the  Israeli occupation has ended forever. [end recording]    [In a similar report on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at  1505 GMT on 19 May, settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman  reports that "the settlers have presented the police and the IDF  with a long list of complaints concerning thefts from their  settlements, especially from those adjacent to the Jericho area.  For example, four days ago, someone broke into a house in the  settlement of Tomer, stole the owner's Uzi submachine gun, and  fled on a mini-tractor that had been parked nearby. The  settlers claim that an IDF jeep pursued the thief up to the  entrance to the village of al-'Awja'. Since this village is  situated inside the Palestinian autonomy, the IDF soldiers broke  off the chase at the village gates." The report notes that "the  IDF takes a grave view of this phenomena. The local commanders,  during a vociferous meeting two days ago, promised the settlers  that they would take action to resolve the problem."]</p>

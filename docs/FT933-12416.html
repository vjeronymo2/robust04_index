			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Talks on Nafta side-agreements TRADE ministers from the US, Canada and Mexico will meet in Washington next week to take final decisions on environmental and labour pacts to be attached to the North American free trade agreement. Canada's chief negotiator, Mr John Weekes, reported 'considerable progress' yesterday after a week-long meeting of officials from the three countries in Ottawa. A consolidated text with some remaining areas of disagreement is expected to be submitted to the ministerial meeting, which starts on Thursday. Nafta is due to be implemented on January 1, but the Clinton administration in the US has said the pact will not be submitted to Congress until the two side-agreements are finalised. The prospects of Nafta being put into force as scheduled have brightened markedly in recent weeks. The US administration is anxious to submit the entire package to Congress before the recess which starts on August 6. The administration is confident that congressional approval can proceed despite a legal wrangle over whether a full assessment is required of Nafta's environmental impact. A US court last month ruled that such an assessment is necessary, but the Justice Department has appealed against the ruling. Mr Weekes said that enforcement of the proposed environmental pact remained an issue, in particular Washington's demand for trade sanctions against offenders. Canada and Mexico consider the US demands to be an infringement on their sovereignty, and are concerned at the risk that environmental disputes may spur trade protectionism. Mr Weekes declined to predict the outcome of next week's meeting. But he said the negotiators tried to do some 'creative thinking' to facilitate the task of the ministers. Among the proposals floated recently has been a North American Environmental Fund, which would finance anti-pollution projects and clean-ups, especially along the US-Mexico border.</p>

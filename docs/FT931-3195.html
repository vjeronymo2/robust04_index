			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Easing of ACT exceeds hopes THE chancellor's proposals to ease the burden of unrelieved advance corporation tax on companies went further than industrialists had dared hope. Mr Roger Wood, head of the 100 Group of Finance Directors working party on surplus ACT, said: 'I am delighted with what the chancellor appears to be offering. It makes the UK a more attractive location for international companies both UK- and foreign-owned.' ACT is paid by companies on dividends and can be offset against UK corporation tax. However, many companies do not pay sufficient UK corporation tax to offset fully the ACT, meaning that they end up paying more tax. Many had expected that something would be done to help foreign-owned multi-nationals which were being tempted to move their headquarters out of the UK because of the tax regime. Mr Lamont recognised this problem with the promised to establish a special tax regime for such companies from 1994-95. But his second proposal, to class dividends paid out of overseas profits as a 'foreign income dividend' came as welcome news to those companies which earn substantial proportions of their profits from abroad. Many do not pay enough UK corporation tax to offset the whole of their ACT liability. The scheme is expected to reduce the annual build up of ACT by Pounds 250m. Companies said they wanted to examine the consultative document which the government issued before commenting in detail. However, BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance group which made about 85 per cent of its 1992 profits overseas, said yesterday it welcomed the consultative process. Mr David Allvey, finance director, said 'at least he's picked up the baton and he's going to run with it'. Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, Britain's biggest textiles company, which makes 70 per cent of its profits overseas, said: 'It is a positive recognition of the trap of double taxation.' Companies said the foreign income dividends would not entitle non-tax paying shareholders, such as pension funds, to a tax credit. They said such shareholders may demand higher dividends or may sell shares in companies with large overseas profits. The move to cut the rate of ACT from 25 to 20 per cent was also welcomed, as it will give a cash flow benefit to companies estimated by the chancellor at Pounds 2bn over the next two years.</p>

The PBGC is now adopting these amendments as a final rule and also is amending its distress termination regulation in order to give the Executive Director the authority to grant relief similar to that given in the interim rule for standard terminations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> April 14, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Harold J.

The interim rule provided that, when the President of the United States declares, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121, 5122(2), 5141(b)), that a major disaster (such as the 1993 flood disaster in the midwestern United States) exists, the PBGC's Executive Director (or his or her designee) may grant relief from certain regulatory deadlines by which persons are to submit filings to the PBGC or take other actions. The PBGC received no comments and is adopting the interim rule as a final rule without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before the interim rule was published, &sect;&sect;2606.33 and 2606.53 of the PBGC's administrative review regulation (29 CFR part 2606) provided deadlines for filing a request for reconsideration or appeal of an initial determination, and &sect;2606.4 provided for extensions of those deadlines for good cause shown and only if requested in writing by the applicable filing deadline. The PBGC concluded that, when a major disaster like the 1993 midwestern flood is declared, the above deadlines do not serve the agency's objective of making timely review available to aggrieved persons. As amended, &sect;2606.4 provides that the deadlines for filing a request for reconsideration or appeal may be extended by the Executive Director (or his or her designee) when a major disaster is declared. The extension may be for a period of up to 180 days and applies to any aggrieved person who resides in, or whose principal place of business is within, a designated disaster area, or with respect to whom the office of the service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to file the request for reconsideration or appeal is within a designated disaster area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, as amended &sect;&sect;2617.25 and 2617.28 of the PBGC's standard termination regulation (29 CFR part 2617) include an exception to the deadlines (1) for filing the standard termination notice with the PBGC (&sect;&sect;2617.3(b)(2) and 2617.25(a)) and, consequently, for issuing notices of plan benefits to participants and beneficiaries (&sect;&sect;2617.3(b)(3) and 2617.23(a)) and (2) for completing the distribution of plan assets (&sect;2617.28(a), (e), and (f)). As in the administrative review regulation, the Executive Director (or his or her designee) may extend these deadlines for a period of up to 180 days when a major disaster is declared. The extension applies to plan terminations with respect to which the principal place of business of the contributing sponsor or the plan administrator, or the office of the service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to issue the notices of plan benefits or file the standard termination notice, or to complete the distribution of plan assets (as applicable), is within a designated disaster area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

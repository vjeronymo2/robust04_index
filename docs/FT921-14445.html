			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Accountancy Column: Institute declares war on its growing deficit DEEP IN the recesses of Moorgate Place in London, home of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, there is a metaphorical sound of clanking. Council members are clambering into suits of armour as they prepare for battle. After six years of timidity, the decision-makers are gearing up for a spring offensive against the critics in their own ranks. They say they need a substantial rise in subscriptions to preserve and expand their activities. As news has trickled out from the council's annual 'conference' in Birmingham last weekend, it emerged that there had been unanimous approval for an increase. Proposals to go before members at their special meeting in June suggest rises in all fees charged for 1993 except those for retired members. The principal changes are a Pounds 15 rise in the annual subscription to Pounds 115 for UK and other EC members of more than five years' standing, with further rises of 12.5 per cent above inflation for the following two years; an increase in practising certificate fees from Pounds 36 to Pounds 50, with similar rises over the next two years; and a jump in the admission and re-admission fees from Pounds 178 to Pounds 285 from the beginning of next year, and to Pounds 400 from the start of 1994. 'The institute really cannot continue to have annual deficits,' Mr Ian McNeil, the president, warned in a statement on Monday. 'Without substantially increased funding, the only alternatives would be to cut essential services to members and to reduce our activities.' Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive, said on Monday that the institute is likely to reveal a deficit of Pounds 200,000 for the year to December 31 1991 when audited figures are released in March, and projected a deficit of Pounds 500,000 for 1992. That comes on top of a deficit for 1990 of Pounds 633,000. It might seem ironic that the professional association for chartered accountants was not able to balance its books in 1990, and does not anticipate doing so for the following two financial years. But Mr Colquhoun has a series of responses that are by now well-oiled. 'There is nothing unique in our financial problems,' he says. 'At their root is the fact that our rates are very low in real terms. The Chartered Accountancy qualification offers a cachet with considerable advantages, for a price comparable to membership of a golf club.' Other accountancy bodies in the UK and abroad are struggling with similar deficits, he argues. So are the equivalent bodies in other professions, which often charge more (Pounds 380 last year for the Law Society). Members of the Scottish and Irish accountancy institutes pay more than their English and Welsh counterparts. While revenues have remained static, the recession has started hurting the commercial activities of the institute, particularly the publications division. Money from recruitment adverts has declined sharply, for instance, and Mr Colquhoun predicts it will not pick up again until well into 1993. At the same time, operating costs have continued to rise. ICAEW's obligations to support stronger financial reporting standards (such as its contribution to the Accounting Standards Board) and its international commitments have stretched existing budgets. 'We can axe people or services but there is an impact on what is provided,' he says. 'We cannot have a situation of continuing deficits. More discretionary activities of direct benefit to our members may be squeezed out. But we must continue to properly fund our public interest commitments.' The council has held back from proposing a large increase in subscriptions since 1985, when it was defeated by just 0.2 per cent in a vote of all members. It estimates that the decision cost it Pounds 6.4m in foregone revenue up till the end of last year. Now they are ready for a new fight. 'I believe we have a much better campaign this time,' says Mr Colquhoun. In 1985, he says there was hardly any argument put forward by the council for a substantial rise. Last autumn, by contrast, the case was put forcefully in an eight-page discussion paper sent to members called 'Financing the Institute'. The result has been one of the largest mailbags the ICAEW has ever received on an issue. While those who write are not a representative sample, officials draw comfort from the fact that about half the correspondents have supported the council. Nevertheless, there are serious concerns voiced by members about the need for an increase, or wider doubts about the direction of the institute and the services it provides that have been stoked by the suggestion of bigger subscriptions. One view is that the ICAEW neglects parts of its constituency, pandering to the larger accountancy firms while offering relatively little to smaller practitioners or those outside practice. Others suggest that with an increasing range of powerful independent bodies regulating aspects of the profession - such as the Accounting Standards Board and the Audit Practices Board - its importance is waning. A meeting at the institute last year drew a parallel with the medical profession, which has two separate bodies: the General Medical Council, which regulates the profession and disciplines its members, and the British Medical Association, which represents doctors' own professional interests. The ICAEW, some suggest, might have to move in that direction to survive. There are more direct concerns about costs relating to the subscription increase as well. The ICAEW currently employs about 460 staff, a significant number by any standards and an increase on last year, although arguably low as a proportion of all members. External consultants have scrutinised different departments for efficiency and have concluded, the ICAEW says, that each offers value for money and some are significantly under-resourced. The corollary, of course, is that they have failed to identify areas for savings. How the fees are structured also raises questions. The larger firms and businesses often pay the annual subscriptions of members they employ, while others, including many sole practitioners, have to pay the fees from their own pockets. The ICAEW sees no way of being able to distinguish different fee levels for the two approaches. 'At least they have given us a lot of information on the reasons for the increases this time,' says Mrs Jane Gillbe, a sole practitioner from Surrey. 'But I think they have spent too much on glossy brochures to explain it. I can sympathise with them, but they should not have let themselves get into such a mess. I don't believe I should have to pay the increase.' She decided not to incur additional fees by registering as an auditor last year. But she does use the institute's library, and finds the services provided by its tax faculty useful. In a sense, she is trapped. While she could potentially practice as a tax consultant without being registered as a chartered accountant, she says she will not resign. 'I think my clients respect the chartered accountancy qualification and the ethics that go with it.'</p>

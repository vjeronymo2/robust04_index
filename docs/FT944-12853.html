			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / 'Solid growth' forecast Mr Lawrence Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said at the weekend that Friday's report on US gross domestic product provides 'more evidence of solid economic growth' which could last for another 'few quarters,' AP-DJ reports from Detroit. He told reporters before addressing a conference on housing: 'I don't see anything in my crystal ball to suggest a slowdown.' Data released on Friday showed that GDP rose 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, which MrLindsey noted was a faster rise than most people had expected.</p>

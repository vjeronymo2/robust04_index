			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIMES BY JUVENILES  </P> <P> The story about an elderly hiker being shot by juveniles reminds me of a scene  from "The Clockwork Orange" where an elderly man is being attacked by young  thugs. Have we finally come to that?  </P> <P> Juveniles are committing more and more violent crimes, partly because they know  that the punishment, if any, will be light. Our juvenile criminal laws are a  travesty! No wonder people have very little regard for the law.  </P> <P> I will be watching closely the resolution of the above-mentioned incident.  </P> <P> JASON THORNBURY  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

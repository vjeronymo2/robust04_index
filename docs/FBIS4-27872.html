			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, the government held a public-national  security affairs-related ministers' meeting on North Korea's  nuclear development. It decided to take all necessary  countermeasures at home and abroad based on a firm policy to  prevent by all means North Korea's nuclear development situation  from causing public uncertainty or threatening the stability of  the people's livelihood.    At today's meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok, the government analyzed North Korea's recent responses  and military movements, checked our Armed Forces' preparedness  and the government's readiness for an emergency, and discussed  ways to consolidate a pangovernmental preparedness for national  security by unifying the national view.    At today's meeting, the government decided to take all  necessary countermeasures at home and abroad to prevent the  situation which might cause public uncertainty or threaten the  stability of people's livelihood in the midst of the rapidly  developing situation, including the international community's  move toward imposing sanctions against North Korea.    The government will also continue to maintain close  cooperation with the United States for establishing a quick  military preparedness in the event of an emergency, while  increasing an all-time capability of gathering information by  operating at full capacity the national security-related  permanent consultative system between the ROK and the United  States. In the meantime, the government will concentrate on  making diplomatic efforts to see our position accomplished in  the international community based on the successes of President  Kim Yong-sam's diplomacy through his visits.    At the same time, the government will focus on establishing  in-country public security by strongly dealing with, and taking  legal measures against, those pro-communist forces that  sympathize with or praise North Korea's allegations as seen at  the ceremony launching the activities of the Korean Federation  of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon].</p>

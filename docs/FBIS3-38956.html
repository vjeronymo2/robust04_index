Ambassadors from the 16 North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  (NATO) states are meeting in Brussels to discuss measures  against Serbs, following their mortar attack in Sarajevo last  week.    Speaking to reporters, Cetin said a plan drawn by the United  States and France is well below Turkey's expectations adding it  has repeatedly called for a "direct air operation without any  waiting period."    Under the proposal, Serb artillery would have to be pulled  back at least 20 km (12 miles) from Sarajevo and all heavy  weapons belonging to Serbs and Muslims in the area would then  have to be handed over to the United Nations.    The United States and France have proposed a deadline of  between seven and 10 days for besieging Serb forces to withdraw.    Failure to comply would mean NATO air strikes.    Cetin said if a resolution is taken without the backing of a  power to enforce it, it has no meaning, and stressed that  sanctioning measures must absolutely be applied if the  resolution is not followed.    He added that further delays should be prevented,  underlining  the fact that if these sanctions are not applied, further  violence will start.    Sixty eight helpless civilians were massacred and 200  wounded  when Serbian mortar turned a market place in central Sarajevo  into a pool of blood.</p>

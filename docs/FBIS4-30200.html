			<p>BFN     [Text] Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian  received Hainan Provincial Deputy Governor Chen Suhou and his  agricultural economic observation delegation from at Government  House at 0900 on 20 June. The delegation is here at the  invitation of the Hainanese Association of Thailand. Deputy  Prime Minister Bunchu, who visited Hainan eight years ago,  warmly welcomed Chen Suhou and his delegation. He hoped that  the delegation will achieve complete success in its observation  trip.    Bunchu said: I visited Hainan in 1986. Hainan was rather  backward at that time. There have been a lot of changes in  Hainan during recent years, however, such as in the energy,  telecommunications, and comunications sectors. Regarding  agriculture, Bunchu said that Hainan, like Thailand, is rich in  agricultural resources. Agricultural development also needs  good planning. He hoped that the delegation will visit  agriculture processing plants and agricultural export-oriented  businesses. Bunchu also said that the Thai Government will  consider joint ventures if the delegation makes any offers. Chen  Suhou extended his gratitude for the warm reception.    At the friendly atmosphere, Chief Delegate Chen Suhou said  that investment conditions in Hainan had improved a lot. The  Sanya Fenghuang International Airport will be opened to air  traffic on 1 July. The expressway from Haikou to Sanya will be  completely open at the end of the year. All this will  facilitate economic cooperation between Hainan and Thailand.  Hainan Province, which has 200 square li of sea area, has  favorable conditions for aquaculture, tropical crops, mining,  and tourism. Hainan is now developing large-scale industry. It  also pays attention to marine, economic, tourism, and  agricultural development. Thai businessmen are welcome to enter  joint investment projects in Hainan. Also present at the  meeting were Chinese Ambassador to Thailand Jin Guihua and vice  chairmen of the Hainanese Association of Thailand, Feng Yude, Fu  Zhisen, and Li Changchun.</p>

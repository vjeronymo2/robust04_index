			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / DTI 'ignored' military warnings on Iraq SENIOR MILITARY advisers warned that the export of machine tools by British exporters was contributing to a big build-up of Iraq's defence capability, but had their advice ignored by the Department of Trade and Industry and other government officials, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday. Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Glazebrook, a retired army officer who was a member of a Ministry of Defence working group that was supposed to vet export licences to Iraq, said that concern about British exports had deepened substantially after February 1989. By then the group had been told of a secret government decision to relax the rules banning the sale of defence-related equipment to Iraq - which was withheld from parliament. According to Lt-Col Glazebrook this led in to sensitive export licences being allowed to accumulate and then to be approved virtually without restrictions by the DTI, which overruled the advice of some MoD officials. Lt-Col Glazebrook said his concern and that of other military advisers in the MoD working group 'crystallised' in June 1989 after the group suspected that a number of machine-tool export licence applications had military uses. 'The more applications were uncovered the more I realised that this was a can of worms and that there really was a lot happening,' Lt-Col Glazebrook said. This concern was the subject of a detailed memorandum written by Lt- Col Glazebrook that was among the documents the government tried to suppress 'in the national interest' during the trial of three former directors of Matrix-Churchill, the Coventry-based machine tools manufacturer. The trial collapsed before the document titled 'British Assistance to the Emerging Iraqi Arms Industry' was used in court. But yesterday it was read virtually in full by the counsel for the inquiry, Miss Presley Baxendale QC, as an important part of the evidence Lord Justice Scott is accumulating about the extent to which the government may have breached its own original guidelines governing defence exports to Iraq. The Scott inquiry team has set itself the task of re-examining the legitimacy of ministers' use of public-interest certificates to restrict access to information about certain government activities. Lt-Col Glazebrook said in his evidence that his views were not shared by some Ministry of Defence officials who wanted to promote UK defence exports. The DTI also backed the companies, warning Lt-Col Glazebrook that the government would risk being sued in court if certain licence applications were revoked. The hearing continues today.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Heseltine calls for unity in accounting Accountants should agree to merge their different professional bodies, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told accountants this week. In a speech to the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, Mr Heseltine said: 'The more rationalised and integrated the accountancy profession becomes the more its voice will be heard.' There are six chartered accountancy bodies as well as several other institutes and associations in related subjects, which have failed to merge in spite of several attempts. The six primary bodies are engaged in another round of discussions about possible mergers, and are expected to make an announcement on the subject later this month. Mr Heseltine, who failed his accountancy examinations, also described himself during the speech as 'an unqualified success' since leaving the profession. He said accountants had a big contribution to make in fostering a successful and competitive British economy but would do it much better if they were integrated.</p>

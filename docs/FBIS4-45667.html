			<p>BFN     [Text] In July 1991, polluted site reclamation experts  joined forces to form the Mecklenburg-Western Pomeranian  Syndicate for Surveying and Reclaiming Polluted Military and  Civilian Sites, MIGEMA for short. This nonprofit association  has set itself the task of pooling the know-how available to  date, promoting the rapid development of processes and  equipment, and making a substantial contribution to the  conservation and enhancement of the environment in the Land of  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.    The first edition of the MIGEMA manual, which provides an  overview of the well over 300 members (as of the beginning of  1992), came out in 1992.    This informative reference work can be obtained from the  following address: MIGEMA, Carl-Hopp-Str. 4a, 18069 Rostock,  tel. 0381/813-490, fax 0381/813-413.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / The Property Market: Warsaw: Paris prices, Albanian standards International companies seeking office space in Warsaw beware. The Polish capital's commercial property market has been characterised as one with Paris prices, Albanian standards and Tokyo's lack of space. Indeed, in a league table of European centres with the highest offices rents, both Warsaw and Czechoslovakia's capital Prague surprisingly figure in the top five. Prime rents in both cities are running at between Pounds 35 to Pounds 40 a sq ft - easily a match for Paris or a very depressed City of London property market. The reason for these unexpectedly high rents is that there are too few buildings being chased by too many tenants. Western companies wanting to open representative offices in Warsaw, to take advantage of the liberalisation of the Polish economy, have struggled to find appropriate accommodation. There are currently only two office schemes under construction in Warsaw's city centre. One is an 800,000 sq ft office complex being developed by Golub Epstein Partnership of the US, National Bank of Poland and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. The project will cost Dollars 120m. The land for the project was provided by National Bank of Poland which will eventually take a third of the space. EBRD has provided Dollars 65.6m of loan finance and Dollars 3m of equity, representing 12 per cent of the total equity of the joint venture. The second large development is a 170,000 sq ft office and shop complex by Ibau, an Austrian developer. Presently, there are no other buildings available which would provide a stand-alone corporate headquarters. Coca Cola, one of many western companies which have opened offices in Warsaw, is looking for a site to develop its own building. The drinks company currently occupies a floor in the Palace of Culture and Science, a massive Stalinesque monument which is as impressive outside as it is tawdry inside. Lifts are slow and old, the large corridors are drab and the viewing platform at the top, providing one of the best views of Warsaw, is spattered with graffiti. From this vantage point it is possible to identify several large sites where developments are planned by international investors but which have still to get under way. These include a 150,000 sq metre hotel, office and retail centre planned by CA Real Estate of Sweden. Gleeds, a firm of British chartered surveyors which has established offices in Warsaw (and in Prague), says German Austrian, US, Swedish and French companies have been among the most active foreign contractors and developers in the local market. The British, he says, have been less aggressive. One exception is Trusthouse Forte, the UK hotel group, which is building a five-star 208-room luxury hotel in Warsaw. Gleeds, which operates out of offices in the Palace of Culture and Science (it pays rent monthly in a mix of D-Marks and US dollars), says the slow rate of development is disappointing though understandable. One reason is that Polish companies and individuals do not have the money to invest in building while international developers are hesitant to invest given Poland's unstable political and economic environment. Yet for those who are prepared to take the plunge the potential rewards  - based on present level of rents - are good. Construction costs, too, should be low so long as local companies can overcome a tradition of inefficiency and delay. Poland with a population of almost 40m is one of Europe's biggest countries. Excluding the former Soviet republics, only Italy, Germany, the UK and France have larger populations. Most international companies will want to have some kind of representative office to serve such a large market. Yet developers which are prepared to take the risk can face long delays and inefficiency as they try to find their way through a minefield of politics and bureaucracy in a community which has little experience of how to manage the planning, design, finances and physical construction of a large private sector development. Mr Phil Hudson, partner of East 8, the UK property consultants which advised the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development on its Warsaw investment, said: 'The biggest problem is finding the right person to make a decision. Those with authority often prevaricate. People who do not have authority are prepared to promise you the earth. Even when you think a decision has been made, it can be changed.' Western financial and engineering consultants operating in Warsaw say petty corruption is endemic, feeding off the confusion that greets Poles and international developers seeking to win approval for schemes. Identifying potential sites is not a problem. Old Warsaw was almost completely destroyed during the second world war. The rebuilt city contains large area of open space (cynics say it was to make it easier for the secret police to see what the local population was up to). These large open areas should provide opportunities for a new wave of development so long as finance and planning can be arranged. Determining ownership of potential sites is another headache. Families have the right to reclaim land and buildings acquired by the former communist regime. But finding out the identity of owners can be difficult. Gleeds tells of a young expatriate architect of Polish descent who claimed an estate in north Warsaw, previously owned by his grandfather. The young man had lost his father's birth certificate proving his relationship to the grandfather. The claim was eventually agreed but only after long delays and much research. Mr Roman Dziekonski, vice-president of the city authority, is trying to improve planning procedures. He wants to create a development zone within Warsaw similar to that in London's Docklands. This would offer planning and fiscal incentives and would also attempt to short-circuit red tape. Mr Dziekonski is regarded by international developers and consultants as one of the few bright lights in the central and local government firmament, following the resignation last month of Poland's finance minister, Mr Karol Lutkowski. Slow decision-making, political uncertainty and a series of highly publicised banking scandals have delayed several potential foreign investments. Up to 40 possible foreign purchases are in the pipeline in sectors such as car production, pulp and paper, cement and brewing. Recent investors include Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss/Swedish electrical group, which already employs more than 10,000 people in Poland and has taken a 10 per cent stake in the recently privatised Elektrim trading company. Unilever, the UK/Dutch consumer goods group, and Benckiser and Henkel, two German detergents manufacturers, have also separately acquired controlling interests in Polish companies. Companies looking for a presence in Poland will certainly want to buy or rent quality office space. Those looking for accommodation in Warsaw include a leading French manufacturer and a top British financial institution. Those like SmithKline Beecham, the British pharmaceuticals group, which already have small offices in Warsaw, are looking for larger accommodation. In any event, demand from potential occupiers is likely to stay firm; at the same time the risks for developers will remain high.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RENTAL GROWTH (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Retail    Office    Industrial    All Properties  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year to Jan 92        -1.1      -9.0          -1.3              -4.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Quarter to Jan 92      0.0      -3.2          -1.1              -1.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Month of Jan 92       -0.1      -0.8          -0.4              -0.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

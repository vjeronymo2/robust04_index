			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Sweden urged to stimulate its economy SWEDEN is suffering a depression that has been underestimated by the right-centre government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt and urgent measures are needed to stimulate economic growth, Sweden's main trade union organisation said yesterday. 'People still believe this is a business cycle downturn, but you don't lose 10 per cent of the nation's productive sector in a downturn. We have 14 per cent of the labour force unemployed. You have to go back to the 1930s to find such figures,' said Mr Dan Andersson, an economist at LO, the confederation of blue-collar unions. The LO said in its latest report on the economy it expected a 3 per cent decline in gross national product this year, the third consecutive year of negative growth. It said 500,000 people had lost their jobs since 1990 and employment was at it lowest level for 20 years. 'Depression in the Swedish economy is now a fact,' the report said. LO figures concur with government estimates showing the decline in GNP and industrial production ended in the middle of this year, leading to official forecasts of a return to modest growth in 1994. It acknowledged the yawning gap in the public finances - the budget deficit is set to rise to 15 per cent of GNP next year - cramped room for manoeuvre. But it insisted real recovery would not occur without a government-led stimulus to break a pattern of high savings and encourage consumption and investment instead. The LO called for a further lowering of interest rates and a radical cut in the 25 per cent standard rate of value added tax. It also said the government should foster public confidence in the economy by bolstering welfare services threatened with cuts, such as state pensions.</p>

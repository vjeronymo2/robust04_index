[Khalid] The summit itself is an important event. It  reaffirms Syria's role in achieving a political settlement after  the U.S. Administration tried to marginalize this role,  especially after the signing of the Oslo agreement, and tried to  show that a settlement could be conducted according to U.S.  plans.    The events reaffirmed Syria's importance in conducting a  political settlement. Moreover, the summit affirmed basic  principles since the aim is to achieve a comprehensive  settlement. The U.S. Administration reiterated, through Clinton,  its commitment to a comprehensive peace based on Resolutions 242  and 338, which stipulate Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab  territories occupied since 1967, and on Resolution 425, which  stipulates Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, as well as  the land-for-peace principle. These bases were violated when  the Oslo agreement was signed and through the statements  delivered at the signing ceremony. Therefore, we considered the  reaffirmation of these bases as something important.    Despite the positive aspect of this summit, we, as a  democratic front, were hoping that the Syrian side would address  the Palestinian dimension of the conflict and of its solution.  We were also hoping that a solution would be based on the  national legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This was  absent during the Syrian-U.S. summit.    [Al-Khatib] Some say that you adopted this stand in  accordance with the political, geographical, and leadership  stand in Syria. How do you respond to this, especially since the  issue of the 10 opposition factions was on the agenda of the  summit between the two presidents?    [Khalid] We are always asked these questions and we have  responded to them in the past. Our policy, as a democratic  front, is not governed by the factor of geographic location in  this country or that. Our standard is to adhere to the higher  national interest of the Palestinian people. The DFLP has never  submitted to anyone. We were often involved in political and  non-political differences with some Arab countries, especially  Syria, concerning Palestinian decisionmaking. This was in the  1970s and 1980s, particularly when there was a rift in the PLO  ranks and we were centered in Damascus. At the time, we did not  consider the geographic dimension in making our decisions, but  we basically considered the interest of the Palestinian people  and we frankly announced our stand toward the Syrian policy.    In any case, the summit is not a magic key for a political  settlement. This summit reaffirmed bases which could be a key  toward progress on the various negotiating tracks, including the  Syrian-Israeli track. The Israeli statements after the summit  confirm that negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are not  easy, not to mention that the Israeli lobby in the United States  is exercising pressure to diminish the weight of U.S.  affirmations expressed by President Clinton. Therefore, we say  that fears about how this summit will affect Syria's relations  with the Syrian-based opposition forces are highly exaggerated.  We are not at all worried about this summit and its results.    [Al-Khatib] What are the requisites for achieving progress  on the Syrian-Israeli track with relation to the Palestinian  opposition forces? And why don't you practice your opposition  from within the future Palestinian authority?    [Khalid] Our experience with Syria is long. We and our  Syrian brothers learned lessons from this experience. In the  past, Syria closed down the DFLP offices between 1983 and 1988  on the day leader Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir] was martyred.  Despite this, the DFLP remained unshaken and did not retreat.  The closing of its offices did not affect its weight among the  ranks of our Palestinian people. On the contrary, the DFLP's  effectiveness and respect increased among our Palestinian people.    We in the DFLP will continue to be an independent force that  does not submit to anyone. Even if we assume that Syria is  doing what you are assuming, we are convinced that this will not  affect our stand, role, and weight. This also applies to our  comrades in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  and the Hamas movement. Whoever has an entrenched and deep  rooted presence within the ranks of his people does not take  such calculations into account.    As for the second part of your question, we will not take  part in elections for the future self-rule agencies because the  agencies that will emanate from these elections will have only  one mission; that is, political responsibility toward the  agreement reached in Oslo. The Oslo agreement is receiving  opposition because it closed the doors to our people's right to  return, to self-determination, and to establishing an  independent state. Moreover, this agreement only seeks to turn  the occupied territories into protected areas under Israeli  control. However, we will definitely wage our political battles  with those who signed this agreement. We will do so through  wide participation in all the self-rule authorities that are of  a popular nature, such as student, cultural, and professional  unions as well as chambers of commerce, municipal and village  councils, and clubs. We will go through with these elections in  order to create a state of double authority between the  administrative self-rule agencies and institutions and bodies  that emerge from elections that have nothing to do with  implementing the Oslo agreement. We will continue our struggle  on the ground to prevent actual implementation of this agreement.    [Al-Khalid] What do you think about the PLO's recent call to  restore dialogue and coordination with Syria after the Geneva  summit?    [Khalid] The PLO leadership behaved unilaterally when it  held  secret negotiations in Oslo behind the backs of the Palestinian  people, of their legitimate institutions and national factions,  and of the Arab parties to the negotiations. In practice, the  Oslo agreement was a form of separate political settlement.  This leadership is responsible for the Arab reactions, for  striking at Arab coordination, and for holding secret  negotiations. As for now, we do not know on which common  denominators coordination can be held. We call for canceling  the Oslo agreement and returning to national constants. If this  happens, then it is natural to call on the Arab countries,  especially Syria, to return to coordination with the Palestinian  side in order to reach a comprehensive solution on all fronts.

"We feel quite satisfied, but not fully satisfied," the head  of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) told  reporters, following his four-day mission to Baghdad.    "In the chemical area we are not satisfied that Iraq has  given us full, detailed information necessary for us to be  definite that all these weapons have been taken away," Ekeus  said.    The Swedish UN official on Sunday ended a visit to Iraq  saying Baghdad and the United Nations still disagreed over  certain aspects of the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons  programmes, despite their determination to implement the  surveillance measures quickly.    Ekeus said Monday he was confident that all Iraq's  long-range  missiles had been destroyed, along with the production  facilities.    "We have the satisfactory feeling that most of the Iraqi  capabilities have now been destroyed and eliminated," Ekeus  said, referring to the dismantling of Iraqi weapons programmes  in line with the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire conditions.    In a joint statement issued in Baghdad Sunday, Ekeus and  Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz said both sides  "expressed their readiness to expedite the process of  establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of  goodwill."    They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic  Energy Agency to report to the UN Security Council "that, in  their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by  paragraph 22 of Resolution 687."    The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil  embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions  calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass  destruction.    UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four  days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990.    Ekeus was due to leave Kuwait for New York Monday, Kuwaiti  officials said.</p>

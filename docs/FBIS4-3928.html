			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The provincial meeting on the work of opening to  the outside world was held in Jinan on 25 April. Under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th  party congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, participants in this meeting conscientiously  summarized the province's opening up work since the commencement  of reform and opening up since 1992. In particular, they  learned from and used for reference the successful experiences  of fraternal provinces and municipalities, researched and drew  up the province's general pattern of opening up in the  foreseeable future, and defined the province's overall goal and  policy on developing the economy oriented to opening up in the  next step. Attending the meeting were provincial leading  comrades Jiang Chunyun, Zhao Zhihao, Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, Li  Zhen, and Lu Maozeng. Li Chunting presided over the meeting.    He said: This meeting, held by the provincial party  committee and the provincial government, is an important one  related to the province's overall economic situation and is a  major move adopted by the province to accelerate the development  of the economy oriented to opening up since the issuance of Deng  Xiaoping's speeches made during his south China trip in spring  of 1992 and since the convocation of the provincial meeting on  opening up. The purpose of this meeting is to again mobilize  the whole province to deepen reform and open even wider to the  outside world and to further emancipate the mind and seek unity  in understanding and action in order to push the province's  opening up towards the orientation of high level, high sphere,  and in-depth development.

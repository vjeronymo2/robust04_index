On the streets in the capital which are decorated with  various welcoming decorations, the workers from all walks of  life warmly welcomed the deputies. The deputies will attend the  conference with great pride in having made active contributions  to strengthening and developing our party and to accelerating  the revolution and construction by loyally upholding the  leadership of the great general [widaehan changgunnim] Kim  Chong-il and by enhancing functions and role of the party cells.    Following the arrival of deputies from Chagang Province,  North Hamgyong Province, Yanggang Province, and South Hwanghae  Province, all deputies throughout the country including North  Hwanghae Province, South Hamgyong Province, and South Pyongan  Province, arrived in Pyongyang on 25 March.    The Pyongyang Railway Station, which greeted the deputies of  the conference of cell secretaries of the whole party who are  the core of our party, was overwhelmed from the early morning  with an atmosphere of warm welcome.    A portrait of Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our  party and people, was respectfully placed in the railway  station. The slogans reading, "Long live the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song!" and "Long live the glorious Workers Party  of Korea!" were hung up.    Placards reading "We warmly welcome the attendants in the  conference of cell secretaries of the whole party!" and "Let us  loyally uphold the party's leadership!" were put up in the  railway station, and large-size propaganda pictures welcoming  the deputies of the conference were set up.    As the train arrived in the station with deputies aboard,  the  welcoming masses, waving bouquets and flowers, warmly welcomed  the participants in the conference of cell secretaries of the  whole country who will demonstrate the true shape of our party  which is firmly rallied behind the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with a sense of  loyalty and filial piety.    The officials concerned warmly greeted the deputies. The  deputies, who arrived in Pyongyang--the capital of the  revolution--were overflowing with the revolutionary passion to  glorify the conference of cell secretaries of the whole party,  which will be held splendidly in the great expectations and  interest of the people across the country, as a meeting of  loyalty, which will vigorously demonstrate the firm faith and  invincible will of the party's cell secretaries to tenaciously  defend and to further glorify the socialist cause--the party's  cause--without even a slight degree of wavering under any  complex situation.    At the Pyongyang Railway Station, reporter Kim Chun-kyo of  the Central Broadcasting Network met Comrades So Kwang-su and  Kil Chang-ho, deputies from South Pyongan Province who will  attend the conference of cell secretaries of the whole party.    [Begin reporter Kim recording] I warmly welcome you who have  arrived in Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution. Will you  speak a few words about your impression on arriving in  Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution?    [Begin Deputy So recording] I am indeed pleased to come to  Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution. From the moment of  boarding the train, my heart dashed toward Pyongyang where the  great leader and dear comrade leader are. As I am warmly  welcomed after arriving in Pyongyang as a deputy of the  conference of cell secretaries of the whole party, I am  overflowing with the pride in being the core of our glorious  party and a responsible figure for the basic party organization  [kichungdang chojik].    I cannot suppress deep emotion fraught with thanks to the  great General Kim Chong-il who provided us with a conference of  cell secretaries of the whole party, which is the first occasion  in history of our party, and who extended all benevolence and  love to us after calling us as deputies. [end So recording]    [Begin Deputy Kil recording] The cell secretaries of the  party in our South Pyongan Province who will attend the upcoming  conference rushed to Pyongyang with deep emotion for benevolence  of the great leader who called on women party members in  (Tangsan) and party members in Nagwon during the days of war and  led the party cell youth. The respected leader's lofty intention  and effort to strengthen and develop the party cell have been  brilliantly inherited by energetic activities of the great  General Kim Chong-il.    Even in the midst of a busy time, the dear comrade leader  personally read the letters sent from the cell members of the  Fifth Bureau of the Korean Central News Agency and from the  mining workers' cell in Toksong Mine, and sent reply letters to  them. Thus, he saw to it that all cells throughout the country  be firmly consolidated into that of loyalty. Even if the world  may change a thousand times, I will loudly sing the song of  faith, "Without You, There Is No Fatherland, With You, We Will  Win!" I will attend the conference with loyalty cherished by  our party cell members who trust and follow only the respected  general Kim Chong-il forever. [end Kil recording]    [Begin deputy So recording] Deeply cherishing the lofty  intentions of the great leader and the dear comrade leader who  made efforts to strengthen and develop the party cells, I will  actively contribute to glorifying the upcoming conference held  for the first time in our party's history as a historic  conference which will open a new turning point in carrying to  accomplishment the chuche socialist cause. [end So recording]    Thus, the deputies, who will attend a conference of cell  secretaries of the whole party, have arrived in Pyongyang, the  capital of the revolution.</p>

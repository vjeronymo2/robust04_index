			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNG UP ON THE HULK  </P> <P> Please let Bill Bixby know that I think retiring the Incredible Hulk is a  drastic mistake.  </P> <P> I for one have missed the program immensely. It is the Superman type of program  that everyone loves. It's good, clean, exciting entertainment, and I wish it  was a weekly program again. If not weekly, then maybe quarterly episodes.  Please advise Mr. Bixby of this, and maybe he can bring him back to life.  </P> <P> Sandra Lea, Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

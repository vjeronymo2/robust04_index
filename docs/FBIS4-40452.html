			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Feofanov: "Emergency Measures To Fight </F> Crime Could Turn Into Arbitrary Action by Authorities"]    [Text] In all probability the Russian Federation  president's Edict of 14 June "On Urgent Measures To Protect the  Population From Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of  Organized Crime" will get the approval of working people. For  some reason I think that, had the edict talked of shooting  gangsters on the spot without a trial or investigation, the  approval would have been even more hearty.    True, the following question will remain open: Is it always  the gangster who gets shot?    The state is entitled to take any number of strict measures  to protect its citizens and public order from crime. In the  United States they do not balk at sentencing minors to death.  But over there a judge will free the most hardened criminal if  the police violated the prescribed procedures when arresting  him: If they entered an apartment without a warrant, bugged a  telephone without authorization, or arrested and questioned him  without an attorney. They are well aware that justice consists  of procedures.    The president's edict does not correspond, to put it mildly,  very much to these principles and norms. The craftiness of this  act, equal in force to a law, is that it erodes the procedural  guarantees which at least nominally guarantee our rights and  freedoms.    We often hear and read that criminal proceedings have been  instituted in a case or against a specific person suspected of a  crime. Only after this are investigatory actions possible:  seizures, searches, the confiscation of documents, detention,  etc. Even justified suspicions must be procedurally recorded.  This gives a citizen a guarantee from arbitrary action by  administrative authority. By instituting criminal proceedings,  by officially making accusation, the authorities put a person  under the law's protection and give him the opportunity to  resort to judicial control. The president's edict overturns all  these guarantees. Of course, this is very convenient for the  administrative authorities. In fact, an investigation can go on  before criminal proceedings have been instituted. In the edict  clear requirements of a procedural nature have been replaced by  the empty words "by agreement with the prosecutor."    Yes, our business is to a considerable extent criminal; yes,  many businessmen are associated with gangland and other criminal  groupings. But there is also honest business. The edict hands  it over to the full arbitrariness of repressive organs, which  for some reason we call law-enforcement organs. Henceforth,  under a law-enforcement official's directive it will be possible  to violate a commercial secret, a secret regarding deposits, and  the privileged nature of banking and financial documents -- that  is, everything which forms the basis of business. But is there  confidence that the intrusion into business will be dictated by  the interests of the fight against crime and not by a bribe from  competing structures? Given the total corruptness of the  apparatus? And then...how will the market be affected? Because  it cannot get along with a repressive regime.    Section 3, Article 1 of the edict is particularly confusing.  It is worded with a fair dose of jesuitic craftiness. The crux  of the matter is that people suspected of crimes who are going  to be punished not under the criminal law but under this edict  can be immediately arrested (detained) for 30 days. In the  document the word "arrest" is neatly avoided: "a written  undertaking not to leave, personal recognizance, recognizance of  public associations, or a bond are not applicable." Of all the  measures to secure a defendant's appearance, prison for a month  is all that is left. Incidentally, the General Prosecutor's  Office has been instructed to establish "constant oversight of  the observance of legislation when this edict is being  implemented." I wonder how it will be possible to exercise this  oversight if one thing contradicts another? The document says  nothing about an attorney's participation in the "edict  procedure." Does it follow from this that his functions have  been completely excluded? If so preliminary investigators and  investigators are completely free to do as they please....    About 20 years ago the CPSU Central Committee, protecting  the  population from hooligans, also issued a directive authorizing  arrest on the spot; at that time we wrote, thrilled by the  authorities' decisiveness: "Let the ground burn under the feet  of criminals." Now this has been repeated word for word by our  capital's mayor. If we count back about 50-60 years we get to  other laws and edicts: "Ten years apiece for gleaning ears of  grain, into the dock for being late for work.    I repeat again. It is not the law's severity which is  terrible. It is the rejection of law that is terrible. Of  procedural law above all. Stalin's mass repressions began with  the simplification of the judicial procedure for certain  categories of cases, then trials were eliminated altogether,  being replaced by two-man tribunals, three-man tribunals, and  lists....    I am very frightened by the surge in gangland and any other  crime; it has indeed exceeded all bounds. Yet the most terrible  thing is legalized arbitrary action by the state. Here there  cannot be any protection for anyone. We have already  experienced this but we are trying to forget the experience, as  though people in our country have not been tried under edicts  which have supplanted laws, and under laws which have supplanted  justice. If a gangster can be taken away without a trial and  investigation today, they will surely come after an honest man  tomorrow. There are no exceptions to this rule.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (7): Currency crisis triggers losses / A look at the banking sector Greek banking profits will shrink this year because of a three-week currency crisis, triggered by the removal last May of all remaining exchange controls. The drachma's struggle to fend off devaluation also revealed the mutual dependence between the big state banks which dominate the banking market and the finance ministry. National Bank, the biggest state-owned bank, raised short-term interest rates above 70 per cent during the crisis to help protect the currency. One banker said: 'The fact that the finance ministry can use the big state banks as a policy tool meant the drachma could resist speculative attack. But it weakens the banking system.' Estimates for the banks' total losses from the currency crisis vary from Dr70bn to more than Dr100bn. Last year, net profits at Greece's top 10 banks rose by 14 per cent to Dr130bn. This year's projection has been revised downwards from 15 to about 8 per cent. 'The banking system as a whole lost money in the crisis because it couldn't pass on high interest costs and couldn't protect its funding base,' a Greek banker said. It was not just the state banks' willingness to raise interest rates to record levels that enabled the drachma to ride out the crisis unscathed. The small size of Greece's mortgage lending market made it possible to sustain such high rates over a longer period. Total mortgage loans, mainly handled by two specialist subsidiaries of National Bank, are estimated at less than Dr1,000bn. Consumer lending, mostly in the hands of small new private banks is also underdeveloped. The market received a boost a few weeks before the crisis, when the ceiling on consumer loans was raised to Dr8m, only to collapse when interest rates rose sharply. 'The small private banks did better when the currency was under attack because they have a drachma surplus. But mortgage and consumer lending suffered a real setback,' says Stathis Papageorgiou, managing director of Aspis Bank, a new private bank that specialises in mortgage lending. The central bank rewarded the banks for their part in defending the drachma by paying interest for six months on the interest-free portion of their compulsory reserve requirement. But the banks, which have big holdings of tax-free treasury bills, the main debt instrument, also benefited from a surge in interest rates on government paper in May and June, aimed at preventing a flight of capital. Interest rates have since dropped almost to pre-crisis levels. Nevertheless, the squeeze on lending continues, with many banks still reluctant to take on new borrowers or extend additional credit to existing clients. The tight relationship between the government and the big state banks, whose governors were directly appointed by the ruling socialists, accounts for the state banks' readiness to acquire extra government securities when requested. Thanks to their help, the finance ministry has avoided rescheduling part of the public debt. The big state banks agreed to underwrite about Dr600bn of Dr1,300bn needed last month to cover a hump in debt financing, in return for increased commissions. National Bank is being paid off for its role during the drachma crisis by becoming lead underwriter for future government bond issues, which could add more than Dr10bn to its 1994 earnings. 'Much of the banking system operates for the benefit of the government rather than the private borrower,' says one local analyst. While the state banks control 73 per cent of total deposits, they account for only 60 per cent of lending. By contrast, the private banks control just 16.5 per cent of deposits but cover 18.4 per cent of lending. The state banks' role in lending is in fact much smaller, given that a high percentage of their portfolio consists of non-performing loans. For example, some Dr900bn of National Bank's Dr1,400bn loan book is said to consist of doubtful loans, the result of years of lending on political not banking criteria. Not suprisingly, their market share is shrinking as Greeks turn to the more efficient private banks. Both Credit Bank and Ergobank, the country's two largest private banks are expanding aggressively, opening new branches, investing heavily in new technology and improving their retail products. National Bank's share of Greek deposits has fallen from 50 to 40 per cent in the past five years. While total deposits doubled in the same period, the state banks' share declined by 7 percentage points. Smaller state banks need fresh capital and better management. Investors' appetites have sharpened with the successful privatisation of three small state banks under the previous conservative government. Nevertheless the government seems reluctant to make state banks more competitive. For example, Commercial Bank, the second-largest state bank, is to retain control of Ionian Bank by taking up its full share of a Dr20bn rights issue planned for early next year. Ionian was cleaning up its balance sheet, increasing provisions for doubtful loans, preparing to sell its hotel subsidiary and launching new products with the aim of attracting an outside investor.</p>

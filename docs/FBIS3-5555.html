			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At ROK-U.S. working-level trade talks held on 8  March in Seoul, concerning the issues of automobile and  intellectual property rights, the U.S. side strongly urged the  ROK side to further reduce tariffs on imported cars and to  conduct a special crackdown on those who violate intellectual  property rights, along with revising relevant laws and  regulations established to protect the rights.    In the talks, while highly assessing the results of the ROK  side's efforts to crack down on violators of the intellectual  property rights, the U.S. side not only called for the ROK side  to conduct a stronger crackdown on violators, but also strongly  urged it to revise its laws and regulations so as to match those  of the intellectual property agreement of the Urguay Round and  the level of those of advanced countries.    Concerning the issue of opening the automobile market, the  U.S. side, claiming that the ROK authorities have taken such an  unfavorable measure as conducting a tax audit on those who  purchase foreign cars, strongly urged the ROK side to stop  taking such a measure and to further lower tariffs on imported  cars from the current 10 percent.    However, recalling the fact that the laws related to the  intellectual property rights such as the copyright protection  law, the computer program protection law, the tariff law, and  the cabled television broadcasting law have already been revised  last year through consultations with the United States, our side  explained that the tariff on imported cars has been lowered from  15 percent last year to 10 percent this year and that it is  difficult to further lower the tariff because the European Union  also levies a 10 percent trariff on imported cars.</p>

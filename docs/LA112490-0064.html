			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUCE, BONNIE AND BROWNE  </P> <P> Re Robert Hilburn's Nov. 19 article, "Killing 'Em Softly With His Songs": The  piece reads more like a tribute in a teen fan club flyer than an analysis in a  major newspaper. Hilburn says Bruce Springsteen "faced the (personal) issues  and questions of the last two years head-on."  </P> <P> But it is worth noting that he did not utter a word on stage about our coming  war with Iraq or did he go beyond giving a brief thanks to the Christic  Institute, which is pursuing a lawsuit against many of the Iran-Contra crooks  who got off so lightly for meddling in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Conversely, Jackson Browne did several songs about the shameless activities of  Reagan, the CIA and the vicious, drug-running "freedom fighters" in Central  America. This was, after all, supposed to be a folk concert by three of our  most politically engaged performers.  </P> <P> So when Hilburn describes Springsteen's "Brilliant Disguise" as a "supreme  moment of confrontation and confession" it becomes clear that the rock critic  is fixated on the gossip about his icon. Does he see no irony in celebrating  Bruce for "facing the issues," given Springsteen's neglect of politics in this  supremely political moment?  </P> <P> KEITH FITZGERALD  </P> <P> Bel Air  </P></p>

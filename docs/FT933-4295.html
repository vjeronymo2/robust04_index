			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall rises to Pounds 3.6m Jupiter Tyndall Group, the banking and investment management group, raised pre-tax profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 3.61m in the first half of 1993. The current year's figure included Pounds 493,000 from the sale of Jupiter's interest in Tyndall Australia, but with a number of non-recurring items also in the comparable figures, Mr John Duffield, chairman, said the increase was regarded as a 'fair reflection' of the group's underlying performance. Earnings per share were 8.2p (7p), while an interim cash dividend of 4p (3p) has been declared or an enhanced scrip dividend to the value of 6p per share. James Capel will be underwriting the scrip dividend shares, the directors stated, at a discount of 2.5 per cent, free of expenses to a selling shareholder.</p>

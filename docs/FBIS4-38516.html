			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [John Lloyd report: "Ukraine Seeks Recipe for Economic </F> Survival"]    [Text] Ukraine's economy is in deep crisis. Production  has fallen an estimated 40 per cent compared with last year and  both its currency and state revenues have plunged.    Inflation has been screwed down from hyperinflationary  levels  to around 6 per cent a month and official unemployment is a mere  100,000 people. But this is achieved, economists say, at the  cost of idle plants and millions of workers paid -- or more  often not paid -- to do nothing.    The plight of the economy, and possible reforms to drag it  out of the mire, were discussed yesterday by international  economists at a conference in Kiev organised by the World Bank,  the Kiev International Centre for Advanced Studies and the  Economic Policy journal.    Among those on the podium were Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the  formgr deputy prime minister of Poland, Mr Sergey Vasiliyev,  deputy economics minister of Russia, and Professor Jeffrey  Sachs, the highest-profile western adviser to the economies in  transition. Mr Balcerowicz, the inspiration behind Polish  reforms in 1990 and 1991, told the audience that Poland in 1989  was in a similar position to Ukraine today, with suppressed  hyperinflation, a command economy and little private sector. "A  radical programme can work," Mr Balcerowicz said, "so long as it  includes stabilisation of the currency, privatisation and a  unified exchange rate" -- none of which Ukraine at present has.    Mr Vasiliyev, in the rare role for a Russian minister of  being seen as the representative of a success story, said that  "if Ukraine continues on the road it is now on it has no chance  of coming out of its crisis. Experience shows that the more  rapidly you go, the faster you get out."    Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and  a former reformist deputy prime minister with responsibility for  the economy commented: "We in Ukraine have chosen to show the  word that we can commit every possible mistake on the road to a  market economy."    Mr Daniel Kaufman, the head of the World Bank mission in  Kiev, said that the black economy was now growing rapidly --  despite increasingly desperate efforts by the government to  tighten its grip on the state sector.    "Literally speaking, assets, capital, activities and  entrepreneurs have departed from the official economy (but) the  emergence and growth of the unofficial economy does demonstrate  the entrepreneurship, creativity and ability to adapt and  survive of Ukraine's citizens.    "This bodes well for the future," said Mr Kaufman.</p>

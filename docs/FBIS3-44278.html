Officials from the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the mainland and the Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan agreed to hold further talks as soon  as possible to negotiate the repatriation of hijackers so as to  reach a formal agreement.    A senior official from ARATS told XINHUA today that the  negotiations between the two sides from December 18 to 22 in  Taipei had made major progress as the two sides have achieved  important common ground and formed a basic framework for the  agreement on repatriation of hijackers. Airliner hijacking has  become a serious problem since early this year.    The two sides agreed in principle that hijackers must be  repatriated and punished severely, as hijacking civil airliners  is a serious criminal activity.    The framework of the repatriation agreement involves the  scope of repatriation, principle of repatriation, coercive  measures and the way of repatriation and hand-over, according to  the official.    The planned agreement applies to persons from both sides of  the Taiwan Straits who hijack civil aircraft to the other side.    The official said that although exact wording of the  agreement is to be further discussed, Mazu and Mawei ports will  be the places for handover and Jinmen and Xiamen may also be  possible venues for it.</p>

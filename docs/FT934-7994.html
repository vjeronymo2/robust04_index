			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (8): Mass privatisation - Hungarian style IN JANUARY Hungary starts to sell state shareholdings on concessionary terms to small investors through the Budapest Stock Exchange. First on the block are minority stakes in eight companies including the Pannonia, Soproni and Borsodi breweries, the Pannonia and Hungaria hotel chains, and plastics producer Pannonplast. Every adult Hungarian paying a nominal Ft2000 (Dollars 21) entrance fee will be entitled to a Ft100,000 (Dollars 1030) interest-free credit facility which can be used to subscribe to the public offerings. The scheme, devised by Schroders, the UK investment bank, allows repayments to be spread over five years and no security is required beyond the purchased shares themselves. The authorities hope that the generous terms will attract up to one million of Hungary's 10m population and thus defuse the widespread feeling that privatisation has passed by the general public. For the sake of simplicity, the new initiative has been classified internationally as a mass privatisation programme or even a voucher scheme along Czech lines. But such labels cause Budapest officials to flinch. The Hungarian scheme is different, they stress. First, relatively few companies, around 40, will be involved, even over the full five-year lifespan of the project. Only minority, passive stakes will be on offer. And investors will have to pay for their shares if they want to keep them, albeit on an instalment basis. The new scheme, therefore, is not a replacement for existing strategies, but rather another ingredient added to Hungary's already complex privatisation mix.</p>

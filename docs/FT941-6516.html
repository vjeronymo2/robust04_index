			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Viacom lifted by rise in European MTV subscribers A sharp rise in the number of European subscribers to Viacom's MTV music video network was behind an 11 per cent advance in operating earnings at the US cable television group last year. The company, which won a Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications a fortnight ago, benefited from a 25 per cent fall in its debt service costs, to Dollars 145m, and a reduction in its effective tax rate to 43 per cent from 55 per cent. These factors contributed to net income for the year of Dollars 158.2m or Dollars 1.31 a share, up from Dollars 49m or 41 cents in 1992. By the end of the year, MTV Europe had 58.3m subscribers, up from 43m, 12 months earlier. With other parts of the MTV Networks division, including Nickleodeon, recording only modest gains in subscriber numbers, the European performance largely accounted for the division's 27 per cent revenue increase, to Dollars 677.9m from Dollars 533.4m. Operating earnings reached Dollars 239.7m, up from Dollars 172.9m Showtime, Viacom's other network operation, recorded a 5 per cent rise in revenues, to Dollars 543.3m, while operating earnings slid to Dollars 32.3m from Dollars 35.2m. Earnings fell in the cable television division, due to new regulations on rates charged to subscribers. Revenues rose 1 per cent to Dollars 416m, while operating earnings fell 9 per cent to Dollars 110m. For the final three months of the year, Viacom's net income was Dollars 13.6m or 11 cents a share, after a Dollars 12.8m dividend on convertible stock issued to Nynex and Blockbuster Entertainment, which had backed the Paramount bid. This compared with net income of Dollars 11.6m or 10 cents a year before. A number of Blockbuster shareholders yesterday asked the Delaware chancery court for an injunction blocking the merger of the video rental company with Viacom, which was agreed in principle in January. The action is the latest sign of concern among some Blockbuster shareholders that their company is being sold too cheaply. Viacom's shares have fallen sharply in recent weeks, cutting into the value of its all-share offer. Though the company's B shares yesterday rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 28 7/8 , they were trading at well below the Dollars 55 a share at which Blockbuster agreed to buy a Dollars 1.25bn stake in January.</p>

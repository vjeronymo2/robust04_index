He was at the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] national headquarters,  where he stood in an honor guard before Luis Donaldo Colosio's  coffin. As we all know, he accompanied the body from the Mexico  City international airport to the party's headquarters. The  president was accompanied by his wife, Cecilia Ocheli de  Salinas, and he was obviously dismayed. He told us he has lost  his great friend and asked us to respect his sorrow. Let us  listen to the recording.    [Begin Salinas recording] I have just stood in an honor  guard  before the body of Luis Donaldo Colosio. I went to the airport  to pick up his widow, Diana Laura, and to pick him up. My wife  and I accompanied her. Just a few minutes ago, we also  accompanied her to her vehicle when she decided to leave.    I want to tell you that Mexico has lost a great man, and I  have lost a great friend. I want to ask you to allow us to  mourn him, and bid him farewell. Thank you. [end recording]    President Salinas' agenda today is private. Nonetheless, it  is expected that at noon he will receive [Canadian] Prime  Minister Jean Chretien, with whom he had to interrupt his  discussions yesterday when the attack occurred which took the  life of Luis Donaldo Colosio.</p>

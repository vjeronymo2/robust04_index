			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (3): Too much of a good thing? HOWEVER good for growth, the extent of the inflows has complicated the task of governments across Latin America in managing economic policy. The flows have had important repercussions on exchange rates, the money supply, inflation, interest rates and wages. They have often pushed economies economy in the opposite direction from that intended by governments. They have made it more difficult to increase exports, have increased dependence on international capital markets and on developments in the industrialised world, and have played a role in bidding up prices of existing assets, the general benefits of which have not always been clear. Most governments have handled the inflation risk caused by the capital inflows with some skill. The proof of this is in the decline, except in Brazil, of inflation rates across the region as governments have responded with tight monetary and fiscal policies. However, this has, in some countries, been at the cost of an exchange rate pitched too high to ensure that domestic industry remained competitive in international markets. The appreciation of real exchange rates caused by the inflows to some countries has - by making exports more expensive and imports cheaper - added to the difficulties of expanding exports. It has placed additional pressures on domestic industries also facing the tough adjustment to lower tariffs and the lifting of import quotas. As Chile's finance minister, Alejandro Foxley, said last year: 'We already know from the previous crisis that a sudden inflow of capital can be extremely destructive: it forces an appreciation of the currency that can be of such a magnitude that it will severely hurt the domestic productive structure.' The exchange rate has been a real bind for many governments. If they allow their currencies to appreciate, domestic industry is damaged, imports increase and the current account deficit worsens. If they attempt to maintain exchange rates by intervention in the currency market, the inflows are absorbed through increases in foreign exchange reserves. However, this latter course - because the government issues domestic currency to buy foreign currency - expands money supply and increases inflationary pressures. The government can take action to offset the increase in money supply by selling government debt. But if it sells debt, this pushes interest rates higher - thereby deterring physical investment (which is actually what it is trying to encourage). It also spurs even more short-term inflows of capital. In the mean time, central banks lose money as they buy up foreign exchange on which they earn single-digit interest rates, and pay double digit interest rates or higher to buyers of the debt. The problems caused by selling debt to 'sterilise' capital inflows were particularly acute in Brazil last year. There was a rapid expansion of internal debt and a sharp rise in reserves. But because inflation and real interest rates were so high, the interest rates paid on the extra debt added critically to the overall fiscal deficit, which fed into the country's inflation problem. COLOMBIA also had great difficulty: foreign exchange reserves rose in 1991 by Dollars 1.9bn, equal to its entire monetary base. High real interest rates, which resulted from attempts to sterilise these inflows, meant that, according to the InterAmerican Development Bank, in Colombia and some other countries there had been 'no real benefit of the inflows of capital to the national economies in terms of increased investment or faster growth.' By common consent, Mexico has probably struck the best balance. Although it had the largest inflow, its fiscal surplus allowed internal debt to be paid back and interest rates to be lowered. Without the fiscal surplus - which is difficult psychologically to justify in a developing country - interest rates in Mexico would have had to be higher and therefore economic growth slower. The Mexican government has also used foreign currency reserves to buy back foreign debt, although this has the disadvantage again that it uses high-cost capital to buy back low-cost capital. Significantly, a further possible policy reaction has hardly been discussed in the region: direct obstacles to capital flows. It is clear that most governments recognise that this would send a strong signal suggesting a reversal of the recent financial liberalisation. Furthermore, there must be substantial doubts about the efficacy of capital controls or foreign exchange controls either to keep funds in a country or to stop them from entering. Such controls would probably have little effect at a substantial cost. There is no doubt that the inflows would probably have been more useful if they had been somewhat slower. As the InterAmerican Development Bank said, late last year: 'It would have been preferable if they had entered the countries more gradually and on a sustainable basis.' Indeed, forecasts suggest that inflows to the region will slow down in the current year. This will happen for a variety of reasons, but an important contributory factor will be the impact on the figures of Brazil. That country's continuing economic difficulties will feed continuing fears about another asset confiscation through some kind of shock plan, while the government's growth orientation may bring about a decline in real interest rates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCES AND TOTAL EXTERNAL DEBT (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country               1992     Proj. 1993     1992     Proj. 1993                    balance       balance     debt          debt  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentine             -8.0          -8.0       62            56 Brazil                 5.2           3.7      127           127 Chile                 -0.5          -1.2       19            20 Colombia               0.9           0.4       16            16 Mexico               -22.7         -25.7      105           112 Peru                  -1.8          -1.8       22            23 Venezuela             -3.7          -2.6       34            35 LATIN AMERICA        -30.5         -35.2      384           390  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: JP Morgan, Emerging Markets Economic Outlook, 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Triplex seeks Pounds 17.3m via rights TRIPLEX LLOYD, the industrial engineering group, is asking shareholders for Pounds 17.3m through a 1-for-4 rights issue at 140p a share to finance expansion in its power and automotive and engineering divisions. The price has been pitched at a discount of 33p to the overnight share price of 173p. It is just 7p above the bottom of the shares' 1992-93 trading range. The rights issue is the second move in a financial reorganisation of the group. Last month it raised Dollars 35m (Pounds 23.1m) through a private placement on the US capital markets and, in the process, switched most of its short term debt into medium and long term borrowings at fixed rates of interest. The cash call, first contemplated last October, constitutes what Mr Colin Cooke, chairman, called 'a recharging of our batteries.' Mr John Foley, managing director, said: 'We now have cash at fixed rates and the size of balance sheet to finance expansion and some small add-ons as well.' The immediate effect, however, is to reduce gearing. This had increased to 70 per cent, from 60 per cent last September, because of capital expenditure and increased needs for working capital. It is expected to drop after the rights issue to just over 20 per cent, then rise to a peak of over 40 per cent for two years, before declining again. Triplex Lloyd will be spending the proceeds over two years. Much will be devoted both to expanding and to raising the technological level of casting operations, both in the UK and the US. The spending emphasises the group's policy, evident over the last two years, of concentrating on the development of its power and automotive and engineering businesses. This places a question mark over the future for the building products division. The new shares will not attract the interim dividend, payable later this month, but will receive the final for the year to March 31 1993. The directors said they ex-pected to hold the final dis-tribution at 4.5p, maintaining total payments for the year at 7p. However, the group would not expand further on trading prospects for the current year; at the time of the interim statement last December it said that prospects for the power division were rosy  - there were 'substantial opportunities for growth'  - while it was cautious about the automotive and engineering sector and had seen no sign of an upturn in the building products market. COMMENT The City expects pre-tax profits for the current year to be about Pounds 7m, roughly the same as in 1991-92. Short of any quick economic upturn, shareholders looking for a profits boost will have to rely on the ability of the management to carve out a larger market share in the power and automotive component markets. This is happening to some degree now but the process is unlikely to accelerate until the investment programme has worked through. That points to a quiet current year but greater excitement thereafter.</p>

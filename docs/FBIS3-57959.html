In his  Order of the Day at the end of the year, which was published  today, Ruehe refers to the forthcoming internal restructuring,  the closure of 66 command posts, and the transfer of numerous  units to new locations.    In view of the difficult budgetary situation, it will also  be  necessary in 1994 to set clear priorities and to confine  activities to the "core abilities" of the armed forces which  derive from "security policy requirements," the minister said.  At the same time, he appealed to those responsible to make  particular efforts for conscripts, despite tight resources:  "Even though the money is tight, the training of our young  soldiers must take a prominent position in our common efforts  for a healthy Bundeswehr."    In his Order of the Day, Ruehe referred in particular to the  foreign missions of German servicemen. In the UN operations in  Kampuchea, Somalia, Iraq, and the Adriatic as well as the aid  flights to Bosnia, the Bundeswehr is fulfilling "daily the duty  of Germany: People in need can count on our support." The armed  forces are achieving "great things, at home and abroad" and they  can be "justly proud" of this.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> M.9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested wording changes to the draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance in Attachment A, Section 1.2.6, Action b, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows: ``Visually inspect placement of top shield plug. Re-install or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjust position of top shield plug if it is not properly seated.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter also proposed wording changes to Action c of the same section as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows: ``Install additional temporary shielding or implement other ALARA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions, as appropriate.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC staff agrees with the first comment and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added the suggested words to the Certificate of Compliance, Section A.1.2.6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Action b. It is not necessary to change Action c because 10 CFR Part 20 ALARA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already applies to these activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M.10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted draft Certificate of Compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attachment A, Section 1.2.6, Action d deleted. The user should be permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to analyze and document higher dose rates under 10 CFR 72.48, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for NRC review. Another commenter wanted the complete Section 1.2.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Attachment A to the draft Certificate of Compliance deleted. Given that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HSM dose rates are specified, a specification for DSC dose rates is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary because only the workers involved in the canister closure operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are affected by them and they are already covered by the reactor radiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection program. One commenter wanted draft Certificate of Compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attachment A, Section 1.2.11 deleted. Given that HSM dose rates are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified, a specification for transfer cask dose rates is not necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because only the workers involved are affected, not the general public. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter also stated that if Section 1.2.11 cannot be deleted the action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement should be revised to read as follows: ``If specified dose rates are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded, place temporary shielding around the affected areas of the transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask or implement other ALARA actions, as appropriate. Review the plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records of the fuel assemblies which have been placed in the DSC to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they conform to the fuel specifications of Section 1.2.1. The report to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC should be deleted with the user being able to analyze and document the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher dose rates under 10 CFR 72.48, which is available for NRC review.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The dose rate limits are for design purposes. The dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate is limited to ensure that the DSC has not inadvertently been loaded with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel not meeting the vendor/applicant spent fuel specifications. The NRC will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require reporting if the specified dose limits are exceeded. For these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons, the NRC will not grant the above requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M.11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the requirement for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dissolved boron concentration in the DSC of 2000 ppm is in excess of the 1810  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ppm site-specific license. The 1810 ppm dissolved boron is sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure reactivity below 0.95 K-eff (95/95 tolerance level with uncertainties)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assuming 24 fresh fuel assemblies. For the unlikely worst case with water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> density of 0.2 to 0.7 gm/cc (a condition not achievable for fresh fuel),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactivity remains below 0.98 K-eff. The pool dissolved-boron verification-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement frequency should be changed from not to exceed 48 hours to once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per month to be consistent with 10 CFR Part 50 requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter stated that the NUHOMS&hyph;24P canister was designed using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burnup credit, the basis for licensing is ``credit for soluble boron.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burnup-enrichment curve requirement (Figure 1&hyph;1, draft Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance) should be removed until the NRC accepts burnup credit and the pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boron specification (Section 1.2.15, draft Certificate of Compliance) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC has not yet approved the use of burnup credit in criticality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses for spent fuel storage and transportation casks. The applicant did,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, analyze credit for burnup as an alternative design acceptance basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the NUHOMS&hyph;24P DSC, pending further consideration of burnup credit by NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the SER, the NUHOMS&hyph;24P DSC criticality safety is approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on, among others, the key assumptions of loading with irradiated fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies with equivalent enrichment &lt;1.45 wt% U&hyph;235, misloading unirradiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel with maximum enrichment of 4.0 wt% U&hyph;235, and soluble boron in water for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wet loading and unloading. The NRC considered the use of the burnup-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrichment curve, Certificate of Compliance, Figure 1&hyph;1, as a fuel selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria, to be prudent. Its use adds additional unanalyzed conservatism in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criticality safety margin. It is comparable to previous NUHOMS&hyph;24P  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvals. Its use would also be consistent with the requirement that storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask designs be, to the extent practicable, compatible with removal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stored spent fuel from the reactor site, transportation, and ultimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposition by DOE. Therefore, the NRC disagreed with the commenter's request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P users the option of using these burnup-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrichment curve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The comment appears to refer to the use of a NUHOMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24P associated with a site-specific license. The ``standardized NUHOMS 24P and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52B'' are the subject of this general rulemaking and should not be confused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a site license. The SER for this rulemaking is clear about conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for use, i.e., 2000 ppm boron concentration is required to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> k <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> eff <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  remains below 0.95. The SAR for this rulemaking does not request, nor does the SER grant, exemption from the requirement of k <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> eff <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  = 0.95 for all accident conditions, including misloading of 24 unirradiated fuel assemblies and optimum moderation density.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

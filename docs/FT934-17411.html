			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Reform legislation must wait until 1994 IN SPITE of praise from Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, for the efforts of Professor Goode and his colleagues, legislation on pension reform will not come until at least 1994-95. This has been clear since March when Mr Lilley announced that the Pension Law Review Committee would be three months late reporting. This meant the study was not available when ministers were making decisions about the government's legislative programme for the next parliamentary session, beginning in November. Indeed, the government is not technically committed to implementing any of the report at all. The only specific pledge Mr Lilley has made on the shape of future pensions law came 15 months ago when he promised to give members of occupational pension schemes a new entitlement to an annual statement saying how much their savings are worth. This was in response to a report on the Robert Maxwell affair from the cross-party social security select committee. It seems reasonable to assume that, having set up the review committee in the wake of Maxwell, Mr Lilley will draft what legislation is needed to implement some, if not all, reforms the report recommends. The first indication of the government's intentions will come in a Commons statement Mr Lilley will make either when MPs return briefly to Westminster later this month, or soon after the opening of the next parliamentary session in November. With the government also believed to have postponed politically sensitive plans to raise the state retirement age for women, it is possible it intends to combine these with what it decides to take from Goode into one omnibus bill. But with a small majority, there is no guarantee that ministers could steer what would probably be a large and complex measure through parliament unamended. Already yesterday, Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the Commons social security committee, was appealing to 'radical' MPs to 'get hold' of the bill when it arrives and amend it to give pensioners ownership of their own pension-fund assets. This would in effect overturn Prof Goode's recommendation that trust law should 'continue to provide the foundation for interests, rights and duties arising in connection with occupational pension schemes'. Mr Field said the transfer of assets that such a step would involve would make selling council houses 'pale into insignificance'. He was optimistic that the report would form the basis of a worthwhile reform, partly because of the proposals for a compensation scheme. This would encourage the financial services industry to back effective regulation 'because otherwise they would pick up the bill'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Aleksandr Tumanov, chief of </F> the Federal Administration for Special Construction under the  Government of the Russian Federation, by Ivan Ivanyuk; place and  date not given: "We Are in the Places Where It Is Most Important  To Be"]    [Text] Among the first to complete their part of the work  for reconstruction of the White House in Moscow after the  October events were the military construction workers. Besides  restoring seven floors on the right side of the building, the  so-called sectors G-1 and G-2, they did a good deal of  additional work. This organization, which is not well known even  to specialists, began to be discussed literally during the first  weeks of work, and when the plans for construction of the new  parliamentary center appeared, it was the one to receive the  prestigious order.    What kind of a firm is this, which has constructed hundreds  of the largest facilities but until recently seemed to remain in  the shadows? This and other questions are answered by Colonel  General Aleksandr Tumanov, chief of the Federal Administration  of Special Construction under the Government of the Russian  Federation.    [Ivanyuk] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, last year your organization  celebrated its 40th anniversary...    [Tumanov] Yes, it was created in July 1953. The  Glavspetsstroy [Main Administration for Special Construction  Work] (that is what it was called at the time) included 14  construction and installation administrations, 10 individual  construction units, and several enterprises with various  profiles. These forces had to carry out an extremely important  task--to create an air defense system for Moscow in the shortest  possible period of time. In addition to specialized facilities  it was necessary to build a broad highway network, electric  power transmission lines, substations, mechanization and  transportation bases, and many other things. As early as 1955  the basic facilities of the Moscow air defense system were  turned over to the military department. A system for protection  of Leningrad was created in parallel.    [Ivanyuk] That is, your organization more or less came to  the  aid of the military builders of the Ministry of Defense.    [Tumanov] Not quite. We found our own "niche" very quickly.  At the time one of the priority tasks was to raise the country's  defense industry to a qualitatively new level. Glavspetsstroy  was assigned the construction of the production shops,  buildings, and structures, scientific research institutions, and  design bureaus of the ministries of aviation, the  radio-technical industry, shipbuilding, and the chemical,  electronics, and defense industry. New military construction  administrations were created in Saratov, Kuybyshev, Voronezh,  Severodvinsk, and other cities.    [Ivanyuk] Now one could probably name certain specific  facilities that were constructed during those years.    [Tumanov] It would be impossible to list all that was  constructed. A very large volume of work was done in Moscow by  seven military construction administrations. It would probably  be hard to find a person in the capital who has not heard of the  firms of Koroleva and Lavochkina or the plants Khromatron and  imeni Khrunichev. Many administrative buildings, residential  buildings, and medical institutions were built according to  individual plans. The remarkable bicycle race track was built on  Krylatskiy for the 1980 Olympics.    In St. Petersburg I would mention first of all the Svetlana  Plant, the scientific research production-design institute  Terminal, the Leninets scientific production association, and  the scientific research institute of instruments, for whose  construction at the end of the seventies the prize of the USSR  Council of Ministers was awarded. A significant scientific and  production potential was created in Voronezh. Among the  enterprises and scientific research institutes built by the  military builders was the plant for electro-vacuum instruments,  the scientific research institute of communications, and the  design bureau for chemical automation.    The Glavspetsstroy has done a great deal for the aerospace  industry. We built the Center for Aviation and Space  Machine-Building in Samara where, in particular, the Energiya  missile was made. And in general for the Energiya-Buran program  we built facilities in Moscow and in the Urals and in the Moscow  environs.    In Sverdlovsk Oblast such strategically important facilities  as the plant for producing titanium was introduced, and in  Verkhnyaya and Nizhnyaya Salda--facilities for testing missile  aircraft engines. The construction administration in  Severodvinsk, which is now headed by Major General Anatoliy  Polyakov, created the Center for Construction of Nuclear  Submarines starting from zero. The immense scale of this  construction project is shown by the fact that four football  fields could be placed under the roof of the assembly shop.    During 1966-1967 construction was started on a whole complex  of defense industry enterprises in Udmurtia. Through the efforts  of two construction administrations an immense volume of work  was performed--comparable to what was done in Moscow. Giants of  industry were constructed such as the Izhevsk automotive plant,  which is intended for annual output of 200,000 motor vehicles  and 450,000 motorcycles, the Izhevsk metallurgical combine,  which provides "defense" with especially strong grades of steel,  the Izhevsk motor plant, which produces space electronic  equipment, the Izhevsk radio plant, which produces the most  complicated instruments and household radio equipment, the now  world-renowned Votkinskiy machine-building plant where SS-20  missiles were produced...    [Ivanyuk] Each of these facilities probably required that  the  builders come up with difficult engineering solutions.    [Tumanov] Undoubtedly. For example, when constructing the  bicycle race track on Krylatskiy in order to cover spans of 168  meters, they installed on inclined metal arches two  saddle-shaped coverings made of rolled welded steel sheets four  millimeters thick. And the supports were reinforced with solid  reinforced concrete tie-beams which can hold up to 6,000 tonnes.  This was the first time such a solution had been used in  domestic or foreign practice. One could give many examples like  this. And in 1989 the Planning Design-Technological Institute  was created as a part of Glavspetsstroy, which made it possible  to perform the full cycle of work for creating one facility or  another, to introduce the achievements of science and technology  more actively, and to reduce the time periods for construction.    [Ivanyuk] Spetsstroy must be distinguished by its autonomy.    [Tumanov] It does approximately 80 percent of its work with  its own forces. The Main Administration includes automotive  transportation enterprises and mechanization administrations.  Practically every year we build an enterprise for the  development of our own production base. Now, for example, in the  Moscow suburb of Tuchkovo we are building a modern brick plant  which meets European standards. It will produce 45 million  bricks a year. We want to arrange production of plastic  carpentry items. In recent years we have mastered the technology  for pouring solid concrete and producing gypsum-cardboard  partitions. Industry of the Main Administration produces a total  of more than a million cubic meters of reinforced concrete a  year, approximately the same amount of gravel and sand, hundreds  of square meters of carpentry items, tens of thousands of  "cubes" of items made of cellular concrete, and tens of  thousands of tonnes of metal structural elements.    [Ivanyuk] Your organization has been working for "defense"  for decades. The conversion of the defense industry, and  especially the way it is proceeding, could not but affect the  work of the builders.    [Tumanov] Of course, it has had an effect. We too are now  conducting a kind of conversion process, and it is rather  painful. While before 1990 each day we released 700,000-750,000  square meters of industrial space and 500,000-600,000 square  meters of dwelling space for operation, now it would be ideal to  reverse this ratio. But the decline of production during the  past two or three years was so sharp that last year we were only  able to reach the level of 450,000 square meters. And I am not  even talking about industrial projects.    And this also entailed a considerable outflow of personnel,  although we were able to retain many of them. The number of  military construction workers also decreased from 50,000 to  20,000. Working in Glavspetsstroy has always been prestigious.  For example, we used to hire 40 graduates of the Moscow  Engineering Construction School each year and we held a  competition for them to enter our system. Many officers from the  military schools also had hopes of working in Glavspetsstroy. I  recall my own experience, since I came to one of the largest  construction projects in Udmurtia as a lieutenant after  graduating from the Kazan Engineering-Construction School.    We have always tried to create good conditions for the work  and recreation of our people: We set up polyclinics and  hospitals with the latest in technical equipment, built  sanatoriums-preventive treatment facilities, and health bases.  Each year 10,000-11,000 children spend the summer in recreation  camps alone. Even now during these difficult times we are  building a children's health facility to accommodate 450, which  is to be put into operation in 1995. We are solving our workers'  housing problems. There were times when we constructed  200,000-250,000 square meters of housing a year for ourselves  alone. But even this year, for example, in Moscow alone we will  release at least 250 apartments.    Now we are faced with the task of making housing  construction  the main area of the work of the entire Main Administration. To  do this we are reconstructing housing construction combines in  Izhevsk and Novorossiysk.    [Ivanyuk] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, what are your specific  plans  for this year?    [Tumanov] There are many suggestions. A large volume of work  is planned for Moscow. Thus the Moscow Construction Committee  has turned over to us for reconstruction an entire block of  residences on Zoologicheskaya Street--about 100,000 square  meters of housing, garages, parking lots, and offices. In  today's prices this amounts to more than a quarter of a trillion  rubles. Large amounts of work are also planned for Butovo and  Lyublina.    If we look at the defense industry, it is "loading" us by 15  percent. They are the traditional clients--the Izhevsk plants,  the design bureau imeni Lavochkin, the Severodvinsk nuclear  center. Perhaps the most difficult situation now is in  Severodvinsk: They have plenty of work but no money. We might  have to relocate part of the organization to another region. Two  new construction administrations were formed recently in  Krasnodar Kray and the creation of several subdivisions is in  the stage of development. We are prepared to work in any region  of Russia and carry out any tasks in short periods of time.    [Ivanyuk] The "special construction workers" are used to  strict deadlines but will you be able to compete in terms of  quality?    [Tumanov] With good quality of construction materials and  control of the course of the work I think we can cope with any  task, and it is a fact that we will do it at a lower cost, even  if we have to buy some of the materials abroad. We have  experience in building unique facilities. I have already  mentioned the bicycle race track on Krylatskaya. I can also name  others: the Moscow area flight control center, the relay tower  in Novorossiysk. We are also striving to gain new experience. In  1990 we acquired a license to engage in foreign economic  activity and we already have two joint ventures with foreign  firms functioning. During this time we have managed to build a  station for technical service for the Soviet-Japanese firm Imis.  In conjunction with the Canadians we have released several  offices "turnkey" for foreign firms and we are building an ice  cream plant for the well-known American firm Baskin-Robbins in  Moscow. So we are giving serious thought to reaching the level  of world standards.</p>

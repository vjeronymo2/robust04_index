			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Japanese investment in north set to fall THE PEAK years of Japanese investment into the north of England are over, according to a report by the Northern Development Company, the region's economic regeneration body. The north, comprising north-east England and Cumbria, has more Japanese manufacturing investment, in terms of jobs created and money invested, than any other region in Europe. But, the report warns, the region cannot expect jobs gains from Japanese investment in the 1990s to match 1980s levels and must acknowledge that the UK's traditional advantages of language and lower costs are not on their own sufficient to counter intense competition, especially from Germany. The report attributes the likely downturn in Japanese investment to: The weakening of the yen. The fact that most big Japanese manufacturers have made their move into Europe in anticipation of the single market. Stronger competition for inward investment. Increasingly, the report warns, as projects become more capital intensive, investors want not cheap labour but highly-skilled labour - a requirement Germany may be better able to satisfy. Germany, it adds, also offers a strategic base for exploiting opportunities in eastern Europe. The north now has 48 Japanese companies, of which 27 are manufacturers with existing or committed investment of more than Pounds 1.5bn. The report say that to maintain inward investment the north must satisfy the probably more exacting skills requirements of Japanese manufacturers yet to invest; target sectors such as pharmaceuticals in which companies are awaiting completion of single market legislation before moving into Europe; and target other sources of inward investment, such as the emerging economies of east Asia.

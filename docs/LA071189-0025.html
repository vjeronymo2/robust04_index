The  Atlanta-based airline said a newly formed employee stock ownership plan would  control 14% of its shares and that Swissair, a foreign airline, would acquire  5%. At the same time, Delta said it would acquire 5% of Swissair, and  repurchase 19% of its own shares on the open market. In March, Delta and  Swissair formed a marketing alliance.  </P></p>

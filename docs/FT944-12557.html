			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / A turn for the worse in Bosnia: Bruce Clark explains the UN dilemma and the diplomatic disarray provoked by the Moslem army offensive Whenever the fighting in former Yugoslavia subsides, more comfortable parts of the world forget about it with relief. They have largely done so since February, when a ceasefire brought a minimum of normality to Sarajevo. But in the last few days, that complacency has been shattered. In its most spectacular offensive since the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina began nearly three years ago, the Moslem-led government army has burst out of its position near the enclave of Bihac and captured over 100 square miles of territory. It has put to flight thousands of Serb soldiers and civilians, and threatened the Serb-held towns of Bosanska Krupa and Bosanski Petrovac. There have also been Bosnian government offensives to the south and west of Sarajevo, and in retaliation the city's suburbs have again been shelled. UN peacekeepers have come under shellfire from government soldiers who refuse to leave the strategic Mount Igman, outside Sarajevo. From the Serbs, they have faced kidnappings and the obstruction of fuel deliveries to eastern Bosnia. UN officials - who need a minimum of co-operation from all parties to function effectively - admit to being near the the end of their tether. Yet winding down their giant operation in former Yugoslavia, which involves 40,000 troops from 36 countries, may turn out to be more disastrous than retaining it. 'Our peacekeeping effort has continually been tested by the warring parties, and in recent weeks the conflict has intensified,' says Mr Michael Williams, chief spokesman for the UN in Zagreb. In theory, the peacekeeping operation was given more teeth by the UN, which last week agreed tougher procedures for air strikes with Nato, which is responsible for policing the Bosnian skies. But Nato's insistence that any bombing raids be on a much larger scale than before could make UN commanders more reluctant to invoke air power. And it would be almost impossible politically to use Nato aircraft against the Bosnian government army, which enjoys strong US support. In the diplomatic arena the picture is scarcely more encouraging, with divisions between the five nations in the international contact group on Bosnia which is leading efforts to arrange a peaceful settlement. The key to progress was supposed to be the unity of the group's members: the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany. But now they are divided over a US-sponsored resolution in the UN Security Council that would authorise arms supplies to Bosnia in six months - unless the Serbs accept a peace plan. If the resolution is pushed to a vote, it will be blocked by UK and French abstentions and possibly a Russian veto. Worse diplomatic disarray has been avoided with the dropping of Washington's demand for an immediate lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia. But the ability of the five to act together with credibility has already been compromised. Both the renewed fighting, and the crumbling of international consensus, bring closer the spectre that haunts every actor in the Bosnian drama: a UN pull-out in what military planners euphemistically describe as 'non-benign' conditions - under fire from one or more of the warring factions. Nato's plans for this scenario run to thousands of pages; they remain secret, but are assumed to envisage hundreds of casualties and the temporary deployment of up to 20,000 extra ground forces to cover the withdrawal. It is hard to imagine how Nato could assemble such numbers at speed without including some US troops. It is, however, even harder to imagine how the US could agree to the inclusion of their armed forces in view of the American electorate's acute reluctance to accept losses in foreign wars. Either way, a bloody withdrawal from Bosnia could shake both transatlantic relations, and the international order, to their foundations. This, in turn, would cloud prospects for concerted diplomatic action over a host of other regional problems, from Iraq to Indochina. The pull-out of UN peacekeepers could also leave behind a bloodbath in Bosnia in which the death toll would far exceed the 200,000 or so already chalked up. If the events of recent days do portend a serious turn for the worse, it is quite possible - strange as this may sound - that historians will view the last eight months as a period of success in international policy towards the region. While each of the outside powers involved in Bosnia has its own strategic aims, there are four goals to which all are committed: The prevention of a humanitarian catastrophe by distributing aid, and sheltering civilians from the worst effects of the war. The geographical containment of the fighting, so that it does not spread through ex-Yugoslavia and the Balkans. The avoidance of any breakdown in relations between the world's leading powers because of disagreement over Bosnia. The creation, if possible, of conditions for a long-term settlement which is viable and not too unjust. The four objectives have been difficult to pursue simultaneously, because they often point in contradictory directions. It is not possible, for example, to feed civilians without feeding armies, which prolongs the fighting. However, if there is no progress towards the fourth aim of a settlement, the successes on the first two will be compromised, because the political will to maintain the huge humanitarian relief effort and vigorous preventive diplomacy will start to flag. Conversely, if one outside power intervenes unilaterally to promote the fourth goal - by altering the battle lines and imposing what it considers to be a just outcome - the other three goals could be left in ruins. That is what the British, French and Russians will be telling the US at this week's Security Council debate: far from bringing peace to Bosnia, the creation of a 'level killing field' through arms deliveries to the Bosnian government could trigger a new humanitarian nightmare and bitter international recrimination. Compared with the disasters which might have occurred, the world community has achievements to its credit, at least on the first three goals. With the completion last week of the 10,000th aid flight to Sarajevo, the UN can point to some success in meeting the first objective. There has also been success on the second front: thanks to (mainly US) diplomacy, the Serb-Moslem stand-off in Bosnia has not so far triggered an even bigger conflict to the south between the Serbs and the mainly Moslem Albanians. Last July, when the five contact group nations threw their weight behind a new peace plan for Bosnia, they were ostensibly pursuing the fourth objective, a long-term settlement. Yet in practice, the peace plan - which would allocate 51 per cent of Bosnia's territory to a Moslem-Croat federation and the rest to the Serbs - had much more to do with the third goal of maintaining international consensus. Rather than having any practical effect, the peace proposal has served as a kind of totem to which all the outside powers can pay homage, and a standard by which the good intentions of the parties on the ground can be judged. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has emerged triumphantly from opprobrium by accepting the plan, while his rival, the Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic, has fallen further into disrepute by saying no. Few close observers of the conflict see the slightest chance of the warring parties agreeing to implement the plan, which would require the Bosnian Serbs to give up 20 per cent of the land they have staked out and largely 'ethnically cleansed' of non-Serbs. Bosnia's Moslem leaders have accepted the map, albeit reluctantly. But they admit that they have accepted it only because they see no risk of having to implement it: their Serb adversaries were always bound to say no. There is little prospect that outside powers will come up with a new map. The best hope is that the parties will agree among themselves on adjusting the plan, after exhausting all military options. But even if the contact group's peace plan is dead, there have been some encouraging hints of progress towards a comprehensive settlement in the former Yugoslavia. One sign is the covert diplomacy that has been going on since the summer, including a secret meeting between army commanders from Belgrade and Zagreb. Efforts towards a peace settlement in Croatia - based on full diplomatic recognition between Belgrade and Zagreb, and some autonomy for the Serb-dominated areas of Croatia - appear to be moving into higher gear. After months of intricate negotiations, involving the US and Russian embassies in Zagreb and envoys of the European Union and the UN, it was announced last week that Zagreb and Belgrade will hold regular meetings at foreign minister level. Serb-Croat reconciliation does not automatically bring peace in Bosnia closer. Whenever Serbs and Croats talk, the Moslems become nervous, on the understandable ground that the most likely subject of these discussions is carving up Bosnia. But for the present, the Croat-Moslem federation agreement stitched together last February under strong international pressure is holding. In Mostar, which had its Moslem eastern half subjected to a ruthless siege by the Croats last year, about 30 hard-pressed bureaucrats from the EU are working, with modest success, to promote reconciliation and ensure that basic municipal functions are carried out. In return for international respectability, Croatia's leaders have set aside aspirations to carve out a slice of Bosnia for themselves. President Milosevic, for similar reasons, seems willing in principle to recognise the territorial integrity of both Bosnia and Croatia. Advances such as these have made the recent French proposal for a meeting between the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia more plausible. This would not mean an instant end to all fighting; but if it allowed the broad lines of a settlement in former Yugoslavia to be laid out, it would be a big step forward. At the very least, the diplomatic efforts of recent months have put in place building bricks for a settlement to be constructed. The latest upsurge in fighting might scupper that process. However, it might just conceivably help it along. The Bosnian Serbs' current reverses could make them more willing to sue for peace on terms acceptable to the rest of the world. Some observers in Belgrade believe that Mr Milosevic would not be too unhappy to see the power base of his rival, Mr Karadzic, confined to eastern Bosnia. This could happen if the Bosnian Serbs continued to suffer military defeats in the far north of the republic, and the political friends of Mr Milosevic gained the upper hand in the Serbs' stronghold of Banja Luka. A bleaker scenario, however, is that the Bosnian Serbs will be so badly humiliated that politicians in Belgrade, and perhaps Moscow, find themselves under irresistible moral pressure to come to their aid. Since his apparent conversion to the cause of a peaceful settlement last August, Mr Milosevic has used his authoritarian state machine, and his control of the media, to insulate himself from nationalist pressures to support the Bosnian Serbs. But the commanders of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army may not be prepared to stand by indefinitely if their brother officers in the Bosnian Serb forces are subjected to a series of humiliating setbacks. Another imponderable is the political balance in Russia, where the government might be tempted into pursuing a more stridently pro-Serb policy as a way of parrying hard-line nationalist opposition to its economic programme. That would end all hope of keeping the contact group together. The outside powers involved in Bosnia might then find the only thing they could agree on was the level of military support each gave to its own friends: the US to the Bosnian government, the Russians to the Serbs. The last such agreement was in 1989, when Presidents Bush and Gorbachev settled on the deadly principle of 'positive symmetry' - or balanced arms supplies to their proteges - in Afghanistan. As a means of settling a civil war, that is not a happy precedent. While the deal helped take the Afghan issue off the international agenda, it also stoked the fighting that reduced much of Kabul to smouldering rubble. And unlike the conflict in Afghanistan, an escalating war by proxy in the former Yugoslavia would be hard to restrict to a single country.</p>

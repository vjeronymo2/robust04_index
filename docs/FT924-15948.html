			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Technology: Double vision - The latest developments in consumer photography The photographic industry is suffering from double vision. It is grappling with a move into electronics while experimenting with lighter cameras and 'intelligent' film. As a result, it is having to think big and small at the same time. This has prompted manufacturers to head off in various technological directions. The long-awaited move into the electronic era is its biggest challenge. For years, manufacturers have been trumpeting the approach of an age when 'the photograph meets the computer meets the video in one medium,' as Jonathan Brandon, marketing co-ordinator at Canon in the UK puts it. But the industry has not yet been able to deliver the goods. While digital still video cameras - which record images on magnetic disks and then 'play' them back on television - have been available for a number of years, they are still mainly for specialist use and are not expected to win mass consumer acceptance for some time. The greatest advantage of digital still videos is that there is no need for film processing. The pictures which are shot can be viewed immediately on television. And images captured on a digital camera can be sent down the telephone line to an electronic device such as a computer. The business potential is huge. Newspapers and other publications are already using digital cameras to send pictures of major events half way around the globe in a matter of seconds. The average consumer, however, has not yet warmed to the idea of electronic photography, whatever its merits. For one thing, digital photography cannot yet match the price advantages of chemical film processing. Kodak's latest fully digital cameras cost Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 6,500. Digital cameras also fail to compete successfully on quality grounds. When viewed on an electronic medium such as television the resolution is excellent, but it lacks the quality of a Polaroid when printed. This is because the amount of digital data needed to obtain the equivalent of a single frame of high-quality film would fill 20 floppy disks, Kodak says. What can be stored on a digital camera disk is a fraction of that. As Leo Thomas, group vice president of Kodak, told an audience at the recent Photokina photography exhibition in Cologne: 'As long as you can get excellent colour prints from traditional systems at less than 1 per cent the cost of (digital cameras), silver halide systems will take most of our pictures.' Nevertheless, manufacturers insist that demand for digital photography is growing. 'By the year 2010 the average person would not be using emulsion-based film cameras,' predicts Brandon. 'It will be totally electronically based.' The camera of the future will have a 'smart card' instead of a roll of film. People will simply insert the card into their televisions to view the photographs. But even for those who are more muted in their enthusiasm about the digital age of photography, such as Kodak, the question is no longer whether the age of digitisation will come but when. Despite its own vested interests in chemical photography, Kodak recently launched its own electronic storage system, called Photo-CD. 'We felt that if Kodak didn't supply the electronic system to photography, the computer industry would,' says Scott Brownstein at Kodak. Photo-CD attempts to combine the best of both the chemical and digital worlds by transferring photographs taken by conventional cameras on to digital disks. Because silver halide film is used in taking the photographs, quality is not sacrificed. The benefits of digitisation are there too, in the form of compact storage on a CD-sized disk and the ability to manipulate and transfer the images via electronic media. d3 The increasing popularity of camcorders has prompted the question of whether the 35mm compact camera and its more sophisticated cousin, the single lens reflex camera (SLR), can survive amid intense competition. So far, they are not giving up without a fight. SLR cameras are undergoing improvements such as eye-controlled focusing, which enables the camera to detect what the photographer's eye is looking at by analysing light reflected from it. Other tricks include a mechanism to minimise the 'red eye' effect and a 'silent' mode to reduce the noise created by automatic zoom lenses and automatic film rewinding. Yet for the majority of amateur photographers who want a small, simple box that can be relied upon to take good pictures, this gimmickry seems to defeat the purpose of a compact camera, which is primarily ease of use. So it will come as no surprise that the compact camera market is seeing a revival in simple, 'decision free' cameras that are light, cheap, and simple to use. Over the past 10 years, cameras have become smaller but they also become more complex, as manufacturers add an increasing number of features such as zoom lenses, explains Jonathan Brandon, marketing co-ordinator of Canon in the UK. The more features they add, the larger the cameras got again. 'Now, we're seeing a regression to simpler cameras,' he says. Single-use cameras, often referred to as 'disposable' cameras, have doubtless taken market share away from compacts. But with lightweight compact cameras that take good-quality pictures selling for as little as Pounds 39, single-use cameras are still seen primarily for emergency use. Canon says that while camcorders have eaten into sales of more expensive SLR cameras, the company saw SLR sales rise strongly after it dropped prices. 'Everything robs from everything else,' says Brandon. 'Photography has always been niche marketing.' d3 Meanwhile, Kodak and Fuji, the US and Japanese film companies, have been working with camera manufacturers Canon, Nikon and Minolta on film technologies. The widespread view among industry watchers is that the companies are working to reduce the size of the film canister so that cameras can be made thinner. The attempt to make the film canister smaller fits in with the trend to reduce the overall size of the camera. Although progress has been made, after a certain point reduction in the camera size is restricted by the size of the film. The technology is not a problem. 'We have the technology to make any film of any size,' says Mike O'Farrell, manager of Kodak's consumer imaging division. But the 135mm format most commonly used today offers excellent reproduction on any print size. 'It would have to be something really spectacularly good to challenge it,' O'Farrell says. One way to keep the 135mm format but reduce the overall space taken up by the film is to reduce the circumference of the canister. Konica, the Japanese film and camera manufacturer, has succeeded in reducing the diameter of the canister from the conventional 2.5cm to 2cm by making both the film base and chemical coating thinner. Yet only one camera, Konica's 'single-use' device sold in Japan, is made to fit the film. Another development in film technology is the use of magnetic strips on film to record information about the conditions under which photographs were shot, such as lighting and distance. This 'intelligent' film would improve the printing process by giving developers more accurate information on how each particular photograph should be printed. The magnetic strip may even be able to replace the zoom lens. Information could be recorded on the magnetic strip to print just one particular section of the image, framed in the viewfinder, in an enlarged format. This information could be fed into the printer at the time of printing. The magnetic strip is still experimental, but closer collaboration between camera manufacturers and film companies will help whatever strides are made in film technology. In a fickle market, strategic alliances may be the only way manufacturers can stay one step ahead of the competition.</p>

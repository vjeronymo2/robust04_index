			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Lucas invests in Chinese car industry Lucas Industries, the UK automotive components and aerospace group, is making its first investment in China's rapidly expanding motor industry via a Dollars 33m (Pounds 21.7m) joint venture to manufacture disc brakes. If the project proceeds as envisaged, output of 600,000 discs a year will be reached in 1997. The three-way venture is with Langfang Braking Air Compressor Factory of Hebei province and Mando Machinery, part of South Korea's Halla group and a long-standing partner of Lucas in ventures outside China. Lucas will have a 20 per cent stake, with its partners each holding 40 per cent. The two-phase project involves an initial investment of Dollars 14m at Langfang's existing site, on the outskirts of Beijing, to produce up to 280,000 brake discs a year starting at the end of 1995. In phase two, a new facility will be built in the Langfang economic and technology zone. The venture follows the signing of Lucas' first technology transfer agreement with China, under which it is providing technology for braking systems to a joint venture company, Hwa Heng, set up between Lucas's licensee in Taiwan and the Wuhu Auto Parts factory in Anhui province. Lucas has no stake in that venture.</p>

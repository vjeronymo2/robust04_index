			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "De Mita's Candidacy Continues To </F> Torment the PPI"]    [Text] The leader from Avellino [former Christian  Democratic Party (DC) Chairman Ciriaco De Mita], supported by  the PPI [Italian Popular Party] secretary for Avellino, wants to  return to parliament, despite being served two judicial notices  of investigation. He said that he "is neither indicted nor  under investigation" and added: "There are no judges wanting to  commit me to trial." He went on to specify that one case has  already been dealt with by the lower house and in the other case  the magistrates acted because it was their official duty to do  so. A thorny problem for [PPI Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli who,  in a brief article in IL POPOLO, calls for "discipline and  humility" from all party members. And, in view of the "huge  responsibility" which the present moment carries with it,  Martinazzoli says that "it must be clear to everybody that there  are no problems regarding `individuals.'"    Other PPI members, too, are trying to persuade De Mita to  stand down. "Good examples must come first and foremost from  the top," Popular Party movement leader Roberto Formigoni said,  adding that there is a need for new faces and that De Mita was  both DC secretary for seven years and prime minister. [Pact for  Italy leader] Mario Segni referred to the example set by the PRI  [Italian Republican Party] secretary: "La Malfa," he said, "set  a really noteworthy example; it is painful to say so but the  same unquestionably applies to De Mita." The call to stand  aside was also made by [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS)  Secretary] Achille Occhetto, while [Christian Democratic Center  leader] Francesco D'Onofrio feels that it is right for De Mita  to want to return to Montecitorio [parliament]. [PPI left-wing  faction leader] Rosy Bindi chose not to offer any advice.  "Ciriaco has taught us a great many things," she said. "One of  the many things he has taught us is that politics is conviction.  This problem will be resolved on the basis of his convinctions,  not thanks to any reiterated appeals on our part." The  merry-go-round of withdrawals -- the latest comes from Freedom  of Life movement leader Carlo Casini, who will not be standing  for parliament again -- and candidacies is continuing. [Italian  Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Gianfranco Fini could lead the  flame [MSI symbol] in Treviso, while in the eastern Veneto the  PDS grass roots want [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni. The oak  tree [PDS symbol] will put forward Achille Occhetto in Bologna,  and Vittorio Sgarbi [Italian Liberal Party member and Berlusconi  supporter running on the "Sgarbi for Italy" ticket] is aiming  for a constituency in the Marche region.</p>

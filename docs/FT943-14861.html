			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Ministers on Bosnia mission Britain and France embark today on a diplomatic mission to persuade leaders of Bosnia's warring sides to endorse the 'last-chance' partition plan. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, and Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, will begin a two-day tour of former Yugoslavia to step up pressure to accept the plan for Bosnia's partition by the July 19 deadline. Bosnian and Croat leaders have given conditional approval to the plan, which gives 51 per cent of Bosnia to the new Moslem-Croat federation and the rest to the Bosnian Serbs, who now control 70 per cent of the land. Lord Owen, European Union mediator, and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN emissary, met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leaders in Belgrade, paving the way for today's ministerial mission.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (1): When style obscures substance - Introduction / The seriously rich can afford to pay somebody else to do most of their worrying for them, says Barry Riley. But do they get good value? The seriously wealthy are by and large a discreet bunch, preferring to keep their money out of the jealous gaze of the public and of the tax man. Occasionally, however, publications with a vulgar inclination insist on publishing speculative league tables of the multi-millionaires. Although we do not have accurate statistical information on the wealth of the rich, it does look as though serious money has become more diversified. Once, it was mostly confined to property and family businesses, and was directed through channels which were largely determined by tax loopholes and exchange controls. The legacy of those extreme distortions can still be seen in the continuing agonies of the Lloyd's insurance market, which expanded rapidly in the postwar period when it could be marketed as the ideal bolthole for the seriously rich. In their attempt to escape from heavy taxes and exchange controls, Lloyd's Names accepted high risks which were largely overlooked but which have now come tragically home to roost in many cases. In fact, the wealthier you are, the fewer the risks you need to take. Only the middling rich are seriously concerned with growth. The really wealthy are focused upon capital preservation. Swiss banks have made a speciality of serving the preoccupation of the global rich with discretion and security. In this respect, Switzerland tops the list of private investment centres, offering a powerful combination of confidentiality, security and top-class service. But it is expensive, and there is a pecking order of centres beneath it. Luxembourg, for instance, has grown rapidly as the European centre for the middling rich, cunningly combining an 'offshore' status with its membership of the European Union. Other centres, such as Jersey and Guernsey, have developed their own niches, in their cases in the English-speaking market. There is big, big money in the hands of wealthy private investors. Last year, Chase Manhattan Private Bank estimated that the offshore market alone was worth some Dollars 2,100bn. About half of this was sourced in Europe and the Middle East, but the much more rapidly expanding half originated in the Far East and in Latin America. This leaves out of account, of course, the further vast sums held onshore, especially in the US and Japan. Of the Dollars 2,100bn, incidentally, Chase estimated 35 per cent was managed in Switzerland. The UK, long a haven for rich Arabs, Swedes and others, came next with 15 per cent. Luxembourg and the Channel Islands had 6 per cent each, and the Caribbean centres, which primarily hold wealth from the US and Latin America, had 10 per cent. The base currency is highly influential in determining investment strategies. UK-based investors select their strategies in the context of a historically weak currency and a higher inflation rate than has been experienced in most countries on the continent of Europe (and slightly higher than in the US). The British government and the Bank of England are, it is true, proclaiming that they have adopted a low-inflation strategy. Indeed, for the past couple of years inflation has been higher in Germany and the US than in the UK. But it will take years before UK investors - who can vividly remember Black Wednesday and the collapse in sterling only two years ago - are convinced that anything fundamental has changed. British investors are therefore hooked on equities rather than fixed-interest investments. Cantrade Investment Management, a private-client fund manager in London (which happens to be an offshoot of a Swiss bank) has devised a benchmark which it says is typical of a sizeable private client portfolio. The benchmark return is based on a portfolio containing 50 per cent in UK equities, 20 per cent in overseas equities and 30 per cent in 'defensive assets'. The last would include index-linked gilts, overseas bonds and liquid deposits. Investors with portfolios constructed on these lines have had a rather dull 1994 so far, with a negative return of about 8 per cent in the first six months. However, in 1993 the return was an impressive 26 per cent, so few investors will have been seriously worried by the latest setback. A penalty of being merely comfortably off is that you worry about your money. An advantage of being seriously rich is that you can afford to pay somebody else to do most of the worrying for you. Many advisory firms in London and elsewhere in the UK are positioning themselves to attract the business of the financially well-endowed. Whare should you go? The mystique of the City of London continues to attract many British investors. Merchant banks and stockbrokers still cluster in the Square Mile, although as far as investment management business is concerned the practical benefits of being there are slight. The West End and areas like Kensington are also important for private-client business, particularly for foreigners who are familiar with this part of London but would probably not be able to find their way from Throgmorton Street to Threadneedle Street. Style rather than substance dominates the advisory business. Investment performance is rarely a sensitive factor, because clients are so ill-informed about the results obtained by other managers (although to some extent Cantrade may have set the cat amongst the pigeons here). Levels of service and marketing styles are usually more important. Clients normally like to talk to an account director who is reasonably close to their own age, and they value continuity of relationships. At the top end of the market, elegant addresses and butler-with-silver-tray styles are regarded as essential. If you are entertained to an elegant lunch at your private bank, you can be sure that, although you will never receive a bill, it will be costing you a small fortune. But if you have a large fortune you will be able to regard it all as a vital part of the service.</p>

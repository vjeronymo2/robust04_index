			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- The government decided  Thursday [31 March] on 83.1 billion yen worth of measures to  beef up the dairy and livestock industries for fiscal 1994, 2.2  times more than the previous year, government officials said.  The stepped-up measures are aimed at stabilizing operations of  the dairy and livestock industries based on the agreement at the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round trade talks in December.    Of the total, 34.9 billion yen will be applied to the dairy  industry and 48.2 billion yen will go to livestock farmers.    For the dairy industry, 14.6 billion yen will be used to  streamline dairy business management by paying farmers 2 yen per  kilogram of milk production. This measure is to continue from  fiscal 1993.    The government will pay an additional 1 yen per kilogram to  dairy farmers as an emergency subsidy to compensate for damaged  pastures due to bad weather in 1993.    In the end result, despite the 1 yen cut in the  government-guaranteed price of milk for fiscal 1994, farmers'  revenue from milk production will be unchanged from the previous  year.    The government sets its guaranteed producer prices for milk  every year. When market prices for milk fall below the minimum  level, the government buys up stocks to prevent further price  declines.</p>

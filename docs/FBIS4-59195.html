			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Rafiq Khuri: "A `Strike' by a Ruler and the </F> `Resignation' of a People"]    [Excerpts] It is the prime minister's right to rule or  resign, not to drop his political duties. It is his duty, if he  cannot rule and resign all at once or if he does not want to  rule yet does not want to resign, to tell the people why he has  decided not to perform his duties. Spelling things out is the  least a man should do. But if this is difficult, the motive  behind the prime minister's decision to stay home should  certainly not be to get the various groups to rally round to  declare their adherence to al-Hariri, to claim that he is  indispensable. This is the case whether the decision not to  perform his duties is halfway to resignation or, in the other  direction, to strengthening his role in office. It is also the  case whether the outcome is his return to business as usual or  to changing the people he works with. [passage omitted]    The formula is very simple. If what is required is to amend  the representation of leaders inside the government, then there  is no need for a crisis over things that neither add to nor  subtract from the situation. If the objective is to rectify the  popular representation inside the government, then what is  needed is much more than just the appointment of two more  ministers to the Cabinet. The Christian situation in Lebanon  cannot be resolved through a little game. And the Christian  situation in Lebanon cannot be resolved without addressing the  entire Lebanese situation. The Lebanese situation has many  problems, including imbalanced political and social positions,  and a virtual absence of national equality. Political life here  is dormant. The increasing internal and external debts, taxes,  and fines fall on the shoulders of the poor alone. The Middle  East peace settlement circumvents Lebanon amid fears that the  settlement will apply to and include Lebanon. When Prime  Minister al-Hariri says he can no longer tolerate the situation,  what should those who are caught in the middle of the struggle  over power between the warlords and the money barons do?    Whatever the case, a public crisis is better than a covert  one. Perhaps our case is similar to Dr. Kissinger's. After  heart surgery, he said mockingly: This proves that I have a  heart. Between their joking and their serious moments, can the  Lebanese claim that the crisis proves that politics exist in  Lebanon?</p>

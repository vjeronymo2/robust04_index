			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Woolwich launches loan aid WOOLWICH Building Society launched two schemes yesterday to help up to 1.5m people who have mortgage debts that exceed the value of their homes. A further fall in the Halifax building society's house-price index meanwhile confirmed the continued downward trend in UK house prices. One scheme offered by Woolwich, the country's fourth largest building society, would allow people to use equity in their homes as security for part of their children's new mortgage. The other scheme allows borrowers to transfer their existing mortgage, including the negative equity element, to a new home of the same or lower value. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the first scheme was the most innovative homes initiative so far. Mr Gary Marsh, house price specialist at Halifax, said: 'The pattern of 1992, of seasonally adjusted falls of 1 per cent every month, shows every sign of continuing.' Halifax is calling on the government to lower base rates by at least 2 percentage points to 6 per cent and to introduce measures, aimed particularly at first-time buyers, to stabilise house prices next year. Last month's 1.2 per cent fall in the index - 0.8 per cent after seasonal adjustment - follows a fall of 3.1 per cent in September, or 2.9 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis. The index indicates a fall of 8.7 per cent in the past year. These developments increase pressure on the government to address the decline in the housing market in its Autumn Statement next week. The Halifax index comes a day after Nationwide's house-price index recorded a fall of 2.7 per cent last month, after a 1.4 per cent fall in September. Mr Wriglesworth said: 'The two indices have come into line over the two-month period.' He attributed the sharp fall during the two months to the ending of stamp duty relief and expects house prices to be down by at least a further 5 per cent next year. Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court, said the continued fall in house prices showed that monetary policy was still too tight. Interest rates would have to be reduced significantly to initiate recovery, he said. He did not expect house prices to rise in real terms for five years. In Scotland, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday that the main concern of prospective buyers was job security. Recent interest rate cuts had not spurred people into moving home. Scotland has not suffered mortgage repossessions on the same scale as England, the institution said, but many areas report static prices and slow turnover. Mortgage lending was 'disappointing' in the third quarter of the year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday. At the end of September, outstanding loans for house purchases totalled Pounds 336.3bn, up from Pounds 330.1bn in the previous quarter and 6.6 per cent higher than for the third quarter last year.</p>

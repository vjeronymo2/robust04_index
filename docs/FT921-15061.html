			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Inconsistencies in handling civil claims across the EC condemned INCONSISTENCIES in the handling of civil claims across the European Community are preventing consumers from benefiting equally from community laws, according to a report* published today. The report by City solicitors Davies Arnold Cooper, for Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance, says differences in procedures in the civil courts of member states will continue to undermine the purpose of EC directives in terms of both the speed at which they are implemented by EC countries and the way they are enforced. The average time between issuing a writ and obtaining judgment varies from six months in Greece and Germany to 42 months in Italy. 'How can it be fair within an economic community for litigation to drag on for as long as five years in one country and only for six months or less in another?' the report asks. The authors are also critical of the variation in eligibility for legal aid in EC countries, which it says cannot be justified by local factors. These inconsistencies, when combined with inconsistencies in the level of damages in personal injury cases, suggest the EC is unwilling to ensure that important community measures are consistently applied. A study carried out by Davies Arnold Cooper in 1990 showed average damages for a fatal accident varied from Pounds 420,000 in Germany, where it takes on average six months to litigate, to Pounds 120,000 in Denmark, where a civil claim takes an average od two years. 'If the single market is to mean anything, Europe's legal systems and levels of damages must be standardised.' The authors call for: an EC working party with senior judges from each member state to look at standardisation; interchange of EC judges; harmonisation of time limits for starting cases and the type of recoverable legal costs; published guidelines for EC lawyers' fees; and standardisation of legal aid funding and administration. *Civil Procedures in EC Countries, Davies Arnold Cooper, Lloyds of London Press, Pounds 125</p>

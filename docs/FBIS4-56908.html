			<p>BFN     [Text] On 7 May in another interview on CNN, Haitian  President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide said that in case the  new sanctions against Haiti fail, the United States should  overthrow the military. It is a question of political will, he  said, nevertheless refusing to speak clearly of military  intervention. He noted: Under the Constitution, if I ask for a  military intervention, I will be dismissed.</p>

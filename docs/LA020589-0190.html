			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINNER IN MUSICAL PODIUMS  </P> <P> Almost as soon as Georg Solti made it known late in 1986 that he would retire  as music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1991, Daniel Barenboim  headed the roster of rumored heirs. After all, the 46-year-old musician had  first conducted the orchestra back in 1970, and has made more than 30  recordings with the CSO.  </P> <P> Reached at his home in Paris, Barenboim confirmed that he had signed a contract  more than a year ago with the Chicago Symphony, which made the agreement public  last week. Barenboim becomes music director designate immediately, dropping the  designate portion of the title for the 1991-92 season.  </P> <P> "I have a number of ideas about the role of the musicians, and the orchestra in  general. It is time now to look back and see how the symphony orchestra has  developed," Barenboim says. "We have made really tremendous progress in the  last 50 years in improving the social position of musicians. However, because  of the need for more concerts -- and more audiences -- the life has become a  little too much based on routine. It is all too much in compartments."  </P> <P> Barenboim's solution to the problem is to expand the activities of the  orchestra, in collaborations with other arts institutions, citing in Chicago  the opera, theaters, museums and music schools. "I would like for the Chicago  Symphony to have a catalyzing influence," he says. "I would like to give the  musicians of Chicago the widest possible opportunities."  </P> <P> His ideas may seem familiar to followers of U.S. orchestras. Ernest  Fleischmann, executive vice president of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, put  forth similar proposals in a widely discussed article, "The Orchestra Is Dead.  Long Live the Community of Musicians."  </P> <P> Barenboim is not quite ready to say that the orchestra is dead, a statement  seemingly used principally for shock value by Fleischmann. Nor does he believe  the symphony orchestra is an elitist institution.  </P> <P> "No, absolutely not," he says. Elitism, however, was one of the charges laid  against Barenboim when he was fired two weeks ago from a $1.1 million job  heading the new Opera de la Bastille in Paris.  </P> <P> "That was a very inaccurate way of describing what I wanted to do with the  Opera," Barenboim says. Nor is he plannning to go gently into operatic night.  "We are going to court now."  </P> <P> Even if the French courts disappoint him in his bid to remain as head of Opera  Bastille, Barenboim will be a busy man. He is music director of L'Orchestre de  Paris, succeeding Solti in the position in 1975, and will remain there until  1990. He conducted the new "Ring" in Bayreuth last summer, and confirms that  Bayreuth remains a long-term commitment. He also has other guest-conducting  engagements, and intends to maintain active as a piano soloist and recitalist.  </P> <P> "I don't forsee any problems," he says of this schedule. As music director  designate, Barenboim is expected to be in Chicago for at least six weeks during  each of the transitional seasons, and will share conducting duties with Solti  during the CSO tour of Japan in April, 1990. When he takes over in 1991, his  three-year contract calls for him to conduct a minimum of 12 weeks of concerts  in Chicago per season and lead all major tours.  </P> <P> "I'm going into this position in Chicago with a great sense of joy," Barenboim  says.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DICK TRACY IS ON THE CASE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE  </P> <P> Comic book character Dick Tracy found life on movie screens this summer, but a  real Dick Tracy has been fighting crime in Manchester for 11 years.  </P> <P> Police Officer Richard (Dick) Tracy said he's taken a little more ribbing than  usual about his name this summer. But he said things are still better than when  his partner was Lt. Jimmy Stewart.  </P> <P> "We'd knock on a door and they'd say 'Who's there?' We'd say 'Jimmy Stewart and  Dick Tracy,' and they'd tell us to get lost," said Tracy, who works in the  juvenile division.  </P> <P> Another time, a man he questioned called a police commissioner to complain  about a "wise guy who told me his name was Dick Tracy."  </P></p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Miller buys 20% Molson stake MILLER Brewing, the beer arm of US food and tobacco group Philip Morris, is broadening its international horizons by buying a 20 per cent stake in Molson Breweries, Canada's biggest brewer. Molson is a joint venture between Molson Companies of Toronto and Australia's Foster's Brewing. Miller's USDollars 273m (Pounds 177.3m) investment is part of a wider alliance with Molson and Foster's, which will also give the Milwaukee-based company marketing and distribution rights in the US to a range of imported beers produced by the Canadian and Australian groups. The deal will also help Molson realise a long-held ambition to join a wider international brewing alliance. Molson Companies and Foster's will each retain a 40 per cent stake in Molson Breweries, which controls about half the Canadian beer market. Revenues totalled CDollars 632m (Pounds 321m) in the six months to September 30. The company already brews Miller brands under licence in Canada. Miller will pay a royalty on Molson and Foster's sales in the US. Molson is the second-largest imported beer in the US after Heineken. Its products, led by Molson Golden and Molson Light, have a share of about 16 per cent of the imported market. Miller said yesterday that Molson and Foster's brands will be a 'strong complement' to its existing products. But Mr Allan Kaplan, brewing analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, said the deal was a small one for a company of Philip Morris's size and financial resources, and that it would only modestly augment Miller's volumes in the US. The deal with Molson follows Philip Morris's purchase last month of a 7.9 per cent interest in Fomento Economico Mexicano, Mexico's biggest beverage company. Philip Morris, through Miller Brewing which it acquired in 1970, is number two in the US beer market, with an estimated 23 per cent share behind St Louis-based Anheuser-Busch's 45.5 per cent. However, competition has been intensifying in a contracting market. Miller Brewing posted a 41.5 per cent drop in third-quarter operating profits to Dollars 55m, because of lower volumes and a provision for an early retirement programme, while operating revenues fell almost 8 per cent to Dollars 1bn.</p>

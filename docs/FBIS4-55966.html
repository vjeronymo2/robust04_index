			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, May 24 (TANJUG) -- Moslems and Croats on  Tuesday afternoon [24 May] attacked Serb positions on all  sections of the front from Doboj in the north of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, through central Bosnia-Herzegovina, to the  line of delimitation in the area of Nevesinje in the south of  this former Yugoslav republic, Bosnian Serb military sources  said on Tuesday evening. Armed forces of Bosnian Croats, the  Croatian Defense Council -- HVO, joined the Moslem forces with  their tanks and attacked Serb positions in central Bosnia,  REUTERS said on Tuesday evening, quoting sources of the United  Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia.    Bosnian Croat forces are actively helping Moslem troops  against the local Serbs, REUTERS reported from Sarajevo. Two  Croat T-55 tanks and HVO troops attacked Serb positions in a  joint action southwest of Tesanj, REUTERS said. Two M-84 tanks  also took part in this operation which began on Monday morning,  said REUTERS quoting the same source.    Moslems forces are attacking serb defense positions and  villages in fronts in the wider area of Doboj. In the afternoon  hours, Moslems shelled Doboj and Serb villages and positions  west of this town.    The Serb forces returned strong fire and neutralized the  enemy operations.    On the front southeast of Teslic (south of Doboj), Moslem  units have been trying to penetrate the Serb defense lines for  days.    Moslems are speedily building up their forces south and  southwest of Serb positions near Mt. Ozren (south of Doboj), the  First Krajina corps of the Bosnian Serb Army said. United  forces of the HVO and regular Croatian Army units on Tuesday  fired several shells at Serb positions in the area of Gradine,  on the front near Nevesinje (south of Mostar), TANJUG reported  from Bileca on Tuesday evening, quoting a statement by the  Herzegovina corps of the Bosnian Serb Army. The source also  said that Serb fighters answered the attack, thus silencing the  Croat guns.</p>

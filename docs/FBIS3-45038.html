			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Year-end commentary by XINHUA reporter Fan Liqing (5400 </F> 7787 7230): "There Are Still Repercussions From the Race for  Power and a Shadow Hangs Over the Mainland Policy -- a Review of  Taiwan's Political Situation in 1993"]    [Text] Beijing, 27 Dec (XINHUA) -- Despite a little  turbulence, on the whole Taiwan's political situation in 1993  was stable. The outcome of a five-year power struggle within  the ruling Kuomintang [KMT] was known this year. The faction in  power guided and completed an inner-party power redistribution;  the KMT consolidated the superiority it has enjoyed in local  governments in the elections for "county magistrates and city  mayors." During the year, though Taiwan somewhat relaxed the  restrictions in its policy on cross-Strait two-way exchanges and  put forward a "concept on promoting cross-Strait information  exchange," the dispute over the one-China policy resurfaced and  cast a new shadow over the development of cross-Strait relations  because the Taiwan authorities increased the publicity of the  concept of "giving priority to Taiwan" at home and vigorously  conducted so-called "return-to-the- United Nations" activities  abroad.    After Taiwan held elections for "Legislative Yuan members  for  the second term of office" at the end of 1992, the situation  became was unstable for awhile in January 1993, with disputes  revolving around whether "Executive Yuan Premier" Hao Po-tsun  should resign when "Legislative Yuan members" for the next term  of office were elected. Later, Hao Po-tsun quietly resigned  seeing as he could not get support from the KMT Central  Committee. The persistent power struggle and internecine strife  among high-level KMT officials in the five years following the  death of Jiang Jingguo [Chiang Ching- kuo] were brought to a  temporary close with the resignation of Hao Po-tsun. It also  signaled the end of an era in which high-level KMT officials of  the older generation who followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan had  been in power.    The KMT's "14th national party congress," which had been  postponed for a year so, opened in August. Just when the  congress was on the verge of a breakup, it completed a reluctant  consolidation and reorganization of the KMT. At the meeting,  the KMT created for the first time the positions of four vice  chairmen; Li Denghui [Li Teng-hui] was reelected KMT chairman.  The ruling faction completed the redistribution of leadership  powers within the KMT through the "14th national party  congress"; the new term of the KMT Central Committee boasted  that "the KMT -- a 100-year-old shop -- has been transformed"  and has the capital to "start anew." However, factional  struggles within the KMT are still very intense and complicated;  the KMT Central Committee cannot obtain a unanimous approval of  its domestic and foreign policies by those inside the party; the  race for power, contradictions between people who are natives of  Taiwan and people who come from provinces other than Taiwan,  differences in understanding and concepts, and other deep-  rooted contradictions within the party are still looking for an  opportunity to erupt. During the period of the "14th national  party congress," a faction -- "the New KMT Alliance" -- within  the KMT quit the party, established a new party, and actively  took part in the campaign for "county magistrate and city  mayoral" elections to be held at the end of the year.    This year [1993], the public has become even more wary of  the ties between Taiwan authorities and the business sector, and  some people have tried to restrain the KMT with slogans like:  "fight against money politics" and "fight against special  privileges." Against this background, the "Legislative Yuan"  adopted the "Act of Publicizing Personnel's Property," known as  the "Sunshine Act," in mid-1993, despite opposition from the  KMT- controlled executive branch. After the "public personnel"  publicized their property one group after another, people on  Taiwan have found that those who owned property ranging from 10  million new Taiwan dollars [NT] to several billion NT dollars  are all high- ranking officials or "parliamentarians." The act  has heightened people's awareness of Taiwan authorities' "money  politics."    During Taiwan's quadrennial election of "county magistrates  and mayors," which began in mid-November and ended on 27  December, 77 candidates of the KMT, the Democratic Progress  Party [DPP], and the New KMT Alliance Party, as well as  independent candidates, vied for 23 seats. Since the DPP had  overbearingly vowed to "become the ruling party within three  years," the KMT regarded the election as a "campaign to defend  the local political powers" and mobilized all KMT members to  support the KMT candidates. In an unprecedented move, the KMT  chairman and executive officials went all out to voice their  support for candidates in districts within their jurisdictions.  On the other hand, the DPP also considered the election as the  first step "toward becoming the ruling party." During the  election, instead of loudly advocating "Taiwan independence" as  it did in the past, it repeatedly underscored its social welfare  policies. The three-month-old New Party continued to advocate  "opposition against money politics and special privileges," and  used the election to test how big a space in which it could  develop between the KMT and the DPP. The election process was  replete with vicious attacks between candidates, lavish  banquets, and "wanton bombings" with propagandistic materials.  There was also endless violence and rumors of bribery.  Although the KMT was able to keep the majority seats during the  election, the total votes it acquired fell below 50 percent for  the first time, and so it is likely that in the future it will  face increasingly stronger challenges to its ruling status.    The two sides have made some headway in their business talks  this year. They made a historic step forward in their relations  with the signing of five agreements during the world-renowned  talks between Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu], which took  place in Singapore in April. For the sake that the agreements  reached in the talks can be fully implemented, Taiwan's Strait  Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the mainland's Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] have had three  follow-up working consultations in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taibei  [Taipei] during the second half of the year, and they reached  common understandings in principle on relevant issues. ARATS  representatives had the understanding and support from all walks  of life in Taiwan during their consultative meeting held in  Taiwan. With the new headway which the two associations have  achieved in their liaison and cooperation, cross-Strait business  consultations will continue.    After the talks between Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu, the  Taiwan  authorities have continued spreading the fallacy that "the talks  demonstrate the roles of the two sides as equal political  entities," and their endeavor of "developing international  space" has also gone astray as indicated by their clamor to  "return to the United Nations." However, because of the  opposition of the international community and the Chinese people  as a whole, their attempts to create "one country, two seats"  and "two Chinas," were woefully defeated because they disregard  the one China principle. In November, the official which the  Taiwan authorities sent to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic  Conference in Seattle continued to slip on the way to create  "two Chinas" by proposing the so-called "policy of two Chinas at  the present stage," and his proposal was strongly criticized by  media at home and abroad.    Taiwan will elect "county and city assemblymen" and  "township  and town magistrates" in January next year, and also the "Taiwan  governor" and "mayors of Taibei and Gaoxiong [Kaohsiung]" at the  end of the year. The new redistribution of political power in  Taiwan will certainly give rise to even more fierce fights  within the KMT and between the KMT and other political parties  in Taiwan. In 1994, power struggle will still be the theme  within Taiwan's political arena and the development of  cross-Strait relations will continue to be the focus of  attention inside and outside the island.</p>

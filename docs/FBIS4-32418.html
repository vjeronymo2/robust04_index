			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second installment of summary of the program of the </F> Right-Wing Democratic Party of Albania; date not given]    [Text]  <H5>  The Policy of the Right-Wing Democratic Party of Albania </H5> [PDDSH] on the Functioning of the Juridical State    The PDDSH is for a complete functioning of the juridical  state. The PDDSH stresses that, since the fall of the  dictatorial regime, the role of the state has been to protect  and coordinate the interests of the individual with those of  society. In the post- dictatorial period, a powerful and  rigorous state is needed to implement laws and defend the rights  of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution.    For the juridical state to function better, the PDDSH will  strive to implement the following measures:    1. To restore law and order by waging a bitter struggle  against criminals (theft, violation, drugs, prostitution, and  hooliganism). In order to achieve this, extensive powers will be  granted to the law and order forces to impose extremely severe  sanctions against dereliction of duty.    2. To determine the official status of state employees by  giving them necessary powers to perform their duties, decent pay  according to their functions, and legal protection. Criteria to  be met by state employees will also be defined, giving priority  to honesty, professionalism, and the strict implementation of  state laws.    3. For a better functioning of the legal state, a profound  reform in the justice system is necessary. Existing legislation  should be amended to include judgments by people's juries. Work  will be also be carried out to purge judicial groups of people  who, in the past, have participated in political trials or,  during the transition period, have compromised themselves while  carrying out their duties.    A profound reform in the law and order forces and the army  will be carried out in order to make these bodies serve the  juridical state with allegiance.    4. The PDSSH will firmly struggle against corruption,  speculations, and favoritism at all levels. It will persevere  with extremely severe lawful measures to discover and punish  such cases.    Within this framework, a major overhaul of the customs-duty  system, financial policy, tariff offices, forestry policy, state  inspectorates of electricity, health services, etc. will be  carried out.    5. To fully implement these laws, the PDDSH will insist that  the legislation on urban area development be further improved  and put into practice by guaranteeing buildings and other  construction sites in conformity with technical discipline and  approved plans.    6. The PDDSH supports a parliamentary republic where the  three powers -- legislative, executive, and juridical -- are led  along the fulfillment of rights set out in the Constitution.  The PDDSH is, at the same time, in favor of a popular  referendum on the form of regime to be established.    7. The PDDSH is for a secular state where religion is  separate from the state. The PDDSH honors the rights of Muslim,  Orthodox, and Catholic believers to freely observe their  religious endeavors.    The PDDSH will resolutely circumvent any religious sect in  their attempt to capitalize on citizens' religious convictions,  national interests, or democratic principles defined by the  Constitution.    Thee PDDSH underscores that it will resolutely fight for the  Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania. The PDDSH decidedly  declares itself against foreign prelates of various ranks  overseeing religious organizations in Albania.    8. The PDDSH will make all necessary efforts to secure full  equality among citizens, regardless of race, religion, sex, or  political views.    9. The PDDSH is for a better coordination of power between  central and local government bodies.  <H5>  The PDDSH's policy on the National Question </H5>   1. The PDDSH will pursue its foreign policy entirely along  the fulfillment and protection of aspirations, the rights and  interests of the Albanian nation as a whole, and the Albanian  state.    2. The PDDSH proclaims as its benevolent ideal the struggle  for the resolution of the Albanian national question -- that is,  the unification of all detached parts of the Albanian nation and  ethnic territories based on the Albanian nation's right to  self-determination in accordance with the Law of Nations.    3. The PDDSH is opposed to all kinds of malicious  propaganda,  domestic and external, by the speculative name of "Great  Albania," and it is definitely in favor of the ethnic Albania as  a national state for all Albanians as a factor for peace and  stability in the Balkans.    4. All efforts by the PDDSH reagrding foreign policy will  serve the fulfillment of the Albanian nation's aspirations for  unity. It will not accept any general or partial solution aimed  at denying legitimate endeavors for unity.    5. The PDDSH is against any tendencies, political trends, or  Albanian political forces that tend to present the Albanian  national question as a facultative task for the Albanians, thus  trying to replace nationalism with cosmopolitanism.    6. The PDDSH will strive to unite all the patriotic forces  of  the Albanian nation in the ethnic Albanian lands and diaspora in  order to serve the cause of national unification. It will  repudiate all kinds of political forces or elements who try to  bring into question the Albanian nation's right to and  capability for unification or manifest their tendencies to  conclude agreements or cooperate with foreign powers to the  detirment of the Albanian national question.  <H5>  PDDSH Foreign Policy </H5>   1. In its relations with other countries, the PDDSH will  pursue a serious, realistic, entirely nationalist, and open  policy that firmly relies on the lessons that history has taught  us, without preconceptions, or a complex of inferiority toward  others, opposing unilateral concessions that are not based on  the principles of mutual benefit and justice.    2. The PDDSH will strive to build and develop the Albanian  state's international relations on sound and safe foundations in  reasonable ways, in accordance with our country's real  possilibities, and the attitude of other states and nations  toward the Albanian nation and state.    3. Albania as a state and nation should decently take its  place in Europe next to the other nations and states.  Nationalism should not be considered as an obstacle to  Albania's integration into Europe but rather a necessity for the  united Albanian nation to take its place in united Europe  without any discrimination.    4. The PDDSH will strive to see that Albania, as an European  country, maintains broad and cordial relations with other  countries and regions of the world, especially those countries  with which it has maintained ancient traditional links,  spiritual and cultural affinity, and common interests and  principles.    5. The PDDSH is in favor of close state relations,  particularly those states and nations that are historically or  actually inclined to be close friends and allies of Albania, as  well as other countries and nations that show signs of goodwill  toward us. The PDDSH will never aim to fuel and foment  hostility toward any other nation or state, be it big or small,  near or far away. What the PDSH wants is only good  understanding, friendship, and useful cooperation.    6. The PDDSH will always be ready to develop close and  thorough relations of good neighborliness in the Balkans and  Adriactic region. It is of the opinion that relations with  Italy and Turkey are fruitful and neighborly. Possiblities are  increasing for relations with Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and  Slovenia. Relations can also be developed with nearby countries  bordering on the Albanian nation, like Greece, Serbia, Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], and Montenegro,  depending on the stand that those states maintain toward the  Albanian nation's legitimate rights of the Albanian nation and  toward the Republic of Kosovo. The PDDSH will always bear in  mind that good-neighborly relations with those states will  depend on the policy pursued by their governments.    7. The PDDSH is in favor of Albania's absolute relationship  with Kosovo as two states belonging to one and the same religion  and having the same political and diplomatic tasks to fulfill in  the field of foreign policy and international relations. The  policy of the Republic of Albania will powerfully and without  any reservations support the recognition of independence and  sovereignty of the Republic of Kosovo as a transitory period  toward national union. The PDDSH will oppose all kinds of  diplomatic plans that try to impose upon the Albanian nation in  Kosovo any narrow politico-juridical, state, or  juridico-international status that is contrary to the political  will already expressed by their votes in the referendum on the  occasion of the proclamation of the Republic of Kosovo and the  elections held in Kosovo. The PDDSH will resolutely struggle to  see that Albanians in Macedonia and Montenegro freely and  without hindrance are able to exercise their rights until the  ultimate resolution of the Albanian national question is  accomplished. The PDDSH will strive that the [word indistinct]  population return to their hearths and their property [in  northwestern Greece] taken by force, enjoying their rights as an  inseparable part of the Albanian nation.    8. The PDDSH desires and will attempt to maintain the  Albanian state's close and fruitful relations friendly nations  and countries like Austria, Germany, and Hungary, great  democratic powers like the United States, Europe's civilized and  developed countries, and Arab and all other countries.    9. The PDDSH supports the participation of Albania in  universal organizations, important international bodies, and  organizations of regional character. The PDDSH attaches  importance to the participation of the Albanian state through  relevant bodies in activities of cooperation and understanding  in the Balkans, the Adriatic Sea, Europe, the Mediterranean and  Black Sea, in the Conference of the Islamic Countries, and in  other bodies that might be set up in the future.    10. The PDDSH proposes that the Albanian state set up a  diplomatic service of genuine national physiognomy, spirit, and  professional qualification that is capable of properly  performing its duties toward their nation and serving the cause  of the Albanian national question and its long-term mission.    11. The PDDSH will always be ready to coordinate efforts and  actions and discuss them with all Albanian political forces that  are sincerely in favor of a genuine foreign and national policy  on the part of the Albanian state on the international policy  front. However, the PDDSH will resolutely reject and repudiate  any compromise that might undermine and impair the resolution of  the Albanian national question, sacrifice the rights and  interests of our brothers in their ethnically occupied  territories, or damage the sovereignty and dignity of the  Albanian nation and state.    12. The PDDSH will strive to see that Albania and the  Albanians earn the world's sympathy and respect, thus achieving  a good understanding but not pleading for them. It will oppose  all practices of various states or international bodies that try  to bring Albania under a certain degree of foreign political and  juridical tutelage.</p>

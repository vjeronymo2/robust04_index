			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Russian government seeks 10% export tax THE Russian government is demanding a new, 10 per cent tax on all exports in an effort to raise funds to pay off the Dollars 80bn debt it inherited from the former Soviet Union. The demand is a measure of the desperate straits in which the government finds itself - faced with massive tax evasion and a rapid fall in income as production and living standards plummet. Government estimates show that over the past year, a gap of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn opened up between the volume of goods exported and what the government should have received in existing export taxes. At the same time, the precipitous fall of the rouble against hard currencies has meant that the government must now again subsidise imports, to the tune of half of the credit created each month. Russian exporters are already among the most heavily taxed traders in the world. Non-payment of taxes through use of offshore accounts is common, thus compounding the government's hard currency problems.</p>

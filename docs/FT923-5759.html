			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Antidote for paracetamol The British Technology Group has licensed Penn Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of products used for the prevention and treatment of poisoning, to manufacture and distribute tablets combining paracetamol with its antidote, methionine, which helps to prevent liver damage if large doses of paracetamol are taken. Although paracetamol, known in many places by the brand name Tylenol, is a widely used an effective pain reliever, an overdose can be fatal because it leads to irreversible liver damage unless the patient receives swift treatment. Methionine is an amino acid that increases the level in the liver of a substance called glutathione, which protects the liver from paracetamol poisoning. The combination of methionine with paracetamol in a single tablet or capsule provides a safer painkiller with built-in protection against liver damage. BTG holds patents on the combination. British Technology Group: UK, 071 403 6666. Penn Pharmaceuticals: UK, 0495 711711.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Greenfield sites 'fail to inspire' EMPLOYEES at greenfield sites are no more motivated than workers elsewhere and are usually poached from other employers rather than recruited from the unemployed, says a study published today. A survey of 67 employees at three greenfield sites found they were more likely to say their job was 'just a means of earning a living' and that they were less likely to 'work as hard as they could regardless of pay' compared with views expressed in the national British Social Attitudes Survey. Dr Helen Newell of Warwick University Business School, author of the study published in Personnel Management Plus, says unrealistic job descriptions - emphasising challenging work, autonomy, flexibility and training - create inflated expectations among recruits which can lead to job dissatisfaction and absenteeism. The three companies surveyed were involved in brewing, textiles and cable-making.</p>

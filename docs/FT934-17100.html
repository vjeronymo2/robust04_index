			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DERIVATIVES markets yesterday recovered the good form shown earlier this week, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index returning to a 32 point premium against cash, as the market braced itself for the final trading quarter of the year, writes Terry Byland. However, trading volume was less impressive, with the December contract trading only 7,773 contracts. The day opened with a sell-off which took December down to 3,045, depressing the underlying blue chips also. Most of the business came from the locals or independent traders. The big institutions had completed their end-of-quarter operations and were content to wait until Monday when the new equity market account opens; fair value on the futures, still at 24 points yesterday, drops to around 21 on Monday, when dividend flows will depress the FT-SE Index by about 2.5. Business in the FT-SE traded option halved to 7,207 contracts in a market also quieter, at a total of 20,776 against 28,864. Asda (1250) headed the individual stocks list.</p>

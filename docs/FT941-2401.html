			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lihir Gold flotation threatened with delay The flotation of Lihir Gold Company, which will have the RTZ Corporation of the UK as its biggest shareholder and operator, is threatened with delay because of recent upheavals in the government of Papua New Guinea. The company, which will develop one of the world's biggest gold mines in the crater of an extinct volcano on the PNG island of Lihir, is scheduled to be floated on the Australian stock exchange in September. It is expected to be valued at more than Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 820m). However, the PNG government has not yet issued a Special Mining Lease for the project, without which the flotation process will stall. This lease was expected to be issued in January at the latest. But, Mr Pias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, reshuffled his cabinet and the new minister for mines, Mr John Kaputin, will not be hurried into giving a decision. The delay is costing RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, some useful cash flow. Only after the licence is issued will RTZ complete a deal agreed a year ago to sell another 16 per cent to Nuigini Mining, its partner in the project, for Dollars 48m. The PNG government is to take 30 per cent of the project for Dollars 42m, its share of the Dollars 138m spent by the partners so far. When Lihir Gold is set up, RTZ will raise about Dollars 300m in debt financing. Lihir will be floated to raise Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m. PNG citizens will get preferential treatment to take about 10 per cent of the company and the Malaysian Mining Corporation is expected to emerge with up to 20 per cent, either bought from RTZ or via a placement or sub-underwriting. RTZ would be left as operator of the mine with 24-30 per cent of the new company, and Nuigini Mining, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold of the US, with 18-23 per cent. Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of Nuigini, said at the weekend that he was confident the Special Mining Lease would be issued. 'But we are all on tenterhooks. Obviously, if the lease is not issued until mid-year the flotation schedule would have to be changed.' RTZ was continuing talks with bankers about raising the debt and some technical work was being carried out on the Dollars 625m project.</p>

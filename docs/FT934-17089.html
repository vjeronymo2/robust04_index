			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lufthansa/UAL The winds of change are whistling through the airline industry so fast that it is becoming ever more difficult for carriers to chart a steady course. The proposed link-up between Lufthansa and United Airlines opens up a new competitive front and provides further evidence of rapid global consolidation. Moreover, Europe may soon see the creation of another international force if the Alcazar alliance becomes a reality. That merged carrier will doubtless be keen to forge effective transatlantic links. The Lufthansa-UAL alliance will increase the pressure on Delta, which has a big presence at Frankfurt. But British Airways, too, which has been winning traffic by siphoning off transatlantic passengers from Germany, will face a trickier task. As the biggest US international carrier, United was once BA's preferred US partner. United's big presence at Heathrow and in the important US-Pacific region may considerably discomfit the British carrier once a working relationship with Lufthansa has been established. A possible weakness in the Lufthansa-UAL link-up could be the lack of financial commitments. With bitter experience, BA argues equity holdings are necessary to cement trading relationships. Lufthansa, though, seems likely to eschew this approach. In truth, it may have little option. The state-owned German carrier is cutting costs with a vengeance to ready itself for privatisation and can ill afford the cash. The tangled web enmeshing its vast pension fund obligations has also to be resolved with the government.</p>

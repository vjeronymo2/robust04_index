			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Alcazar partners confront US issue THE selection of a US airline partner for the Alcazar project to merge the operations of four European airlines has been given fresh urgency. Swissair said yesterday that it and the three other airlines in the project  -KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines - had decided to resolve the issue of selecting a US partner before signing a memorandum of understanding in the next few weeks. In August, the four agreed to shelve the US partner issue in the interest of reaching early agreement on other important issues by mid-September. However, that timetable has slipped, creating time for consideration of the US partner issue. 'We now intend to solve the big questions before the memorandum of understanding. To leave a question like this to future discussions would not make sense. It has to be solved anyway,' Swissair said, adding that there was no longer a definite timetable for conclusion of the talks. The airlines' dilemma is that three of the four have trade ties with different US airlines - Swissair with Delta Airlines, KLM with Northwest Airlines and SAS with Continental Airlines - but Alcazar would need only one. Moreover, the issue is sufficiently important that none of the four would want to go ahead with the Alcazar project without knowing and being comfortable with the selection. The KLM-Northwest connection would appear to be the most promising because the US and the Netherlands have an 'open skies' agreement. Also, KLM has a 20 per cent equity stake in Wings Holdings, Northwest's parent. However, Swissair feels strongly about being associated with Delta's quality image. The ties between the two are just beginning to bear fruit. 'It would be very difficult for us to break the Delta link,' Swissair said. Potential US partners are reported to have been asked to make presentations to the Alcazar companies, but Swissair said only that there were active negotiations.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Radhanath Chaturvedi: "India and China: </F> Extending the Hand of Friendship to Each other"]    [Text] Some recent incidents seem to hint that the chasm  created between India and China during the 1962 confrontation is  becoming narrower now. One of the indicators of this change is  China's reaction to the Pakistani resolution in the UN Human  Rights Commission [UNHRC] meeting in Geneva.    Pakistan is so agitated over the Jammu-Kashmir issue that it  raises it at every international platform and is always  defeated. It brought this issue up in the form of a resolution  in the UNHRC meeting in Geneva. Pakistan first suggested that an  international task force be sent to Kashmir for investigating  human rights violations there and that a report be presented in  the 49th session of the United Nations. Later, it amended this  resolution and demanded that the situation related to human  rights violations be investigated and India be asked to protect  human rights there. It did not mention India in the first draft,  however, the finger was clearly pointed towards India. India was  mentioned by name in the amended resolution.    There are 53 members on this commission and China is one of  them. Usually, China supports Pakistan against India, however,  this time China said when the resolution was introduced that if  Pakistan insisted on a vote then it would not participate in the  vote. This is a new development. Also, when Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto went to Beijing on official visit, she had asked  the Chinese leaders to support Pakistan openly over the  Jammu-Kashmir issue. China had expressed disagreement over the  proposal which was made public in the communication published  after the Pakistani prime minister's visit.    After the fall of the Soviet Union, no major world power is  left to support India at the international level over the  Jammu-Kashmir issue. The U.S. attitude is known to all. Against  this background, the Chinese attitude from the Indian  perspective was very welcome, and still is.    An even more important fact than these two developments is  the meeting of military officials and diplomats from India and  China to discuss the border-related differences between the two  countries. Although no decisions were made in this meeting held  in New Delhi, the atmosphere lacked tension and the attitude on  every issue was cooperative and productive. In this meeting,  discussion centered around such topics as making some changes in  the Line of Control in the northeastern region, changing sites  of some military posts, reducing the number of soldiers, and  starting and increasing trade across the border. It is clear  that some of these problems are so old that these cannot be  resolved in a single meeting. Therefore, one or two more  meetings will be held. The next meeting following the diplomatic  protocol should be held in Beijing, and will take place soon.    The series of these meeting started after Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao's visit to China in September 1993. However, the  efforts to improve relations began in the early 80s. In December  1988, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited China. The  groundwork he created for goodwill was further enhanced by  Defense Minister Sharad Pawar's visit to China. A deputation  from the National Defense College visited China in 1990. On  their invitation, a representative group from the Chinese  National Defense University came to visit India. At that time,  military deputations were encouraged to visit each other. The  vice commander of the Chinese army visited India after about  three decades. After about 40 years, a Chinese naval ship docked  at an Indian port in Bombay.    All these remind one of the days when India and China had  come into contact at the Bandug Conference [1954]. Both  countries had jointly expressed faith in the Panchashila  principles. This relationship was poisoned with Zhou Enlai's  demand to have Aksai Chin, forcible occupation of Tibet, India's  silent acceptance, and finally the war on the northeastern  border in 1962. The final episode destroyed the late Krishna  Menon's dream of friendship between the two nations, and killed  the first Prime Minister Nehru. Mr. Nehru was greatly hurt by  the Chinese attack and could not bear it. It took 20-25 years to  dissolve the bitterness that was created in 1962.    It is true that India can take a sigh of relief at the  indications of both countries coming together. However, there is  no reason to stop worrying and become complacent.    The main reason for India's worry is the Chinese progress in  the area of nuclear technology for weapons. Secondly, China is  still supplying weapons to Pakistan. China's recent sale of 11  missiles to Pakistan has shaken us up. Even worse than this is  China's attitude about trade. The United States used to supply  weapon to Pakistan in the past. The mention of Star warplanes  was often made in this context. However, the United States was  upset at Pakistan's efforts at making nuclear bombs. It began to  lose interest in Pakistan and restricted supply of weapons to an  extent. China came forward at such an opportunity and started  to supply missiles and other weapons. These missiles cannot be  used against any country except India. China considers the sale  of these missiles to be purely a business deal. When India  expressed its concern, a Chinese government spokesman said that  India can also purchase these missiles and other weapons from  China if it so desires. It is willing to supply these to India  also. This situation definitely causes concern. It puts a  question mark on the efforts China has made to improve relations.    As for the border dispute, this is a major issue for India.  India has seas on three sides. Except for Pakistan and China,  there are friendly nations on our borders. There is no military  danger from other countries. However the same cannot be said of  China. The country, with over one billion in population is 3,000  miles long and 2,500 miles wide. Its borders meet with 11 other  countries. These countries are: North Korea, some regions of the  former Soviet Union, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Nepal, India,  Bhutan, Burma. Laos, and Vietnam. Pakistan has also joined as a  neighbor of China now because China has taken over 2,000 square  miles of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.    There are very few countries with which China does not have  border-related disputes. It disagrees with North Korea over the  border in the Chang Chai mountains. Its border problems with the  former Soviet Union is well known. There is disagreement with  Myanmar over some areas in Yennan province. China has such  economic, military and trade relations with Vietnam and Laos,  and they have so much open travel among the three countries that  it is not known where one country's border begins or ends. China  disagrees with Nepal over Mount Everest. China says that Mount  Everest is in China [Tibet] and Nepal says it is in Nepal. The  groups that come to climb the Everest get permission from the  Nepalese government. China has disputes with Mongolia also.  Thus, involvement in border disputes has become a part of  China's political life style.    If we can leave the border dispute alone and give some time  for it to be resolved, the efforts that India and China are  making to normalize their relations should continue. It appears  very possible that these will continue and both countries will  continue to have close ties.</p>

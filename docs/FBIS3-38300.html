			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn/Washington (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl  today appealed to U.S. governors for investment in eastern  Germany. There will be "the most modern locations for industry  some time in the future" in eastern Germany, Kohl said in a  speech to the annual conference of the National Governors'  Association in Washington, the text of which was released in  Bonn. He said there will be "very interesting opportunities"  there for the American states.    Three years after German unification "the worst is behind"  eastern Germany, the chancellor stressed. Even now investment  per head of population is higher than in western Germany. This  shows that a positive development has started despite the  difficult catching up process.    Kohl, who was the first foreign head of state to speak at  the  governors' conference, also stressed that Germany wants to  further expand the transatlantic partnership with the United  States. This is as vitally significant for Germany as European  political union. Efforts for an independent European security  policy and defense complement and strengthen NATO and will also  lead to less of a burden being placed on the United States.    The chancellor added that the "world's hopes and  expectations" are directed toward the United States. Securing  democracy and the market economy in the part of Europe which  used to be communist is "the great task of the future" for  America, Germany, and their partners. He also agreed with  President Bill Clinton that it is a matter of helping Russia and  the other states undergoing reform along the path to stable  democracy "by combining our forces." Otherwise those states will  have to pay too high a price themselves.</p>

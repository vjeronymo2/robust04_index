			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Late falls for peseta and krone THE SPANISH peseta, Portuguese escudo and Danish krone came under strong selling pressure in the European afternoon yesterday, as dealers remained concerned that the Bundesbank might not cut its official interest rates at its council meeting tomorrow, writes James Blitz. The French franc remained relatively calm inside the exchange rate mechanism. But dealers wondered how the market - and particularly the fund manager community - might respond if the Bundesbank did not lower the discount rate by one percentage point at its last council meeting before the summer. For the second day running the market did little in anticipation of the Bundesbank's move. The French franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark to close at FFr3.416 from a previous FFr3.414. The main event in the ERM yesterday was the peseta's fall to the bottom of the currency grid, as speculators went short of the currency. The Spanish currency bottomed out at Pta80.90 per D-Mark, prompting a rise in the country's overnight lending rates to 13.50 per cent from the 12.95 per cent of the previous day. The peseta ended at Pta80.89, against Monday's close of Pta80.15. Undermining the peseta was the belief that the Spanish government was unwilling to sustain high interest rates for much longer. At the weekend, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, was reported as saying that his economic priorities were 'first, jobs, second, jobs, and third, jobs'. Adding to the uncertainty were rumours that Spanish unemployment would be confirmed at 22 per cent in the second quarter, against 21.7 per cent in the first. The peseta's drop prompted more falls for the Portuguese escudo and Danish krone. The Danish currency fell to about DKr3.8930 per D-Mark at the close, having been at DKr3.8915 at the start of trading. Sterling fell back sharply yesterday after the Confederation of British Industry produced a gloomy survey of manufacturing industry showing that weakening export markets put the recovery at risk. After a powerful performance on Monday, the pound lost 2 pfennigs yesterday to close at DM2.5700. Against its Exchange Rate Index sterling was down 50 basis points on the day at 81.5. The setback for the UK currency may partly have been due to difficulties breaching the DM2.59 level, which marked the pound's high point since September of last year. However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, believes an appre-ciation to DM2.65 is possible, especially if the ERM crisis drags on. The dollar remained resilient against the D-Mark in spite of a monthly drop in US consumer sentiment in July from 58.6 to 57.7. It closed at DM1.7255, compared with a previous DM1.7245. In New York it ended at DM1.7270.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Ward back in black with Pounds 0.3m IMPROVED income in housebuilding, rental income and property disposals, enabled Ward Holdings to record a pre-tax profit of Pounds 347,000 for the half year to April 30. That compared with a loss of Pounds 1.8m in the corresponding period, which increased to Pounds 5.29m by the end of that year. Turnover in housebuilding came to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9.2m). Trading conditions in the south-east of England continued to be depressed but the company sold more houses than last time. Margins continued to be squeezed, the market overhang of housing stock remained and problems created by repossessions continued, said Mr Denis Ward, chairman. Sales of industrial and commercial units were being achieved where lettings had been secured. Contracts had also been exchanged for the sale of part of the Lordswood Industrial Estate. Gross rents and property disposals totalled Pounds 8.32m (Pounds 1.08m). Earnings per share were 0.7p (2.3p losses). Value of the land bank will be reviewed on October 31 so the directors were unable to determine likely results for the year.</p>

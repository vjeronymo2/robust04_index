			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While section 10(j) of the Act requires each Bank to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an AHP, and vests in the Board broad authority to regulate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banks' AHP activities through regulations implementing the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 10(j) does not specifically assign the responsibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating the AHP to the Board. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). The Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does have other statutorily designated duties, including issuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that specify activities eligible to receive subsidized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advances under the AHP, ensuring advances are used to assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects for which adequate long-term monitoring is available,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring that a preponderance of assistance provided under the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is ultimately received by low- and moderate-income households, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring that AHP subsidies provided by Banks to members are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passed on to the ultimate borrower. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1430(j)(9) (A), (C),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D), (E). However, section 10(j) does not specify what entity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for administering the AHP, and what entity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for determining which AHP applications are approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the following reasons, the Board is proposing that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banks assume the responsibility for determining which AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications are approved for funding. First, the Banks have had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three and one-half years of experience with the AHP, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience has included processing AHP applications, scoring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications, and recommending applications for approval to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board as described above. Consequently, the Banks are already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing and reviewing applications under the existing system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, decentralization of the AHP is consistent with the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System's Strategic Plan, which calls for decentralization of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of functions currently conducted by the Board, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception of those Board activities involving oversight and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision of the Banks. See ``System 2000: A Long-Term Strategic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan For The Federal Home Loan Bank System.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The details of the proposed new application approval process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are discussed further below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board specifically requests comments as to whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banks should be given the authority to approve and disapprove AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also revises the Board's existing AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation by allowing each Bank to define more specifically its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own priorities and scoring criteria, subject to certain overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority and scoring parameters established in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank would be required to include such proposed priorities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scoring criteria in its AHP implementation plan which must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Board. Under the Board's existing AHP regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Banks have much less flexibility in defining priorities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scoring criteria. See 12 CFR 960.5 (a) through (e). In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the proposed rule, certain point values for scoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories would be revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The details of the proposed revisions for adopting priorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and scoring criteria are discussed further below under the scoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of AHP applications section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Bank Establishment of AHP and Adoption of AHP Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.2(a) of the proposed rule generally reiterates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement in &sect;960.2(a) of the Board's existing AHP regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is the policy of the Board and the Banks to promote decent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and safe affordable housing and to address critical affordable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing needs through providing subsidized advances and direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidies to members pursuant to the AHP. See 12 CFR 960.2(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.2(b) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> board of directors shall establish an AHP, which shall be funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the requirements of &sect;960.18 of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See discussion below under the required annual AHP contributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.) The Bank is required to make subsidized advances to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants pursuant to its AHP and to operate its AHP in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity with an annual AHP implementation plan and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this part. Direct subsidies provided by a Bank to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants pursuant to its AHP also shall be provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity with the Bank's AHP implementation plan and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this part. Each Bank's AHP implementation plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be approved by the Board before it is effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.2(b) of the proposed rule further provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP implementation plan must meet the requirements of this part,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and shall include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: McKechnie improves to Pounds 24.5m - Cost controls and introduction of new products behind advance THE INTRODUCTION of new products and tight cost controls helped McKechnie, the international plastics and metal components group, increase pre-tax profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 24.5m in the year to July 31. The Midlands-based group said that the growth, achieved on turnover ahead 10 per cent to Pounds 314.4m, came from focused management rather than improving economic conditions. Mr Michael Ost, chief executive, said: 'Current trading is showing only patchy improvement and we believe it will be the second half of our financial year before any significant upturn in economic activity can be expected.' Profits before interest increased from Pounds 23.3m to Pounds 25.2m, although operating profits in the key plastics business fell from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 5.9m. The decline, more than offset by improvements in consumer and specialist products, was blamed on a Pounds 224,000 loss on US operations compared with a Pounds 2.2m profit last time. Mr Ost said the poor performance in the US was due mainly to restructuring costs and weak volume sales. Management restructuring in the US, costing Pounds 1.1m, was included in 'net one-time costs' which totalled Pounds 2.3m. These included Pounds 1.6m on redundancies and a Pounds 700,000 loss on foreign exchange transactions. Gearing increased from 2 per cent to 8.4 per cent following the Pounds 47.3m acquisition of Savage Group, the UK manufacturer of home improvement products. Savage contributed Pounds 1.2m to pre-interest profits in the 10 weeks following its acquisition. McKechnie also purchased Accord Industries, the New Zealand machine retailer, for Pounds 1.3m and, since the year-end, Phipps International, the Australian architectural hardware manufacturer, for Pounds 5m. Mr Ost said the acquisitions in Australasia reflected the group's determination to exploit markets in the Pacific Rim, where pre-interest profits increased 46 per cent to Pounds 7.3m. Although borrowings increased to cover these acquisitions, gearing was low enough to enable the group to consider further purchases, he added. 'We're in a position to make both large and small buys.' Earnings per share advanced from 19.7p to 21.4p. An unchanged final dividend of 9.75p maintains the total at 14.75p. COMMENT By focusing on its core activities McKechnie has managed to come through the UK recession, but adverse trading conditions - especially in plastics - means it is still having to squeeze margins and costs. It is looking at new acquisitions in Europe but is unlikely to proceed before the end of 1994. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 31m next year put the shares, down 13p at 432p, on a multiple of 17.7. Although the strong balance sheet and low gearing makes them a safe investment, the company's strategy envisages only slow organic growth rather than a swift upturn in profitability.</p>

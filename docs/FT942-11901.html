			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Civil Guard on trail of its fugitive former chief The young man on duty outside the Civil Guard headquarters in Madrid fingered his automatic weapon and laughed nervously. No, the force would not be affected. But it was still 'a blemish'. People did not like it. The 'blemish' is the extraordinary story of Mr Lus Roldan, six months ago the Guard's chief, now a fugitive wanted for questioning and hunted by the paramilitary police he used to have under his orders. Mr Roldan, 51, who managed to combine the post with extensive property purchases and a jet-setting lifestyle, was last year tipped as a candidate for interior minister. The man who got the job instead, Mr Antoni Asuncion, handed in his resignation at the weekend over Mr Roldan's embarrassing disappearance, becoming the first senior victim of Spain's current scandals. Opposition politicians are now baying for more blood, including that of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, who appointed Mr Roldan. The headquarters building was where Mr Roldan's business partner, Mr Jorge Esparza, would (according to the latter's evidence to a parliamentary committee) walk out with briefcases stuffed with money on his way to a bank. Mr Esparza said he did not know where the cash came from. A Civil Guard general told the committee Mr Roldan would choose contractors for new barracks after calling them into his office. Mr Roldan has denied taking commissions. Controversy also surrounds the use of 'reserved funds', alleged to have been used to provide pay bonuses. Mr Roldan, who denies using these funds, has said the records have routinely been destroyed. While in his post, Mr Roldan bought houses and other properties, mostly through a company called Europe Capital. He and Mr Esparza also travelled extensively. In one instance, confirmed by Mr Roldan, an official chauffeur drove his car to Switzerland for the use of his wife, who had travelled there by air. The Civil Guard has not made such headlines since Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero held up parliament at gunpoint in 1981. The latest publicity has spoilt the forthcoming 150th anniversary of the 75,000-strong force, which polices the Spanish countryside and roads, protects official buildings and which has borne the brunt of Basque terrorism. The force's shiny black tricorn hats have given way to green cloth caps, softening the image of what the poet Lorca called 'those patent-leather men with their patent-leather souls'. Mr Roldan, a Socialist party member until his recent expulsion, was the first civilian to head the force. For an administration already hit by allegations against a former Bank of Spain governor, the controversy has eclipsed all other affairs of government. Interviewed in hiding by the daily El Mundo, Mr Roldan said there were similar irregularities elsewhere in the Interior Ministry and other departments. 'If I go to prison, I could easily not go alone.'</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices slip to fresh 5-year lows Oil prices tested new five-year lows yesterday as markets continued to react to last week's decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries not to cut output. At one stage the benchmark Brent Blend for January delivery broke through the psychological Dollars 14-a-barrel barrier, before recovering to around Dollars 14.25 in late London trading, about 10 cents down on Friday's close. There was little optimism among traders or analysts that prices would recover in the short term. Neither was there much support for Opec's view that winter demand in the northern hemisphere would soon lead to surplus stocks being eroded, thus clearing the way for higher prices. 'Prices in a balanced market stay still,' said Mr Lindsay Horn, a trader at Lehman Brothers Securities in London. Yesterday's price weakness was exacerbated by Iraq's announcement last Friday that it was prepared to accept United Nations' monitoring of factories capable of manufacturing military equipment, a prerequisite for a resumption of oil exports.</p>

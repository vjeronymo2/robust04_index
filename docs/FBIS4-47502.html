How Will It  Be Satisfied?'']    [Text] Today the only way higher educational institutions  [VUZs] cannot train personnel for industry and science at the  level of world requirements is by using the information  resources that are accessible to higher education in developed  countries, which is to say by working in a computer network  system whose service is maximally adapted to meet scientists'  and teachers' needs.    In Russia, computer networks have also been actively  developed in the past few years. Unfortunately, most of these  networks are commercial networks (for example, Relcom, IASNET,  Sprint) where the price per amount of information sent (i.e.,  the price for traffic) is rather high and the amount of  information sent by science and higher education is  traditionally large.    The use of noncommercial networks, where traffic is free of  charge, would therefore be far more valuable for the development  of higher education. The inter-higher educational institution  [intervuz] information infrastructure of the Russian Federation  State Committee on Higher Education, which could be closely tied  to already existing international scientific research and  educational noncommercial networks, could become such a network.    In view of the formation of the United National Center for  Coordination (NIIC SUEARN/FREEnet/UNICOM-RUSSIA) of the  respective programs of development of telecommunications of the  Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Federation State  Committee on Higher Education, the creation in Russia of a  research and education network with its own higher education  information resources (a project to develop higher educational  institution data bases, knowledge networks, library  telecommunication networks, and other resources along the line  of UNICOM-RUSSIA) and virtually unlimited access to all  resources of international academic and scientific networks (the  Academy of Sciences project SUEARN/FREEnet) has become a real  possibility.    There are a number of prerequisites permitting rather rapid  creation of a well-developed electronic infrastructure for  intervuz information exchange in Yaroslavl and the northwestern  region based on the computer system of Yaroslavl State  University.    The university has a data processing center with affiliates  in the following: the biology, mathematics, and economics  departments; the information science laboratory of the  information science and computer engineering department of the  new information technologies center; computer support group of  and the political research center of the social sciences  department. The existing segment of the heterogeneous education  and research network was created on the basis of the Yaroslavl  State University Data Processing Center, which includes computer  systems of different levels ranging from personal computers of  the IBM PC/386 and 486 (OS UNIX, MS DOS, Windows) class and  computers of the YeS 1061 (OS VM/SP RSCS) mainframe type to  modern network servers of the SPARC Classic (OS Solaris) type.    Systems have been developed for interaction of a segment of  a  network with a central computer cluster in the NICC  SUEARN/FREEnet/UNICOM-RUSSIA at the Organic Chemistry Institute  imeni N.D. Zelinski of the Russian Academy of Sciences by using  a multiprotocol technology that makes it possible to implement  up to four logical channels based on one physical channel (in  our case, the protocols NYE, TCP/IO, and X.25 are implemented  simultaneously). This process was used in a system of  noncommercial open networks for the first time in the Russian  Federation. Operation along switched telephone lines for users  at other higher educational institutions in accordance with the  UUCP protocol is supported.    Operation of a bridge-radio channel connecting the data  processing center's central local area network with its segment  in the mathematics department (a distance of up to 6 km) has  been started up and is being supported.    Network software that is part of the standard for  mathematics  software of the international nodes of university computer  centers, i.e., NETSERV, LISTSERV, NETNEWS, Internet Gopher (in  server and client versions), and ASTRA, has been installed at  the research and education network's hosts, (at)SUYARS.BITNET,  (at)UNIV.YARS.free.net, (at)ICN.YARS.free.net, and  (at)CLASSIC.YARS.free.net. A whole series of programs are in the  development stage: formation of departmental local area networks  with plans to combine them into a single university local area  network and to then integrate them into the EARN/BITNET/Internet  global international networks; a university data processing  center; and organizatio of a full-scale regional center of the  research and education network.    Training of scientific and teaching personnel and students  at  higher educational institutions in the principles of working in  open-type global international networks has begun. New software  supporting the teaching process based on the use of  international teleconference materials and remote information  resources (including the conduct of teleconferences on  LISTSERV(at)SUYARS.BITNET) are being assimilated. The computer  center at Yaroslavl State University is conducting enterprising  research in the development of an optimal scheme for using  computer resources at the oblast's scientific research  institutes and higher educational institution for scientific  research and educational purposes. This scheme is based on  Internet-type technologies and makes it possible to integrate  mainframe-type high-efficiency computers at multiple-access  computer centers and local area networks of personal computers.    The first phase of experimental computer data bases on  instructional process quality control systems (specialization:  chemistry, biology, ecology) with interactive and E-mail  teleaccess is being prepared and installed.    A systems analysis of teleconference information flows on  international list servers and different file servers is being  conducted, and systematic information service of a number of  scientific directions at the departments of Yaroslavl State  University has begun.    Satisfactory results have been obtained in working in a  remote terminal mode with a catalogue of electronic libraries of  very large universities in the United States and Europe,  including the U.S. Library of Congress.    Overall coordination of the development of the network's  materials and equipment and software base was conducted at  Yaroslavl State University's Data Processing Center within the  framework of cooperation with the National United Center of  International Projects RAN/SUEARN/FREEnet and the Russian  Federation State Committee on Higher Education (University  Communications UNICOM-RUSSIA). Work related to using the  information resources of international computer networks in the  instructional process (the data processing center's affiliate at  Yaroslavl State University's biology department) was conducted  during the course of the implementation of a number of  directions of the Universities of Russia program.    To date, nodes of EARN/BITNET and FREEnet/Yaroslavl State  University have been registered in international routing tables,  including in the largest U.S. networks.    Plans for the future include work in four directions  involving implementation of ideas developed in the past 15  months, provided that sufficient financing is available. In  essence, this is that fragment of the federal plan that was  developed at the national coordination center  FREEnet/SUERN/UNICOM (Organic Chemistry Institute imeni N.D.  Zelinskiy, Russian Academy of Sciences).    Our experience in developing computer networks indicates  that  it is, for all practical purposes, possible to develop segments  of a unified research and educational network in the Russian  Federation based on data processing centers at the universities  and institutes of the Russian Federation State Committee on  Higher Education with implementation of a program of  reoutfitting already operating computer centers and equipping  them with both personal computers and workstations and  multiple-access computers.</p>

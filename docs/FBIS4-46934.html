			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Radio VVS Editor in Chief Vladimir Oshchenko: </F> "Radio VVS Is Vladivostok Today--At 1413 kHz Frequency"]    [Text] Next week, Radio VVS (Vladivostok Today) will  commence operations. It will broadcast daily for 14 hours at  1413 kHz frequency in the medium-wave range (between Youth  Channel and VBC) from 0700 to 2100. We will publish the precise  date of the Radio VVS first broadcast as soon as the Vladivostok  city telephone company completes the work for which it already  has been paid, the technical substantiation for which has been  in the works at the telephone company since April.    Radio VVS is another information channel owned by AO  [joint-stock society] Vladivostok-Novosti, which currently  publishes VLADIVOSTOK, TIKHIY OKEAN, VLADIVOSTOK-REKLAMA, and  VLADIVOSTOK NEWS newspapers. The need to set up a new radio  station was dictated first and foremost by the information needs  of Vladivostok residents. It was also these needs that defined  the structural basis of Radio VVS programs: 20 minutes of each  of 14 hours (from 0700 to 2100) will be devoted to news--the  most current, just-received news.    Imagine: On a weekend you are at a dacha or on the sea  shore... Moscow radio programs are too far removed from the life  of the Far East and Maritime Kray; besides, when something  happens here, it is usually the middle of the night in Moscow. A  portable radio tuned to Radio VVS will bring you all the  information about events happening in the city and kray.    How much did AO Vladivostok-Novosti journalists regret that  they did not have access to air waves on 14 May! This day is  remembered for its bad news: the explosion in Novonezhino  arsenal, evacuation of residents of Romanovka and other  villages, and, of course, rumors and anxiety. I am convinced  that there would be fewer rumors had Radio VVS already been in  operation. Our correspondents knew about the incident one hour  after it happened, and an AO VLADIVOSTOK-NOVOSTI journalist even  managed to squeeze into the car that took members of the  commission for emergency situations to Novonezhino. Maritime  Kray residents could have listened to reports from the incident  site as shells were still exploding, and then read the  VLADIVOSTOK newspaper with all the details and particulars two  days later.    But, of course, this is about more than just emergency  situations. Numerous events take place in our city and kray that  any person who feels himself an active member of society would  find useful to know--be it economic and sociopolitical items or  the news from everyday life of the city.    Some may say: Why set up another radio station in the city  that already has Radio Vladivostok and VBC? And we will reply:  The more stations, the better. Each of them has its own audience  of listeners, and those who do not have a strong preference for  one particular station simply will have a choice. Besides, let  us admit it--each radio station has its own specialty: Radio  Vladivostok has great shows and expensive prizes; VBC has  innovative advertisement, round-the-clock music. Radio VVS dares  to make the emphasis in its programming on the latest news about  the events and life in Vladivostok. Of course, it will be  supplemented by musical programs.    Radio VVS information programs will be anchored by  journalists whose names are very familiar to VLADIVOSTOK  readers: Andrey Ostrovskiy, Marina Lobova, Aleksandr Kartashov,  Sergey Filonenko, Aleksandr Maltsev, Dmitriy Khabalov. The  programs will be produced by Tatyana Batova, Oleg Erastov, Igor  Chetverikov, Stanislav Golovach, and Irina Roshchina.    Thanks to AO Vladivostok-Novosti's stable economic  situation,  Radio VVS is completely independent of political parties, state  bodies, and commercial and financial structures. This to a large  extent guarantees objectivity and unprejudiced coverage at our  radio station. We do not intend to go after superprofits:  Advertising will occupy no more than one-fifth of broadcast time  in Radio VVS programs.    The transmitter from which Radio VVS programs will be  broadcast is powerful enough to ensure stable reception on the  territory of the entire southern part of Maritime Kray--50 kW.  We are grateful to the staff of Vladivostok Radio Center who  were able to lease us these broadcast capacities and air time.    And we do hope that Vladivostok Today radio will become  truly  a necessity for the city and its residents.</p>

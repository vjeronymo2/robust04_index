			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWN BY FOUR, KINGS GET POINT ACROSS ON ROAD  </P> <P> A tornado swept through here early this week and an earthquake has been  predicted for early next week.  </P> <P> For the visiting Kings, disaster seemed to beckon everywhere.  </P> <P> On land. In the air. Even on the ice.  </P> <P> While it certainly doesn't rank with the tragedies of the real world, the Kings  were looking at a little disaster of their own when they fell behind the St.  Louis Blues, 4-0, after two periods Thursday night at St. Louis Arena.  </P> <P> Instead, the Kings put together their biggest rally of the season to eke out a  4-4 tie before a sellout crowd of 17,982 and then hopped on their plane to  return home atop the Smythe Division by four points over the Calgary Flames.  </P> <P> Eight days on the road produced only a 1-2-2 mark, but a gain of one point in  the standings for the Kings, who come back with a season mark of 16-6-3.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel we were down and pouting after the second period," goalie Kelly  Hrudey said. "We felt we would work hard and see what came of it."  </P> <P> Hrudey was also the goalie Sunday when the Kings tied the Quebec Nordiques,  4-4.  </P> <P> That night, the Kings twice blew two-goal leads and acted as if they had lost.  </P> <P> This night, it was St. Louis that had the blues after taking a seemingly secure  lead on home ice, where the club had gone 7-0-2 in its first nine games as the  Blues got off to the best start in their history.  </P> <P> But they are 0-1-2 at home in their last three as their overall record has  dropped to 15-7-3.  </P> <P> It looked as if the Blues had snapped out of it when Gino Cavallini scored his  sixth and seventh goals, Brett Hull his league-leading 25th and Dominic Lavoie  his first, all in the second period.  </P> <P> Luc Robitaille, back from a four-game suspension, started the Kings' comeback  with his 10th goal 55 seconds into the final period.  </P> <P> Then came, perhaps, the crucial play.  </P> <P> With Robitaille in the penalty box on a double minor for high-sticking, Bob  Kudelski controlled the puck near the boards on the left side and whipped it to  John McIntyre.  </P> <P> McIntyre, 21, in only his sixth game as a King after joining the club in a  trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs for Mike Krushelnyski, had yet to score.  </P> <P> Receiving the puck, he found himself alone at the red line.  </P> <P> "I thought somebody would be there," he said, "but nobody was. I started  thinking about what I was going to do as I skated from the red line. I thought  of something by the time I got there."  </P> <P> It wasn't too complicated. He just banged the puck through the pads of goalie  Vince Riendeau.  </P> <P> That almost wasn't enough as the puck hit the left post. But it ricocheted into  the net, putting the Kings back by two goals with 2:08 gone in the third  period.  </P> <P> It got tougher when Tomas Sandstrom had to leave 16 seconds later with a  contusion of the back, the result of sliding into the net.  </P> <P> He never returned, but the Kings did after holding the Blues scoreless in the  double minor.  </P> <P> When John Tonelli put in his own rebound for his fifth goal at the 6:39 mark,  the margin was down to one. It was Tonelli's 800th career point.  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky tied the score at 16:33 on a power play, scoring his 16th goal  from the middle of the right circle, the puck flying past Riendeau on his stick  side.  </P> <P> Both teams had their chances to break the deadlock. Gretzky had the puck on a  two-on-one near the end of regulation play, but couldn't get it past defender  Jeff Brown.  </P> <P> And at the end of the overtime, Paul Cavallini fired from the left circle, but  Hrudey deflected the puck with his left pad.  </P> <P> And that was that. Nobody won.  </P> <P> But try telling that to the Kings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Defenseman Marty McSorley suffered bruised ribs and left the game in the second  period. . . . The Kings fired Marcel Comeau, the coach of their New Haven  Nighthawk farm team. The American Hockey League club has struggled to an 8-13-4  start. Garry Unger, assistant coach of the Phoenix Roadrunners, the Kings'  other minor league affiliate, was named New Haven's interim coach. "It was a  real good team on paper," King General Manager Rogie Vachon said, "but for some  reason, they couldn't win." . . . Defenseman Bob Halkidis, sent to New Haven  for conditioning as the final step in his recovery from off-season shoulder  surgery, has been assigned to Phoenix after clearing waivers.  </P></p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Arts: Dresden tunes up - After 40 years of communism the musical tempo in this great city is gaining pace DRESDEN WAS not rebuilt in a day. Since the fall of Communism, work on restoring the city's shattered monuments has speeded up. The stump of the Frauenkirche is now adorned with scaffolding and the eerie ruin of the Taschenberg Palais is to be developed as a luxury hotel. But it will be ten or 20 years before the spectre of devastation left by that one night of bombing in February 1945 can be removed. It will also be some time before Dresden resumes its profile as one of Europe's great musical cities. This is where Weber and Wagner served as Hofkapellmeister, where nine Richard Strauss operas were premiered, where Schuch, Busch and Bohm developed and maintained a strong Germanic tradition. Then, during 40 years of communism, Dresden was gradually reduced to a cheap recording outpost. The tempo of musical life is now picking up. After a sharp drop in attendance figures before and after unification, the Dresdeners' appetite for music has returned. The Staatskapelle, Dresden's renowned opera orchestra, is once again attracting the world's leading conductors. Along with most other major east German institutions, the Dresden Philharmonic (the city's main concert orchestra) and the Semper Opera have brought in new administrators from the west, with their own ideas about artistic programming and marketing. Established German singers like Rene Kollo have given performances for no fee. But the hangover from unification is proving hard to shrug off. Orchestra salaries in Dresden are still only 60 per cent of those in Hamburg or Stuttgart. The task of slimming down communist-era staffing levels has yet to be confronted. The Dresden Philharmonic is in the throes of an artistic leadership crisis, and the acoustical barrenness of its ugly 2,400-seat home, the Kulturpalast, is affecting morale and standards. A promised new hall will not be ready until 1997. The orchestra is also caught up in what has been dubbed 'Stasi-gier', the obsession with exposing former state security informers. Only four of its players were Communist Party members, but the extent of Stasi infiltration has yet to be established. It is a bitter issue. The atmosphere at the Semper Opera is more positive, partly because the building itself - faithfully reconstructed by the communists and re-opened in 1985 - is well-equipped and has become a major tourist draw. The orchestra and chorus are among Europe's best. But the company wants to be able to compete with cities like Munich in the international market for conductors and soloists, and to do that it needs more money. Next year, the federal government in Bonn - which has provided emergency grants since unification - will hand back the burden of funding to the Saxon state government, jeopardising the contracts which the new intendant, Christoph Albrecht, has signed with guest-artists. For the time being, Albrecht is trading on the fact that many singers are happy to perform in Dresden simply to share in its traditions: at the start of next season, for example, Felicity Lott will sing the title role in a new production of Arabella, one of the Strauss operas most closely associated with the city. But Dresden's music institutions could be in for a nasty shock if the local economy does not pick up quickly. Already the city is discovering that artistic leadership does not come cheap: after a long and apparently successful courtship of Giuseppe Sinopoli for the post of music director at the Semper Opera, the Saxon state government last month found the Italian conductor had suddenly increased his financial demands to match the DM 900,000 contract recently awarded to Daniel Barenboim at the Berlin State Opera. Sinopoli has also made his involvement in individual productions conditional on the engagement of certain singers, most of whom are expensive recording stars. One of Sinopoli's attractions is his own Deutsche Grammophon contract, which has already benefitted the Staatskapelle. On the other hand, as long as he continues to dominate the orchestra's concert work, the opera house will be unable to attract an alternative music director of sufficient standing. The whole Sinopoli episode suggests that Dresden has not yet found a way to reconcile its glorious pre-war tradition with its current straitened circumstances. The Semper Opera has four new productions this season. Lulu, which was new to Dresden, found favour neither with the conservative local public nor with the tourists whom the city is so keen to attract. La Cenerentola, Dresden's contribution to the Rossini year, was a popular success and marked the company's conversion to original-language performance with surtitles. Still to come are Les Contes d'Hoffmann, to be staged next week by the radical east German producer Peter Konwitschny, and Der Freischutz during the Dresden Festival in May. The rest of the season is taken up with standard repertory, played six nights a week at prices (DM10 to 50) only marginally below those in equivalent west German houses. One of the joys of any visit to the Semper Opera is the theatre itself. Built as a court opera house in 1841 and occupying a commanding position in Dresden's historic centre, it has a spacious, richly decorated horse-shoe auditorium and an atmosphere of tradition. The acoustic is disappointing: the orchestral sound is rich and well-blended, but the voices simply do not project over the footlights - perhaps the penalty for enlarging the proscenium during reconstruction. Both Lulu and Cenerentola can be judged artistic successes, the Rossini particularly so. Martin Rupprecht's designs - a tumble-down under-the-arches homestead for the opening and closing scenes, a revolving gold prism for the palace - had a post-modern look, set against a bright blue background. Steffen Piontek's stage direction was equally pleasing: fluent ensemble work, witty without being over-produced. Alidoro, sung by Eike Wilm Schulte with the vocal poise of a Lieder specialist and the dramatic presence of a practised Wagnerian, was a magical master of ceremonies, engineering the prince's arrival in a balloon-basket and setting off an elegant firework display at the end. Kathleen Kuhlmann's Angelina was vocally polished but rather pallid, lacking the youthful vulnerability to stir the heart. Eduardo Gimenez was the eloquent Don Ramiro, Martin Gantner a handsome Dandini. Don Magnifico was sung by Rolf Wollrad, an experienced basso buffo who served with dignity as 'father of the house' in the months after unification. The performance was very respectably conducted by the young Englishman Anthony Bramall - a replacement for Arnold Ostman, who had a bust-up with the Staatskapelle at the first rehearsal. The conductor of Lulu was Friedemann Layer, who displayed admirable structural command, steering a course between dry intellectualism and sensuous lyricism. The Staatskapelle played with outstanding tonal bloom, as if the music was in their blood. The staging by Fred Berndt, an east German drama producer and designer, updated the setting to the 1930s, but otherwise showed too much respect for Berg's stage instructions, too little fantasy. The entire evening took place within a circus ring, with a caged perimeter in the prologue and a trap-door and tent for the finale. Apart from the Act Two film interlude - a whirl of shocked female faces - the story was told with pristine clarity. But Lulu is more than a domestic morality play. There was no sense of Lulu's ascent and descent, nothing sordid, no tragic grandeur. The cast was dominated by Siegfried Vogel's Athlete - physically vulgar, larger-than-life, powerfully declaimed. Theo Adam's Dr Schon has seen better days, but he still cuts a commanding figure on stage. Kerstin Witt's Geschwitz and Norbert Orth's Alwa made no great impression. In the title role, Maria Husmann looked chic and sexy, and caught a selfish, callous streak in the character, but the voice lacked weight or brilliance. This Lulu was just too innocent by half.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Energy efficiency Sir, Energy efficiency advocates like Mr Andrew Warren (Letters, March 24) persist in depicting the normal operation of energy markets as barriers to energy efficiency. 'Energy tariffs,' they say, 'are too low.' By what criterion? If suppliers are prepared to offer fuel at these prices and consumers to take up the offer, the market is doing its job of contributing to general economic efficiency. It is up to energy efficiency advocates to justify setting markets aside, remembering that more efficient use is not the same thing as reduced consumption. As distinguished American economist Robert Solow has pointed out: 'Factor augmentation does not mean factor saving.' L G Brookes, 16 Ipswich Road, Bournemouth BH4 9HZ</p>

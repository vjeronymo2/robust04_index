			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Gunmen kill 25 blacks in Johannesburg attacks GUNMEN shot dead 25 blacks in three attacks around Johannesburg yesterday, one day after South African political leaders agreed a watershed deal on the transition to majority rule, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Police said about 10 gunmen killed 19 people and wounded 22 when they opened fire on a mini-bus taxi rank in the Wadeville industrial area east of Johannesburg at about 6pm. Two hours later two people were killed in an ambush on a mini-bus taxi 6km away. Earlier in the day four people were killed in a shoot-out at a taxi association meeting in Soweto township. Mr Hernus Kriel, the law and order minister, described the Wadeville massacre as 'a horrific atrocity'. He said: 'It is the prevailing culture of violence. . . which provides the seedbed for outrages such as these.' He urged the country's two main black rival groups, Inkatha and the African National Congress, to settle their differences. Feuding between the two groups has been blamed on much of the recent political killing. An ANC spokesman said the Wadeville raid followed a pattern in which political breakthroughs were followed by outbreaks of violence. 'I don't think it's a coincidence at all that this happened the day after agreement was reached on a transitional executive council (TEC),' he said. A majority of the 23 groups negotiating an end to white rule agreed on Tuesday on a draft bill setting up a TEC which will for the first time bring blacks into central government. The TEC is supported by the ANC and the government of President FW de Klerk but rejected by Inkatha. The Wadeville killing, carried out with AK-47 combat rifles, took place near the site of a massacre in which 12 blacks were shot dead at an iron and steel works on August 22.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / National Power to close two stations NATIONAL Power, the electricity generating company, is to close two power stations with the loss of 400 jobs, Michael Smith writes. The company expects to handle staff losses at the stations in West Thurrock, Essex, and Padiham, Lancashire, through voluntary severance and natural wastage. The National Grid, which runs the electricity system in England and Wales, yesterday signed an eight-year deal with Electricite de France, the French power company, to allow the 2,000MW cross-channel link to be used for both imports and exports. Industrial consumers of electricity in Northern Ireland are to pay up to 9 per cent more from today, it was announced yesterday. The move is in spite of a government promise last week of at least Pounds 10m to curb rises. The increases come at a time when electricity companies in England and Wales are freezing or reducing prices. Mr Nigel Smith, local director of the Confederation of British Industry, said it was very worrying.</p>

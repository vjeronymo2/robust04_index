			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: To the right, smartly YESTERDAY I attended the morning editorial conferences of The Daily Telegraph, The Sun and Daily Mail - three staunch defenders of the British way of life. I do this periodically, for it keeps me in touch with right-wing opinion. I am always welcomed warmly. The reason I am warmly welcomed is that I am related, by birth, to all the great proprietors and to many of the editors of Britain's national newspapers. I have a smart-card to prove it, a golden piece of plastic that whisks me through the security cordons that all newspapers use to shield themselves from readers. As usual, the conference at the Telegraph resembled a full-dress planning meeting for a spectacular act of war. There were maps on the walls and stacks of computer print-out. On the editor's desk stood a life-like model of a Trident nuclear submarine. When the editor walked in, everyone stood and saluted him. He was wearing an air vice-marshall's cape and a bombardier's plumed hat that was not of this century. Gentlemen, he said. I liked this morning's paper. It had blood, sweat and tears. It offered high-precision gunnery. Also excellent work by the cavalry. But where was the wretched infantry? Our coverage of Michael Mates' resignation was without doubt first-class. And the sports desk got its finger out with some rousing stuff on the battling Brits at Wimbledon. Peterborough shone. Arts was up to scratch. And I liked the tailpiece letter from Ian Hamilton Fazey, about Mekons and dinosaurs. But there were blemishes, gentlemen. The weather report offended me. Let me quote from the start: 'General Situation: Patchy mist and fog in England and Wales will soon clear to leave a dry day with fairly sunny skies. However, it will become cloudier in the north later, but still bright.' It is expressly stated in standing orders, gentlemen, that the word however is never to appear anywhere except in editorials - least of all in the weather. Second, there was no reference this morning to world war two. I have told you repeatedly that the 50th anniversary of world war two is to be a daily feature of our current circulation drive. Next year we will be celebrating D-Day itself. Starting Monday, I want a blockbuster summer offensive to establish the scene. For a month I shall edit the paper from an office in Bayeux. That is all, gentlemen. Dis-miss. Round at the Sun, I expected the editor to be furious at the way his staff had squandered the best tabloid story of the week. It started: 'Giving up sex can kill you, a boffin warned yesterday. Professor John Copeland claims our bodies waste away when we stop having nookie. He said: 'Once reproduction has stopped, maybe the body gets the message that its usefulness has ceased'.' The story was crammed into just 9 centimetres. Come to think of it, 9cm is probably par for the course for most Sun readers. But the editor was indifferent. He looked broody and troubled. Apparently (sources tell me) he has not been the same since the FT afforded him space to propagate his peculiar brand of Euroscepticism. The experience went to his head. Now he has gone all serious. Has ideas above his station. There are a hundred and one things we should be doing, he screamed at his minions yesterday. I want major Sun series on EC competition policy, cross-border deals, the transparency of merger control, Bundesbank interest rate policy, EC employment prospects, privatisation, banking and financial deregulation, labour costs and productivity, and whether Russia's plan to offload rare earths and metals has a strategic downside for companies in Britain. We owe it to Sun readers to keep them abreast of serious news. There is more to life than tits, you know. At the Daily Mail the editor looked pleased with yesterday's issue, which mixed good-to-middling columnists with Mail-type clamminess (Andre Agassi's chest hair; Raine Spencer's diet). In accordance with Mail tradition the editor conducts his morning conferences while sitting on a throne, attended by flunkies and a sweet choir of eunuchs. Yesterday, in front of him, prostrate and forlorn, lay a broken, penitent figure whom I took to be John Major. But I could not approach the throne. The crush was too oppressive. So I tiptoed away, dumbstruck and awed.</p>

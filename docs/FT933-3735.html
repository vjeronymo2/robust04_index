			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Fashion: The romantic and monastic - Avril Groom advises on clothes for autumn THE SHOWS have long since been and gone, orders placed and clothes safely delivered to the stores. For autumn, it is all over, bar the shopping, which is is the most nerve-racking part. Will people want to buy what the stores decree is The Look? In March, straight after the autumn shows, we asked a selection of the country's top buyers to give their gut reactions to the key new styles for every woman's autumn wardrobe. Now that the season has arrived we asked them again, in the cold light of their buying budgets, to consider how 'new' looking the average shopper will want to be. Their initial hunches were good and the majority of their shop rails are now filled with the themes outlined in spring. The mood falls between a gentle historical romance and an unadorned monastic simplicity. It is, of course, in the buyers' interests to persuade us that our wardrobes need a twice-yearly overhaul. And when fashion undergoes a substantial shift  -in this case from brash tailoring to self-effacing softness - some new pieces are unquestionably necessary. Most of us cannot look as the fashion magazines would have us, because their featured outfits are new every time, whereas our wardrobes carry the fashion equivalent to our emotional baggage - clothes that, for reasons of economy or affection, we will continue to wear whatever the blandishments of the much-hyped latest look. But one buyer's assertion that 'the secret this winter is knowing exactly how to mix clothes in an unusual and individual way' is good news. A clever assistant, could show you how to make that individual mix by linking new pieces to old and by using old items in new ways. Several of this autumn's staples, like a white shirt, skinny rib sweaters, a swingy long skirt, waistcoats and even a big coat, are probably already in your wardrobe, languishing unnoticed. A store's art lies in encouraging you to look at them anew and persuading you of the need for the essentials to update all you already own. For example, the dandy look is an early autumn favourite that acts as a bridge between familiar tailoring and the new fluidity. An integral part of it is the long white shirt which, to look new, is worn with tails, collar and undone cuffs flamboyantly on show. The shirt also works with fine knits that, in new proportions of short and long, are the easiest way to achieve soft layers. The shirt now goes under a skinny, cropped sweater instead of over. On top goes another autumn essential which, in some version, you probably already have - the waistcoat. In this case the trendy floor-length knitted gilet with short brocade or velvet ones are part of the dandy look. Layered with chunky wool or tweed, they contribute to the unexpected texture-mix, revolving round velvet, which is the buyers' hot tip for mid-winter. Day time velvet divides the buyers. Some see it as too much identified with evening; others feel that, contrasted with rugged tweed, wool and even leather it makes sense, but cotton velvet is better for day than sheeny, soft silk velvet. The velvet jacket is, in many eyes, essential this autumn. The favoured silhouette is gently A-line, narrow-shouldered and flaring to the hem, even for jackets which, despite gilets and long dresses, are still the working woman's mainstay. What to put with them? Wide trousers or a long, softly flaring skirt are the buyers' choices, while last year's jodhpurs are still good for dandies. Over the layers goes the contrast of a big coat - fitted, flared and military-style or plain, voluminous and often not buttoned at all. Lastly there are the essential accessories which can be the cheapest way to update. Lace-up boots rise higher up your leg the more fashion forward you are. Other trappings are floppy velvet hats or felt toppers, velvet scarves, jet beads, chunky amber, crosses of all kinds and a bag much softer than the ubiquitous gilt-chained square. We asked each of our consultant buyers to summarise their favourite look and suggest one essential autumn purchase: Josephine Turner, A la Mode, London SW1: 'The look is long, light, body-skimming layers in mixed velvet, cashmere, chiffon and suede - not traditional daywear fabrics but everything should double for evening. Best buy is a huge coat, to keep you warm and to hide those unusual fabrics while you're out'. Francoise Tessier, Browns, London W1: 'Layering and unusual fabric combinations are my choice. Soft, long, flaring knits under a gilet or jacket with a similar shape are easy and flattering. Fine or rib-knitted pieces are essentials'. Joseph Ettedgui, Joseph shops: 'The classics are a soft cardigan, a white shirt, wide and narrow pants, a big coat. Then mix in the fashion pieces like a dandy jacket so the textures are interesting. Velvet is great but a long velvet dress should only be for evening. One essential is soft, loose trousers, in black or deep brown'. Amanda Verdan, Harvey Nichols, London SW1: 'The look is much softer, deconstructed and very plain. Dandy velvet or jewellery in amber, silver or jet add the fun. The best buy jacket is narrow-shouldered, long and gently wider at the hem.' Rita Britton, Pollyanna, Barnsley: 'Layers look simple but are easy to get wrong. They should be light, fine and fluid, especially the bottom half, and mix the neutrals - black, brown and grey - together. The contrast is in chunky, emphatic shoes. One buy is boots, lace-up ankle or biker style'. Anne Pitcher, Harrods, London SW1: 'The essential pieces are velvet, knits and anything long and fluid. This can be tough for business-wear but knits under soft cardigans work well. Velvet for day is very new, mixed with tweed. A velvet shirt is extremely versatile'. Lucille Lewin, Whistles shops: 'I am mad about velvet for day, mixed as outrageously as you want. Your first buy should be a white shirt if you don't own one and then a velvet jacket. Selina Blow's is definitive - expensive but you can wear it with anything'. Cathy Harris, Fenwick, London W1: 'It is easy to update inexpensively. Waistcoats layered long over short in different fabrics are good for mixed textures. A velvet scarf, long beads and a cross, a white shirt and lace-up boots are good buys'.</p>

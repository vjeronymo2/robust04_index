Duma Committee for  Budget, Finance, Banks, and Credits Debated Wisdom of Presenting  Quarterly Budgets"]    [Text] An incomplete draft 1994 budget message came to the  State Duma on the evening of 19 March with its classified part  coming to the chamber yesterday morning. Yesterday, the Duma  budget committee looked at the government's request to provide  it with 10.6 million rubles [R] toward financing state outlays  in April and May 1994. The cabinet had sent in a draft law  where the government authorized the release of the given sum  proceeding from the draft budget for this year, taking account  of the current situation in the financial sphere and the receipt  of money by the state treasury and the Central Bank cash  department. The committee at first ruled that financing should  be kept open throughout the first quarter, while the sum to be  released should be further discussed with the Finance Ministry.  Besides, out of the basis, only proportions of the 1994 budget  remained. The committee then passed an amendment proposed by  its deputy chairman Aleksandr Pochinok to the effect that the  law should regulate the allocation of money throughout the first  half- year. In this manner members of the committee decided to  eliminate inconsistencies in the proportions of financing: most  of the money spent in the first quarter had been earmarked by  the government for defense and the law enforcement organs rather  than on social spending. Incidentally, R7.5 trillion known to  have been earmarked under the president's edict for the first  three months of 1994 was spent approximately early in March.    Inconsistencies in financing proportions compelled members  of  the budget committee to make a decision on whether the  government should submit to the Duma, in addition to the annual  budget, its quarter- by-quarter breakdown. This was sharply  opposed by committee deputy chairman Gennadiy Kulik, who stated  that this would cause a quarrel between the Duma and the  government. Aleksandr Pochinok supported his colleague, saying  that the Duma would in fact return the annual budget without  discussing it if it sets the given condition: a mandatory  quarter-by-quarter presentation.</p>

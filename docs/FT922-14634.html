			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (4): New magnet for funds - Stock Markets / Secondary Markets LATIN AMERICA has been an El Dorado for fortune-hunters through the centuries but in recent years stock markets rather than promises of gold have attracted overseas investors. A return to democracy throughout the region after decades of rule by military dictatorships and totalitarian regimes, and austere but necessary economic restructuring have been the strongest magnets for foreign fund managers. The rash of privatisations by most Latin American governments, which have concentrated largely on the state telecommunications monopolies, have added to the allure. Believers in Latin America's ability to reform its economy and its political system have, for the most part, been greatly rewarded. According to data from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank, investors in Latin American equities enjoyed total returns in dollar terms of 134 per cent in 1991. Argentina provided the biggest individual return, up 396.6 per cent in dollar terms, while Venezuela brought up the rear with a return of 48.4 per cent. Fund managers interested in the region but unable, or unwilling, to invest directly in the stock market of their preferred country, have either entrusted their portfolios to specialist brokers or bought into one of several regional or country funds. The sharp rises in the stock markets have been reflected in the funds. For example, Latin American Investment Trust was the best performer of all UK investment trusts last year, with its net asset value rising by 124 per cent. These results have not gone unnoticed by more conservative institutions, who had decided not to invest in Latin America because of its history of economic problems. The lack of market regulations and of critical research by brokers keen on securing primary business, as well as difficulty in understanding inflation accounting practices, have also been serious barriers for the cautious foreign investor. To a certain extent, these fears are being addressed. Mexico, which is the region's largest and most liquid market, has virtually adopted US Gaap (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and has also introduced strict broker requirements. The Argentine government, which is planning further privatisation issues this year, has given more powers to its National Securities commission to crack down on stock market manipulation. In February, two companies were suspended for alleged tax and trading offences. The shift in international investors' attention away from the 'Tiger' markets in the Pacific Basin towards Latin America has been reflected in the number of securities houses now covering the region and this should lead to more qualified company research. Furthermore, to attract the international investors who dislike the lack of liquidity in the domestic markets, the larger listed companies in Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela have issued American Depository Receipts (ADRs) or shares and Global Deposit Shares. Brazil's Telebras is also expected to offer ADRs soon. But for all its progress, Latin America has retained its mercurial ability to disappoint. A case in point is Venezuela, which in February suffered its first military coup attempt since the early 1960s. The coup failed, but it has forced President Carlos Andres Perez to back-pedal on his unpopular economic reform and introduce constitutional changes. The stock market made a satisfactory recovery immediately after the abortive uprising but it has since fallen back. According to the IFC, Caracas fell by 14.8 per cent in local currency terms in March, after a fall of 3 per cent in February, and by 15 per cent in dollar terms because of continued weakness in the bolivar. In the first three months, the market has dropped 3.8 per cent in local currency terms and 5.4 per cent in dollar terms. The recent developments in Venezuela have reminded equity investors of their largest, single risk: that the region remains dependent on the continued good health of a few individuals to safeguard reform and democracy. Specialist brokers started to cover Peru after the appointment of President Alberto Fujimori in 1990 signalled a radical change. A first generation Peruvian and an academic, not from the traditional power bases, his austerity programme has allowed the central bank to concentrate on long-term monetary policies rather than the daily devaluation of the currency, so much so that the new sol is appreciating against the dollar. This optimism has also been reflected in the stock market, which rose 55.4 per cent in dollar terms last year. Over the next year, the biggest gains are expected to be in the smaller markets which are judged to be undervalued. Mr Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton, a director at Baring Securities, is optimistic about the prospects for Peru, Chile and Colombia. Brazil still has some scope to surprise, says Mr Audley Twiston Davies, managing director of Latin American Securities, since its economy is twice the size of Mexico's and it was one of the last in the region to be restructured. Most brokers believe Mexico is fast approaching its full value for now, since the beneficial effects of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States are largely being discounted by the stock market.</p>

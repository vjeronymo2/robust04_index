			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: A CRAZY EIGHT IS TOO MUCH FOR ONE TV SCREEN;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE OVERABUNDANCE OF BOWL GAMES ON NEW YEAR'S DAY MAKES IT  IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH THEM ALL. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS SYSTEM?  </P> <P> Inspecting the bowl football program on New Year's Day, you have a vision of  herring in a net, flopping over one another.  </P> <P> The current lineup embraces eight games, running from 8:30 in the morning (PST)  until roughly 8:30 at night.  </P> <P> You are surprised the genii of college football have stopped at eight games.  Between midnight and 8 a.m., they could book two more.  </P> <P> And, of course, they could squeeze in another in prime time.  </P> <P> Right now, they have arranged so many games Jan. 1 that an overlap occurs. For  instance, the Citrus Bowl, the Cotton Bowl and the Hall of Fame Bowl poach on  each other's telecast.  </P> <P> And all three arrive on the air at some time during the second half of the  Gator Bowl.  </P> <P> The Orange Bowl and the Sugar Bowl overlap, same as the Fiesta Bowl and the  Rose Bowl. And all are coming off a previous day of activity featuring the John  Hancock Bowl and the Domino's Pizza Copper Bowl.  </P> <P> A confused viewer of those two could leave his set believing he will be insured  in 30 minutes, or the policy is free.  </P> <P> You are a tolerant individual. You are patient and understanding, the milk of  human kindness flowing by the liter through every vein.  </P> <P> You are not aiming to rock the vessel. All you are trying to comprehend is  whether college football has gone foaming-at-the-mouth mad.  </P> <P> One isn't supposed to be dealing here with dummies. This is our highest  intellectual order, the teachers of our young.  </P> <P> And they allow a circumstance on New Year's Day calling for eight televised  bowl games?  </P> <P> If smart guys permit this excess, what would imbeciles do?  </P> <P> So what has all this done to that spectacle billing itself as "the Granddaddy  of 'Em All," the Rose Bowl?  </P> <P> What it has done is reduce the Rose Bowl to selling nothing but age -- a game  beginning in 1902 and continuing to the present, with intermittent stoppages.  </P> <P> After the 1902 game, for instance, it stopped until 1916, substituting that  well-known ghetto sport, polo. It also tried chariot races.  </P> <P> And then the Rose Bowl ground to a halt in Pasadena in 1942 when the game was  shifted to Durham, N.C. It was a war year, and Pasadena feared an air attack by  the Japanese.  </P> <P> What an insult to the Luftwaffe to OK the game on the East Coast.  </P> <P> Although it was once the premier postseason game, the Rose Bowl has suffered  serious slippage, not at the box office, but in the television ratings and in  general prestige.  </P> <P> And the ultimate contempt has been the willingness of other bowls to go  head-and-head with it on TV.  </P> <P> Offering Washington and Iowa this time, the Rose Bowl needn't necessarily  apologize. Washington, on a good day, can knock off any amateur team in the  hemisphere.  </P> <P> And Iowa is better than average.  </P> <P> But it has become increasingly rare that connoisseurs about the land judge the  Rose Bowl as an event of major national impact. It is more a parochial little  war between the Pacific 10 and the Big Ten, pretty much like Eton and Harrow.  </P> <P> Since the Rose Bowl still dredges more money from television than any other  bowl game -- that could be a fleeting condition -- it behooves the promoters  each year to capture participants of muscle, teams with substantial followings.  </P> <P> Those teams preferred are USC, UCLA, Michigan and Ohio State.  </P> <P> Washington and Iowa are rated fair. What ABC lives in fear of is, say, Oregon  State vs. Indiana.  </P> <P> Bucking seven other games New Year's Day, with such a matchup the network  starts looking for a bridge.  </P> <P> One is available in Pasadena, making the Rose Bowl a game of convenience, if  nothing else.  </P></p>

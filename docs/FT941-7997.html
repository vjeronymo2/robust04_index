			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Managers 'bear brunt of car levy' Middle managers stand to lose most when new company-car taxes take effect in April - with some paying as much as Pounds 600 extra a year, says a survey published yesterday. But some top managers, driving mainly Jaguar, BMW and Mercedes cars, could pay less tax, says human resources and employee benefits consultants WF Corroon. Under the new arrangement staff will be taxed on 35 per cent of the list price of their company car with discounts for business mileage and the vehicle's age. The survey, which covered 255 organisations, found that most middle managers drive Fords, Vauxhalls and Rovers costing between Pounds 16,000 and Pounds 23,600. The tax changes will mean 56 per cent of these managers could be paying as much as Pounds 600 more tax a year for their cars. Among chairmen, chief executives and managing directors, about one in three would have a higher tax bill and the remainder would pay less. The survey says a driver with a company Ford Granada 2.01 Ghia costing Pounds 19,150 would pay Pounds 591 more tax under the new system. But a top manager with a four-litre Pounds 33,700 Jaguar XJ6 would pay Pounds 871 less tax. Other findings were that Jaguars were the most popular company cars for top executives, one-in-five companies said they offered chairmen, chief executives and managing directors a monthly cash allowance as an alternative to a car, and more than 25 per cent of companies offered directors and others a cash alternative.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] [Words indistinct] the Malawi Young Pioneers has  been disarmed and disgraced, then President Banda himself has  been proposing their rehabilitation. Opening parliament  yesterday, he said the act that set them up would be repealed,  but also suggested that the Young Pioneers who had fled the  country should be recalled, and their misdeeds of the past  forgiven and forgotten. He has even suggested that old civil  servants could be retired and their jobs be given to the Young  Pioneers. The disbandment of the Young Pioneers was, of course,  one of the (?crying) demands of the opposition. Aleki Banda,  first vice president of the opposition United Democratic Front,  UDF, was himself instrumental years ago in setting up the Young  Pioneers. On the line, Josephine Hazeley asked him if he was  happy with the president's decision to repeal the Young Pioneers  Act.    [Begin recording] [Banda] Not quite. You see, the issue of  the Young Pioneers is a very important issue here. In the  National Consultative Council what we have insisted on [words  indistinct] is that first we want a full report of what has been  done to delink the Malawi Young Pioneers from the MCP [Malawi  Congress Party]. Secondly, a full report on the disarmament.  Now, we have not received any report up to now. Therefore, we  are not satisfied with any statements that are made unilaterally  by the MCP and the Malawi Government.    [Hazeley] But surely, making them illegally, repealing the  Young Pioneers Act is a step in the right direction, you must  admit.    [Banda] Well, that is certainly a step in the right  direction, except that, of course, he goes on to say what is  going to be done about them, and various other matters. Now,  all these are matters which we are deeply interested in. They  have not involved us in the formulation of any of the policies  which he has announced.    [Hazeley] The president has said he would like for everybody  to embrace the Young Pioneers because after all they are your  children.    [Banda] Well, we agree with that. We do agree that they are  our children, they're our nephews and nieces. We ourselves have  said that we have no desire to victimize them, except of course  for those who may have committed crimes for which, of course,  each individual would answer for. But we would still like to be  involved in the formulation of policy regarding the future usage  of these useful resources that we have.    [Hazeley] So, you don't find it distasteful to incorporate  the Young Pioneers into the civil service?    [Banda] Well, probably as a general principle no. But it  can't just be a wholesale incorporation of the Young Pioneers.  We have to look at the numbers, at the various individuals to  work out the most appropriate way of solving this problem.    [Hazeley] Now, the president has also suggested that as a  matter of reconciliation, he would like to propose that those  who are old members of the Young Pioneers should be retired and  given full, terminal benefits.    [Banda] Well, as I say we are prepared to look at all those  proposals, including retirement of those who are old, but we  insist -- certainly on behalf of the UDF -- we would insist that  we should be involved in all these decisions. We should discuss  them.    [Hazeley] Aren't you just simply making a mountain out of a  molehill as far as the Young Pioneers are concerned. The  president has [words indistinct] with concrete ideas as to the  future of these people, and you in the opposition haven't.    [Banda] Well, we are certainly not making a mountain out of  a  molehill because the Young Pioneers issue is a very sensitive  transitional issue. The Young Pioneers did many things during  the referendum process which were unacceptable. Now, this is a  very important issue which really requires full consultation  among all interested parties in this country in order to solve  this problem in the best interests of Malawi.    [Hazeley] Some people say you, Aleki Banda, ought to be  [words indistinct] because after all you had set these people up  in the first place, the Young Pioneers.    [Banda] Oh, definitely. Well, I really understand I was the  first commander of the Young Pioneers, and was commander for 10  years. During the 10 years of my commandership, the main  emphasis for the Young Pioneers was in development. The basic  principles for which they were formed is still valid up to now,  except that in later years the Malawi Congress Party misused  them, or rather abused the movement in order to further their  ends.

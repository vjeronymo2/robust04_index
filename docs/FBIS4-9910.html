			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by correspondent Mara Rivera, from the </F> Supreme Electoral Tribunal Office in Panama City, with Julio  Miller, Panama City Circuito RPC Television news director, in  the studio -- live]    [Text] [Rivera] Good morning, dear listeners. A few moments  ago a ruling was handed down in the case of [former Panama City  Mayor] Mayin Correa, condemning Mrs. Correa. The sentence handed  down is 187 days in prison and the suspension of citizen's  rights, disqualifying her from holding public office for one  year. It is noted that, according to Article 82 of the penal  code, the prison sentence handed down can be converted into a  60-day fine, considering the salary she received at the time the  crime was committed. That is, she must pay a fine equivalent to  60 days, in accordance with the salary she received while she  was mayor.    She is disqualified from holding public office. The other  people involved in this case, Mr. Juan Domingo Diaz, Alexis  Morales, and Enrique Delgado Bolanos also received rulings. Juan  Domingo Diaz and Alexis Morales were acquitted. Mr. Enrique  Delgado Bolanos was sentenced to two months in prison, which can  also be converted to the payment of a fine.    We learned here at the Electoral Tribunal that Mrs. Correa  can run as candidate for the post of mayor. She cannot, however,  assume the post -- should she be elected with the necessary  votes. In this case, the post would have to be filled by her  alternate, her first alternate. I do not know if Mr. Miller has  anything else.    [Miller] Yes, Mara. Let us repeat the sentence handed down.  Also, can she fill the post, after she serves the sentence  handed down? Go ahead.    [Rivera] The ruling condemns her. The sentence condemns her.  She is sentenced to 187 days, which can be converted to a 60-day  fine. Then there is the sentence suspending her citizen's rights  and disqualifying her from holding a public post for one year.  After serving the sentence for one year, she can fill the post.  In other words, if she is elected, she can fill the post of  mayor after one year. In the meantime, her alternate would have  to be in charge.    [Miller] What other alternative does she have, following the  sentence handed down by the tribunal, Mara?    [Rivera] We were told she can submit an appeal. Nothing has  been established yet because the sentence was just handed down.  We understand her attorneys will immediately file an appeal with  the tribunal.    [Miller] Thank you, Mara, for this last-minute report.</p>

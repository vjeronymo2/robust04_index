			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Bond 'unable to recall Jersey companies' Mr Alan Bond, the failed Australian businessman, told a Sydney court yesterday he was unable to remember anything about a series of Jersey-based companies which allegedly handled his personal funds and made investments but were never mentioned in the formal statement of affairs drawn up when he went bankrupt in 1992. The bankruptcy trustee is trying to find where Mr Bond's assets lie, to pay his creditors. One of Australia's most-prominent entrepreneurs in the 1980s, Mr Bond went into bankruptcy with debts totalling hundreds of millions of dollars. At the long-delayed public examination by his trustee in bankruptcy, he said he had no recollection of telling the Jersey office of Touche Ross to accept instructions from Mr John Bond, his son, Mr Harry Lodge, a Perth-based solicitor, or two other business associates, to act on his behalf over his personal affairs during the 1970s and 1980s. Asked if he had authorised anyone to set up an offshore company for his personal benefit, Mr Bond said he could not recall. In fact, Mr Bond could not even remember Touche Ross. A day of relentless questioning by Mr Francis Douglas QC, acting for the trustee in bankruptcy, failed to have any impact on this amnesia. Neither did the presentation of a deposition given by one of the Touche Ross partners, a series of notes allegedly taken by Mr Lodge at a meeting with a Touche Ross partner in Jersey, or letters signed by Mr Bond telling Touche Ross to accept instructions from some of these individuals. 'What I'm suggesting is that you had substantial sums of money, amounting to millions of dollars, administered for you through companies in the Channel Islands,' said Mr Douglas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lyubov Latypova, journalist: ``Cholera Exists </F> But One Must Pay for Information About It''; first paragraph is  boldface NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA introduction]    [Text]Alamkhon Akhmedov, health minister of the  Republic of Tajikistan, acknowledged that a variety of cholera  has indeed been discovered in several dozen cases in the Pyandzh  and Kolkhozabad rayons. As a member of the World Health  Organization [WHO], he informed WHO headquarters of this fact in  a telegram and asked for assistance.    The focus is completely localized at the present time.  Cholera is not yet in the Kolkhozabad rayon, and a team of 100  persons including experienced bacteriologists from Russia are  working in the Pyandzh rayon. The minister announced that as far  as physicians from remote foreign lands are concerned, their  presence at the focus of the epidemic is not necessary and they  will not be let in. As far as the cause of the two lethal  outcomes is concerned, it is impossible to say precisely whether  they were due to cholera or some other serious diseases from  which those who died suffered. There are no grounds for panic,  and rumors regarding the cause of the appearance of cases of  cholera in Dushanbe are unfounded.    However, the telegram from the minister to the WHO  headquarters in Copenhagen was sent on the very day that his  deputy Anatoliy Kopyltsov stated in IZVESTIYA that there is no  cholera in Tajikistan. How is this to be understood? In response  to this question, Akhmedov said that exciting panic in the  republic on this score would serve no purpose.    I myself can add one curious detail. Before giving even this  incomplete information, the deputy minister demanded that we  reach an agreement to pay him. As arguments he said the  following. First, he had already been on his feet for 12 hours  and is not obliged to waste his time talking to a journalist.  Second, information is a commodity that is worth money. Third,  he has already sold information to the BBC at a dollar a  paragraph. All of this would have looked like an unfortunate  joke had the discussion not taken much more time that the actual  information itself.</p>

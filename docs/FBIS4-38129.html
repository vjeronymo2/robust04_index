			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 27 Jun (INA)--A responsible source at the  Ministry of Industry and Minerals has described as successful  and fruitful the recent visit to Iraq by a delegation of French  businessmen representing 28 French companies.    In a statement to INA, the source added that several  memorandums of understanding have been signed between Iraq and  the French delegation to promote cooperation and coordination  between Iraq and the French firms in various areas of civilian  industries, both before and after the unfair embargo is lifted.    The source indicated that Thierry Corteine [name as  transliterated], chairman of the National Confederation of  French Employers, reaffirmed the readiness of French firms to  contribute toward the activation of developmental and industrial  projects in Iraq in the interest of the two sides. He also  reiterated that the French firms that dealt with Iraq in the  past honored their commitments to Iraq. He indicated that the  confederation will arrange for other visits to Iraq by  representatives of more than 10 major companies specializing in  the areas of construction, agriculture, milk industries,  agricultural tractors, cars, medical supplies, hospital  building, and banking. The delegations that will be visiting  Iraq will also include parliamentary figures, he said.    It is to be recalled that the National Confederation of  French Employers, has a membership of some 1.5 million employees  working for various large and medium-sized industrial, services,  and banking firms. One of the prime objectives of the  confederation is to promote and expand economic cooperation  between France and other countries.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Crackdown ahead for asset transfers - Avoidance schemes A crackdown is planned on tax-avoidance schemes under which companies are sold in such a way that their corporation-tax liabilities arising before the date of sale cannot be collected. The Inland Revenue said such schemes usually worked by transferring the trading assets of a profitable subsidiary to another group company and selling the subsidiary to a new owner. The new owner then strips it of the remaining cash assets, thus leaving the company unable to pay outstanding tax liability. Proposed legislation would allow the Inland Revenue to collect the unpaid corporation tax from the previous owners of the company, or from other companies previously under the same ownership. The new provision will apply to contracts for sale entered into on or after today. The revenue said Mr Clarke's intention was to counter a 'substantial loss' of tax resulting from such sales. If certain conditions were met, the Inland Revenue would be able to collect the unpaid tax from those who previously controlled the company, or from any other company which was, at any time in the three years before the change in ownership, controlled by that person or persons. One of the conditions will be if the activities of a trade or business of the company cease or the scale becomes small or negligible in the three years before the change in the ownership. Another will be if corporation tax liabilities arise in respect of accounting periods beginning before the change of ownership, and part or all of those liabilities are not paid.</p>

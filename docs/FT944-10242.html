			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB to publish pathfinder on Monday British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture is pushing ahead with a December flotation in London and New York, expected to value the company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.5bn. The offer of some 20 per cent of the enlarged share capital will be launched with a pathfinder prospectus on Monday. The value of the offer is in the middle of expectations. Some estimates put a potential valuation of more than Pounds 5bn on the company, formed out of a merger between Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting. The closing of the offer is expected in the week beginning December 5, which means the float will come about a week after shares of TeleWest, the UK's largest cable operator, start to trade in both London and on the Nasdaq market in New York. The main shareholders in BSkyB are Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times, Granada, the television and leisure group, and Chargeurs, the French industrial company. In addition to the institutional offer, 12 firms were named yesterday as providing share shops for the retail offer of shares. As BSkyB moves towards flotation, designed mainly to reduce debt, the satellite company is believed to be signing up new subscribers through both cable networks and direct to the home at the rate of about 60,000 a month. BSkyB is also thought to be on the verge of signing a deal with SES of Luxembourg. SES operates the Astra satellite system for five more 24-hour channels, which will be used to provide further services. One part of the extra capacity will enable experimentation with pay-per-view services, particularly for recent films. The London listing is being co-sponsored by Goldman Sachs and Lazard Brothers.</p>

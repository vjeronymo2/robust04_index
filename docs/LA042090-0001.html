			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LANDFILL SENTRY MATCHES WITS WITH BIRDS TO PROTECT AIRCRAFT AND LIVES  </P> <P> When the stench of garbage begins to rise over the 420-acre Miramar Sanitary  Landfill, Mike Rennie loads his shotgun with an Explosive Pest Repellent  Device, looks into the sun and waits.  </P> <P> The birds will be here soon, the 19-year-old city laborer says. "They always  come back." And Rennie is ready for them.  </P> <P> Armed with loud but harmless flying projectiles, Rennie is one of a dozen city  employees trained in the art of scaring scavengers -- the gulls and blackbirds  that look upon the landfill as their next meal. Seven days a week, 12 hours a  day, one of these men can be found atop a mountain of trash, squinting for a  glimpse of a gull. Every few minutes, a Navy jet flies overhead -- each one a  $33.5-million reminder of why Rennie and his colleagues do what they do.  </P> <P> "If the sea gulls get sucked up in there," he explained Thursday as an F-14 jet  fighter from the neighboring Miramar Naval Air Station roared by, "then I get  in trouble."  </P> <P> On average, laborers like Rennie make $28,000 a year, including benefits,  according to Michael Bresnahan, the landfill operations manager. But he says  funding the city's bird-control program is a small price to pay for the use of  the landfill site, which is owned by the Navy.  </P> <P> The Navy has granted the city an easement to pile trash, free of charge, as  high as the jet station's runways. In return, the Navy dumps its trash in the  landfill free. There's only one catch -- the city must prevent "bird strikes."  </P> <P> "Birds and aviation are a difficult mixture," said Chief Petty Officer Bobbie  Carleton, a Navy spokeswoman, noting that, although no bird-related accidents  have occurred in San Diego, jets have been known to crash elsewhere after  sucking birds into their engines.  </P> <P> "The worst case is jet-threatening and life-threatening as well," Carleton  said. "It's also possible for what we call a 'bird strike' to go through the  canopies (the glass over the cockpit), disabling the pilot."  </P> <P> The Navy is concerned enough about such airborne obstacles that it has come up  with an acronym for them: BASH, or Bird Aircraft Strike Hazards. According to  Carleton, the Navy uses its BASH program to teach aviators life-saving  strategies.  </P> <P> "Like when you're flying around, and you meet a duck, you fly up because the  duck will fly down -- duck psychology," Carleton said. "I wouldn't say that  it's a real exact science. If it was, we wouldn't need these guys out there  seven days a week."  </P> <P> But, in fact, says Hank L. Rodriguez, the senior disposal site supervisor at  the landfill, a little bird psychology goes a long way.  </P> <P> His efforts to repel birds have included purchasing plastic owls and playing  amplified recordings of birds in distress. Once, he ran a crisscross of wires  across the mouth of a landfill pit to disrupt birds' flight patterns. But the  cornerstone of his bird control program is an arsenal of noise-making  cartridges, three types of "racket bombs" that his men fire at the rate of up  to 300 a day.  </P> <P> With 4,400 tons of fresh, pungent trash arriving at the landfill each day, the  birds have plenty of incentive to persevere. So city workers are strategic in  their firecracker deployment. After observing that birds soon learn to  recognize which vehicle carries the man with the shotgun, Rodriguez has advised  his bird control men to switch cars every so often. And he advises his men not  to fire at regular intervals -- "you have to be sporadic."  </P> <P> "Everything works to a certain extent, but nothing works 100%," he said.  "You've got to combine things to keep them disoriented."  </P> <P> After a year on the job, Rennie has discovered that, if he fires too many  "whistlers" in a row, the birds get used to it. The trick is to keep them  guessing: a whistler, followed by the boom of a racket bomb, followed by the  dreaded combo -- a whistler that wiggles with a disconcertingly erratic motion.  </P> <P> He has also learned to watch for "scouts" -- the lone birds that blaze the  trail for the entire flock. If you let one land, the rest will follow, a moving  wall of feathers.  </P> <P> "One of them will casually come over, and I'll fire," Rennie said. "When they  finally realize I'm not going to let them land, they head elsewhere."  </P> <P> But, with one man covering more than 400 acres, the birds have the advantage.  They circle back, luring the human and his truck to another site, only to  return to their original target.  </P> <P> "In due time they figure me out," Rennie concedes. "Makes you wonder what's  going on in that little head of theirs."  </P> <P> "You have to chase them at times. They'll play games," Rodriguez said. "You  have to keep alternating your methods."  </P> <P> "You've got to outthink them," said landfill manager Bresnahan. "The humbling  part is when they outthink you."  </P> <P> Rennie, who also does other tasks at the dump, says that when he first realized  what part of the tasks entailed, he was surprised.  </P> <P> "They said, 'We're going to hire you to shoot a shotgun.' I said, 'Right on!  Sounds great,' " he said, adding that his friends "don't believe it."  </P> <P> Still, he said, "It's not a break. It's a job. You've got to do it. You can't  just take a nap in the truck."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Chilean President Eduadro Frei has requested  that Chile be the site of the next Ibero-American summit to be  held in 1996. [sentence as heard]    Speaking before the heads of state attending the summit in  Cartagena, Frei urged his colleagues to achieve economic  development on the basis of social development and to combat  poverty. The following is a report by our special correspondent.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] All the heads of  state attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit are lodged at  the Cartagena Hilton Hotel. Four thousand policemen and  soldiers have been entrusted with the security of the visiting  dignitaries. For this purpose, they have been detached  throughout the hotel building and the city where many of them  have to endure intense heat and humidity.    Because of extreme weather conditions, the visiting heads of  state arrived at the convention center wearing informal clothes.  President Eduardo Frei was accompanied by his wife, Marta  Larraechea.    Sitting next to Cuban President Fidel Castro during the  first  work session, President Frei broached the subject of open  regionalism.    [Frei] We must expand our trade on realistic and specific  terms and without exceptions. In economy, like in politics,  exclusion is not only unjust but also dangerous.    The number one priority issue of my administration is to  combat poverty. No matter how important it may be, however,  government action is not enough to combat this scourge which is  affecting over one million Chileans. All national groups must,  therefore, join efforts to overcome this situation. In view of  this, it is imperative today to establish a culture of  solidarity which makes people and development the main target of  both government action and private business.    [Reporter] The Ibero-American Summit is the only regional  group that allows Fidel Castro's attendance. Cuba has been  excluded from the OAS since 1962 and only countries with  democratic regimes take part in the Rio Group. [passage omitted]    Although this issue is not on the summit's agenda, there are  informal talks about Cuba's eventual return to the OAS. Asked  his opinion about this, President Frei said:    [Frei] This decision is now up to Cuba. We want Cuba's  return to the Latin American system. This obviously will be  achieved by taking steps toward democracy, implementing a  democratic process, and upholding human rights, which we believe  is of utmost importance.

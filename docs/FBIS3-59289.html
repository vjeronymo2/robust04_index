			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installments No 43, 44, 45, and 46 of the serialized </F> memoirs of Xu Jiatun (6079 1367 1470): "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong  Memoirs"]  <H5>  [16 Jun p 2] </H5> <H3>  British Cooperation Still Needed After 1997; Britain  Participates in Entire Process of Basic Law Drafting </H3>   [Text] During discussions of issues relevant to other  agencies, authorities from those other agencies under the State  Council joined the meetings. For example, authorities from the  Ministry of Finance participated in the discussions on finance  matters. Relevant officials from the General Staff Headquarters  of the Central Military Commission participated in discussions  on the stationing of troops. Authorities from the General  Administration of Civil Aviation joined in discussions of  navigation rights. After discussion, amendment, and arrival at  consensus, the Hong Kong Macao Office put the conclusions in  writing to be implemented after approval by the Central  Committee.    During the process of drafting the Basic Law, many views  were  raised by the secretariat of the drafting committee. In this  respect, the Hong Kong Macao Office and the secretariat of the  drafting committee overlapped and were difficult to distinguish.    The drafting committee included many experts in China such  as  famous legal scholars Zhang Youyu and Yuan Shaoheng and  international law experts Shao Tianren and Wang Jilan. Hu Sheng,  one of the drafters of China's constitution, was also a vice  chairman of the drafting committee. He and Y.K. Pao jointly led  a subcommittee which summarized and organized the proposals and  views discussed by each of the special topic subcommittees.  These experts are all very influential in China. They weighed  every word with extreme prudence and attention to detail in the  discussions on the Basic Law. The Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY participated in the entire process of investigation  and research, consultations, suggestions and discussions on the  drafting of the Basic Law. We did this in two ways. First, the  Hong Kong Macao Office handed down a "topic" and asked the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Branch to provide background information,  views and suggestions. Second, the NEWS AGENCY Branch  voluntarily offered background information and suggestions. This  was the usual approach.    Using investigation and research units as a basis, the  XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY Branch selected relevant people to form a political  system research subcommittee. With Qiao Zonghuai and Mao Junnian  in charge, the subcommittee was tasked with studying political  systems by gathering materials on the development of democracy  and political systems in various countries in the world. They  then studied various types of cases and discussions in Hong  Kong. After approval by the working committee, written reports  on their views and suggestions were submitted to the Hong Kong  Macao Office and to the drafting committee.    Actually, the British government participated in the  drafting  of the Basic Law from the start to the finish. They primarily  used diplomatic channels, through both countries' embassies and  through the PRC-UK Liaison Team. Many issues were touched on in  Beijing, but some issues were communicated through the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch. Although the drafting of the Basic  Law was a Chinese affair, it relates to the implementation of  the PRC-UK Joint Communique. Also, in light of the fact that  during the next 12 years of transition, Hong Kong will still be  administered by Britain; after 1997 some issues relevant to the  content of the Basic Law will require the cooperation of  Britain. The Liaison Team will be retained until the year 2000.  During this time, some issues may require British cooperation.    In summary, the special position and situation of Britain in  Hong Kong before and after 1997 led the Chinese government to  hold respect for Britain's views and to adopt a welcoming  attitude towards Britain's participation. We understand that  they not only used public figures employed in the Hong Kong  government but also other persons with no official titles to  find out what was happening in the meetings. It can be said that  Britain participated in the drafting of the Basic Law from the  start to the finish. The degree of Britain's participation  extended to offering objections to every chapter, section, and  paragraph, even to individual words. This level of specificity  and detail is seldom seen. [Installment No. 43]  <H5>  [17 Jun p 2] </H5> <H3>  Tan Yaozong's Proposal To Protect Labor Interests Rejected;  Nomination of Li Zhuming and Liao Yaozhu to Drafting Committee  Provokes Controversy </H3>   [Text] Hong Kong residents participated only indirectly in  the Sino-British talks because these were negotiations between  two nations. The Chinese government did not allow the British  government to use Hong Kong's opinion as a bargaining chip. In  Beijing and Hong Kong, the Chinese government had contact with  social organizations and public figures from various spheres in  Hong Kong. The government listened to the views and suggestions  of the Hong Kong people and paid attention to the views and  information on Hong Kong reflected in the Hong Kong media and  took these into consideration in making policy.    The formulation of the Basic Law was different. It required  the direct participation of the people of Hong Kong. As Beijing  was considering whether to include Hong Kong people as direct  participants in the drafting committee, there were two views.  One side felt it was not necessary. The other view was that the  committee should include Hong Kong people. The views of the Hong  Kong Macao Office belong to the latter category. I discussed  this issue with Ji Pengfei in Beijing. We both felt that the  people of Hong Kong should participate.    My view at the time was that the Basic Law would determine  the future of the people of Hong Kong and that representatives  from Hong Kong should participate in drafting and formulating  the law. Only in this way would the majority of the people of  Hong Kong then accept the law as their own Basic Law. In  addition, the participation of Hong Kong people would allow for  greater understanding of the feelings of all classes of people  in Hong Kong during the formulation process and would also allow  for a more realistic effort to win the desire of Hong Kong  people to rejoin China.    Ji Pengfei agreed with my view and asked me to consider a  list of names after my return to Hong Kong (this method is the  mainland "custom," at the moment in Hong Kong we still have not  been able to change this). After he reported this suggestion to  the Central Committee and obtained approval, we would proceed  formally. I returned to Hong Kong and immediately received  notification from the Hong Kong Macao Office that the Central  Committee had given approval for 18 people from Hong Kong to  participate in the Basic Law Drafting Committee. We had two  major "headaches" in preparing the list of names. The first was  representativeness; the second was the number of people. The  first issue should have been the main principle for  consideration, but then 18 people would not have been enough. To  increase the number of people, we had to obtain permission from  Beijing. Thus, we started working on a preliminary list of names  and at the same time requested Beijing to increase the number.  Ji Pengfei agreed to add two people, to increase the total to 20.    Participation in the drafting of the Basic Law was a matter  for all Hong Kong people. In theory, there should be  participants representative of all classes of people, but the  number of people was too limited. The working committee agreed  with my thought that the emphasis should be on representatives  from the upper and middle levels, with fewer people from the  lower classes. There would be quite a few Communist Party  members among the mainland representatives to the committee, and  these representatives would compensate for the omission. Later  events demonstrated that this approach was not thorough enough.  When the 8th plenary meeting of the drafting committee was held  in Guangzhou, the section proposed by Tan Yaozong on the  protection of labor interests was rejected. I objected to Ji  Pengfei and Li Hou about this and tried to rescue the situation.    To reassure the British capitalists, some people with close  connections to the Hong Kong British Government also  participated in the drafting process.    To allow Taiwan to be informed on the drafting situation and  be involved in the reuniting of Hong Kong with China, we also  tried to get public figures with close connections to Taiwan to  participate. Finally, however, due to the limitations of the  Taiwan political situation at the time, the representative  persons could not accept our invitation, and those who could  accept our invitation lacked that representativeness and were  dropped from consideration.    There was controversy within the working committee over two  names on the preliminary list. One was lawyer Li Zhuming. At the  time, some felt that Li Zhuming leaned towards Britain,  advocated radical democratization, and frequently said "no" to  proposals from China. I felt that we needed to be tolerant and  win over the friendship of this type of person. In the end, I  convinced my colleagues who opposed him. The other was Liao  Yaozhu, a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and a  representative to the National People's Congress. Colleagues at  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch office all viewed her as a person  who was patriotic but tended to express contrary views and put  other people on the spot. The new and old vice directors of the  news agency as well as many people from cooperating agencies all  objected to nominating her. I had visited her father, Liao Ende.  He gave his frank opinion of his daughter, "She is a knife that  cuts both ways, if she has something to say, she can't hold it  in, but she is truly patriotic." I used old Liao's words to  convince my colleagues. "What's wrong with cutting both ways!  Even for unfriendly criticism, we say `if it is true, correct  it; even if it is not, then increase vigilance.' We should  follow this even more for criticism from a patriot."  [Installment No. 44]  <H5>  [18 Jun p 2] </H5> <H3>  Misunderstood Zheng Weirong But Nominate Him to Drafting  Committee; Britain Pleased Tan Huizhu, Li Fushan To Join  Committee </H3>   [Text] After working the list back and forth, we still had  23 names, three over the quota. The list was submitted to Ji  Pengfei with the explanation that it could not be shortened  further, and it was approved.    The Hong Kong Macao Office submitted the draft list of  mainland committee members to the working committee to seek an  opinion. This list included authorities from relevant Chinese  agencies (including Mao Junnian and myself), authorities from  various democratic parties, well-known figures from various  circles, and senior figures from legal circles. We had no  objection, except that among the individuals from the relevant  agencies were several retired former XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch  directors. I suggested to Ji Pengfei that these be replaced by  younger persons with greather familiarity with Hong Kong and  more "liberated" thinking. Ji indicated that it "might be  considered."    Ji Pengfei convened a meeting of the Hong Kong Macao Working  Committee to discuss the drafting of the Basic Law. During the  discussion on the namelist for the drafting committee, I  repeated my suggestion on the mainland members from relevant  agencies. Ji Pengfei immediately agreed and asked everyone: "Who  would be suitable?" For the moment, no one responded. I  suggested, "What about Zheng Weirong?" No one at the meeting  objected. Ji Pengfei said: "Then it will be Zheng Weirong." I  did not know much about Zheng Weirong. At the time, I thought  that he met the criteria I was considering. Only later did I  learn that I had not completely understood him. Only after the  final namelist was approved by the Central Committee did the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch make contact with the  nominees to seek their views and determine whether they were  willing to be nominated. Generally speaking, most were pleased  to accept. We took pains to seek the views of the Hong Kong  British Government on the nominations of public figures with  Hong Kong government positions such as Tan Huizhu, who was  called the four-fold representative by Hong Kong people (because  she simultaneously served as a member of the Executive Council,  Legislative Council, the Hong Kong City Council, and a District  Council); and Appellate Court Investigation Division (Senior  Judge) Li Fushan [Simon Li Fook-Sean]. The government responded  "pleased to see them serve."    Hong Kong society expressed satisfaction with this,  indicating that it was a very significant issue for the people  of Hong Kong to participate directly in the drafting and  formulation of the Basic Law and to directly reflect the views  of Hong Kong people and strive for Hong Kong people's rights.  They also felt that this namelist "embraced the best from every  sphere, and considered the interests of all sides."    However, there were also many discussions such as on the  view  that there was an overemphasis on the upper class and on  commercial circles, with inadequate representation from the  local districts and the middle and lower classes.    On July 1, 1985, a grand ceremony in Beijing inaugurated the  first plenary session of the Basic Law Drafting Committee.  Twenty-three Hong Kong committee members and 36 mainland  committee members began to discuss the Basic Law to be  implemented in Hong Kong 12 years later. Coincidentally, on this  day 12 years hence, that is, on July 1, 1997, China will resume  the exercise of sovereign rights in Hong Kong.    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress viewed the  participation of Hong Kong people in the drafting of the Basic  Law as very important. Before the first plenum of the drafting  committee, National People's Congress Standing Committee  Chairman Peng Zhen personally sent invitations to all of the  committee members and held a grand ceremony. This was an  approach never before used by the National People's Congress. In  the past when new committees were established by the National  Peoples' Congress, there had never been a ceremony with written  invitations issued by the chairman of the Standing Committee.  [Installment No. 45]  <H5>  [19 Jun p 2] </H5> <H3>  Youde Waives Registration for Advisory Committee; Zhong  Shiyuan, Deng Lianru Decline To Participate </H3>   [Text] Before the first plenary session of the Basic Law  Drafting Committee, there was already consideration of how to  achieve more extensive participation by the people of Hong Kong  because the 23 drafting committee members were, after all, a  small group.    I exchanged views with Ji Pengfei, noting that the Hong Kong  Government had over 300 advisory bodies to carry out "essential  democracy." We could also form an advisory committee in Hong  Kong on the Basic Law, as a non-governmental organization, to  allow the people of Hong Kong to participate in the drafting of  the Basic Law on a broader basis. Ji Pengfei may have already  reported this suggestion to the Central Committee and obtained  approval, because at the first meeting of the drafting  committee, he raised this tentative plan with the Hong Kong  representatives and asked for their reaction. They unanimously  approved and suggested that the drafting committee vice chairmen  in Hong Kong be in charge of setting up the advisory committee.    The five vice chairmen in Hong Kong included An Zijie, Bao  Yugang [Y.K. Pao], Fei Yiming, Li Guobao (Executive Director and  General Manager of the Bank of East Asia), and Xu Jiatun. I was  the only one not from Hong Kong. The reason given internally for  my inclusion was that I was an authority from the working  committee and I should be responsible for matters of principle,  but the other four vice chairmen were told that I was included  because they might need to draw on me to make arrangements for  some specific tasks.    Ji Pengfei convened a meeting of the chairmen and vice  chairmen of the drafting committee to discuss this proposal. The  vice-chairmen from Hong Kong all actively approved, Y.K Pao  being the first to express approval. An Zijie mentioned that  according to Hong Kong law an organization established in Hong  Kong must register wth the Hong Kong Government. It might be  awkward, however, for an advisory committtee on the Basic Law to  register. He felt that we should ask the Hong Kong British  Government to waive the registration requirement. He suggested  that we discuss this with Tan Huizhu and ask her to communicate  with the Hong Kong British Government. Everyone agreed we could  try this. After the meeting, An Zijie and Tan Huizhu, Huang  Lisong, and Situ Hua [Szeto Wah] (Chairman of the Hong Kong  Teachers Professional Association) immediately contacted Hong  Kong Governor Youde who was then in London, by long-distance  telephone. Youde immediate agreed that the advisory committee  would not need to follow the procedures to register as an  organization. An Zijie indicated that we should ask the Hong  Kong Government for written confirmation of this and also for  full support. No one would openly indicate their views on this.  Privately, Ji Pengfei asked me to urge An Zijie not to push the  Hong Kong Government on this. After registration was waived for  the advisory committee, the charter of the committee then did  not require the approval of the Hong Kong Government and there  was no requirement to report on the activities or membership  list to the Hong Kong Government.    To establish the advisory commmittee, we first had to  arrange  for a draft charter and funding. The five vice chairmen from  Hong Kong consulted on whether to call a meeting of the drafting  committee members from Hong Kong to talk over this issue. An  Zijie again raised a question. If we held a meeting in Hong Kong  would we run up against Hong Kong law and be labeled an illegal  gathering? The other vice chairmen all felt that since the Hong  Kong Governor had already indicated that the advisory committee  would be treated as a special case which did not need to  register, holding a meeting should not be a problem. Thus we  decided to invite all the drafting committee members from Hong  Kong (the 23 Hong Kong representatives plus Mao Junnian and  myself) to the meeting hall on the 50th floor of the Huarun  building in Wanchai to discuss issues related to the  establishment of an advisory committee.    The meeting was chaired by Y.K. Pao who suggested that five  people be selected to draft a charter for the advisory  committee. Of the 25 committee members present, there were four  from the legal profession. These were Li Fushan [Simon Li  Fook-Sean], Li Zhuming, Tan Huizhu, and Liao Yaozhu. They were  the obvious choices. An Zijie nominated XINHUA NEWS AGENCY  branch vice secretary and drafting committee vice chairman, Mao  Junnian, to join the group, because in fact setting up the  advisory committee would require the News Agency to assist with  certain tasks. At this time, Szeto Wah nominated himself to join  the group, but Li Fushan objected and very emotionally  announced: "If he joins, I will withdraw." The atmosphere in the  meeting suddenly became very tense. I consulted with Y.K. Pao  and said that one person more or one person fewer would not make  a difference in principle. Whether the group is an odd number or  an even number would not matter because it was only to draft the  charter. If the small group had different views, three votes  against three votes, they could hand it over to the whole Hong  Kong delegation of the drafting commmittee to decide. Pao then  smoothed things over, and calmed the atmosphere so that finally  it was agreed that the six people would form a team responsible  for drafting the charter. The advisory committee needed funding.  During the fund raising process, Y.K. Pao, Li Jiacheng [Li  Kashing], Cha Jiming and others voluntarily took on this burden.  They did not want this to be public. To respect their wishes it  was not publicized. The XINHUA NEWS AGENCY did not ask for  specific details. The secretary and vice-secretary of the  advisory committee reported directly to the chairman and  vice-chairman. Regarding the number of members of the advisory  committee, the Hong Kong Macao Office notified the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY branch that they proposed 80 people, not to exceed 100.  Some of the Hong Kong drafting committee members suggested 200.  I instructed Mao Junnian and Yang Sheng, the director of the  coordination division who assisted him, to "come up with a  namelist and then we'll see." I advocated a broader range and a  larger number of members. The namelist had to include the upper,  middle and lower; the left, middle and right; Chinese and  foreign; male and female; old and young; and the so-called  "right", including those who opposed the Communist Party, and  those who did not approve of Hong Kong reuniting with China. We  drew up three lists of 100 people, 180 people and 200 people.  After repeated comparisons and deliberation, we finally decided  upon a list of 180 members for the advisory committee. After the  list was approved by the vice chairmen from Hong Kong, it was  submitted to the Hong Kong Macao Office for the record.    While deliberating on the namelist, we considered trying to  get Zhong Shiyuan and Deng Lianru to join. We sent people to  seek their views on this but they tactfully refused without  giving much of a reason, just that it was inconvenient for them  to participate. [Installment No. 46]</p>

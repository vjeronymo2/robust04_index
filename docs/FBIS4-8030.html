			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 11 Apr--A meeting between Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  Talbott lasted nearly one and a half hours. Talbott is paying a  two-day official visit to Poland.    After the meeting, Pawlak told journalists that talks  focused, among other things, on Polish-U.S. cooperation in  international financial and economic organizations such as the  World Bank, the IMF, and the OECD. Views were also exchanged on  the "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] program. Pawlak announced  that Polish-U.S. talks at the experts' level would be held soon.  They should lead to joint undertakings this year within the  framework of Poland's cooperation with NATO.    According to Pawlak, development of the whole  Central-Eastern  region of Europe was also discussed, as well as the possibility  of U.S. support for the process.    Talbott said that the United States was of the opinion that  Polish reforms were yielding good results. He stressed that the  United States was the largest investor in Poland and that  economic relations between both states might still be expanded.  Talbott pointed out that economic issues would probably be the  main subject of talks by President Bill Clinton during his visit  to Poland in July.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> River Channel and Floodplains <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Construction of the bridge involves placing of concrete piers and may have some minor short-term effects on the Rio Grande channel. However, the City states that the bridge when constructed will not alter the existing hydrogeological characteristics and will not increase backwater elevation in the Rio Grande by more than one foot. The bottom of the structure will be 12.13 feet above the International Boundary and Water Commission's required water surface elevation and will permit passage under the bridge of the 100-year flood of 181,000 cubic feet per second. The proposal was reviewed by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) and by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, each of which have concurred in the issuance of a Permit. Final design of the bridge will require the approval of the IBWC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Historical and Archaeological Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A programmatic agreement has been executed among the Department of State, the Advisory Council in Historic Preservation, the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer, the Texas Department of Transportation and the City of Laredo, addressing to the satisfaction of those agencies the City's obligation to avoid, minimize or mitigate the effects of the bridge project on known and potential historic and archaeological resources within the construction area. The Presidential Permit contains a provision that the City notify the United States Coast Guard if before or during construction historic or archaeological properties are located and, if construction has already started, cease construction immediately and prepare a Section 4(f) statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Land Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The bridge and border station site are in an undeveloped area within the city limits. The City's Future Land Use Plan shows the project area as open space along the Rio Grande floodplain, retail/office and warehouse/light industrial. The site is predominantly native range and brush land. The general trend of growth of the City of Laredo indicates that the area between the Mines Road and the Rio Grande is likely to be developed for warehouse, industrial and commercial uses even in the absence of a border crossing. The opening of a border crossing will probably accelerate that development. The project will not alter any park or recreational lands or significantly reduce any land suitable for agricultural crops. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Threatened and Endangered Species <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Construction of the project and subsequent development will not result in a significant reduction in range and brush land available for habitat. As noted above, given the trends in growth of the City of Laredo, such habitat loss as may occur is likely to occur even without construction of the bridge. Short-term disruption of narrow bands of vegetation and thickets along the Rio Grande may occur in the course of construction of the bridge and supporting piers. However, no permanent structures, other than bridge piers will be placed in this area, and after construction of the bridge, the area is expected to revegetate. The City has committed to maintaining the Rio Grande as a corridor for wildlife. In a seven point mitigation plan accepted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on August 24, 1994, the City agreed, among other measures, to amend its Land Use Plan, designating the floodplains areas along the Rio Grande and the arroyos located in the vicinity of the proposed project as open space. This was accomplished by City Council resolution of June 27, 1994. The mitigation plan is part of the City's bridge permit application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Noise <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Modeling of the expected traffic noise levels in the years 2000 and 2010 respectively predicts an hourly A-weighted sound level of 71 to 72 dBA, respectively. These levels do not exceed noise abatement criteria established by the FHWA. The closest residential area receptor to the proposed project is a residential unit located approximately 2,050 feet north of the proposed project site. There is a three decibel reduction in noise every time the distance between the noise source and the receptor is doubled. Assuming the noise analysis was conducted on the centerline of a 300 feet wide right-of-way, the predicated 71 dBA would be reduced to approximately 30 dBA at the residential unit. Given reference noise levels of 80 dBA, 77.5 dBA or 75 dBA at 50 feet from trucks accelerating or decelerating, the noise levels anticipated at the residential unit would be 64, 61 and 59 dBA respectively, noise levels that are acceptable for picnic areas, recreation areas, playgrounds, active sports areas and parks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Water Quality/Public Water Supply <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The area of the bridge and associated development will be served by the sewage system of the City of Laredo. Existing water treatment facilities are adequate to handle the increased waste loads anticipated to be produced as a result of the project. Construction activities may result in transient impacts on water quality. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has stated that its concerns regarding water quality, including any discharges which may originate from the project, have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Wetlands <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some minor wetlands are located along the banks of the Rio Grande. As noted above, construction may have some transient effects on these areas, but no permanent construction other than bridge piers will occur in this area which might reduce or otherwise affect the wetlands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of the Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the Environmental Assessment, information developed during the review of the City's application and environmental assessment, and comments received, a finding of no significant impact (``FONSI'') is adopted and an environmental impact statement will not be prepared. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 3, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen R.

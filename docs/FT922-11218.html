			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Stress on need to cut fiscal deficits Excerpts from the G7 communique after the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US. The ministers and governors remained concerned that aggregate G7 economic activity this year would be below potential and growth would be inadequate to achieve a reduction in unemployment. In some countries recovery is still delayed, while growth has slowed significantly in other countries which had experienced relatively stronger growth earlier. The ministers and governors reviewed their economic policies with a view to strengthening world growth. With regard to fiscal policies they emphasised the importance of movement to reduce government demands on private savings to facilitate needed capital spending. In that context, they underline the need to reduce fiscal deficits in all countries with large budgetary imbalances through credible medium-term consolidation strategies. This is important both for countries with long lasting fiscal imbalances and for countries experiencing exceptional adjustment challenges. Those countries with large fiscal deficits, relatively high inflation, excessive wage developments and tight monetary policy should follow a balanced policy approach to facilitate improved growth. Certain other countries with large deficits that have experienced weak growth should avoid actions that would jeopardise medium-term efforts to consolidate budget positions. Where fiscal imbalances have been contained and where recession has been avoided, appropriate measures should be pursued to enhance medium-term growth prospects while maintaining public expenditure under control. In those countries with large surpluses and declining growth, policy makers should be mindful of the possibilities of strengthening domestic demand thought appropriate measures. On monetary policies the ministers and governors welcomed the reductions in cost and price pressures in most of their countries, which have permitted significantly lower interest rates in several cases. Nevertheless, real interest rates remain high, hampering global investment and growth. They were of the view that satisfactory progress on inflation , curbing excessive wage pressure and progress in consolidating fiscal positions would create the basis for lower interest rates.</p>

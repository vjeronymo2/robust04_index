			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: Shetlands confident of overcoming oil disaster Sir, The full impact of the oil spillage on the Shetland islands will not be known for many months, perhaps years. The oil industry is very much part of the way of life in Shetland and will continue to be so for a long time to come. However, in addition to the measures which have long been in place through Shetland Islands Council to manage Sullom Voe tanker traffic, there must also be increased national and international efforts to ensure the safe marine transportation of oil and the protection of the environment by the introduction of additional maritime regulations. We must not underestimate the difficult times that we face, but neither should we overstate them. Our economy has a solid base and we have an excellent name for producing quality goods and providing good services. It is very important to let everyone know that we are not going to allow this disaster to rule us or affect the quality of any of our products or services. The Shetland community is made up of resilient people and we will overcome any difficulties before us. We ask that our customers continue to have faith in our ability to supply quality products and services. M A P McArthur, chair, Shetland Chamber of Commerce, 122 Commercial Street, Lerwick, Scotland ZE1 0HX</p>

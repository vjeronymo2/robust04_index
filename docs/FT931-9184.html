			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Cardenas comes back from the brink: A renewed attempt to gain the Mexican presidency by a candidate who came very close last time in 1988 FIVE YEARS after losing the Mexican presidential election to Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas continues to cast a spell over the nation's politics. Son of the revered President Lazaro Cardenas and named after the last Aztec king, he embodies for much of the country the nationalist past that the present government is leaving behind. Mr Cardenas has now announced his candidacy for next year's presidential election, and is once again the most serious threat to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). No other government or opposition politician is as well-known (except for President Salinas, who is barred by the constitution from running again) and few can match his rapport with the poor and urban left. Such qualities brought him to the brink of victory in the disputed elections of 1988. Many observers, and Mr Cardenas himself, claim he would have won had the voting been clean. Soon after Mr Salinas's victory, Mr Cardenas declared that there had been a 'technical coup d'etat' - but in the end he backed away from violent protests that could have engulfed the country. Mr Cardenas's early declaration gives him 18 months to build the sort of grass-roots support he enjoyed in 1988 - and a significant head start over other contenders. The PRI candidate is not expected to be announced until late this year or early next. There are other factors in his favour. As Mr Cardenas says: 'Many more people now in Mexico are conscious that things can change because of an election.' In the past five years, the PRI has lost two governorships, and conceded a third after a disputed election - the first time it has ever lost such elections. The government is also under growing domestic and international pressure to respect the vote. Few doubt, however, that Mr Cardenas faces an uphill task. His newly-formed Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) has been beset by internal divisions, while its aggressive, confrontational style has cost it support, and undermined its claim to be a party for democracy. In a crucial test of popularity, the PRD failed last year to win the gubernatorial election in Michoacan, Mr Cardenas's home state. Nationally, its popularity is put at a mere 10-15 per cent. The PRI, for its part, has recovered much of its natural support, thanks to a steady, if unspectacular, improvement in the economy. Inflation, which had reached 160 per cent a year in 1987, is likely fall to single digits next month, and per capita economic growth has been positive for the past four years. Mr Salinas's energetic travels around the country in support of his Dollars 3bn-a-year anti-poverty programme have further helped his government. But Mr Cardenas was also written off six years ago, before gaining momentum in the last stages of the campaign. He is already distancing himself from the PRD, and pointedly described himself as the 'citizen's candidate' when announcing his bid for the Mexican presidency. This week, he will resign as PRD president to give himself freedom to define his candidacy as he wishes. He has also matured in the past five years. He has gone out of his way to present himself as a reasonable, cautious politician, rather than the demon conjured up by government propaganda. He has dined with important businessmen, encouraged disaffected opposition leaders from the centre-right Party of National Action to join his movement, and even suggested he would withdraw his candidacy if a strong consensus candidate emerged from the opposition. There has also been a change in Mr Cardenas's views. 'He now realises that Mexico's economic limitations mean social programmes have to be modest and that a good relationship between Mexico and the US is crucial to the financial sustainability of his programme,' says Mr Adolfo Aguilar, a close friend and adviser. Mr Cardenas says that while he would try to improve the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement, he would not reject it. Nor, say advisers, would he restrict foreign investment, renationalise industries privatised by Mr Salinas, or deliberately endanger the macro-economic stability so painfully acquired over the past decade. His ideas for economic reform are not yet specific. Aides talk vaguely about selective protectionism, subsidies to medium-sized and small industries, reactivation of the internal economy, and greater social justice, but with little sense of priorities. As Mr Aguilar says: 'There is still no clear economic programme'. Mr Cardenas will focus part of his campaign on the lack of democratic change in Mexico - what he sees as the continuing intrusion of the governing party in all walks of life, the biased coverage it receives on national television, and its control of electoral and other nominally independent organisations. In this way, he hopes to build up a strong base of support from the politically active middle-class, even from those who might not agree with his views on the economy. But, coming from a man who spent 20 years in the PRI, such attacks often lack credibility. And even if he overcomes all his other handicaps, these very conditions will make it difficult for him to wrest power from the PRI, just as they did in the far more favourable circumstances of 1988.</p>

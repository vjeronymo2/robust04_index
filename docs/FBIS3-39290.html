Skaarup: "Folketing </F> Demands Removal of Secrecy Surrounding Police Intelligence Work"]    [Text] Five years after the end of the Cold War, the  Folketing is demanding greater openness in the PET [Police  Intelligence Service].    The service's surveillance of extreme political activities  among the population and search for spies and terrorists is to  be brought into the light of day. The inspiration for this lies  in our neighboring countries, including the German Intelligence  Service, which openly speaks about its work.    The special parliamentary control committee of five members  is currently exploring how much access the public can demand  without its jeopardizing the effectiveness of the PET's  investigations, according to committee Chairman Svend Erik  Hovmand (V [Liberal Party]).    The blanket of secrecy is today so thick that the public is  allowed to know nothing of the budget, methods of investigation,  or files on suspects. Even the control committee -- with all  the parliamentary committees under the strictest pledge of  secrecy -- has access only to the broad, general guidelines for  PET's work.    Svend Erik Hovmand is assured of a majority for the idea.  Two other committee members, Ole Espersen (SDP [Social  Democratic Party]) and Jens Thoft (SF [Socialist People's  Party]) have already expressed agreement.    "There is no reason whatsoever why the guidelines for PET's  work, for example, should be kept from the public. In my  opinion, around 10 out of almost 1,000 pages received by the  control committee since it was set up in 1988 ought to be kept  secret. As for the rest, if they were left scattered about the  streets it would not matter," Jens Thoft said.    He has been jealously observing the open-door policy  practiced by the German Intelligence Service. A quarterly  account is published with information on the current threat  situation and on the groups currently under surveillance.    "In a democratic country it is both reasonable and important  that the citizens know as much as possible about the public  institutions. That must also apply to the Police Intelligence  Service," Svend Erik Hovmand said.    The head of PET, Chief Commissioner Birgitte Stampe, is no  stranger to the idea. She has revealed that she is in the  process of writing a folder on the PET similar to those already  issued by the British MI5 and the Norwegian Surveillance Police.  If Justice Minister Erling Olsen (SDP) is able to support the  idea, the folder will be available later in the year at public  libraries.</p>

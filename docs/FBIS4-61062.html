			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and  others]    [Text] The Ukrainian nationalists who put forward  territorial claims to Russia and who speak about Kuban and "the  north Slobozhanshina" (southern districts of the Kursk and  Belgorod regions within the Russian Federation -- INTERFAX) as  about truly Ukrainian territories "are playing with fire." A  prominent Russian expert, who is in charge for the problems of  the Russian-Ukrainian relations, that's why he preferred to stay  anonymous, expressed this opinion in his interview with INTERFAX.    In his words, "those Ukrainian politicians who strive "to  pull out" Russia out of Crimea and "to possess" the entire Black  Sea Fleet demonstrate the same play with fire. Unfortunately,  separate officials in Kiev also voice identical statements," he  noted.    As the expert said, "Russia does not raise the issue on  Crimea's return at the official level" "As one can say, what has  been done, has been done. In 1954 during the celebration of the  300th anniversary of Ukraine's and Russia's re-unification  Nikita Khrushchev handed over Crimea to Ukraine with a stroke of  the pen. Now it does not matter much that nobody asked the  Crimeans about this. This wide gesture of the communist leader,  who is often and, probably, justly called a precursor of one  more reformatory, Mikhail Gorbachev, has not changed anything in  the life of the peninsula or his citizens. The USSR has not  only seemed, but it was a monolith in which the borders between  its republics were of pure nominal and administrative nature,"  he pointed out.    The expert believes that after the collapse of the USSR  "Yeltsin's team" had no choice but to recognize the territorial  integrity of Ukraine within the former Ukrainian Soviet  Socialist Republic. "As if we have lacked only a conflict  between Russia and Ukraine,--he noted.--Meanwhile, the time  places everything to the proper place. If the emissaries from  Kiev and Lvov had not tried to dictate their provisions to the  Crimeans, had not implemented an artificial Ukrainization, and  agreed to the introduction of the institute of dual citizenship  then the situation in the Russian- speaking and pro-Russian  Crimea could have remained more or less calm. However, Kiev has  made an opposite decision and even has not let the  democratically elected Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov to the  negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministers  Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy who were held in Sevastopol,  that is in Crimea."    According to the expert, such actions are able "to blow up"  not only Crimea but to undermine Ukraine's territorial  integrity. "It is not necessary to be a prophet in order to  forecast the results of the possible referendum on Crimea's  withdrawal from Ukraine and its unification with the Russian  Federation. One can ban a referendum and recognize it  non-constitutional. However, one should not forget that even  the principles of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe which has fixed the unchangeability of the post-war  borders, admits that such a referendum is quite possible under  certain provisions. And where is the guarantee that the Donetsk  basin and Ukraine's whole Left Bank region would not follow  Crimea? It is difficult to predict any answer under the  forthcoming economic collapse of the Ukrainian economy,"  stressed the expert.    He expressed his supposition that "these premises make  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk force postponement of the  presidential elections scheduled for 26 June." "It's interesting  to note that the most active critics representing Ukrainian  nationalists support Kravchuk's position. Apparently they  understand what they do in this case," he made a conclusion.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Fokker's earnings down 74% FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft producer, yesterday reported a 74 per cent drop in 1992 net profits and warned that prolonged recession and the cost of planned redundancies will would further depress this year's results. Net profits fell to Fl 20m (Dollars 11.17m), from an adjusted Fl 77m, on sales of Fl 4.08bn. Operating results were roughly unchanged at Fl 131.3m, against Fl 134.6m in 1991. But heavy financing costs, which rose from Fl 62m to Fl 126m, depressed final earnings. The group will forgo a dividend payment for the year. Fokker, in which Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary is to take a majority stake, recently unveiled plans to cut production and trim its workforce by 2,118 from the present 12,500 by year-end. Output of the 50-seat twin-turboprop Fokker 50 will be cut from 27 to 20 by 1994, and the number of new 100-seat Fokker 100 twin-jets will fall from 59 to 40 in 1995. The job cuts are expected to save the group some Fl 270m in annual wages, although the rationalisation will initially entail heavy, but as-yet undetermined, costs. Fokker, while welcoming Thursday's approval of the takeover by the Daimler-Benz supervisory board, said 1993 would be 'a year of adjustment to the altered circumstances', adding profits would remain under pressure.</p>

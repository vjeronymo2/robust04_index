			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Better news from the Balkans For over a month now, since the Bosnian Serbs complied with Nato's ultimatum and withdrew their heavy weapons from Sarajevo, the news from the former Yugoslavia has been, for the most part, unusually good. Further west, the war between Croats and Moslems has been brought to a sudden halt. Supply routes have been opened. The two sides have agreed on a federal constitution, and even on merging their forces into a common army. Northwards, the Serbs have allowed the reopening of Tuzla airport, and have at long last permitted a UN relief convoy to reach the Moslem enclave of Maglaj. These hopeful developments have been achieved through diplomacy, backed by a show of military force and political resolve - elements which were cruelly lacking in earlier attempts to stop the fighting. Force has been displayed by Nato in the air and by the UN on the ground. At the local level General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, has proved an outstanding diplomat, with a rare grasp of Clausewitzian principle. At the international level Mr Charles Redman and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the US and Russian special envoys, have performed prodigies of discreet arm-twisting on their respective Balkan clients. Indeed, their achievements have spread beyond Bosnia, with the ceasefire agreement signed early yesterday by Croatian officials and Serb leaders from the breakaway Krajina region. Euphoria premature But euphoria would be premature, to say the least. The peace in Sarajevo, however welcome, is based on de facto recognition of Serb authority in several suburbs where Moslems were the largest group before the war. It could easily turn out to be a further step towards permanent partition of the city. Meanwhile in Banja Luka, the main city of northern Bosnia, the odious process of 'ethnic cleansing' is still going on. In Croatia, too, the new agreement consolidates territorial division by installing a buffer zone, to be policed by UN troops. This was precisely the deployment which the Vance Plan, on which the original ceasefire was based two years ago, had been careful, at Croat insistence, to avoid. Croats are well aware of the precedent set in Cyprus, where a UN-manned 'green line' across the island has become a 20-year partition. Accordingly the Vance Plan provided for an 'ink-blot' UN deployment in 'protected areas', within which militias were supposed to be disarmed, and refugees allowed to return to their homes. None of that has happened, and it now seems unlikely it will. US firmness Hopes for peace in both Bosnia and Croatia now depend on a combination of US firmness and Russian diplomacy. Between them, they will have to push the Serbs beyond ceasefires into withdrawing from captured territory, and into accepting, in name at least, both Bosnia and Croatia as sovereign states within their prewar frontiers. Nor should Serbia be allowed to think that the present state of affairs in Kosovo can continue indefinitely. The ethnic Albanians there, comprising 90 per cent of the population, have been deprived not only of the autonomy they enjoyed before 1989 but effectively of all political and civil rights. Their leader, Mr Ibrahim Rugova, has so far restrained them from taking up arms. For that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but so far the main result has been that the world has postponed dealing with their problem, while the Serbs in Krajina, who did take up arms, seem likely to be offered autonomy amounting to independence in all but name. Inevitably some Albanians are beginning to question Mr Rugova's strategy. The US has suggested linking the lifting of sanctions on Serbia to solution of the problems in Croatia and Kosovo, and to the handing over of war criminals. Legally that may be difficult to sustain, and Russia can be expected to object, since sanctions were originally imposed only to deal with the situation in Bosnia. Politically, however, the connection is clear. If Russia is going to make itself the guarantor of Serbia's contribution to peace in the Balkans, it will have to interest itself in the whole range of Serbian behaviour.</p>

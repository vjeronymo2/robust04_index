			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS REFUSE TO URGE BAN ON WOOD ROOFS  </P> <P> A divided Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday refused to support  a ban on new wood roofs, despite claims that such a ban could have dramatically  reduced losses from recent Southern California fires.  </P> <P> The 3-2 vote was strictly along ideological lines, with the board's  conservative majority opposing liberal Supervisor Kenneth Hahn's call for state  legislation banning new wood roofs throughout California.  </P> <P> Hahn has proposed a ban after every major fire for more than a quarter of a  century. Each time he has been rebuffed by his colleagues who side with the  roof industry in contending that wood roofs treated with a fire retardant  provide adequate protection.  </P> <P> This time, Hahn cited recent fires in Glendale, Santa Barbara and Chino Hills  that destroyed more than 500 homes -- most with wood roofs.  </P> <P> "If you watch television, you could see the embers go from one wood shake roof  to another," Hahn said. "How many fire tragedies must occur before we take  steps to ban these dangerous roofs?"  </P> <P> In Santa Barbara County, where 435 homes were destroyed, officials plan to  recommend that their Board of Supervisors outlaw all new wood or replacement  wood roofs, building official Frank Breckenridge said Tuesday.  </P> <P> In Glendale, where the City Council banned all new wood roofs a year ago, the  majority of the 66 homes damaged or destroyed in last week's fire had wood  roofs, Glendale Fire Marshal Chris Gray said.  </P> <P> Hahn argued that a statewide ban would save the county money. "Look at all the  fire trucks we had to send" to help fight the Glendale and Santa Barbara fires,  he said.  </P> <P> But conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich said that the type of roof  installed on homes is an issue of "freedom of choice" best left to property  owners.  </P> <P> Antonovich, who lives in Glendale but outside the fire zone, pointed out that  during the recent fires, some homes with slate and tile roofs were destroyed,  while others with wood roofs survived.  </P> <P> Supervisor Deane Dana said he replaced the wood roof on his Palos Verdes home  with a fire-resistant one because "I live in an area where there is a possible  danger." But he said he opposes a statewide ban as unnecessary and too costly  for homeowners.  </P> <P> Supervisor Pete Schabarum also voted against Hahn's proposal, while Supervisor  Ed Edelman supported it.  </P> <P> A ban on new wood roofs in the city of Los Angeles, approved last year by the  mayor and City Council, is being challenged in court by the wood roof industry.  Wood roofs are also banned in fire-prone Malibu.  </P> <P> Last year, supervisors extended to all unincorporated areas under their  jurisdiction a requirement that new and replacement wood roofs be treated with  a fire retardant.  </P> <P> State legislation banning wood roofs has been introduced in recent years, but  has always been defeated amid heavy lobbying from the wood roof industry.  </P> <P> Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) is now sponsoring a bill that would reinforce  the authority of local government to adopt tougher roofing restrictions than  the state, an aide said.  </P> <P> Industry officials estimate that about 30% of all homes in Los Angeles have  wood roofs, and fire officials have long blamed them for boosting the damage  toll of periodic brush fires.  </P> <P> Mike Westfall, president of the Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau in Bellevue,  Wash., accused Hahn of a "knee-jerk reaction." Westfall said his trade  organization has sent teams to Southern California to assess the damage from  the fires and found that some homes with tile roofs were destroyed, while  neighborhood homes with wood roofs suffered no damage.  </P> <P> Breckenridge of Santa Barbara County said that homes without wood roofs had a  "significantly" better survival rate in the recent fire than those with wood  roofs.  </P></p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs refuse to let bombs set agenda  -Westminster's reaction to Saturday's explosion MR John Major's refusal to be provoked by the IRA's attack on the City captured the mood of most MPs yesterday - and avoided the terrorists triggering a debate over government policy on Northern Ireland. Pressure for tougher security on the UK mainland was palpable at Westminster yesterday - although there was no consensus on specific measures, beyond greater vigilance. But Conservative MPs and the Labour party were determined to avoid 'knee-jerk' reactions. 'Today in the City, it is business as usual,' the prime minister told the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. Mr John Smith, Labour party leader, said: 'It has to be made absolutely clear to the evil men of the IRA that . . . the nation as a whole will not be intimidated or diverted from their normal course of action by bombing.' There were no calls for a Commons' statement by the government. One loyalist Tory MP said: 'We keep on. The road is seamless. There is no great groundswell for a change of policy.' Yet a Commons debate may have revealed Conservative tensions over government thinking on Northern Ireland. Some Tories have joined Ulster Unionist MPs in expressing fears that the government is drifting too close to a nationalist agenda, encouraging the IRA to think it is making an impact. 'We need to make it quite plain that Ulster shall remain part of the UK and stop constitutional mongering that panders to the US and the south of Ireland,' said Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton south-west. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said Britain has 'no strategic interest' in Northern Ireland and that the province remains part of the UK because a majority of its population wants to be. Last Friday he ruled out a future political agreement in Northern Ireland that precluded future unification. Fresh protests from Ulster Unionists MPs came yesterday from comments by Sir Patrick in a German magazine when he went further than intended in saying Britain would 'very happily' release Northern Ireland if unification was supported locally. The remark was withdrawn immediately. However, it would be unfair to suggest that support for Northern Ireland's Unionist parties is unbending within Tory ranks. Mr Budgen admits he is in a minority: 'I don't think most of my colleagues have much of a view about Ulster, to be honest.' To an extent, there is indifference - few Tory MPs take a close interest in Northern Ireland; relations with the Northern Ireland parties are not often intimate. But there is also a consensus that, after nearly 25 years of 'troubles', Northern Ireland's problems have to be addressed through political talks. Events such as those that occurred on Saturday have to be divorced from that process. 'In spite of its murderous actions, the IRA does have a political rationale and that is a united Ireland . . . Any reaction based on a political solution is actually what the IRA wants to see happen,' said Mr Graham Riddick, Tory MP for Colne Valley. In practice, the successful resumption of political talks will depend on local factors. The biggest obstacle may be the reaction of Ulster Unionists to discussions between Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Generals stay in line for Yeltsin: Moscow's plan for peace at home GENERAL Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, insisted this week that the military would not become involved in politics. But the definition of 'involved' is, in today's Russia, a flexible one. The Russian armed forces are undergoing such colossal change that some political unrest within their ranks is inevitable. The question is the scale and the danger of that unrest. First, it is well attested - by reporters and editors on the daily Izvestia  -that at the end of a meeting of the Russian security council on Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin was told by a group of senior commanders that he should take resolute measures to end the political crisis. The implication - though not spelled out, either then or subsequently - is that the army would be on the president's side if presidential rule were established. Mr Yuri Skokov, secretary of the security council, sidestepped questions about Izvestia's report from MPs yesterday, saying the council had discussed military and foreign policies, and that any other reports should be taken up with Izvestia. Gen Grachev, appointed by Mr Yeltsin after the former's part in defending the White House during the August 1991 putsch, is himself under attack from discontented officers. Many of them demonstrated in Moscow last week, and demanded his resignation, as well as that of Mr Yeltsin. There has been no announcement that officers who took part in the rally - and were filmed doing so, in their uniforms - have been disciplined. Gen Grachev was also constrained yesterday to deny charges from some MPs that corruption and theft among his troops were on the increase. However, the evidence is that he is struggling to contain just such elements: a number of generals have been charged with corruption, and he has threatened to sack senior commanders of the Pacific Fleet for failing to deliver food and other supplies to conscripts - resulting in actual deaths from hunger and widespread malnutrition. Captain Victor Cherepkov, head of the official investigation into conditions in the Pacific Fleet, told the Russian Information Agency yesterday that 'disgraceful outrages' had occurred and that 'never was battle-readiness in the Fleet as low as it is now'. Capt Cherepkov blamed the 'top brass' - the implication being that they had been profiteering from the theft of their sailors' rations. However, as Gen Grachev is defensive at home, he is expansionist abroad  - or at least in the neighbouring former Soviet states, which Russian commanders clearly do not really consider to be abroad. He recently visited the Abkhazian region of Georgia - where Abkhazian separatists are locked in conflict with Georgian forces, the former allegedly enjoying the support of Russian units - without an invitation from the Georgian government. Before he did so, he said that Russian troops would stay in the area to safeguard access to the Black Sea. Russian troops also remain stationed in the TransDnestr area of Moldova, in the Baltics and throughout Central Asia. The Black Sea fleet, based in Sevastopol in the Ukrainian region of Crimea, is under uneasy joint Russian-Ukrainian command: while Russia actually drafts troops from Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian states to make up for the lack of enthusiasm among its own pool of conscripts. President Yeltsin yesterday told Mr Mauno Koivisto, the Finnish president, that Russia would extend its security coverage only to those states which wished it. This a 'clarification' of remarks he made at the weekend in which he appeared to be asking for international agencies to give him a free had in quelling conflict throughout the former Soviet Union (which he is, in effect, doing anyway). It is clear, however, that Mr Yeltsin is willing to support his generals' desire to keep presences in as many former Soviet states as possible: in return for this, they are likely to feel he is worthy of their continuing support.</p>

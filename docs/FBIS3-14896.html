Esteemed representatives of the Armed Forces!    Respected guests!    First of all, let me congratulate you on the occasion of the  Day of Fatherland's Defenders and the Armed Forces of the  Republic of Belarus!    There is hardly a family, even hardly a person in our  republic, whose fates have not been connected in one way or  another with the past war, with the Army, with the making of the  Armed Forces.    Many times, our soil had been the scene of terrible battles  for freedom and independence of the Fatherland. Such is the  history. Many times, foreign invaders trod over our land and  crop, set our towns and villages on fire. And every time, the  path of the invading enemies was blocked by Fatherland's  Defenders, by our valiant soldiers, guerrillas, and  conspirators. The destiny of the Belarusian nation as well as  those of other nations have often been determined on the banks  of the Berezina river, alongside the gray Dnepr river, and by  the walls of the Brest fortress.    Addressing our words of gratitude to older generations, and  bowing our heads by the graves of the fallen and those dead of  wounds and woes during the evil years of the war, we also draw  conclusions for the present day. We should always remember how  great was the price paid for our victory and freedom.  Therefore, it is our holy duty to preserve and augment the  glorious traditions of our ancestors.    Today our activity proceeds from our realities. The Republic  of Belarus is an independent, sovereign state. A young state,  too. Our state threatens nobody's security and builds its  relations with all states on the basis of equal partnership and  mutual respect, having clearly determined its neutral status  that is being affirmed through practical actions.    While building up our tomorrow, we have to begin many things  anew. At the current time, in an exceptionally important and,  due to objective reasons, complicated period, we lay the  foundations for a new economic union with Russia and other CIS  countries, as well as strengthen our ties with the countries of  far abroad. Belarus favors collective security, supports those  good traditions which were established with Russia and other  countries of the former USSR during the past decades.    Undoubtedly, we are all expecting improvements in all the  spheres of our life. However, to achieve them, we must  determine the ways out of the crisis and resolve many complex  problems. Alas, many things -- due to various objective and  subjective reasons -- are being resolved in an undesirable way.  There is a very complex situation in the national economy. The  national income, as compared to January-December last year [as  published], decreased by 10 percent. The decrease in industrial  production during 1993-94 in comparable prices amounts to 18.5  percent. The situation in agriculture -- it should be openly  admitted -- has become threatening. Immediate measures should  be adopted there, and we will adopt them.    The issues of the upcoming sowing campaign have recently  been  discussed at the Supreme Soviet Presidium session. New  possibilities of financial aid to the countryside have been  found; some other problems will also be resolved.    With regard to our economy as a whole, we are principally  committed to the orientation toward an economic union with  Russia, toward a single ruble zone. I think that, given the  current circumstances, this approach is reasonable. It is  important to stabilize industry, give enterprises greater  employment opportunities, and restore people's confidence in the  future.    In today's activity of the Supreme Soviet, we give priority  to the questions of the state political system: Introduction of  the presidency and the nationwide elections of the president as  a head of the state and executive power. The necessary draft  laws have been prepared, and will be discussed during the  current Supreme Soviet session.    The parliamentary opposition as well as certain political  parties and movements urge early elections for the Supreme  Soviet; they propose holding presidential elections next, and,  then ultimately, adopting a new constitution. I believe that in  this case we should expect an interim period of complete state  uncontrollability. I think that I do not need to mention the  consequences of such a period.    Esteemed representatives of the Armed Forces! The issues  related to the building of the Army and the defense of the  Republic of Belarus have always been given priority by the  Supreme Soviet.    The current process of reforms in the Armed Forces tends not  to disorganize the defense capability of the republic, but to  bring this capability in line with the current political and  economic situation of our young sovereign state.    There are many difficulties. What are their roots and  origins?    The Belarusian people have been living in peace for the last  50 years. It is a rare historical fact. However, due to  well-known political processes, a change in the world outlook  has occurred over the last two years. Along with it, a sense of  honor for the destiny of the Fatherland has been lost to a  certain extent. A very negative role has recently been played  by political games, to which the Army was a hostage. Many of  those who honestly attended to their military duties, have been  brought down by a rush of accusations and insults. By unjust  accusations and insults, I would like to emphasize. As a  result, a fall in the prestige of the military service and work  among the ranks followed.    Celebrating the professional holiday of servicemen, which is  historically associated with the notions of manly valor, honor,  and dignity, we also see those first results that were attained  in the complex work of building the Belarusian Armed Forces.    Having declared its nonnuclear status and commitment to  neutrality, Belarus has to eliminate these disproportions in a  short time and benefit as much as possible from all that was  inherited. Unfortunately, mistakes have been made here, too.    Having announced our move toward neutrality, we clearly  realize that the desirable effect cannot be achieved quickly.  Therefore, many politicians understand that one has to  optimally make use of those circumstances, of those economic,  political, social, and demographic situations that were attained  during the existence of the USSR.    A well-considered approach by the Supreme Soviet and the  government as well as a good attitude of our citizens to  transformations in the military sphere have allowed us to  prepare a legislative basis for resolving the tasks of the state  defense and the creation of our own Armed Forces.    Over 30 laws have been worked out and adopted; the  government  has implemented over 60 normative documents. On this basis, it  was possible to reduce the number of troops almost by half in  two years, as well as to implement the principal structural  transformations which were applicable to the situation and the  capability of our state.    To picture the scale of this work, I will cite some figures.  By November 1995, the republic should dismantle over 2,000  tanks, about 1,500 combat vehicles, and over 500 aircraft.    We are for the strict fulfillment of international  agreements. However, we also need an understanding on the part  of other states which are interested in providing security to  the European continent. Under the circumstances that have been  globally changed -- I put it straightforwardly -- our republic  alone is incapable of fulfilling those agreements.    We, undoubtedly, count on the predominance of the spirit of  reality among the governments of Europe and the United States,  as well as their financial and material participation in the  resolution of these issues.    However, it is only a single, though very important, aspect.  As the building of our statehood advances, new layers of very  complex problems are uncovered. Therefore, while celebrating  the day of Fatherland's Defenders and the Armed Forces, we also  consult the righteousness of the adopted orientation with that  part of our society, which is most competent in the military  sphere.    I evaluate the situation in the Army, which was created by  our joint efforts with the Ministry of Defense in the process of  reforming and deeply reducing the troops, as a success.    The Supreme Soviet is deeply concerned today with the  situation of servicemen and their families, as well as those  pensioned or transferred to the reserve due to reforms in the  Army.    The economic situation in the republic does not allow us to  safeguard the proper level of social guarantees to the right  degree. I will say even more -- for the time being, we are not  able to provide our troops with satisfactory material and  technical support.    The Supreme Soviet and the government are very concerned  with  the level of military discipline and the fall in the level of  patriotic education of youth.    There are many problems. However, there are also good  aspects. I think that we all, including the information media,  should also see the good things.    I am sure, dear friends, that all those who served in the  Army, and those who are serving today, as well as all the  Belarusian citizens understand very well that our future is in  our hands.    Let me congratulate you on the Day of Fatherland's Defenders  and the Armed Forces.    I wish you good health and every success in mastering combat  ability for the benefit of our Belarus!    Dear veterans!    I thank you for your contribution to the strengthening of  our  state independence and the education of the young generation.    I wish you happiness and joy for long years to come!    Congratulations, dear friends!</p>

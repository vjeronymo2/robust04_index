			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Way cleared for another media deal for Pearson THE completion of Pearson's Pounds 99m acquisition of Thames Television clears the way for another potentially large media deal by the publishing, industrial and banking group. Mr Frank Barlow, the managing director of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is interested in the consortium now being put together to bid for the film interests of the Rank Organisation. Mr John Whitney, former director general of the Independent Broadcasting Authority and Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, have put together a small company called Premier Media to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m to bid for Rank's film businesses. These range from an important film library and film distribution business to Pinewood studios, the Odeon cinema chain and video duplication. Rank executives have denied their film businesses are for sale although the company has debt of around Pounds 1bn. In the past few months Pearson has been preoccupied with completing the Thames deal which went unconditional on Wednesday. Premier Media now expects talks with Pearson to get more serious. Both Lord Blakenham, the Pearson chairman and Mr Barlow have made it clear recently that they want to create a major television division for the company. Nothing has been agreed between Pearson and Premier, but one possibility looked at would envisage the publishing group taking a majority stake in the consortium.</p>

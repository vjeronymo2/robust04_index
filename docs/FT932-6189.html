			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Pull together, or fall apart: The Tory party must choose between power and revenge Now the Conservative party must make up its mind. Fair or otherwise, Mr John Major has removed the fault-line in his cabinet. Mr Norman Lamont's departure was a necessary condition for the prime minister's survival. But it was not sufficient. Now it is for his party, exhausted and faction-riven, to decide whether it has, any longer, the will to govern. The first response was not encouraging. The disgruntled, disenchanted and irreconcilable on the Tory backbenches once again filled the airwaves. For some, Mr Major had not done enough. The game of musical chairs which had accompanied Mr Lamont's sacking had smacked of timidity rather than firm government. Others - on the Euro-sceptic right - were busy laying down publicly the conditions under which Mr Kenneth Clarke could run the Treasury: no return to the exchange rate mechanism, real cuts in the welfare state. Hard to remember that the Conservatives once were the party of unity. In private conversations there was not even the pretence of common cause. How close Mr Clarke was now to the premiership was the rhetorical question of one ministerial colleague. The Tories still have a sense of history. Had not Mr Anthony Eden sealed his fate as prime minister when in 1955 he had made Mr Harold MacMillan his chancellor? What were we to make of Mr Michael Heseltine's public admission that Mr Lamont had been a scapegoat, queried another loyal colleague. He answered the question himself: Mr Heseltine was positioning himself for a leadership contest. Then there was the synthetic shock at Mr Lamont's departure. For months now MPs across the party have been complaining that the government's fortunes were irrecoverable as long Mr Lamont stayed in Number 11 Downing Street. After the defeats in Newbury and the county council elections on May 6, the clamour became deafening. If Mr Major did not listen, he would be considered weak, wounded, and vulnerable to a leadership challenge in the autumn. The best Mr Lamont's colleagues could offer when asked to defend the then chancellor was a doleful flick of the eyebrows, an embarrassed glance at scuffed shoes. Anyone who followed close-up the campaign against Mr Lamont cannot escape one conclusion: if the former chancellor was betrayed, it was not by Mr Major but by his party. That includes many Mr Lamont might still number among his political friends. They found no time to consider the justice of it all as they waited in eager anticipation on Thursday morning for the summons to 10 Downing Street. By yesterday Mr Michael Howard, the newly-promoted home secretary, was dismissing the recriminations as 'tittle-tattle'. Mr Heseltine reminded us that politics had always been a 'ruthless business'. But that sounds too polite for the modern Tory party. Mr Major's only hope now is that is that after a year on the edge of the abyss, the government's supporters at Westminster will come to their collective senses. The choice is a straightforward one: between power and revenge. He might be lucky. The recession has ended. By the end of the July the bitter struggle over the Maastricht treaty should be over. For all the apparent lack of inspiration in the reshuffle which accompanied Mr Lamont's departure, the re-arranging of the place mats around the cabinet table could make a difference. The new line-up may well reinforce the impression that Mr Major is the creature rather than the master of his cabinet. The authority of Messrs Clarke, Hurd, Howard and Heseltine will be unchallengable. But if his colleagues manage to contain their personal ambitions, the prime minister should be able to turn their political effectiveness to his own advantage. Mr Clarke is an accomplished operator - described by Lord Tebbit, no less, as the best politician in the cabinet. His formidable skills should allow the government to draw maximum advantage from the slow process of economic recovery. He should restore to management of the economy an impression at least that the government has retrieved its grip. At times like this, political weight is worth much more than detailed comprehension of the Treasury's monetary motorways. The medium problems facing the British economy (see below) - a Pounds 1bn-a-week borrowing requirement, an inflation psychology which has been suppressed rather than extinguished - have not departed with Mr Lamont. But in the short term, low inflation and the emerging recovery provide Mr Clarke with a valuable breathing space. And if more pain is required in the November budget - on the spending, the tax or on both sides of the Treasury's balance sheet - the new chancellor is as good as any to placate his colleagues on the backbenches. Mr Clarke's easy relationship with Mr Douglas Hurd (he ran the foreign secretary's unsuccessful leadership campaign in 1990) and with Mr Heseltine carries with it obvious advantages. The government's policy towards Europe will be shaped by a chancellor and foreign secretary who share the same outlook. The Treasury now has a master sympathetic rather than antagonistic to the ambitions of the department of trade and industry. Mr David Hunt's appointment to head employment completes the picture. A former acolyte of Mr Heseltine, Mr Hunt shares the view that government can no longer afford to be indifferent to the fate of industry. Mr Howard, of course, is not a member of the same One-Nation team. But his promotion to the Home Office will be well-received among the party's activists. Now anointed as the candidate of the right, he will offer the government's supporters on the ground the reassurance they have been demanding that it is prepared to be tough on crime. And for now, Mr Howard's interest lies in Mr Major's leadership. All of this will count for nothing unless the party at Westminster is willing to endorse the prime minister's words, that tomorrow is more important than yesterday. Fourteen years in government, the enforced departure of Lady Thatcher and the war over Maastricht have torn apart the fabric of loyalty on which Conservative governments could once depend. Restoring the habit of discipline will not be easy. The wounds inflicted by Maastricht will not be healed by the appointment to the Treasury of an enthusiast for Europe. Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit have yet to have their say on the treaty in the House of Lords. And brooding in the background stands Mr Lamont. Convinced that he has been betrayed, the former chancellor must decide whether he values his reputation above revenge. He does not have the authority enjoyed by the then Mr Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe when they delivered from the backbenches their devastating indictments of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government. Mr Major though has a parliamentary majority of only 18. It is likely to be reduced to 17 after what promises to be another devastating defeat in the Christchurch by-election. It takes fewer than a dozen malcontents on the backbenches to destabilise his government. Mr Lamont could expect to mobilise substantially more. Thursday was meant to mark a new beginning for Mr Major's government. It might. But only if the Conservatives rediscover the will to govern. If not, it will mark the beginning of the end.</p>

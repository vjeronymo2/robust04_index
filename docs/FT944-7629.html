			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / EU economy to grow 2.6% Economic growth in the European Union will rise to an average 2.6 per cent this year, accelerating to 2.9 per cent in 1995 and 3.2 per cent in 1996, according to forecasts published yesterday by the European Commission. But the number out of work is likely to remain above 17m this year, with the average rate of unemployment expected to fall by only 1 per cent to 9.8 per cent in 1996. 'This is unacceptably high,' said Mr Henning Christophersen, the outgoing economics commissioner. The Commission is pressing for fresh measures at next month's European summit in Essen to reduce 'structural unemployment', including deeper cuts in non-wage costs, more vocational education, and a switch in unemployment allowances into wage subsidies. The solid economic recovery in Europe follows a meagre 0.4 per cent growth in 1993. As a result, government deficits are expected to fall from 5.6 per cent of GDP this year, to 4.7 per cent next and 3.9 per cent in 1996. These levels are above the Maastricht treaty's targets for monetary union, but the forecasts assume no change in existing policies. Inflation is likely to pick up in 1996 but present levels are not dangerous, said Mr Christophersen. The worries are rising long-term interest rates and a weak dollar undercutting EU exports in world markets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Georghe Armasu, director of the State </F> Service for Cult Affairs, by Anatol Limanskiy; place and date  not given: "Georghe Armasu: 'The Church Is Separate from the  State'"]    [Text] President Snegur recently signed an edict on  the establishment of the State Service for Cult Affairs. Today  we present its director, Georghe Armasu.    [Armasu] I was born into an ordinary peasant family in the  village of Tsareuk in Rezinskiy Rayon... I am Moldavian. I have  a higher education. I left home at 14 and enrolled in the  agricultural technical school. After that, three years in the  army. I went through all the stages of the administrative  structure from team leader, deputy chairman of a kolkhoz,  secretary of the rayon party committee, to the Central Committee  of the Communist Party of Moldova. Starting in 1984 I worked as  the deputy to the commissioner of the Council for Religious  Affairs of the Council of Ministers of the Union for the  Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. After the elimination of  this apparatus--in the secretariat of the parliament of  Moldova...    [Limanskiy] For what purpose did the president establish the  new government service?    [Armasu] In order not to permit unjustified interference of  the state organs in the activity of legally recognized religious  organizations. To strengthen control over adherence to  legislation on cults. The new state service is a consultative  information and expert examination organ...    [Limanskiy] Until recently all these questions were handled  by a department under the Ministry of Culture. Should it have  been eliminated?    [Armasu] I would put the question in a different way. Was it  necessary to unite culture and cults? Well, since you asked--I  will answer...    After all, just what is a ministry? It is a state organ that  manages and directs institutions and industrial organizations.  In our case, the Ministry of Culture and Cults manages not only  institutions but the church as well. This is a violation not  only of the Constitution of the republic, in which it is written  that in Moldova the church is separated from the state and  school from the church (Section 50). It is a violation of  international acts on human rights and freedoms. The church is  supposed to be managed by religious centers that function on the  basis of their own regulations and statutes.    The question on the unification of culture and cults arose  for the first time in May 1990 at a session of the Moldovan  parliament. The staff of the commissioner of the Council on  Religious Affairs tried to prevent this. Here is a quote from  one of the documents that we sent to the leadership of the  republic.    "If the state, i.e., the Ministry of Culture and Cults,  manages religions in the SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] of  Moldavia... this, it seems, will be a step backward with respect  to the times when the administrative-command system was in  operation, or even worse--when religion in the country  (moreover, one--Orthodoxy) was declared a state institution. In  the final analysis, this will inevitably lead to a dispute  between denominations, between organs of authority and religious  organizations, and to a complication of the whole sociopolitical  situation in the Moldavian SSR."    Which is what we have today. One of our main tasks is to  correct this state of affairs.    [Limanskiy] Judging by everything, do you think that the  department for cults was not entirely engaged in what was  necessary?    [Armasu] I am not one of those people who claims to have the  final word. Let the church and the public first express  themselves in this regard. I was not acquainted with Mr.  Kubryak, the head of the department, before he was confirmed for  the new post. But I know that he is one of the initiators of the  revival of the activity of the Metropolitan See of Bessarabia.  He directed this process at the state level, openly meddled in  the affairs of the Orthodox Church, and undermined its trust in  the state.    A trust that our state service should once again win...    [Limanskiy] Relations between the two Orthodox communities,  I  will say frankly, are strained. What is the reason for the  conflict?    [Armasu] There was no conflict and there is none.    [Limanskiy] But what is there?    [Armasu] At the beginning of last year a group of clergymen,  headed by His Grace Bishop Peter of Beltsy, decided to revive  the activity of the Bessarabian Autonomous Metropolitan See  after a 52-year break. On 18 December 1992, together with  deputies in parliament and representatives of the Ministry of  Culture and Cults, they took par in a meeting of the Holy Synod  of the Romanian Patriarchate. The synod approved a so-called  resolution of the "eparchial meeting of 14 September 1992 on  reviving the activity of the Bessarabian Metropolitan See under  the jurisdiction of the Romanian Patriarchate. Bishop Peter  became the deputy of this metropolitan see and a member of the  Holy Romanian Synod. Such a resolution seems to me to be rather  arguable, inasmuch as back on 5 October 1992 Peter was suspended  in service... According to canons, another church cannot restore  him.    The metropolitan see ceased its activity in 1940, and since  that time a lot has changed. There is no Romanian kingdom, no  Moldavian SSR, and no Chisinau eparchy, but there is the  Moldovan Metropolitan See, whose charter was officially  registered by the government on 3 November 1993.    Although our service was established recently, we have  already started talks on the peaceful settlement of problems. We  are now studying archival documents concerning the organization  and activity of the Bessarabian Metropolitan See, and we are  proposing to examine them: There is now a critical question  concerning property, inasmuch as the churches of Bessarabia were  at different times under the jurisdiction of three  churches--Ecumenical, Romanian, and Russian...    Only it is not necessary to rush, and it is not necessary to  urge us on. The situation has to be studied well in the  localities, and the leadership of the republic must be kept  reliably informed.    [Limanskiy] In your opinion, will the religious communities  have any kind of influence on the course of the coming  parliamentary elections?    [Armasu] The communities are already quite politicized. And  this is what they have come to. The church is a holy place,  where people find peace, offer prayers to God, and enrich  themselves spiritually. The priests hear the confessions of the  people and forgive them their sins--and everyone needs this--the  supporters of the people's front, and the socialists, and the  communists.    [Limanskiy] Well, very soon new deputies will come to power,  really the people's representatives. Does the Law on Cults  require any kinds of changes?    [Armasu] Undoubtedly. The first article requires  considerable  revision--it denies the right to choose and to switch to another  faith (proselytism). Articles 14 and 15 state that for  recognition, cults "are required to submit their charter to the  government." Some of the provisions of the law do not comply  with international human rights and principles.    I think that we will prepare additions and changes to the  Law  on Cults in the very near future...    Availing myself of this opportunity, I want through your  newspaper to call on all believers and leaders of religious  organizations in these difficult times to maintain tranquility,  not engage in disputes, and resolve all questions peacefully.</p>

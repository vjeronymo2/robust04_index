			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Ahern weighs jobs against inflation perils The test for Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, as he presents his 1994 budget today is to halt the rise in unemployment without stoking inflation and currency instability. At 18.4 per cent, unemployment is Ireland's most pressing economic problem. Mr Ahern is in the happy position of facing the year ahead with buoyant tax revenues, historically low interest rates, accelerating growth at home, economic recovery in Ireland's main overseas markets, low inflation (1.5 per cent in 1993) and an opening fiscal deficit of only 2.1 per cent of GNP, one of the lowest in the OECD. Labour ministers in the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition, have been champing at the bit to take a more expansionist approach to economic policy and have heralded the package as a budget for jobs. Mr Ahern has echoed concern on jobs but has tried to damp expectations of a 'give-away' budget. Fiscal discipline will continue to be the overriding goal. 'I am determined to ensure that the progress we have made in the public finances is not used as a base for paying ourselves more,' he said. 'Competitiveness' is the 'highest priority'. His words are welcomed by the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (IBEC), but it is suspicious of Mr Ahern's tax and spending plans. IBEC points out that the government has reduced the fiscal deficit in recent years through tax increases rather than spending cuts. Employers, trade unions and opposition leaders are united in pressing for reductions in the tax burden on the lower paid, and on social insurance contributions of both employers and employees. High taxation, especially at the lower end of the pay scale, is widely viewed as a principal reason why Ireland's good economic performance in recent years fuelled significant growth in unemployment. In framing this budget - Mr Ahern has about IPounds 200m (Dollars 286m), or around 0.7 per cent of GNP, to play with to ease the tax burden - increased economic activity leading to higher tax revenues will give the minister room to cut some taxes without increasing the overall borrowing/GNP ratio. Most likely to go will be a widely disliked 1 per cent income levy, introduced in the last budget, and which has been the main stumbling block in drawing up a new centralised pay agreement over the next three years. A widening of the standard rate income tax band and a substantial increase in personal allowances is also expected. In addition Mr Ahern will have anticipated privatisation receipts of some IPounds 115m from the sale of the government's 15.3 per cent stake in Irish Life, the insurance group, and an estimated windfall of some IPounds 230m accrued from a tax 'amnesty' which closed this month. BCP brokers in Dublin say that in the past three years, the capital-intensive export sector rather than domestic demand 'where there has been a virtual stagnation' has provided the engine for growth in the economy. The challenge for Mr Ahern will be to stimulate domestic demand, but without overheating the economy.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Marriage broker proposes recycling One man's rubbish is another man's treasure, or in these days of waste recycling, another company's raw material. This is the philosophy behind Green Base Exchange, an information service on environmental issues and a business-to-business swap shop for materials which can be recovered and recycled. Ingenious in its simplicity, the Green Base Exchange - based in the UK county of Essex - acts as a 'marriage' broker between companies seeking items as diverse as double glazing frames and ballpoint pens and those wishing to dispose of the same. Subscribers to the on-line exchange leave details of the material on offer, its volume, storage and collection arrangements, together with a contact name and telephone number. Other subscribers look through the industrial categories for materials they want and can either contact the company direct or leave a message. The exchange works through an electronic bulletin board system and can be accessed by anyone with a personal computer and modem. Behind the screens is environmentalist David Cooper. A one-time adviser to the Prince of Wales' Youth Business Trust and development consultant for new businesses in the 1980s, Cooper soon became aware of an information gap on environmental issues and their impact on small business. He noted that the wealth of information coming from the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of the Environment and the European Commission often does not impinge on small businesses, which generally hold a negative view of environmental directives and legislation. The difficulty was in translating the available information and conveying it in a meaningful, useful way. The way forward came in the form of an article on a Dutch Waste Exchange, printed in the Financial Times in March 1991. Inspired by the Dutch experience in recovering and recycling waste material, Cooper was encouraged to develop his ideas - combining his interests in technology and the environment. The exchange also offers a news service encompassing environmental events, legislation and details of green products and services. Green Base is easy to access and unlike some on-line systems does not involve lengthy and costly 'distractions' - the subscriber can quickly and easily find the relevant section and information. Everything is signposted and clearly labelled - the nine industrial waste classifications are those used by the EC and there is a 'help' service and back-up. Updated twice weekly, the exchange's news system is just that - full of news on upcoming events, latest environmental developments and 'how to' advice on implementing governmental and EC directives. The software has recently been developed to incorporate listings from environmental yearbooks as well as information on joint ventures, energy, fuels and recycling groups. The exchange has held a series of meetings with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment to discuss promoting the exchange to a wider audience. According to Cooper, the departments have been willing to help on promotion and co-ordination. As a result, contacts have been expanded to include the Warren Springs Research Laboratory and the British Museum, which both receive a suprisingly high number of callers requesting information on environmental issues. This is largely the result of a lack of policy co-ordination on environmental issues in many companies, small and large, a situation the DTI is anxious to rectify. Subscription rates to the exchange start from Pounds 80 a year for a non-business single subscription, rising to Pounds 320 for trade and professional associations. Monthly rates are also available. There are no other charges for being on-line or accessing and downloading information from the exchange and the only extra cost is British Telecom's connection charges.</p>

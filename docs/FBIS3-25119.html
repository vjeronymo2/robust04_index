			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mandy Jean Woods] </F>   [Excerpt] Almost every financial rand [finrand] application  made to the Reserve Bank between 1987 and 1988 involving large  amounts of money -- between R[rand]5 million and R100 million --  that has been examined by investigators of the Witwatersrand  Attorney-General's office appears to be bogus.    This emerged in the same week that Reserve Bank Governor  Chris Stals admitted that about R10 billion in foreign exchange  reserves had left the country in the second half of last year.    Investigators have so far called for the Reserve Bank files  of 44 companies which made multiple (between one and six)  applications for finrands during the two-year period in  question. They have found that in almost every case:     -  The application were bogus.    -  They related to strategic or labour-intensive industries.    -  They had been approved by Reserve Bank management.    -  Commercial bank staff -- such as bank managers or staff in  the  foreign exchange departments with access to bank systems and  heaps of money -- had knowingly taken part in the fraud.    -  Most large commercial banks are implicated.    -  Lawyers who are prepared to "bend the rules" are involved.       The value of the fraud currently being investigated tops  R200  million and could rise to double this, as the 10-month  investigation continues. Investigators are working around the  clock to compile charge sheets for some of the country's top  businessmen, lawyers and bankers. Arrests in some of the cases  are expected soon.    "If the Reserve Bank, as the guardian of South Africa's  foreign exchange reserves, is doing the best it can, then at  best it is being grossly negligent in its duty," remarked Niko  Shefer this week. Shefer, who was jailed in 1990 for his role  in a R45 million foreign exchange fraud, is co-operating with  the Attorney General's office in the investigation. "If the  investments had happened as purported, South Africa would be  swimming -- no, drowning -- in money," Shefer said, speaking  from his work centre in the Attorney- General's office.    Stals said it was not possible to identify the scale of  illegal capital outflows, "otherwise they would have been  blocked. Such illegal outflows form part of the errors and  omissions item of the balance of payments". But investigators  said there were glaring errors in the applications approved by  the Reserve Bank.

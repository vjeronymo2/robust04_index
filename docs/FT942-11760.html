			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: ASH makes Pounds 300,000 pension contribution Automated Security (Holdings), the international electronic security systems company, made an extra Pounds 300,000 pension contribution on behalf of Mr Tom Buffett, its chairman and chief executive, in the year to November 30, the annual report revealed. The 1993 contribution totalled Pounds 338,000, against Pounds 33,000 the previous year. The company said that the Pounds 300,000 contribution was made 'in respect of a cumulative shortfall in contributions to his pension fund', though the report did not specify over how many years Mr Buffett's contributions had been falling short. The report also revealed that while Mr Buffett's salary remained flat, his total remuneration grew 12 per cent to Pounds 334,000 (Pounds 297,000) thanks to the inclusion of a Pounds 38,300 performance-related payment. Mr Clive Campion, the finance director who resigned in January 1993, was paid Pounds 222,000 on the termination of his contract. At the beginning of October, ASH issued a profits warning, which sent the shares spiralling 23 per cent to 102p.</p>

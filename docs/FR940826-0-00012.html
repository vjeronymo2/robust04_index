The percentages allocate the amounts of domestically produced filberts/hazelnuts which may be marketed in domestic, export and other outlets. The percentages are intended to stabilize the supply of domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts in order to meet the limited domestic demand for such filberts/hazelnuts and provide reasonable returns to producers. This rule was recommended by the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board (Board), which is the agency responsible for local administration of the order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  September 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Teresa Hutchinson, Marketing Specialist, Northwest Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 1220 SW Third Ave., Room 369, Portland, OR 97204; telephone (503) 326&hyph;2724 or Mark A.

This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is intended that this action apply to all merchantable filberts/hazelnuts handled during the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

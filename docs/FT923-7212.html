			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Shake-up at Nippon Credit Bank aims to save Y6bn NIPPON Credit Bank, one of Japan's three long-term credit banks, has drawn up a rationalisation plan, which includes the closure of its overseas operations and a cut in executive allowances. The bank plans to cut around Y6bn (Dollars 48m) in costs by closing four of its overseas operations, consolidating domestic branches, and halving allowances of executives. The bank will also curb new computer investments, and plans to sell part of its property assets. The move is the first among Japanese banks, which are facing an increasing squeeze in profits due to the rising amount of non-performing loans. Nippon Credit's leasing affiliates are heavily burdened with doubtful property loans, and the bank is seeking creditor assistance in restructuring its subsidiaries. Japan's image conscious banks have refrained from actively implementing rationalisation programmes. However, Nippon Credit's announcement could prompt similar moves at other leading banks. Nippon Credit, the smallest of Japan's long-term credit banks, has tried to compensate for its size by lending heavily to property related developments. Total outstanding bad loans at the bank's three financial subsidiaries are estimated to be as high as Y1,000bn. The bank's announcement failed to encourage investors on the Tokyo stock market yesterday and the shares fell Y20 to Y4,020.</p>

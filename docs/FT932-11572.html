			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / France 'shares fears' with UK FRANCE believes that Britain shares its 'reservations' about the use of air strikes, designed to cow the Bosnian Serbs but which also endanger the 7,500 peacekeeping troops the two countries have in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Edouard Balladur, French premier, said yesterday on the eve of his trip later today to London for his first meeting in office with Prime Minister John Major that he hoped to achieve a 'homogenous' Anglo-French position on the way forward in Bosnia. 'We are very concerned not to take counter-productive measures, which instead of calming the fighting could increase it,' he told journalists. He believed that opinions were divided on the issue of possible air strikes to reinforce United Nations sanctions and the Vance-Owen peace plan, even within the US administration. The premier will meet Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in Paris this morning. On the other main subject of today's meeting at Downing Street, Mr Balladur said he hoped to convince Mr Major that Europe should not rush ahead with the Gatt trade negotiations, but that it should take the time to prepare 'a durable, balanced agreement taking account of all European interests'. He did not accept that 'any agreement is better than none at all'. France will shortly be sending its EC partners its detailed comments on all 15 trade sectors treated in the current Uruguay Round. Mr Balladur said he would discuss with Mr Major the need for Europe to win concessions in several of these areas - in particular copyright protection, services and dispute settlement.</p>

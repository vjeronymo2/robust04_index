Zhelev reiterated Bulgaria's stance for non-intervention in the  war in former Yugoslavia and its call on the other Balkan and  neighbouring countries to refrain from such intervention. The  Bulgarian position is motivated by the fact that the Balkan  countries are burdened with their past and any military  intervention in the former Yugoslavia on their part, even if  prompted by the noblest of motives, would arouse old suspicions  and hostility. According to the Bulgarian president, such a  development would aggravate the situation in the Balkans and  increase the danger of a new Balkan war.</p>

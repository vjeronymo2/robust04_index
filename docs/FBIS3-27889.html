Laney said on Tuesday that North Korea should  ease tensions by opening up its nuclear program. Laney, in a  speech prepared for delivery at a dinner meeting hosted by the  Korean-American Association Tuesday afternoon, said North Korea  also "should begin to open its economy, and move as quickly as  possible to grant its people those civil and human rights which  are, after all, the reason governments are instituted among men."    At the meeting held in the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Seoul, he  said, "I have a personal image of the contrast between the world  built by communist societies and that we enjoy in the free  world... North Korea is on the sad side of this contrast. They  must come to terms with this fact."    He added that South Korea has to come to terms with its own  new self.    "I want to urge you to embrace the status you've earned as  one of the world's leaders... So when I urge you to accept and  believe in the Korea that you've built, I'm hoping that your  acceptance will lead you to embrace the responsibilities of a  world leader," he said.</p>

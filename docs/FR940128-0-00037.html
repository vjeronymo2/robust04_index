			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Public Comments/USEPA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two public comments were received by USEPA regarding the March 24, 1993 proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  On April 22, 1993, USEPA received a comment from the Wood River Manufacturing Complex (Shell Oil), which stated that the Shell Oil Company supports the finalization of USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No response is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  On April 23, 1993, USEPA received comments on behalf of the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (Smurfit), which operates a facility in Alton Township, Madison County. Smurfit does not appear to object to the substance of the Wood River Township SIP revision, but believes that USEPA should not approve the January 4, 1989 submittal for Wood River Township until the SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  attainment status of Alton Township has been finalized. Referring to USEPA's September 22, 1992 (57 FR 43846) action, in which USEPA proposed to redesignate Alton, Granite City, and Nameoki Townships, Madison County, to nonattainment for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Smurfit stated that any designation for Madison County regarding SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  should be consistent between Alton Township, Madison County, and Wood River Township, Madison County. Smurfit believes that Alton Township should not be redesignated to nonattainment if Wood River Township is excluded from the nonattainment area. Smurfit argues that emissions from Wood River Township contribute to ambient SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  concentrations in Alton Township, and that USEPA's approval of the January 4, 1989 SIP revision should be deferred until the State determines that the sources in Wood River Township will not interfere with Alton Township's ability to attain the SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ambient standard. Smurfit remarked that it would not dispute USEPA's proposed approval of the January 4, 1989 submittal for Wood River if Alton Township were to remain designated attainment for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The January 4, 1989 Wood River SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP was submitted in response to a September 28, 1984 notice of SIP deficiency. The USEPA's approval of the January 4, 1989 SIP revision for Wood River Township addresses this outstanding notice of SIP deficiency for the area. It in no way precludes USEPA from redesignating Wood River Township to nonattainment for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at a later date, if evidence exists which indicates the necessity for redesignation. Dispersion modeling studies associated with Illinois' SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP development have shown that sources in Wood River Township are not currently causing NAAQS violations in Alton Township. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alton Township was initially cited for SIP deficiencies along with Wood River Township on September 28, 1984. On January 28, 1991, USEPA advised the Governor of Illinois that the whole of Madison County should be designated nonattainment for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In a letter to USEPA dated March 14, 1991, the Governor of Illinois stated that if a nonattainment designation was necessary pursuant to the 1990 Amendments of the Clean Air Act, only Alton, Granite City, and Nameoki Townships in Madison County should be designated, rather than the entire county. The Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency also stated in a separate letter to USEPA dated March 14, 1991 that Illinois' SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP was deficient for these townships. Since 1991, IEPA has worked with Alton Township industries to address SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  attainment issues. IEPA requested that Wood River Township remain attainment for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , since a SIP addressing deficiencies in the area had been submitted on January 4, 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67334), USEPA published its intent to defer the final designation to nonattainment of these townships, as the State is working to expeditiously correct the SIP deficiencies. The State submitted a SIP revision for Alton Township on November 18, 1993. USEPA will take action upon this submittal and make a final determination of Alton Township's attainment status in a subsequent action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Final Rulemaking Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Based on the information contained in the State's January 4, 1989 submittal, and in the federally enforceable operating permit issued to the Shell Oil Company on November 2, 1993, and in consideration of the public comments received on USEPA's March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15824) proposed rule, USEPA is approving amendments to 35 IAC 214.102 and 214.382. The USEPA's approval of these rules satisfies the September 28, 1984 notice of SIP deficiency for Wood River Township, Madison County, Illinois. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the new rules covering the Shell Oil facility, the January 4, 1989 submittal includes amendments to Illinois' SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Measurement Methods (35 IAC 214.101) and Incorporations by Reference (35 IAC 214.104). However, further amendments to 35 IAC 214.101 and 214.104 were submitted to USEPA on February 8, 1991. On December 20, 1991 (56 FR 66003), USEPA proposed to approve these rules, as submitted on February 8, 1991. On June 26, 1992 (57 FR 28617), USEPA approved 35 IAC 214.101 and incorporated it by reference into the Illinois SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP. The USEPA is taking no action on the version of 35 IAC 214.101 which was submitted on January 4, 1989, since the version approved on June 26, 1992 supersedes this submittal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

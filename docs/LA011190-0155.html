			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> BOARD RESCINDS RENT RULE  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Rent Control Board last week rescinded a rule that  automatically allowed rent increases if the board failed to act on a landlord's  rent increase petition within 120 days of filing.  </P> <P> Board member Wayne Bauer said that the rule -- which was adopted a decade ago  when rent control was adopted -- was too drastic, and that it created undue  stress on staff and the board to process petitions quickly.  </P> <P> Rent board administrator Mary Ann Yurkonis, who said the deadline was missed  only once or twice in the last 10 years, said the deadline also forced the  board to often deny continuances for tenants who needed more time to present  their cases.  </P> <P> Landlords have criticized the decision, saying it will allow the board to drag  out processing petitions.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would apply to owners and operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of facilities, with certain exceptions listed below, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations are conducted to manage, convey, or handle wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or recoverable materials that are received from other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities and contain hazardous air pollutants. In other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> words, the waste or recoverable material has been generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site at a separate location and, then, shipped or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred to the facility for subsequent management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicable operations subject to the rule would include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage, treatment, and disposal operations as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recycling, recovery, and reprocessing operations. All of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these operations collectively are referred to hereafter in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this notice as ``off-site waste and recovery operations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule would apply to off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations receiving regulated materials that contain one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more of the specific organic chemicals listed in a table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included as part of the proposed rule. These organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals have been designated as hazardous air pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HAP) under CAA section 112(b), and are referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collectively hereafter in this notice as ``organic HAP.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Off-site waste and recovery operations managing waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable material that does not contain any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic chemicals listed in the rule would not be ``regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials'' subject to the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing that the off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations NESHAP only apply to ``major sources'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in the Part 63 general provisions (40 CFR 63.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Area sources'' as defined under 40 CFR 63.2 would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule would not apply to certain types of waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations located at an affected facility because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP emissions from these operations are addressed by other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA regulatory actions. The following operations at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected facility would be exempted from the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Units or equipment used exclusively to manage waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable material generated at the affected facility site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., waste or recoverable material generated on-site);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) municipal solid waste landfill units; (3) incinerators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to burn waste; (4) boilers or furnaces used to burn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated material to produce energy; (5) units or equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located at a publicly-owned treatment works; or (6) units or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment used exclusively to manage waste that has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from remediation activities to cleanup wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as hazardous wastes under Resource, Conservation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Recovery Act (RCRA) rules. In addition, the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations NESHAP would not apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underground components of injection wells used for disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. General Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The general standards proposed for the off-site waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recovery operations NESHAP apply to major sources. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards would require that the owner or operator of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected facility control air emissions from certain waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management units and equipment in which regulated materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing the organic HAP listed in the rule are placed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or after the effective date of the rule. These air emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control requirements would not apply to any affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility for which the owner or operator demonstrates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total annual organic HAP mass content of all regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials subject to the rule entering the facility is less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1 megagram per year (Mg/yr). The procedure to be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the owner or operator to calculate the total annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic HAP mass content of the regulated material is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the rule. The EPA requests comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed 1 Mg/yr exemption, and requests supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information be provided with any recommendation for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative exemption level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two other provisions are proposed for the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations NESHAP that would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual units at an affected facility to be exempted from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the air emission control requirements of the rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first provision would exempt from the air emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements those units at major sources that exclusively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are used to manage regulated material received at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility with a volatile organic hazardous air pollutant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VOHAP) concentration less than 100 parts per million by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight (ppmw) on a mass-weighted average basis. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated material VOHAP concentration would be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the organic HAP content of the regulated material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the point where the facility accepts delivery or takes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possession of the regulated material, using procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the rule. The EPA requests comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitiveness of the term ``point of entry'' as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

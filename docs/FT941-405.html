			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Observer: Tunnel vision What now for Sir Christopher Bland, 55, former chairman of LWT? He hasn't had to hang around waiting for job offers after Granada's takeover of his ITV company. He's understood to have been approached for the London Transport job. He also politely declined the chance to be a candidate to take over from Sir George Russell as chairman of the Independent Television Commission, when Russell retires at the end of this year. It's believed that Bland, the former deputy chairman of the old IBA, is holding out for a run at the chairmanship of the BBC, a post that Sir George Russell, 58, is unlikely to turn down. Standing in the way of the ambitions of both is the determined figure of Marmaduke Hussey who has absolutely no intention of giving up the chairmanship before the end of his term in November 1996. In the meantime, Russell has a proper job as chairman of 3i which he will be bringing to the stock market. Perhaps Bland should think again about the London Transport job.</p>

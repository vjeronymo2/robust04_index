			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has been chosen  as the host of the Seventh International Anti-Graft Conference  (IAGC) of October 1995, a senior Chinese official said here  today.    "It is of great significance for China to hold the  convention," said Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the  Supreme People's Procuratorate, today at the founding ceremony  of the IAGC Organizing Committee, when its first session was  also held.    The top procurator said China has consistently cracked down  on the crimes of embezzlement and graft in order to build a  clean and honest government.    He claimed that China has achieved great successes in its  anti- corruption drives since its founding in 1949, especially  the one since August 1993 till now.    According to the Supreme People's Procuratorate, more than  22,000 corruption cases were investigated between September last  year and March this year, among which 37 are major cases  involving more than 1 million yuan each, 789 involve money from  100,000 to 1 million yuan each and nearly 10,000 cases involve  sums between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan each.    Nine hundred and four officials above the county level were  punished according to the law in that period, of which 71 rank  at the city level.    Zhang said the "Beijing conference" will not only seek  academic exchanges, but also promote international cooperation  to fight against embezzlement and graft.    "The problem of embezzlement has been internationalized," he  said. "China is even more in need of such cooperation in the  time of reform and opening to the world."    Zhang said the motif of the conference will be "anti-graft  and social stability and development."    The international anti-graft conference is an international  academic meeting for the exchange of experience in curbing and  imposing punishment upon embezzlement, and research into methods  for international cooperation.    The conference is held every two years. Its participants are  mainly government officials, judges, procurators, police chiefs,  lawyers, experts and professors from around the world.</p>

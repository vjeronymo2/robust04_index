A listed company is a company which is approved to  issue and list its stocks for trading on a stock exchange.    A listed company must be a limited liability stock company.  However, not all limited liability stock companies are listed  companies. This is because a limited liability stock company  must meet certain requirements, and go through screening and  approving formalities according to prescribed procedures before  it can become a listed company.    Specific listing requirements for a company differ from  country to country. For example, the listing requirements for a  company stipulated by the New York Stock Exchange are: The  company's pretax profits shall not be less than $2.5 million for  the most recent year and shall not be less than $2 million a  year for the most recent two years; its tangible assets shall  not be less than $16 million; the market value of its publicly  held stocks shall not be less than $16 million; and at least 1  million shares of its stocks are publicly held and 2,000  stockholders hold more than 100 shares of its stock.    China has also conducted experiments to list limited  liability stock companies on the stock market. With approval, a  stock exchange was set up in Shanghai and Shenzhen in December  1990 and July 1991, respectively. At the same time, eight  limited liability stock companies were listed in Shanghai and  six were listed in Shenzhen. With the deepening of reform, more  companies have been listed on the stock exchanges, and the  experimental work has become more standardized. By November  1993, 157 companies had been listed, 97 on the Shanghai Stock  Exchange and 60 on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.    The listing requirements for a company stipulated by the  Shanghai Stock Exchange are: The company must be one registered  with the department of administration for industry and commerce;  its paid-up capital shall not be less than 5 million yuan in  Renminbi; the amount of the company's stocks issued to the  general public shall not be less than 25 percent of its paid-up  capital; the number of registered stocks shall not be fewer than  500; the company has earned profits for the two latest  consecutive years; it has the recommendation of at least one  Shanghai Stock Exchange member; it has set up an office in  Shanghai municipal district for transactions [guo hu 6665 2073];  and it has published its financial situation regularly in at  least one publicly circulated newspaper or periodical.    The listing requirements for a company stipulated by the  Shenzhen Stock Exchange are: The company must be an approved  limited liability stock company newly established or established  through reorganization; its production line and business conform  with Shenzhen City's industrial policy (for companies registered  in Shenzhen; companies registered in other places must conform  with the state's industrial policy); the company is in good  standing in terms of production and business performance, with  net assets not less than 10 million yuan; the net value of its  tangible assets shall not be less than 25 percent of the total  value of its tangible assets in the year preceding listing  application; the founder's subscribed stocks shall not be less  than 5 million yuan and not less than 35 percent of the total  amount of the company's stocks; the amount of stocks issued to  nonspecific individuals through public offering shall not be  less than 25 percent of the total amount of the capital stocks  and the number of stockholders shall not be fewer than 800; and  there are no records showing that the company has violated the  law or harmed the public interests in the most recent three  years.    Since 1992, with the approval of authorized state  departments, nine large state-owned enterprises -- Shanghai  Petrochemical General Plant, Qingdao Beer Plant, Beijing  People's Machinery Plant, Guangzhou Shipyard, Maanshan Steel  Company, Kunming Machine-Building Plant, Dongfang  Electric-Machinery Plant, Tianjin Bohai Petrochemical (Group)  Company, Yizheng Chemical Fiber (Group) Company -- have  undergone reorganization to become limited liability stock  companies and made other preparations for listing according to  the agreement reached between departments concerned and the Hong  Kong Joint Stock Exchange. The first five companies completed  listing formalities and became listed companies in the Hong Kong  Joint Stock Exchange in 1993.</p>

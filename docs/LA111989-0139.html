			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 SOLDIERS KILLED IN ULSTER BLAST; IRA SUSPECTED  </P> <P> A roadside blast killed three British soldiers on patrol in Northern Ireland on  Saturday, hours after a car bomb at an English garrison town injured an army  sergeant and his wife.  </P> <P> The sergeant lost both legs in the explosion, Essex county police said.  </P> <P> No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police and the Home Office  suspected the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which has targeted army  installations in England and continental Europe as well as in Northern Ireland  in its bloody campaign to drive the British out of the province.  </P> <P> The British army patrol was in two armored vehicles in the foothills of the  Mourne Mountains, about six miles from the Irish Republic, when an explosive  device was detonated, apparently from beside the road, the Royal Ulster  Constabulary said.  </P> <P> The blast hurled the first vehicle off the road. All of the casualties were in  that vehicle, police said.  </P> <P> Helicopters flew into the area to help the injured soldiers, but three died  before they could be treated, police said. A fourth was seriously injured and  hospitalized in Belfast.  </P> <P> At the British army headquarters for eastern England in Colchester, 50 miles  northeast of London, a car bomb exploded as Sgt. Andrew Mudd and his wife were  setting out from the parking area at the married quarters, police said. The two  were dragged from the burning wreckage of their car by a lieutenant who was  driving past, witnesses said.  </P> <P> One neighbor said the car was "a mass of flames."  </P> <P> The couple were taken to Colchester General Hospital, where General Manager  Mark Shackell said Mudd had lost both legs and was in serious condition after 4  1/2 hours of surgery. He said Mudd's wife, whose name was not released,  suffered "relatively minor" injuries.  </P> <P> David Waddington, the Home Office secretary, blamed the IRA.  </P> <P> The Ministry of Defense stepped up security at military establishments across  Britain after the Sept. 22 IRA bombing at the Royal Marines Music School in  Deal, in southeast England, that killed 11.  </P> <P> The IRA has also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on British  soldiers and their families in West Germany.  </P> <P> A soldier's wife was killed this summer and a 6-month-old girl died last month  along with her father, a Royal Air Force corporal, in an IRA attack.  </P></p>

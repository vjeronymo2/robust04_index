			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Boost seen for main economies: OECD forecasts for growth in industrialised countries revised upwards to 2.6% The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has revised upwards its projections of economic growth in the industrialised world this year to reflect stronger-than-expected US expansion and improved European exports. The organisation, which last night released highlights of its latest forecasts ahead of today's annual meeting of OECD ministers in Paris, now expects the industrial countries will grow by 2.6 per cent this year. This is half a percentage point more than in its last forecast in December. Its projections - which exclude Mexico, which joined the OECD last month - suggest that the 24 longest-established member states will achieve overall growth of 2.9 per cent next year, up slightly from 2.7 per cent forecast six months ago. Officials said the upward revision reflected strong US growth in the final quarter of last year, better-than-expected exports from Europe and the Japanese government's economic stimulation package of February. The organisation now expects robust 4.4 per cent growth of US domestic demand in 1994 to lift gross domestic product by 4 per cent this year, compared with its previous forecast of 3.1 per cent GDP growth. Although it expects US GDP growth next year will slow to 3 per cent, this rate of expansion would still be faster than the 2.7 per cent growth forecast for 1995 in December. In Germany's case, the organisation now expects GDP growth of 1.8 per cent this year compared with 0.8 per cent previously. While exports are expected to be buoyant, Germany's domestic demand will not see a fast growth and is expected to increase by only 1 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent next year. German GDP is now projected to grow 2.6 per cent next year compared with the 2.2 per cent forecast last December. Germany is the only European country for which detailed forecasts are included. It is understood, however, that the UK outlook is little changed from December when growth of 2.9 per cent was projected for this year and next. The OECD disclosed slight upwards revisions to its projections for Japanese growth. It now expects Japan's economy will expand 0.8 per cent this year, against 0.5 per cent previously, and 2.7 per cent in 1995. The OECD forecasts a continuing divergence of employment trends between the US and Europe. It now expects average unemployment in the US to drop below 6 per cent of the labour force next year while in Europe it is expected to average nearly 12 per cent in 1995. While inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, is expected to decline in Europe and be broadly steady in Japan over the next 18 months, it is forecast to quicken in the US to 3.1 per cent by the end of 1995 from 2.1 per cent in the first half of this year. The OECD has revised its expectations of short-term interest-rate developments. It now expects US 3-month rates will rise to 5.6 per cent by late 1995, about 0.5 points higher than projected in December. German short-term rates are expected to fall over the next 18 months, but less sharply than expected. The OECD expects German 3-month rates will be 4.3 per cent by the end of next year, against its earlier forecast of 3.8 per cent.

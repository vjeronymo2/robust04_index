			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Liu Junxiang (0491 0689 4382): "Survey </F> of Situation in Shanxi Province To Reduce Peasant Burdens]    [Text] Not long ago, our reporter accompanied the  law-enforcement and inspection team of the State Council on  peasants' burdens to go to Shanxi Province to check how the  government policy on reducing peasants's burdens is being  implemented. Since the beginning of this year, especially since  the announcement of the joint emergency circular by the two  general offices on 19 March, the Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee  and the provincial government have explicitly abolished,  corrected, annulled and prohibited those documents,  fee-collecting measures and erroneous practices which run  counter to the provisions of the "Regulations" announced by the  State Council. The State Council's policy on peasants' burdens  (which should not exceed 5 percent of their per capita net  income) is being basically implemented in Shanxi. According to  an estimate, peasants' burdens were reduced by 261.739 million  yuan this year and their per capita burden dropped by 11.69  yuan, representing 2.18 percent of their per capita net income  in 1992. Measures have also been taken to reduce peasants'  burdens in the 435 funding programs for the 1992 fiscal year,  which had exceeded the 5 percent limit as specified by the State  Council, accounting for 64.7 percent of the total amount to be  reduced and amounting to 75.154 million yuan.  <H5>  Burdens Hurt Peasants' Feelings </H5>   Are peasants' financial burdens in Shanxi Province heavy? To  what extent do peasants suffer from such burdens?    According to the 1992 annual statistic report on peasants'  burdens, there were four prefectures and cities, 42 counties and  672 villages and townships where taxes and charges levied on  peasants on a per capita basis exceeded the 5 percent limit  specified by the "regulations." Those villages and townships  where peasants' burdens exceeded the 5 percent limit were mainly  in the farming areas in the grain-producing farming areas and  remote mountainous districts in Xinzhou, Luliang, Jinzhong,  Linfen, Yuncheng, Yanbei and Changzhi. The number of villages  and townships in the Xinzhou Prefecture, where peasants' burdens  exceeded the limit accounts for 72 percent of the total number  of villages and townships in the prefecture. According to  surveys conducted in various localities, there are more than 100  different funding programs in most of the prefectures and  cities. A survey in 51 townships and 171 villages in Linfen  prefecture shows that as many as 123 different types of charges  and fees are being levied on peasants by 48 different  departments. Peasants in some localities are unable to  withstand the unreasonable apportions and excessive charges on  them. Such apportions and charges have also affected the  relationship between the party and the masses and shaken the  people's confidence in the party. For example, the authorities  in Hongzhiyi Township in Yuncheng City increased the  agricultural tax and imposed unreasonable service charges on  peasants. When peasants could not afford to pay, the authorities  then organized public security personnel with handcuffs to  collect fees and taxes. They had illegally assaulted peasants,  and detained 10 peasants and students in six villages.  <H5>  Cases Are Investigated and Handled To Win People's Confidence </H5>   The Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial  government have decided to regard their task in alleviating  peasants' financial burdens and tackling the issue of peasants'  heavy burdens as one of the two major tasks in rectifying the  party style and building a clean and honest government. While  organizing their staff members to screen all relative documents  and carry out self-examination and correct their own errors,  they have also investigated and handled several typical cases in  which some authorities at the different levels have violated  laws and discipline to increase peasants' financial burdens.    An incident occurred at the end of 1992 in Shentangping  township, Kelan County. The head of the township and a secretary  of the township party committee, together with judicial and  public security personnel with handcuffs and truncheons, broke  into 30-odd peasants' houses in Kangjiahui Village to collect  fees and charges. They took away peasants' television sets,  sewing machines, bicycles, push carts, furniture and grain  crops. The provincial, prefectural and county authorities  jointly investigated the case and timely took disciplinary  actions against those lawbreakers who were involved in the  incident. The authorities also returned all the belongings taken  away from peasants' houses and apologized to the peasants for  the wrongdoing.    Eight peasant families including one headed by Liu Hailian  moved into the Zhaizi Village in Zhongyang County several years  ago. This year, the villagers committee decided to impose  another 1,000 yuan on each family for "moving into the village"  in addition to the 1,000 yuan it had already collected,  otherwise no farmland will be allocated to them to grow their  grain crops. Peasants of these eight families appealed to the  provincial authorities for help. After receiving the appeal,  Secretary Hao Tianxi of the Zhongyang County CPC Committee,  immediately assigned someone to look into this matter and solved  the problem in three days. Peasants jubilantly said that the  party and the government fully support us. We must work hard to  carry out production in order to repay the leading comrades for  what they did for us, they added.  <H5>  Unreasonable Charges Still Prevail </H5>   Since the general offices of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council issued the "Emergency Circular on  Realistically Reducing Peasants' Burdens" on 19 March,  especially after the telephone conference sponsored by the State  Council on the work of alleviating peasants' burdens, the Shanxi  Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government have paid  even greater attention to reducing peasants' financial burdens.  Besides abolishing the "three advocation's and five  consolidation's", they have stopped implementing all documents  and regulations on collecting fees from peasants. Later, they  screened all documents from the top level to the bottom level,  while carefully examining all funding programs from the lower  level to the higher level in various localities. According to  statistics, 2,977 documents and 3,378 funding programs  concerning peasants' financial burdens were screened, and a  total of 449 erroneous practices which violated the  "regulations" of the State Council were prohibited.    When all documents on peasants' burdens were carefully  examined, unreasonable charges were canceled and erroneous  practices which violate the "regulations" of the State Council  were prohibited. Normally no one should dare to impose any  unreasonable charge on peasants. However, this was not true.  Even in August 1993, there remained some departments and  townships which still seriously violated the guideline laid down  by the "Emergency Circular" of the two general offices. They  defied the orders and the prohibitions, and continued to collect  unreasonable fees from peasants. Our reporter cited the  following examples during his tour:    From May to September 1993, the Bureau of Electric Power,  the Bureau of Land and the Bureau of Farm Machinery in Pianguan  County continued to collect electric power maintenance fee, land  registration fee and farm machinery administration fee at the  township level.    From April to July, 11 departments in Yangcheng County  including the Bureau of Land, the Bureau of Farm Machinery, the  Bureau of Electric Power and the Bureau of Communications still  illegally collected fees of 28 types from peasants totaling 2.43  million yuan. Twenty of the 25 townships in Yangcheng County  continued to illegally levy fees on peasants. The number of such  illegal funding programs reached 27, totaling 2.74 million yuan.    The Bureau of Communications in suburban Jincheng City laid  down a rigid rule demanding that each of the 31 villages in the  Jinmiaopu Township buy two sets of videotape called: "Eight  Diagrams Specified by the Book of Changes [one of the "Six  Confucian Classics"]. It collected 39 yuan for each set.    From March to August, one township and six units in Qinshui  County still violated the guideline laid down by the documents  of the central, provincial and city authorities in this  connection, and continued to illegally collect fees from  peasants for the development of collective economy.    The Bureau of Civic Affairs in Lingchuan County demands that  all young people who wish to register for marriage must attend a  "pre-marriage class," watch a videotape for the newly wed and  buy a book, an audio cassette tape and two badges. It collected  40 yuan from each registrant for all this.    After all the aforementioned problems were discovered, the  Pianguan county and the various counties under the  administration of the Jincheng county had seriously handled all  these cases on time. Most of the fees collected had been  returned.  <H5>  Peasants Still Dare Not Radiantly Smile Yet </H5>   "After paying enough to the state and retaining enough for  the collective, what is left belongs to peasants themselves."  This is the people's general impression on their income from  labor after the implementation of the system under which  production groups assume full responsibility for the fulfillment  of production plans in the rural areas in 1983. In fact, this  has become the basis on which the collective collects money from  peasants. During our reporter's surveying trip, many peasants  said that there are figures based on which we make payments to  the state, but there are no figures to show the exact amount of  money which we need to pay to the collective. How much is  "enough"? There is no definite figure. It has become a system  under which we must pay what we are asked to pay. When our  reporter mentioned the abolishment of the miscellaneous funding  programs and the provision specified by the State Council that  all the fees collected at the village and township levels  "should not exceed 5 percent of the peasants' net income," they  jubilantly said that now there is a highest limit and that the  collective can no longer collect money beyond the limit.    In order to effectively control peasants' financial  burdens and prevent these erroneous practices on peasants'  burdens from resurfacing, a card system on peasants' financial  burdens has been set up on a provincial basis. The "Control Card  for Peasants' Burdens" has been issued to 5.95 million farming  households free of charge. When our reporter conducted his  survey and called on peasants in Pianguan County, Pingyao County  and Qinshui County, he saw these cards on several occasions. The  portion of the peasant's total income for (budgeted) public  accumulation at the village and township levels that the subject  peasant must pay and the number of work days for community work  that he or she must contribute for this year were clearly  written out on the card which is often regarded as peasants'  "amulet." "With this card on hand, we feel at ease. We know how  much we should pay and how many work days of labor we should  contribute," said peasants.    The party committees and the governments at various  levels have removed the shackles on peasants so that peasants  can take a deep breath and straighten themselves. They are happy  and smiling. However, they are still somewhat worried about the  possibility to find their burdens once again increased after the  autumn harvest and their hope dashed. Peasants are worried  amidst their joy. What do the policy and law enforcing cadres at  the county, township and village levels think about all this?  Not long ago, the Law Enforcement and Inspection Team of the  State Council on Peasants' Burdens distributed questionnaires  among village and township cadres in 143 counties in Shanxi  Province. Among the respondents, 9.1 percent of cadres said that  they would follow the instructions of their superiors. When our  reporter conducted his survey in the Nanyijian Township in  Pingyao County, a township party committee secretary bluntly  said: "We will collect more fees after the autumn harvest, if  our expenses exceed our budget." Although there are not many  cadres who belong to this category, their fuzzy legal concept  and unhealthy work style in defying orders and prohibitions  cannot but make peasants feel uneasy.    We should no longer hurt peasants's feelings. Let us hope  that there will be no relapse in the future.</p>

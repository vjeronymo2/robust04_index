			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Observer: Promise to pay The once mighty greenback, all too frequently discovered these days to be carrying traces of cocaine, was devalued several more cents this week with the jailing of one of its former signatories. The buck has stopped inside the clink for Catalina Villalpando, who ran the US mint during most of the Bush administration. Having under-reported taxable income by Dollars 160,000, misled government officials in the confirmation process, and obstructed a federal investigation in order to secure her job in the first place, she now has four months inside and 200 hours' community service to which to look forward. Villalpando, whose notoriety until now had been confined to her application of the epithet 'skirt-chaser' to Bill Clinton for the purposes of the 1992 Republican party conference, admitted that she was 'no longer the role model'. No wonder the dollar in your pocket fetches less than Y100.</p>

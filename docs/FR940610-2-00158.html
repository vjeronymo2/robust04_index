JSCC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and provides clearing services for securities listed on stock exchanges in Japan. JSCC acts as the central depository for foreign shares, including U.S. shares, listed on stock exchanges in Japan for the benefit of the beneficial owners thereof. It appoints local custodians with respect to non-Japanese securities. In 1988, ISCC and JSCC entered into a linkage agreement which permitted JSCC to obtain access through ISCC to certain services of the Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') for U.S. shares listed on stock exchanges in Japan and included in JSCC's central depository clearing system for foreign shares. ISCC and JSCC are entering into an amendment to the linkage agreement which will permit JSCC to obtain access through ICC to NSCC's NYW services for initial public offerings of U.S. securities listed on exchanges in Japan until such time as such securities are eligible for deposit at DTC. The services provided through the NYW will be similar to that which JSCC obtains through ISCC from DTC for DTC eligible securities. Deliveries and receives of these securities would be free of payment and would be initiated based on instructions received from JSCC. The securities held by NSCC would be used as the basis for the bookkeeping entries at JSCC. At such time as these securities become eligible at DTC they would be deposited at DTC for credit to the account of JSCC. At that time, the services that ISCC. At that time, the services that ISCC provides to JSCC for these issues will be the services covered under the terms of the original linkage agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The proposed rule changes fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and as such is therefore consistent with Section 17A of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

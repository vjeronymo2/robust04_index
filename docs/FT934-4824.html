			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Councils' rules on homeless may be relaxed The government is considering making it easier for local authorities to fulfil their duty to house the homeless by allowing them to place people permanently in accommodation now categorised as temporary. The move - aimed partly at providing a stimulus for the private rental sector - would form part of the sweeping reform of homelessness legislation announced by Sir George Young, housing minister, at October's Conservative party conference. The government's preliminary proposals are expected to be published early next year. One effect of the plans might be to clear the way for homeless lone mothers to be housed in alternative accommodation such as hostels instead of council houses or flats. The government may seek to portray such a move as removing an unjustifiable incentive for parents to turn unmarried pregnant teenagers out of the family home in full knowledge that they would go to the top of the list for council flats. In his conference speech, Sir George said there was a need to distinguish between providing a safety net and a device for jumping the housing queue. He said: 'By guaranteeing speedy access to secure accommodation at low rents, the law rewards those who come under it and penalises those who don't' Curbing the availability of council housing for lone mothers has become a popular call on the Conservative right. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, used his conference speech to signal that moves in this direction were a better way of combating the breakdown of the family than changing the welfare system. Local authorities are now allowed to house the homeless in temporary accommodation such as private rental units or bed-and-breakfast accomodation while they are waiting for a permanent dwelling such as a council house or flat to become available. Ministers have been anxious for some time to enlarge the private rented sector. Sir George believes it is a 'paradox' that British pension funds have shown willingness to invest in high-quality rented flats in Paris and New York but not in Britain. Sir George announced in October that he was discussing action needed to secure the investment of 'serious long-term money' in rental accommodation with pension funds and insurance companies. Of individuals who rent accommodation in Britain, about three-quarters do so from a local authority or housing association.</p>

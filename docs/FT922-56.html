			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Labour presses for companies 'blacklist' MR FRANK DOBSON, shadow energy secretary, called on the government in the Commons last night to blacklist companies in the financial services sector that had any connection with the operations that enabled Robert Maxwell to plunder pension funds. He said they should not be given advisory roles in the privatisation of British Coal or British Rail. When reminded of Mr Maxwell's associations with the Labour party Mr Dobson said: 'I do not give a damn which political party Robert Maxwell came from - he was a villain who stole money from pensioners.' He added: 'The point I am making is that he did it with the connivance of innumerable individuals and institutions in the City, because he could not have done it by himself.' The government rejected a Labour demand for a provision in the British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Bill to prevent advisory contracts being awarded to companies under investigation by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors, or which had been criticised by them. Mr Tim Eggar, minister for energy, accused Mr Dobson of seeking to stir up fears and worries about pensions in the coalfield communities and described his speech as 'an absolute disgrace'. He dismissed as a 'slur' suggestions that the arrangements enabling British Coal to stop making payments to pension funds through a 'contributions holiday' were designed to facilitate a management or employee buyout. Mr Eggar promised that the pension funds of employees of British Coal and British Rail would be safeguarded, but when pressed to provide statutory protection explained that the precise mechanism to be used had still to be decided. A clause moved by Mr Dobson was defeated by a government majority of 46 (273-227).</p>

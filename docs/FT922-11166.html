			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Romanians give ecstatic welcome to former king THOUSANDS of Romanians filled the streets of Bucharest yesterday to welcome back their former king, Michael of Hohenzollern, who was visiting the capital for the first time since 1947, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Police struggled to keep back good-natured crowds who had gathered since early morning around St George's church in the city centre, where the former king, aged 70, celebrated the Orthodox Easter with members of his family. Ex-king Michael declined to make political statements to the crowd, which at one point reached an estimated 100,000. He stood on the church balcony and exchanged traditional Easter greetings with his supporters. Although the crowd gave him an ecstatic welcome, many had mixed feelings as to whether the monarchy should be reinstated in Romania. The country's royalist party, the Liberal Monarchists, have no parliamentary representation. However, some opposition parties whose 14-party coalition attracted strong support in local elections in February, have said they will hold a referendum on the issue, if successful in general elections due this summer.</p>

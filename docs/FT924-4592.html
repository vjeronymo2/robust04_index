			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Reynolds charge pushed to Dollars 827m REYNOLDS Metals is to take a Dollars 827m charge to 1992 earnings as a result of changes in accounting methods for taxes and medical and other non-pension post-retirement benefits. Part of the charge, announced yesterday, represents additional environmental and restructuring costs. The company said the benefits accounting changes, required under new US accounting standards, would amount to charges of Dollars 610m. Previously-reported results for the first three quarters of 1992 will be restated to include higher charges for post-retirement benefits, said Mr Richard Holder, chairman. Mr Holder said the charge for the year would be Dollars 34m after taxes, distributed evenly over four quarters. Another Dollars 30m in charges for changes in income tax accounting would be reflected in the 1992 results, Mr Holder said. Of the Dollars 827m total charges, Dollars 97m are provisions for environmental remediation requirements. Restructuring costs comprise Dollars 56m of the total. Part of those charges stem from an early retirement programme that the company will offer to up to 800 employees. A company spokesman said the restructuring was part of a major cost-cutting effort. For the first nine months of 1992, Reynolds reported net income of Dollars 67.2m, or Dollars 1.13 a share, compared with Dollars 130.4m, or Dollars 2.20, a year earlier.</p>

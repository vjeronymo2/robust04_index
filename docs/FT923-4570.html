			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Books: How Britain faced a bleak inheritance NEVER AGAIN: BRITAIN 1945-51 by Peter Hennessy Jonathan Cape Pounds 20, 544 pages SERGEANT Ernie Teal, of the Coldstream Guards, recalled 1944-45 in a conversation with Peter Hennessy in 1989: 'When we got to Holland, we went to some of those houses in Nijmegen - flush toilets, nice gardens, they were just ordinary people but so much better off than we were. I was flabbergasted. And when we got to Germany, I thought: 'These people have been living well under Adolf. We owned two-thirds of the world and we lived worse off than them'.' Teal had got to the heart of the problem facing the post-war Attlee government, a problem summed up more analytically by former cabinet minister Roy Jenkins (also quoted by Hennessy): 'The inheritance was bleak. Our nominal membership of the triumvirate of world power was guaranteed by our recent record. But it was as unsustainable as it was temporarily incontestable.' With the help of hundreds of quotations such as these, Hennessy has produced a vivid and readable account of Britain between 1945 and 1951. It is a period with a unique flavour; one that looked backwards and was dominated by its own recent past. In retrospect, much of what was attempted and done was directed more to tackling inherited problems than to building for the future. Because of this, Hennessy spends more than a quarter of his book on what was happening in Britain during the second world war and in the 1930s. This is done well and means that the young or ignorant reader can plunge straight in and come away from the book with a fair and balanced assessment of the period. Hennessy aims to get everything in - the economic crises, the creation of Nato and the National Health Service and the withdrawal from India, of course; but also cricket and football, the radio programmes of the day, the New Look. This sometimes makes for an embarrassing superficiality, as in his treatment of the literature or philosophy of the period. On the big issues, though, generally he exhibits an excellent grasp of the material, both published and unpublished, presenting it in such a way as to show the dilemmas and difficulties as they appeared to people at the time. He has had, for example, the good idea of publishing the agendas for cabinet business in the first fortnight of the dreadful year 1947. Keeping in mind the enormous range and intractability of the issues ministers were trying to handle induces a proper degree of tolerance towards their failures and shortcomings. What emerges? On the debit side, most notably, the continual under-estimation by ministers of the UK's external balance-sheet problem (despite many incisive analyses by senior officials) and the consequent absence of any strategic approach to solving it. But there is much on the credit side: for example, the heroism and imagination of Ernest Bevin, almost single- handedly shaping the Marshall plan and creating Nato. The first acts of the long tragedy of the UK's unwillingness to get involved with continental Europe until too late are well set out: the irrational (but ultimately well-founded) rhetoric of Monnet contrasted with the rational (but ultimately ill-founded) scepticism of British officials. Given the context, Hennessy is (surely rightly) tolerant of British behaviour at this point. But he warns that he will be (again, surely rightly) much less tolerant in his next volume. Hennessy also plays fair in his account of the agonising decision to re-arm on the outbreak of the Korean war. He lets the officials most concerned explain eloquently why it was done and how, in the light of Britain's relationship with the US, it appeared unavoidable. But clearly he believes (again, I think rightly) that the result, at a time when continental and Japanese industry was just getting under way, was a terrible blow to the UK's export drive from which, in one sense, the nation never recovered. This is a good book but it could have been an even better one. In the promised succeeding volumes, could we have fewer cliches, fewer reflections on the author's feelings and personal life, and fewer footnotes (there are 2,100 here, including references to Hennessy's own unpublished diaries)? On the other hand, could we please have a critically-annotated bibliography? The absence of any bibliography at all in a book of this sort is amazing.</p>

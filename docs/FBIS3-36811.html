			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 Feb -- In his address in the State Duma  today, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia [LDPR], said that the possible bombing of  Serbian positions in Bosnia would be the "beginning of World War  III." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's address was connected with his  recent trip around former Yugoslavia. According to him,  "millions of Serbs are appealing to Russia for protection."    After a brief excursus on the history of that country,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said the people living in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are "a single Orthodox people, some of whom  at some time were forcibly converted into Islam and Catholicism."    In the opinion of the LDPR leader, the only way to resolve  the Yugoslav problem is to withdraw all foreign military  contingents and afterward "the people who live there will decide  for themselves what they should do next." The economic  sanctions against Belgrade, he thinks, will also fail to achieve  results. "Children are dying because of them," Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy believes.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy called on the Duma to adopt a  unanimous  position on the matter. On behalf of "the party which won the  elections on 12 December," he said, "the countries whose pilots  will dare to bomb Serbian positions will be completely  eliminated."    After this statement by the LDPR leader there were numerous  requests from the audience to switch off Zhirinovskiy's  microphone. Then he promised all parliamentarians unhappy with  his address "a trip to the north in the very near future."    "Russia's Choice" deputy Viktor Davydkin, who spoke after  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, proposed to the chairman that the  microphones of those people's elects who take liberties to speak  "in the tone and style of the LDPR leader" should be switched  off.    In addition, Yuliy Gusman, another "Russia's Choice" deputy,  addressing Vladimir Zhirinovskiy as "one Orthodox Christian  addressing another Orthodox Christian," demanded that the latter  should stop provoking the people's elects and said that, apart  from the LDPR leader, "there are a lot of loud-voiced and  boorish deputies in the audience ready to give a proper rebuff  to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy." Yuliy Gusman also promised Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy that it would be him who would go to the north "in  the very near future, together with his relatives."</p>

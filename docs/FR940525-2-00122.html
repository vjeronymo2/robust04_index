			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Southern California Edison Company, et al., Docket No. 50&hyph;206, San Onofre  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Generating Station, Unit No. 1, San Diego County, California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  April 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed amendment will revise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 2.C and 2.D of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SONGS 1) Operating License. Section 2.C will be revised to modify or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delete several licensing conditions which either no longer apply or require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision to apply to SONGS 1 in its permanently shutdown and defueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition. Section 2.D will be revised to exempt Fire Protection reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the reporting requirements of Section 2.D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an accident previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. SONGS 1 has been permanently shut down and all fuel has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken out of the reactor and stored in the SONGS 1 spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool. The proposed change will not modify any of the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant configurations, controls, procedures, or technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specification requirements necessary to assure the integrity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe operation of the spent fuel pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technical basis for deleting the four license conditions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which relate to Integrated Implementation Schedule, Cycle 11  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thermal Shield Monitoring Program, Plant Modification to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eliminate Single Failure Susceptibility of Vital Bus Automatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transfer Function, and the NRC's Confirmatory Order of January 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990, is that these license conditions were intended to assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the continued safe operation of SONGS 1 as a power producing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant. With the permanent shutdown of SONGS 1 and the issuance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its Permanently Defueled Technical Specifications (PDTS) on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 28, 1993, the plant modifications and safety programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the four license conditions are no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technical basis for modifying the license condition on fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transshipment is that this license condition was intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the safety of the operating plant by putting restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on operation of the turbine building gantry crane. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions are no longer necessary, in light of the permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shutdown of SONGS 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technical basis for modifying the license condition on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical protection is that this is necessary to update the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information contained in the license condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technical basis for exempting the Fire Protection Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the reporting requirements of Section 2.D is that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable requirements are adequately covered in 10 CFR 50.72  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 50.73, as stated in Generic Letters 86&hyph;10 and 88&hyph;12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from any accident previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. No safety-related equipment will be impacted by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed change. Thus, there is no credible likelihood that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new or different kind of accident from any accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated would occur as a result of this proposed change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. As explained earlier, the plant modifications and safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs associated with the license conditions being deleted are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer necessary. The safety-related equipment concerns that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> led to restrictions on operation of the turbine building gantry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crane no longer exist. The modification to the license condition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on physical protection will update the information contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this license condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revision to Section 2.D will make the reporting requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding deficiencies in the Fire Protection Program consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the NRC's generic guidance on this subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change will not significantly reduce a margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the analysis of the licensee and, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Main Library, University of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California, P.O.

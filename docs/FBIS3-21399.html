Sharp Dispute Among Clergy Over Sick Mothers' Abortions']    [Excerpts] According to the World Health Organization's  [WHO] figures, the number of AIDS cases is rising constantly,  and in just six years, that is, in the year 2000, the number of  those infected with the virus will reach approximately 40  million, with 90 percent of these cases in the developing world!    In the face of these dreadful figures, the Islamic Medical  Sciences Organization organized its sixth juristic symposium,  entitled "An Islamic View of the Social Problems of AIDS." It  was held in Kuwait and attended by representatives of 35  countries of the world, among them Egypt, which sent a medical  delegation headed by the Minister of Health and a number of  Muslim ulema, led by His Excellency the Mufti of the Republic.  They discussed extremely sensitive topics and issues, such as:    The isolation of AIDS patients; the position on someone who  spreads the virus intentionally; the rights and duties of an  infected husband; the admissiblity of performing an abortion on  an infected mother; the extent of her nursing and breastfeeding  her healthy child; the right of a healthy spouse to seek  separation from an infected spouse; the nature of the marital  intimacy under these circumstances; and whether AIDS may be  considered a fatal disease.    The conference spent three days in study and lively  discussions, and ended its closing session with a number of  important proposals and recommendations.    At the beginning of this symposium, which is the Islamic  Medical Sciences Organization's first since the liberation of  Kuwait, and held in cooperation with the Kuwaiti Ministry of  Health, the Academy of Islamic Jurisprudence in Jeddah, and the  regional office of the WHO in Alexandria. One hundred and thirty  medical and Islamic figures representing 35 Islamic and  non-Muslim countries set out, at the outset, the global AIDS  situation with the last WHO reports prepared by Dr. Muhammad  Hilmi Wahdan, WHO's Director of Disease Prevention and  Treatment, followed by Dr. Muhammad Haytham al-Khayyat:    In the space of just a decade, AIDS has become an epidemic  affecting millions of men, women, and children on every  continent. Despite the early cases that appeared among  "sodomite" men in several industrialized countries, it has since  then become a wide-ranging plague. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Disaster of the Developing Countries </H5>   It is indeed strange that approximately 90 percent of  expected AIDS cases are in the developing countries. The  situation is critical in the sub-Saharan region of Africa, where  the number of adults infected with the virus exceeds seven  million. About a third of pregnant women who have visited  pregnancy clinics in the cities are infected with the human  immunodeficiency virus. As a result, WHO now expects that by the  year 2000, between 5 and 10 million HIV-infected children will  have been born; by the mid-1990s--about one year from now--the  anticipated increase in juvenile AIDS deaths will be equal to  the decrease in deaths achieved by the Save the Children program  over the last two decades!    The average life expectancy at birth in these African  countries before the spread of the AIDS virus rose 20 percent,  but it will actually drop 5 to 10 percent by 2000, instead of  rising, had it not been for the AIDS virus.    Egypt participated in this symposium with a high-ranking  medical delegation led by Minister of Heath Dr. 'Ali  'Abd-al-Fattah al-Makhzanji and a host of Egypt's medical  notables: Dr. Ibrahim Badran; professor of pediatrics Dr. Ahmad  Mustafa 'Isa; dean of medicine at 'Ayn Shams University Dr.  Salah 'Id; Dr. Hasan Hathut, a native of Egypt who held the  highest post in the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health; Dr. Hamid  Shatlah, professor of pediatrics at 'Ayn Shams; Dr. Usamah  Ruslan, secretary general of the Egyptian Doctors' Syndicate;  Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Abu-al-Fattuh; and the "dynamo" of the  conference, Professor Dr. Ahmad Raja'i al-Jundi, the second man  in the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization serving as  assistant secretary general after Professor Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-'Awadi, the secretary general and former Kuwaiti minister of  health and planning.    A number of senior Muslim ulema from Egypt also took part in  this juristic and medical symposium, most prominently His  Excellency the Mufti of the Republic Dr. Muhammad Sayyid  Tantawi, Muslim preacher, Dr. Yusuf al-Qardawi, and rector of  al-Azhar University Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh.  <H5>  Islamic Medical Cooperation </H5>   The fact is that the scientific, medical, and Islamic  interaction was clear during the symposium's heated debates. The  topics were not the traditional ones, as is the case in many  conferences. Specific topics were brought up, relating to AIDS  victims, which required decisive judgements from the ulema,  researchers, and physicians taking part, on every case  separately. Among the cases upon which judgements were made,  were the ruling on isolating AIDS patients; on the intentional  transmission of the virus; the rights and duties of an  AIDS-infected spouse; performing abortion on an AIDS-infected  mother; the admissibility of an infected mother nursing her  healthy baby; the right of a healthy spouse to request  separation from an infected partner; and the right of marital  intimacy. These are all, as we can see, thorny and sensitive  issues many ulema would hesitate to approach, but in this  instance they talked with frankness and clarity, on the basis  that there is no shame in science and religion.    They discussed the issue of isolating AIDS patients, and the  senior physicians participating said that the AIDS virus is not  transmitted through cohabitation, touch, breathing, through  insects, sharing food, drink, toilet facilities, swimming pools  or chairs, nor even through sharing eating utensils, or other  aspects of living together in normal daily life. The virus is  transmitted, however, chiefly through sexual contact of any  kind, the transfusion of contaminated blood or its derivatives,  the use of contaminated needles, especially among drug users, or  transmission from an infected mother to her child.    In accordance with all this, the ulema in the symposium  resolved that there was no justification for isolating infected  pupils, workers, or others from their healthy colleagues.    The symposium dealt with the issue of intentional  transmission of the AIDS virus to healthy persons by any means,  which the ulema viewed as forbidden and as gravely sinful and  criminal, requiring temporal punishment. This punishment should  vary to suit the degree of seriousness of the deed and its  effect on individuals and society.  <H5>  Combatting Those Spreading the Virus Intentionally </H5>   The purpose of those intentionally spreading this deadly  disease in society, and this deed, is a type of war and  corruption on earth; one of the punishments stipulated for it in  the [Koranic] Verse of the al-Harabah--if the purpose in  intentionally spreading the virus is harm to a specific person,  and the virus actually is transmitted, and leads to the death of  the one to whom it was transmitted--would be retaliatory death,  or execution.    If the purpose in intentionally spreading the virus is to  harm a specific person, but the virus is not transmitted to him,  then the perpetrator must receive a restraining punishment.    The symposium also touched on the issue of abortion for an  AIDS-infected mother. On this issue there was a clear difference  among the ulema, but they cited a judgement reached by the  Islamic Medical Sciences Organization in a previous conference  on Childbearing in Islam, which ruled on abortion that the fetus  is alive from the beginning of conception, and that its life is  inviolable at all stages, and that there could be no harm  inflicted on it by abortion except in cases of extreme medical  need. Some participants, however, sharply disagreed with this  judgement, saying that abortion is permissible before the  fortieth day of pregnancy, especially when there are good  reasons.    Participating members of the symposium discussed the issue  of  AIDS-infected mothers nursing their healthy babies, citing the  views of pediatrics professors, among whom, as we have  mentioned, from Egypt, Dr. Ahmad Mustafa 'Issa, professor of  pediatrics and president of the Egyptian Friends of Mothers'  Milk Society, Dr. Hamid Shatlah, professor of pediatrics at 'Ayn  Shams, pointed out that according to current medical data there  is no certain danger in an AIDS-infected mother nursing her  healthy baby. This is an instance of normal cohabitative  intercourse. The view of the ulema in this symposium, based on  this data, is that in Islamic law there is no impediment to the  mother's nursing.  <H5>  Prevention for Child of an Infected Mother </H5>   While the likelihood of a healthy child being infected by  his  AIDS-infected mother through breastfeeding is extremely rare,  when it has been found to be the case, it was due to the  presence of the virus in the mother's milk or the mother's  blood, transmitted to the baby's mouth due to a crack in the  nipple. The mother may breastfeed for its many benefits, and she  must take care to reduce the likelihood of infecting her nursing  child. She may refrain from breastfeeding if she can find a wet  nurse to suckle it, or to give him alternatives to mother's milk  to nourish him.    They discussed the right of a healthy spouse to request a  separation from an AIDS-infected partner, and concluded that  either spouse may request a separation from an AIDS-infected  partner, as it is an illness whose virus is transmitted chiefly  through sexual contact.    The topic of this unique symposium, held in Kuwait under the  sponsorship of His Royal Highness Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad  al-Sabah, the Amir of Kuwait was the clarification of the rules  of Islam on the effects of the spread of AIDS, and so the ulema  and physicians found no embarrassment in discussing a sensitive  topic, which was the right of marital intimacy in cases of AIDS  infection. They concluded that if either partner were to be  infected with this disease, then the uninfected partner may  refrain from marital intimacy, because sexual contact is the  major mode of transmitting the virus.    If the healthy partner wishes to have sexual intimacy, then  prudence requires him to use a condom, which reduces the  likelihood of the virus and pregnancy, if he knows how to use it  properly.    The members of the symposium did not consider AIDS to be a  fatal disease, until its symptoms appeared fully, and the  patient was no longer able to pursue a normal life, and died.  <H5>  Ten Years of AIDS </H5>   Addressing the importance of this symposium, and the Islamic  view of the social problems of AIDS, Egyptian scientist Prof.  Dr. Ahmad Raja'i al-Jundi, assistant secretary general of the  Islamic Medical Sciences Organization spoke to AKHIR SA'AH. He  said:    "For 10 years the world has been devastated by this plague  of  our time, whose like the world has not yet seen. Before this  sickness research is helpless to offer treatment, with those  infected condemned to death, even though that may be after some  time. This great threat to humanity confirms the words of the  Prophet:    "`If fornication spreads among a people, and they flaunt it,  pains and illnesses that they never had before will appear on  them.' If we consider this saying of the Prophet, we see that it  speaks of fornication and the flaunting of it.    "Now, with a passing glance, we find that the Western and  Eastern worlds take pride in the absolute freedom which has  given people sexual freedom so that they are more like animals  than people, to the point that in the last conference on human  rights, one of the points of conflict between the advanced  countries and the Islamic group was complete, unrestricted  freedom, including sexual freedom, in which they take pride,  disdaining our Muslim countries. And now they are reaping what  they have sown, with this calamitous plague sweeping the world,  which may annihilate it if science does not find decisive  solutions to this problem in the very near future.    "The poor countries of Africa, and those of East Asia, are  today seeing some villages being wiped out of existence by this  dangerous disease. One of the common sights now is to see whole  villages whose young people are gone, those who would been  producing or working, while the overwhelming majority still  alive are old men and children!    "Fortunately, in our Islamic region the effects of the virus  are still under control, and far less than in other, Western  countries. Perhaps the most important difference between us is  our adherence to the teachings of Islam. Virtue and chastity  still have their place among Muslim peoples; right and wrong  have their roots in our peoples' consciences. Adultery is still  a major crime in our societies. We must commit ourselves even  more to the Koranic verse, `Approach not adultery; it is an  abomination and an evil path.'"  <H5>  Protection from Vice </H5>   "If we consider this verse carefully, we see that the ban on  adultery came with a warning not to approach it; approaching it  means the ways leading to it, whether by way of the woman taking  the steps necessary to protect herself by wearing modest Islamic  clothing, and saving her adornments for her husband; or with men  avoiding temptation, so that Satan will not seduce him into vice.    "The Prophet, God's peace and blessings be upon him, said,  `O  community of young men, let those of you who can provide, get  married, and let those who cannot, fast and abstain.' Thus we  are all asked to facilitate marriage for the young, to safeguard  the resources of the Islamic community from being lost, for the  young are the pillar of the community.    "It is not, however, merely a question of marriage. How many  married men and women do we see betraying the vows they made to  God? So the important thing, the more serious thing, is to raise  our youth and the new generation in a purely Islamic way, for  God's sake. They should know the limits God has set, and have  certain knowledge that God is watching them, and that He knows  what the eyes betray, and what is hidden in their hearts. They  must learn to judge themselves before others judge them. If we  can plant these virtues in them, we can guarantee them a safe,  serene, secure life, no matter what modern challenges face them,  sexual or non-sexual.    "It is expected that by the year 2000 the number of AIDS  cases will grow to 40 million, and this staggering number will  cause a great many social problems. There are many groups,  including AIDS groups, which have been able, through their  political influence, to politicize the disease. Perhaps most of  these are in America, England, and France; they do not hide  their infection with AIDS, but help to spread it in order to  reap many political and social gains. There are human rights  groups that sympathize with these infected people, and there are  groups of scientists interested in ethics who have all used  their own reasoning, and made legislation, and given the sick  and the infected many, many rights, at the expense of the  well-being of their societies.    "All this omits the Islamic view, with individual reasoning  to fill the need of the Islamic community, which is `the best  community raised up for mankind.' It is the first to lead with  legislation, and the reasoning of its ulema and jurists is from  known sources, which does not bring evil upon itself, from the  holy Koran and the traditions of the Prophet. This is the main  motive behind the holding of this symposium, "An Islamic View of  the Social Problems of AIDS," under the sponsorship of His  Highness the Amir of Kuwait, and the participation of men  learned in Islamic jurisprudence, and the medical, social, and  legal sciences from more than 35 Islamic and non-Islamic  countries."  <H5>  Declaration of Conference Resolutions </H5>   In the closing session held in the Islamic Medical Center in  the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization, its secretary  general, Professor Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Abdallah al-'Awadi,  announced the resolutions of this important conference:     -  It is the right of a person infected with the AIDS virus  to obtain the treatment and health care required by his health  condition, regardless of how he became infected with the virus.  He must inform his doctor and the competent authorities of his  infection, as a precaution against transmitting the virus to  others. The doctor must treat him and take precautions against  being infected himself; he must make the AIDS patient aware of  ways of keeping his health from deteriorating, and keeping the  virus from others. He must not be oppressed, slandered, or  abandoned because of his illness.    -  To protect youth from sexual perversion, early marriage must  be  encouraged, and the obstacles to it, which cause the age of  marriage to be delayed, should be removed.    -  It is the duty of official and popular bodies to take action  to  make members of society aware of the danger of AIDS, the ways in  which the virus is spread, and methods of prevention--especially  abstinence and an adherence to virtue.    -  Islamic precepts must be made part of the school curriculum  at  all educational levels, to complement the other subjects in  building character, for the good of individuals and society, and  to ensure the prevention of this plague.    -  The media has a significant role in making the public aware  of  the dangers of AIDS, and methods of preventing it, especially in  promoting abstinence. The media must also avoid showing anything  that might inflame the passions or sinful temptations.    -  Official agencies must offer the facilities needed to  diagnose  the AIDS infection on a widespread basis, as early detection has  a real effect on preventing the spread of the disease.    -  This conference calls upon all religious and rational people  throughout the world to join their ranks and efforts with  Muslims in their call for abstinence, and combatting all means  of sexual contact outside legal marriage.</p>

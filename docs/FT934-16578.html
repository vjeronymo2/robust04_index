			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Denmark's PM to seek improved welfare state MR Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, yesterday made a strong commitment to maintain and improve the welfare state in a state-of-the-nation speech at the opening of a new session of the Folketing (parliament). Mr Rasmussen, the Social Democratic head of a four-party centre-left majority coalition, became prime minister in January this year. He described unemployment, running at a rate of more than 12 per cent, as a problem which is 'a real threat to the common well-being and the individual's welfare'. He promised an action plan to help 'the outcasts, the lonely and the mentally handicapped'. A strongly expansive fiscal policy, announced earlier this year, was the government's attempt to get the economy moving and bring down the jobless total, he said. Mr Rasmussen, who is down in the opinion polls, promised improvements in health and hospital services, improved services for the elderly, better opportunities for early retirement for older workers, more day-care institutions for small children and a steady expansion of places for post-school job training. 'Can we really afford all the improvements I have named?' he asked. 'Yes. We have a surplus on the current balance of payments and low inflation. We have the room for manoeuvre,' he said. 'An expensive speech,' was the comment by the opposition Liberal party's economic policy spokesman, Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former economy minister. He accused the government of using promises of more public expenditure to buy voters ahead of the next election, which must be held before the end of 1994.</p>

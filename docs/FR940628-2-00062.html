The proposed permit would authorize for a period of 2 years, the incidental take of a threatened species, the Florida scrub jay,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> incidental to construction of the Villages of Tramore, consisting of 20 patio homes and associated infrastructure on 3.78 acres (Project). The Project is located along State Road A1A south of the city of Melbourne, in the Coconut Point area of Brevard County, Florida.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP) for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has made a preliminary determination that issuing the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments on the permit application, EA, and HCP should be received on or before July 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Persons wishing to review the application, HCP, and EA may obtain a copy by writing the Service's Southeast Regional Office, Atlanta, Georgia.

The scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated population is between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida, it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that one family currently uses the site and surrounding suitable habitat areas. The Applicant proposes to impact a portion of this family's territory. Initial construction of roads and utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury to, scrub jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the loss of 3.78 acres of scrub jay habitat, the Applicant will purchase 7.0 acres of scrub habitat known to support the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County, and provide a management endowment of $7,500 to ensure management of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed by the Applicant include siting of individual building footprints to minimize additional scrub habitat alteration, and protection of active nests, if discovered, during the nesting season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted, consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and no action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James W.

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Single Market Watch: Border controls raise complaints FREE circulation of people within the European Community is being hampered by systematic passport checks at airports, different national visa requirements for non-EC travellers and a lack of information about the single market, according to a lobby group for European citizens. Euro Citizen Action Service (Ecas) has written to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, after receiving more than 700 calls and about 300 written submissions about border controls on a special fax and telephone hotline, which operated between January 4 and January 13. Mr Tony Venables, Ecas director, is now calling on the Commission to take action to resolve flaws which Ecas claims are undermining the principle of free movement of people. In a report*, Ecas says that although systematic passport checks at the EC's internal land frontiers seem to have ended, all member states are in infringement of the Single European Act, particularly at airports. Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the new commissioner for the internal market, yesterday presented a preliminary report on the progress of the single market to his fellow commissioners. The report, details of which should be made public today, refers to delays in lifting internal border controls on people, but it seems unlikely that Mr Vanni d'Archirafi will seek a legal confrontation with sluggish member states. Three EC members, Britain, Ireland and Denmark, are likely to retain passport controls beyond the end of this year, but even the more enthusiastic countries are lagging behind in their attempts to abolish all controls during 1993. In some cases Ecas believes it has the basis for a formal complaint to the European Commission. In particular, Ecas received more than 100 complaints from residents of Gibraltar claiming that Spain had strengthened its controls on people travelling to and from the British crown colony. *Ecas, 1 rue Defacqz, 1050 Brussels, Belgium.</p>

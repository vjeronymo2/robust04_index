			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mozambique begins to rebuild its cashew revenues - The prospects for the country's second biggest export earner following the ceasefire MOZAMBIQUE, once the world's leading cashew nut producer, has begun to rebuild its industry following last year's ceasefire in the civil war. The objective is to match again the output of India and Brazil, which have occupied first and second places since 1977, when fighting began seriously to disrupt production in the former Portuguese colony. Cashew is Mozambique's second biggest value export crop after prawns, an industry less affected by the war, which Britain is helping to modernise through the refitting of trawlers and building of a new jetty at Angoche on the Indian Ocean coast. Cotton and sugar also earn hard currency for Mozambique, but hydro-electric power exports to South Africa from the Cahora Bassa dam had to be stopped during the war years, which also saw a big drop in revenues for rail transit between Indian ocean ports and land-locked states. In the absence of oil or big mineral discoveries Mozambique is reliant on aid for most of its foreign exchange inflows. So it needs all the nuts it can gather to promote greater economic independence. Fortunately demand for cashew is high and the Mozambique variety attracts an average price for all grades of Dollars 3.20 per kilogram of kernal. Mr Juliano Saranga, the Frelimo government's secretary of state for cashew, returned in early April from a meeting of the African Development Bank in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's capital, with an agreement for an additional Dollars 20m of funding for a further five-year rehabilitation and development programme. The minister believes output from existing trees, which are expected to yield only 35,000 tonnes during the October - March 1992-93 season, could be doubled within three years with improved husbandry. That would still be well below the record year of 1972 when Mozambique's 216,000 tonnes were more than four times Indian output. He points out that the smallholders in coastal regions who fled during the war were returning to neglected trees, sometimes in areas where there were no roads to distribute the pesticides to combat mildew. The fall in output to 35,000 tonnes from 54,000 tonnes in the 1991-2 season  -a year when Brazil came first with 190,000 and India produced 140,000 tonnes - was party caused by natural variations in yield, he explained. But the main problem in all areas was collection. Traders - who buy nuts from smallholders at a minimum price set by the government and then sell them on at unregulated prices to wholesalers for delivery and sale again to the processing factories - could not afford to borrow money at the ruling 45 per cent interest rate. As a consequence smallholders increasingly bartered their nuts locally or included them in their own cooking in place of groundnuts. The ADB money, along with that received from the the World Bank, which also has a long-term cashew support programme in Mozambique, is being used to provide extension workers, develop tree nurseries, introduce improved Brazilian grafts, modernise factories and to make a detailed survey of trees. Mr Saranga is convinced that the future lies with providing support for the smallholders and not large, state-funded orchards that were abandoned 10 years ago. Smallholders, usually families cultivating about 10 trees intercropped with maize, cassava and cow peas and producing nuts in October and March, now account for 90 per cent of the harvest. The state role is also being eliminated in processing as buyers or joint venture operators are sought for remaining state factories. Four factories are now privately owned - two by the Anglo American Corporation and two by Portuguese concerns. Two of the remaining state factories are in the process of privatisation and investors are also sought for new factories so that all nuts can be processed within Mozambique. Two years ago, after 15 years of handling the total crop from tree to roasted kernel, Mozambique had to revert to exporting raw nuts to India for cracking and roasting because of inadequate local capacity. About a third of the current October-March season crops will be exported to India in raw form.</p>

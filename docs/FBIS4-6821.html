			<p>BFN     [Text] A FOUNDER and leading member of the Barisan  Revolusi Nasionale (BRN) separatist movement in this northern  Malaysian state blames a group of politicians for instigating  violence in southern Thai provinces so as to create a situation  to justify the overthrow of the Chuan government.    Speaking to the BANGKOK POST through an interpreter in his  hometown Abdul Garim bin Hassan concluded that the situation in  the South, manifested by torching of rural schools and bomb  attacks, was manipulated with political intent.    A respectable religious instructor, he urged the Chuan  government not to be misled by the situation or to put the blame  on separatist movements.    Abdul Garim said he recently met Dr Arong Mureng, leader of  a  new and aggressive faction of the Pattani United Liberation  Organisation, another separatist organisation which has waged a  battle for the creation of an autonomous Pattani state in  southernmost Thailand.    Dr Arong was suspected by the Fourth Army Region of playing  a  role in the torching of 34 schools in Yala, Pattani and  Narathiwat provinces last August.    The BRN founder said he and Dr Arong shared the view that  most of the untoward incidents in the past eight months in the  South were perpetrated by some politicians to cause trouble for  the Government.    He insisted that his BRN organisation and Dr Arong's PULO  faction were not involved in any of those incidents.    "I know him (Dr Arong) personally and this helps convince me  that the allegations against Arong for causing turmoil are  totally ridiculous.    "First, he is a staunchly religious man and anyone who has  strong faith in religion will not dare do anything which will  harm the lives of innocent people.    "Secondly, it would take a large number of people to cause  trouble in different places simultaneously. And Arong does not  have that capability," said Abdul Garim referring to the  torching of 34 schools.    He said when he first heard about the incidents he knew at  once that they were not perpetrated by separatist movements.    Abdul Garim is considered by the Fourth Army as a highly  respectable member of the BRN.    Negotiations are under way to persuade him to return to  Pattani to pursue a normal life.    The BRN founder charged that some separatists "who do not  have any ideology" were hired by some politicians to create  turmoil in the South 'to create a pretext for the overthrow of  the Government.    He said Arong suspects that some of his men may have become  tools of the politicians but without his consent.    Arong, he added, was infuriated.    Abdul Garim claimed separatist organisations were created  for  political objectives.    He explained that southern provinces were a perfect target  for trouble-making because the public could be easily misled to  believe that the separatists have a hand in them.    He said he felt sorry for Prime Minister Chuan Likphai whose  administration has become a target.    "He is a man of good heart and who has always fought for  justice in society. I personally admire him," said Abdul Garim.    About his 30-year struggle for an autonomous state in  southern Thailand, he said he now realises that violence and  armed struggle are not a solution to problems in the South.    He said he was considering the peace overture from the  Fourth  Army. If he is assured religious freedom, he said he may return.    "What I really want to do when I return home is teach Islam  to young Muslims and tell them to have faith in our religion,"  he said.    He said he has heard of the progress in the Muslim-dominated  provinces and was impressed by the effort of the Government  which has gone to great lengths to redress the plight of Muslim  people.    Abdul Garim, who led an armed struggle during the early  1960s  because he felt at the time that the government was repressing  Muslims, now views the situation more favourably.    He said he was confident that the situation in the South  will  improve now that the Government recognises and respects the  religious' rights and freedom of Muslim people.</p>

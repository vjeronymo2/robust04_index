He also lied about what he called Iraq's  commitment to democracy and respect for human rights, and he  cawed like a crow about civility. The Arab saying that  something is so sad that it is funny is true because hesitant  Clinton continues to slaughter people--elderly, women, and  children--in Somalia while he wails about human rights and  announces a withdrawal from Somalia. He wails about civility  while it was he who hit the houses of seemingly safe people in  Baghdad with missiles, and killed men, children, and women from  26-27 June 1993 when there was no military confrontation between  Iraq and the U.S.    When hesitant Clinton tries in vain to prolong the unjust  siege on Iraq through empty logic and baseless pretexts, he  demonstrates his bankruptcy and his deviation from the will of  the international community and law. Iraq has implemented  Resolution 715 on future monitoring and Part C of Resolution  687. This requires the implementation of Paragraph 22 of  Resolution 687--the immediate lifting the oil embargo on Iraq  and the total lifting of the siege. There is nothing in the  Security Council that refers to the "trial period." Hesitant  Clinton's talk about democracy and human rights is mere  nonsense. Statements by Special Commission Chairman Ekeus, and  others, who are not Iraqis, refer to Iraq's legal right to have  the siege lifted.    Iraq's steadfastness, the determination of its leader Saddam  Husayn, and our efforts to bolster the jihad and construction  march, are the means to lift the siege against hesitant  Clinton's will and despite the falsity of his talk.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's rating for Chinese issue THE first Chinese bond issue planned for the Euromarket by an entity not owned by the state, a Dollars 150m floating-rate note offer from Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation, was yesterday given a Baa1 credit rating by Moody's, the US agency, writes Richard Waters. The corporation is owned by the provincial government of Guangdong, China's fastest-growing region, and has been given the same rating as that accorded the People's Republic. The province's economy grew by 14 per cent in real terms in 1992, and its exports by 32 per cent, Moody's said. Foreign debt, it added, 'represents a relatively small burden against quickly rising external revenues'.</p>

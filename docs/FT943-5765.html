			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Rise in house prices just tops inflation The uncertain prospects for recovery in the UK housing market were underlined yesterday with the publication of a survey showing the annual rise in house prices at only just above the rate of inflation. The monthly house price index published by Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest society, suggested that house prices rose 0.6 per cent in August, to a level 2.6 per cent higher than in August last year. These figures are higher than those in the monthly survey produced by Halifax Building Society, the UK's biggest mortgage lender. The Halifax survey for August is due to be published today. It is expected to confirm flatness in terms of month-on-month house price fluctuations, and a small rise in prices over the year. In its July survey it said that further monthly price falls were possible and estimated an annual rate of increase of just 1 per cent. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide chief executive, said evidence suggested that the recovery in market activity, which appeared to be strengthening early in the year, was 'marginal', although underlying levels of transactions appeared to have stabilised. The society expects national house price rises to be close to the level of inflation by the end of the year, but for this overall estimate to include significant local variations. Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, said that house prices appeared to have steadied and were edging up slightly. Mr Charles Toner, managing director of the group's retail operations, said: 'What we are seeing is that the mortgage market is probably a bit bigger than last year. There is a lot of competition and the bulk of it is now in discounted and variable-rate products rather than fixed-rate mortgages'. He said that Abbey's replacement of its previous range of fixed-rate mortgages at the end of business on Wednesday by a new range with interest rates up to two annualised percentage points higher reflected the increasing costs of funding fixed rates on the wholesale money markets. Fixed-rate mortgages were the subject of intense competition among lenders last year and earlier this year. But a number of lenders noticeably raised their fixed-rates in a series of moves from late February onwards. Many longer-term fixed rates are now more expensive than standard variable rates.</p>

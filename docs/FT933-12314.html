			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Ethical investment - honest, or just hype? / The sector is small but has been growing steadily. Yet, some say it is no more than a marketing tool HOW CLEAR is your conscience? Ever since the market in ethical and environmental funds started to grow late in the 1980s, there has been a suspicion that they are more a marketing tool than a wholehearted attempt to offer investors the choice of putting money into companies meeting a series of moral criteria. The amount placed in these funds has been rising steadily, although it remains a very small market. Some Pounds 365m was invested in ethical/environmental unit trusts by May 1993 compared with Pounds 283m in July 1991, according to the Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris); this monitors the activities of UK companies to see if they meet the required criteria. Most ethical/environmental funds are unit trusts but there is also a smattering of investment trusts, such as Jupiter Tyndall Merlin's International Green. Commercial Union runs an environmental pension fund, while Henderson offers a Green personal equity plan and Homeowners, a friendly society, has a Green Chip growth bond. The type of fund you choose depends very much on your own views about a given issue. Take Eagle Star's Environmental Opportunities fund, which might seem a non-starter for many since the company is owned by BAT, the tobacco group. Eagle Star denies it is an ethical fund and says the trust 'should not in any way be labelled a green trust; neither is it an ethical trust. We are not making moral judgments.' Nevertheless, the company says its main aim is to invest in 'far-sighted' companies which take a positive attitude to environmental issues. If you do not think tobacco is an environmental issue, this is not a problem. But if you regard smoking as 'pollution,' you will not think of this as a 'true' environmental fund. Greener than White? Idealists will find it difficult to find a perfect fund, partly because of the different criteria chosen by the trusts. Some green funds will invest in companies trying to clean up their act by using environmentally friendly materials in their offices. Others will invest in companies producing goods and services which contribute to the environment, without taking a view on the shade of green adopted by the management of the company. John Allan, of Clerical Medical's Evergreen fund, says: 'We would avoid investing in companies such as British Petroleum or Shell oil. 'But others will invest on the basis that these companies are involved in research into the environment and are making efforts to clean up their act.' A survey in this month's issue of Which?, the Consumer's Association magazine, gives plenty of ground for disillusionment and would appear to confirm the cynical view of ethical/environmental funds as marketing hype. Its investigation, into 17 of them, found that none managed to avoid completely five areas of ethical or environmental concern. Only three of the funds - Ethical Investment, Friends Provident Stewardship and Scottish Equitable - said they avoided companies where they were unable to monitor investments. The criteria chosen by Which? were animal testing, weapons, oppressive regimes, political donations and green issues such as pollution, nuclear power and ozone-depleting chemicals. Some funds scored particularly low marks, although the criteria used did not necessarily match the funds' own. TSB Environmental Investor rated the lowest over animal exploitation because it invests in Unilever, which tests cosmetics on animals. Abtrust's ethical fund fared poorly in avoiding companies linked with making or supplying arms because of an investment in Weir Group, the engineering company which manufactures missile launching systems for nuclear submarines. Abtrust, however, has sold its holding in Weir and says the company had been under review for some time because of its activities. The Environ trust run by Co-Operative Insurance (CIS) also fell short in the survey. It has a holding in BOC, the industrial gases and drugs group which has subsidiaries in countries such as China, condemned by Amnesty International for human rights abuses. Environ also has a stake in Siebe, an engineering company which makes parts for nuclear submarines and has a subsidiary in South Africa which pays low wages, according to Eiris. Environ does avoid companies which, among other criteria, make more than 10 per cent of their turnover in countries with oppressive regimes, or in arms-related activities. 'If you dig deep enough, you could find fault with any company,' says David Mott, of CIS. 'We think we have been successful in striking a balance between good investment returns and establishing criteria which the average, caring investor would be happy with.' Performance CIS argues that it adopts a more relaxed policy than some funds in order to assist performance, and this appears to be borne out by the table. It was the second highest-performer of any ethical/green fund in the international growth sector in the three years to July 1, although it has not matched that performance in the year to July 1. By contrast, Clerical Medical's Evergreen - which, along with Friends Provident and Scottish Equitable's ethical fund, came out best in the Which? survey - is second from bottom over the three years to July 1. It invests in companies where a major part of the business lies in making a contribution to the environment, but excludes those where other operations might cause damage to the environment. 'This automatically means that we have a narrow band of companies which we can invest in,' says Allan. 'Performance is affected to the same degree as any fund limited to a narrow band, such as a single country emerging market fund.' Most of the companies involved in providing goods and services of the environmental type tend to be small, so performance often can be volatile. Ethical/green unit trusts underperformed the average for the two sectors listed in the table in the year to July 1, but have outperformed the average in the three and five years to the same date. This should give cheer to idealists who also want good returns. 'Investors should look around to find a fund that best meets their own principles,' says Eiris. 'Some people may not find them perfect but, for many, one or more of these funds will get them much closer to their ideal.' And to a clearer conscience, Eiris could have added. To celebrate its ninth anniversary, Friends Provident is offering an extra 1 per cent unit allocation for new investments of more than Pounds 3,000 into Stewardship, the largest ethical fund. The offer runs to September 17.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    PERFORMANCE OF ETHICAL UNIT TRUSTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Fund size        Percentage growth                                (Pounds m)   1 year    3 years   5 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK GROWTH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey Ethical                     16.1       12.9       32.9      54.4 Allchurches Amity                 15.4       11.0       20.2      54.3 Eagle Star Env Opp                10.3        6.9       23.0         - Friends Prov Stewardship         131.7       12.2       22.7      33.7 NM Conscience                     11.6        9.4       21.8      42.7 Scot Equitable Ethical            10.8        8.8       33.3         - Sovereign Ethical                  7.6        5.1       11.7         - TSB Environ Investor              20.0        7.0       18.9         - Average                           27.9        9.2       23.1      46.3 Average UK growth trust           57.5       14.5       19.7      38.7 FT-A All Share Index                         17.7       22.3      48.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL GROWTH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Buckmaster Fellowship              3.8       20.9       -2.9       3.0 CIS Environ                       18.4       11.7       41.3         - City Fin Acorn Ethical             3.2       13.5       23.0         - Clerical Med Evergreen            11.9       33.6        2.1         - Edinburgh Target Global Opps       2.7       27.7       21.1      46.7 Framlington Health                 7.9       26.8       97.9     178.9 Merlin Jupiter Ecology            10.0       16.9       17.9      45.4 NPI Global Care                    3.7       12.9          -         - Average                            7.7       20.5       28.6      68.5 Average Int growth trust          40.5       27.8       19.8      52.2 FT-World Index                               49.4       35.1      57.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finstat, figures to July 1, offer-to-bid, income reinvested  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

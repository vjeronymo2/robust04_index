			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Japan Atomic Power Company has launched construction  plans for the world's largest nuclear power plant. The  construction dates are still undecided, but this will be the  world's first advanced pressurized water reactor (APWR). It was  developed jointly by five electric power companies including  Kansai Electric Power, Kyushu Electric Power and Japan Atomic  Power, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the government, and the U.S.  company Westinghouse based on the Standardization Program for  Third Generation Advanced LWRs.    This plant will consist of Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4, which  each will have an output of 1,420,000 kW. Previous PWR type LWRs  have used a dual system emergency core cooling system (ECCS) but  the APWR will have a quadruple system ECCS. Plans call for the  reactor to used a mixture of uranium and plutonium oxides (MOX)  for fuel. At most, plutonium oxide will make up 33% of the  fuel. However, Toru Ishii (Director, Nuclear Power Technology  Administration Office, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) says, ``The  APWR will have the capability to burn MOX with as much as  50%  plutonium oxide,'' because it was designed for core and  operational diversity.    This plant will use a large core that can load 30%  more  uranium and yield 20% more output than Kansai Electric  Power's  Osaka NPP No. 4. Having this difference of more than 10%  means  the time until the next fuel replacement can be extended. It  also has the advantage that the amount of heat produced by the  individual fuels will be less, making things easier to control.    The reactor will have a stainless steel neutron reflector  positioned around the fuel assembly. The neutrons that have been  wasted because they do not collide with fuel will be reflected  once more into the center to increase burnup of the nuclear fuel.    Yutaka Kurihara (Executive Director, Japan Atomic Power)  says, ``Strictly speaking, the Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4 are not  APRWs according to the Standardization Program for Third  Generation LWRs'' because they do not include a spectral shift  mechanism to increase burnup efficiency of the fuel. This  mechanism has zirconium rods inserted in it, and later they are  withdrawn and replaced with water. It is designed so that the  increased water slows down the neutrons, and that enables  efficient burnup of fuels that gradually become harder and  harder to burn.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-43A>           Key: 1. Comparision of Core Construction; 2. Past PWR; 3. </FIG>       Spectral shift increases burnup efficiency by 10%.  However,  because the fuel cost accounts for only 20% of the total  cost  of nuclear power generation, it only reduces the total costs by  about 2%. Moreover, maintenance and inspection of the  device  that raises and lowers the zirconium rods are delicate and  complex operations, so Japan Atomic Power decided not to use it.    A demand will arise about the year 2000 for refurbishing  aging nuclear power plants in the U.S. At that time a new  generation of reactors will be needed. The APWR and advanced  boiling water reactors have become the prime candidates to fill  that need.</p>

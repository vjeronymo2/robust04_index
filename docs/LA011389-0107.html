			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUSTOM CAR TOOK 3 YEARS TO BUILD;  </P> <P> REAGAN LIMO IS JUST IN TIME -- FOR BUSH  </P> <P> A $600,000 stretch Lincoln limousine was delivered to President Reagan on  Thursday but will be used for the first time by President-elect George Bush on  Inauguration Day, officials said.  </P> <P> The 22-foot black armored presidential limousine was built from the ground up  under Secret Service specifications during the past three years, said Jerald F.  terHorst, Ford's director of national public affairs.  </P> <P> Ross Roberts, vice president and general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury  division of Ford Motor Co., made the presentation to Reagan in Bush's presence.  "It's mine for a few days George, then it will be yours," Reagan told Bush.  </P> <P> It is the first time a presidential limousine has been custom-built. Others  have been transformed to meet White House needs.  </P> <P> TerHorst, who was White House spokesman for former President Gerald Ford, said  he expected that Bush would use the limousine when he goes to the White House  Jan. 20 to pick up President Reagan. They will ride down Pennsylvania Avenue  together to the Capitol. Bush and his wife, Barbara, will also ride in the  Lincoln to start the inaugural parade.  </P> <P> The new White House limousine "has all the latest communications gear that a  president could possibly want," TerHorst said. It seats three persons in the  rear and has three jump seats. The vehicle's interior is dark blue and adorned  with the presidential seal inside and outside.  </P> <P> The last Lincoln presidential limousine was used from 1972 to 1982. The White  House since has leased Cadillacs from General Motors.  </P> <P> In the past, Ford has leased its limousines to the White House but the federal  government purchased the new model for $600,000.  </P> <P> The presidential limousine is always used on overseas presidential trips. It is  expected to be flown to Japan for use by Bush when he attends the Feb. 24  funeral of Emperor Hirohito.  </P></p>

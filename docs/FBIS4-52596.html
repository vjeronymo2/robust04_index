			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "For the Thai National Assembly's Dignity"] </F>   [Text] The Chat Thai Party has done the right thing in  appointing a committee to investigate the U.S. drug trafficking  charge against one of its MP's, Thanon Siriprichaphong. Thanon  is accused of having been involved in exporting huge quantities  of marijuana into the United States. The US Information Service  [USIS], the U.S. Government' mouthpiece in Thailand, has  confirmed the seizure of the MP's property in the United States.    Likewise, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri  has also done the right thing when he assured the U.S.  ambassador to Thailand that the Thai Government, dutybound to  defend Thailand's integrity and interest, will fully cooperate  with the United States in handling the case under the country's  legal system.    Earlier, several opposition leaders pointed out that the  controversy is a political ploy to discredit the opposition Chat  Thai Party, while many others noted that the drug charge was a  personal affair with no effect on the House of Representatives  or Thailand. This opinion is correct only to a certain extent.    Since the accused person is a member of the honorable House  of Representatives and a public figure, his action does have  repercussions on the institution he belongs to and on the  country as a whole. This is a criminal case brought to court by  a foreign government and the accused person's property has  already been confiscated. There is no way to keep the matter  quiet.    We have learned from the new USIS release that the U.S.  Embassy notified the Thai Government about the charge on 12  January 1993. It has been more than a year now and all senior  figures in the government and officials concerned earlier said  that they knew nothing about the matter.    The accused MP himself told mass media representatives that  he had not received any formal charge from the United States.  Hence, people wonder about the efficiency of Thai law  enforcement. How can the agencies in charge of narcotics  suppression with their close touch with the United States be  unaware of the incident?    We appeal to all parties concerned, be it the government,  House of Representative, or Chat Thai Party, to expedite the  investigation into the charge and publicize the clear facts to  preserve the prestige of the Thai House of Representatives and  the good reputation of the country. Do not create a negative  image for the country's legal system, law enforcement, and  judicial procedure in the eyes of foreigners.</p>

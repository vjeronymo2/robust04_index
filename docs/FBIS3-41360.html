JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI. General 'Ali Akbar  Puriani, the commander of the Kerman law enforcement zone, in an  interview announced that last week in four phases of  intelligence operations by the personnel of the Kerman law  enforcement zone, two narcotics trafficking gangs were destroyed.    He said: After several days and nights of continuous effort  and intelligence work, the counternarcotics management personnel  succeeded in destroying a narcotics trafficking gang that was  active on a large scale in the city of Kerman and arrested the  12 members of the gang. He said: Nine weapons, Combat, Klash,  Siminof, and Colt sidearms; a significant amount of combat  ammunition; and five sedans, trucks, and motorcycles were seized  from them, and the accused confessed to the trafficking of nine  tons of narcotics.    Gen. Puriani, the commander of the Kerman law enforcement  zone, added: With the efforts of the personnel of the law  enforcement zone of Kerman Airport and their expansive  investigation, a narcotics trafficking gang was identified and  destroyed. This gang, in which 45 non-native persons were  active, purchased narcotics from individuals in Kerman, prepared  them in 50-780-g packages, hid them in their bodies, and  traveling on airplanes to the provinces in the north, west, and  northwest transported them for sale. All 45 persons were  captured, and on them more than 10 kg of opium were seized. The  sellers in Kerman were also identified and arrested.    The commander of Kerman law enforcement added: After four  people from Zarand were taken hostage last month by armed  outlaws, the personnel of the Zarand law enforcement region,  after a long period of intelligence work and surveillance,  succeeded in capturing five of the kidnappers and contacts of  the outlaws.    In conclusion, he said: After a person was kidnapped by the  armed outlaws, with the round-the-clock efforts of the  self-sacrificing personnel of the Jiroft law enforcement region,  the location of the outlaws was identified, and in an armed  skirmish, two of the outlaws were killed and seven arrested.  Five Klash weapons, some amounts of combat ammunition, and two  motorcycles were also seized on them.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Chicago to add fresh dimension to trade THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange will launch trading in options on its one-month Libor (London interbank offered rate) futures contract on June 12. The futures-options will add a fresh dimension to the one-month Libor future, which has become the most successful new contract launched by the exchange since its Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index future started trading in 1982. As of April 15, open interest in the Libor futures stood at 15,931 - a record. Trading volume has also steadily increased, with the March monthly total reaching nearly 35,500 contracts. Apart from the Libor futures and the proposed Libor options, the exchange's interest rate products include futures and options on 90-day Treasury bills and Eurodollars. One-month Libor options will be listed on the first three consecutive contract months on June 12, pending approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulators.</p>

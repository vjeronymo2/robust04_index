			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 3 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] According to a report submitted by the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs to the ruling parties' policy committee on 2  June, the government is considering submitting to the  International Court of Justice [ICJ] a position paper stating  that "the use of nuclear arms is not necessarily a violation of  international law." Many policy committee members opposed this,  because "even if this may not violate international law, it may  not be proper for Japan to express such an opinion." The  committee asked the Foreign Ministry to reconsider.    The WHO general meeting in May 1993 passed a resolution to  seek a judicial opinion from the ICJ on the issue of "whether  the use of nuclear arms, in view of its effects on health and  the environment, constitutes a violation of international law."  ICJ "agreed to take cognizance of the case," and has been  asking various countries to give their opinions. The  above-mentioned position paper is to be submitted to ICJ in  response to this request, which has a deadline of 10 June.    According to a briefing given to the policy committee, the  Foreign Ministry first questions the jurisdiction of ICJ as to  whether it is appropriate for ICJ to make a judgment on this  issue. However, it also asserts that "in Japan's opinion, the  use of nuclear arms is not necessarily a violation of  international law."    The position paper does not even require a cabinet decision.  The Foreign Ministry says that with regard to this issue, "what  we can say is that we are presently considering the problem,  including whether we should submit a position paper."</p>

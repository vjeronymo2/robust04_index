			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Californian counties declared disaster areas PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday declared five counties in southern California major disaster areas in response to the brush fires that have so far destroyed at least 500 homes in the region. Mr Clinton also sent Mr Bruce Babbitt, the Interior Secretary, and Mr James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to California to help co-ordinate government action. 'It's a huge fire out there and we are going to do whatever it takes to help the people,' Mr Clinton said. Fifteen major wildfires continued burning out of control yesterday across 88,000 acres stretching from the Mexican border to Los Angeles' northern suburbs, giving rise to unofficial damage estimates running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. At least 30,000 people were forced to flee their homes, while 24 firefighters were hurt, three critically, and at least 12 civilians were reported injured in the blazes. Hardest hit was the affluent suburb of Laguna Beach, where a 7-mile wall of fire marched toward the sea, devouring more than 300 homes, some of them million-dollar mansions. The town's entire population of 24,000 was ordered to evacuate. Even Malibu, the up-market coastal enclave of movie stars and millionaires, was feeling the heat. Up to 15 homes sitting atop steep canyons were reported to have gone up in smoke. 'It is a little too early to make any estimates,' said Ms Loretta Waters of the Insurance Information Institute. State Farm Fire and Casualty holds the largest market share of homeowner insurance in California, with about 22 per cent, according to the institute. Allstate is next with 16.8 per cent and Farmers Group is third with 13.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Two borrowers add to heavy supply of FRNs TWO borrowers yesterday added to recent heavy supply of floating rate paper in the international bond market, BankAmerica and Asfinag raising Dollars 300m and Dollars 100m respectively. The deals followed Monday's Dollars 1bn floating rate issue by Finland and a spate of other recent deals by US and European financial institutions. Bankers said yesterday that a significant amount of paper from these earlier transactions remained unsold. In particular, recent issues by Italian banks have faced problems because of doubts about their credit quality. Last week, Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, one of Italy's largest financial institutions, had its credit rating unexpectedly lowered by Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency. In contrast, BankAmerica is one of only a few banks to have its credit ratings increased. Debt issued by the bank holding company is rated A2 by Moody's and single-A by Standard &amp; Poor's. Lead-managed by Kidder Peabody, the paper issued yesterday is fungible with a Dollars 200m transaction launched in February, creating a liquid benchmark in the sector. The notes pay  3/8 per cent over the three-month London interbank offered rate, and were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.80. At this level, the discounted margin is 42 basis points over Libor. In February, paper was launched at 50 basis points over Libor. Participants reported steady buying rather than spectacular demand. By the close of trading in London, the notes were trading at 99.55 bid, inside full fees of 25 basis points. The Asfinag paper carries the backing of the Austrian state and a top triple-a credit rating, but was considered tightly priced. The bonds pay 1/8 per cent over six month Libor, but subject to a cap of 6.5 per cent for the second year. The cap rises through the five-year life of the bonds. Elsewhere, IBM International Finance launched a Dollars 300m fixed-rate deal, targeted at retail investors. The 5.625 per cent paper matures in 1995. The deal, lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston, was expected to appeal mainly to Swiss investors with Eurodollar bond holdings maturing over the next few weeks. The bonds were re-offered at a fixed price of 99.935, where the yield spread is 25 basis points over US Treasury bonds. However, syndicate officials noted that the bonds carry a payment date - the date on which primary market purchases must be settled - six weeks ahead, an unusually long period for a Eurobond. This increases the cost of the bonds for institutional investors switching into the issue, since the proceeds of bond sales have to be held in cash for longer than usual. The lead manager said the long payment date, designed to get better terms for the borrower in the interest rate swaps market, underlined the retail targeting of the deal.</p>

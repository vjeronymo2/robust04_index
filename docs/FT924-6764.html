			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bulgarian farming's post-communist crisis - Production has plummeted after the break-up of co-operatives SENIOR EUROPEAN Community officials flew into Sofia last weekend in an effort to keep talks on Bulgaria's EC association agreement afloat after negotiations last week foundered once again, chiefly over access for Bulgarian agricultural products to community markets. Bulgaria is determined to receive the same treatment as Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, which concluded association agreements last year, and is also asking that wine, its number one agricultural export, be included in the terms. The urgent need for new markets is a prime reason for Bulgaria's strong stand in the EC talks. The country was heavily dependent on the now collapsed Soviet market, which accounted for about 65 per cent of its agricultural exports in the 1980s. Mr Rangel Trendafilov, an agro-economist who advises the Bulgarian government, believes the search for alternative markets is the sector's greatest long-term challenge. 'We need hard currency earnings but must also export because of our small domestic market, around 9m. There is little incentive to increase productivity if there is nowhere to send our goods.' However, in the short term, the sector faces more pressing problems while farmers struggle to set up on their own now that most state co-operatives, which controlled agriculture in the communist period, have been dismantled. Production has plummeted since 1989 with grain, maize, tobacco and sugar beet particularly hard hit, according to Ministry of Agriculture figures. The grain harvest has fallen from 10.2m tonnes in 1980 to an estimated 7.1m tonnes this year, while the sugar beet crop has dropped from 1.6m tonnes, sufficient to meet only 10 per cent of domestic demand. Nor are prospects for 1993 much better with autumn plantings well down on last year and continuing shortages of seed and fertilisers. Land reform, which has become a sensitive political issue, is a central problem. The socialists, the main opposition party, charge that the government, an anti-communist alliance, has put property restitution above all else. They believe the government, acting through so-called 'liquidation committees', broke up the co-operatives far too quickly because to its desire to return land to private ownership. Worse still, they say, the government had no new strategy to replace the old system, often with serious consequences. 'In my constituency, which had a stock-breeding industry, the liquidation of the co-operatives has led to the slaughter of thousands of animals,' says Ms Elena Poptodorova, a socialists MP. 'Those which survived were given to private households where there is no possibility for scientifically-controlled breeding. This policy has destroyed the genetic stocks which our scientists have been building up for years.' Moreover, while co-operatives have been disbanded, by the end of October only about 24 per cent of land had been redistributed, leaving much farm land unworked. Agriculture has also been set back by the division of land into small units. The land law allows for restitution up to 30 hectares (74 acres) per person but, according to Mr Trendafilov, there are relatively few claims of this size. Apart from in Dobrudga, a wheat region next to the Danube, small holdings, rarely more than five hectares, predominated in pre-communist Bulgaria. In addition, where there was previously one owner, there might now be several descendants, all with claims, leading to even smaller parcels of land. New landowners also face difficulties in raising capital to buy machinery, seed or fertiliser, previously provided by the co-operative. Houses can be used as collateral but with the base rate at 41 per cent, few can afford loans. The situation worries agro-economists and scientists, who fear much of the progress of the past two decades is under threat. 'Our intellectual and cultural attitude to agriculture is going backwards - it has become less scientific,' says Ms Slavka Bahchevanova, director of a small research institute in Sandanski, a tobacco and wine producing region in south west Bulgaria, close to the Greek border. With unemployment rising, especially in industry, many new landowners have moved back to the countryside. Most are unskilled workers with little practical experience of farming, she says. 'People aim to survive by living off the land and perhaps have a little left over to sell in local markets.' With such a system, Bulgaria is likely to have difficulty in reviving exports or sustaining profitable related industries such as wine and cigarette manufacturing. Vinprom, Sandanski's local state-owned wine company, could only find 5,000 tonnes of grapes to purchase this year, compared to 25,000 tonnes two years ago, and had to resort to selling stocks to meet demand. Agricultural workers in Sandanski, disappointed by the parliamentary groups, are putting their support behind a recently formed union of agrarian parties. 'We are looking for new markets,' a manager at Vinprom says,'but first, we need clearer government policies so that we can maintain output and preserve the quality of our products.'</p>

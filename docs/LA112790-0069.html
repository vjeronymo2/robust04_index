			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARY DUQUE DIES AFTER 40 YEARS WITH CHILDRENS HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Mary Duque, the indefatigable altruist who helped raise more than $100 million  for Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, died Sunday night. She was believed to be  87.  </P> <P> Michelle Barker, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Mrs. Duque died in her  sleep at her Hancock Park home.  </P> <P> For more than 40 years -- and at an average rate of nearly $3 million a year --  Mrs. Duque raised money so crippled children could learn to walk again and sick  children could return to their homes and classrooms.  </P> <P> Childrens Hospital, with its 331 beds, 30 outpatient clinics and various other  treatment programs, is considered the leading pediatric facility in the Western  United States. Founded in 1901, it has been affiliated with the USC School of  Medicine since 1932 and is the only pediatric trauma center in Southern  California.  </P> <P> During her time on the hospital's board of directors, beginning in 1947 and  culminating in her election to the board presidency in 1970 -- a post she still  held at her death -- Mrs. Duque expanded women's support groups to nearly 3,700  members serving in three dozen units in addition to the seven auxiliaries she  found when she arrived.  </P> <P> She personally pursued the purchase of the latest in medical equipment while  finding time to attend the baptisms and funerals of the hospital's staff and  their families, most of whom she considered friends.  </P> <P> She solicited funds from people ranging from those she barely knew to those she  had known since birth.  </P> <P> Her late brother, Harold McAlister, was responsible for a single gift valued at  $11 million.  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Call, chairman of the hospital board, on Monday remembered Mrs.  Duque as "a driving force behind the unprecedented growth of Childrens  Hospital. . . . Mary was a rare human being with a special capacity for giving  and a unique ability to inspire it in others."  </P> <P> H. Russell Smith, an industrialist and chairman emeritus of the hospital board,  described her simply as the "greatest giver of the opportunity to give by  others in the history of Los Angeles. She built Childrens Hospital."  </P> <P> Mrs. Duque (pronounced Du-kee), always skittish about her exact age, brought  toys to patients, helped bring the hospital back from the brink of bankruptcy  in 1980 and, almost until her death, visited the hospital daily.  </P> <P> In the mornings she greeted the nursing staff with "Good morning, darling  girls," and left at night saying "Goodby, darling girls."  </P> <P> Friends were in awe of her cheerful energy and said she spoke in "triplicate,"  saying "thank you, thank you, thank you" or "hello, hello, hello."  </P> <P> On Sept. 26, 1973, the main building at the hospital at Sunset Boulevard and  Vermont Avenue was named for her at a ceremony attended by hundreds of hospital  staff, friends and admirers. In 1984, a Mary Duque Emeritus Endowment was  started at the hospital, to honor its single greatest fund-raiser and to  support teaching and research activities among the hospital's department heads.  </P> <P> Born Mary McAlister to a banking family in St. Joseph, Mo., she came to Los  Angeles as an infant, attended Westlake and Marlborough schools and then UC  Berkeley and UCLA. She married attorney Gabriel C. Duque before graduating from  college and had two sons, Gabriel Jr., who died in 1977, and James.  </P> <P> Mrs. Duque had earned honorary degrees and several awards, among them selection  in 1951 as a Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year. In 1969 she became the first  recipient of the Dorothy Chandler Achievement Award given to former Times Women  of the Year who have risen to even greater heights in their volunteer or  professional careers.  </P> <P> Asked many years ago how she had managed to raise such an enormous amount of  money for a single cause, she disclaimed any special knowledge.  </P> <P> "If a child were lying injured in the street, everybody would rush to help,  wouldn't they?" she asked. "It's the same here. Everyone wants to help. I just  keep busy doing little things."  </P> <P> Besides her son, Mrs. Duque, a widow, is survived by eight grandchildren and  two great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers her family is asking contributions  to the Mary Duque Fund, Childrens Hospital, Box 29, 4650 Sunset Blvd., Los  Angeles 90027.  </P></p>

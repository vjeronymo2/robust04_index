			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / The charge of the pension brigade: As UK regulations come under scrutiny / A look at the pressures building over the Maxwell affair The sight of pensioners lobbying MPs at Westminster next Monday will be a graphic reminder of the hardship caused by the failure of schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell - and of the pensioners' expectation that the government should play some part in easing their plight. Since the election, the efforts of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners have become more urgent. An all-party group of MPs was set up last month and now numbers more than 100, including some ministers. The subject of pensions' safeguards is moving up the political agenda as the group steps up its activities: tomorrow it will meet to discuss how to exert pressure on banks to help bail out those who lost their life savings in Maxwell pension funds. ''Pensioner' is a very emotive word,' said Mr Richard Thomas, a director of Law Debenture Corporation, the independent trustee to the Maxwell Communication Corporation Pension Scheme. 'The role of government is to protect its most defenceless individuals.' More than 30,000 were left without immediate protection after Mr Maxwell disappeared over the side of his luxury yacht last November and auditors discovered Pounds 400m was missing from the total assets of Pounds 695m in pension schemes he controlled. Already, 240 members of one Leeds-based scheme have had their monthly pension cheques stopped, while 5,000 members of another scheme face a 70 per cent cut in benefits by next month. The five Maxwell company pension schemes have 32,710 members. Of these, 14,110 are already pensioners, highlighting the extent of the government's dilemma. The largest scheme, representing more than 12,000 present and former Mirror Group Newspaper employees, is being shored up by contributions from the employer. However, the scheme includes hundreds of members who worked for a separate Maxwell company, and Mirror Group has said it will not guarantee the pensions of those individuals. If any more Maxwell funds stop paying pensions at the end of this month, the government is likely to come under renewed pressure from the group of MPs. 'That is when it will get nasty and spill over on to the floor of the Commons,' said Labour MP Mr Frank Field, co-chairman of the all-party group. Ministers have so far rejected the group's plan for a 'drip feed' from the government to enable the schemes to continue paying while assets are pursued by independent trustees. The idea of a drip feed, put forward by Mr Richard Page, the Tory MP who co-chairs the group, was intended as a temporary measure until the assets could be located and the most pressing obligations (legal and moral) could be determined. Ministers are awaiting a report by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's regulatory watchdog, into the role played by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, in overseeing Bishopsgate Investment Management, Mr Maxwell's fund management company. Pensioners argue that Imro, and by extension the government, did not fulfil its regulatory duties with regard to BIM. It is alleged that BIM allowed securities belonging to the five Maxwell pension schemes to be 'loaned' to other Maxwell-related businesses. These were then used, it is alleged, by Mr Maxwell as collateral for loans from UK and international banks. 'There will be political pressure on the government to move very, very quickly once SIB is out,' Mr Page commented. 'It would be unwise not to be there ready with a statement, a position and a series of decisions.' MPs, however, are far from convinced that the government should pick up the entire bill - which could amount to Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m - to compensate Maxwell pensioners. What they do agree on is that the pensioners have a strong moral case for help from somewhere. Under the law they had no choice about where to invest their funds, or indeed whether to contribute to an occupational pension scheme at all. Until 1988, all employees were required to contribute to a pension scheme if an employer offered one. While the idea of a government-funded compensation scheme has not garnered wide support at Westminster, the government appears to have softened its position slightly. Miss Ann Widdecombe, a junior social security minister, said it would be 'irresponsible' for the government to consider such a fund before investigations into the disappearance of the missing Maxwell assets are complete - but she said nothing had been ruled out. As political pressure grows at Westminster, the group of 100 MPs is switching its focus from Whitehall to the City, and to the Bank of England in particular. They want the Bank to exert pressure on commercial banks to return some of the securities they received on behalf of Maxwell companies. Some ministers are joining forces with the pensioners' lobbyists to urge the banks to acknowledge their moral obligations. For their part, the banks say that they are studying the matter, but they point out that they accepted the securities in good faith and had no way of knowing that they were pension fund assets. Mr Field and Mr Page were encouraged when they saw Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, recently by his undertaking to pass on their criticisms to the Bank of England. Last week, Mr Page wrote to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, asking him to put pressure on the Bank to take a more active view of its supervisory role. The failure of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank, to acknowledge publicly that the Bank played a rather too passive role in the Maxwell affair is likely to result in some uncomfortable questions from the group of MPs. The Bank's reluctance to become involved in seeking a solution is also likely to raise some uneasy questions about City regulation in general. 'If the Bank steps back from this it is saying it has no role in regulating the City: it would be entirely wrong for the Bank to step back. This strikes at the fundamental core of how the City runs itself and the basis on which transactions take place,' said Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover and another leading member of the MPs' group. He said the entire structure of self-regulation in the City had been called into question, and described as 'profoundly unsatisfactory' the prospect of MPs shuttling about in taxis from one regulator to another in search of a single voice to speak for the City. His remarks echo the findings of the all-party social security committee of MPs in the last parliament. Its report on the Maxwell affair commented that the most striking result of months of hearings was that no single body or individual appeared to have full responsibility for monitoring pension fund activities. 'Pontius Pilate would have blushed at the spectacle of so many witnesses washing their hands in public before the committee of their responsibilities in this affair.' One of the main recommendations of the committee will now be implemented. Mr Lilley is about to announce a government review of pension law, although not specifically within the suggested nine-month timescale. The review will address the fundamental question of the status and ownership of pension funds, but is also set to include other select committee proposals such as: the appointment of independent custodian trustees to hold pension-fund assets, all with clearly designated ownership; the annual right of every pensioner to transfer his or her assets from a pension scheme to another recognised financial institution; and the right of pensioners and contributors to veto transfers of assets to another scheme. It is also likely to look at the concerns already voiced by Imro, about the difficulties of marrying trust law - the legal framework governing pension funds - and financial services legislation. The strengthening of the Occupational Pensions Board to police a new regime will also be considered. Now that a portion of the pensions industry has accepted that some sort of compensation fund is needed, one problem is the form the fund would take. The US, Japan and most European countries, including France and Germany, already have such funds. Setting one up in the UK would entail an overhaul of current pension law because the fund would insist that any scheme covered by it met minimum standards. Mr Brian McMahon, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, has called for scheme members to be eligible to apply to the Investors Compensation Scheme set up under the 1987 Financial Services Act. The ICS allows investors to receive up to Pounds 48,000 in total compensation - a paltry sum compared with the potential benefits lost when a pension scheme collapses. The NAPF has also embarked on a feasibility study of a separate compensation fund. This would be an additional safety net for pensioners whose schemes had failed without sufficient assets to meet all liabilities. One proposal is that it be funded by a levy on all UK pension schemes - an idea which has proved divisive. 'On the basis of my postbag, there isn't much support for it,' Mr McMahon said. 'The postbag tends to be from the larger schemes who say they run good schemes. They don't want to bail out the likes of Robert Maxwell.' Clearly, neither the government nor the industry wants to pay for a compensation fund. The government is waiting to assess exactly how much funding would be needed and to see whether the banks will return some of the securities received on behalf of Mr Maxwell. The industry, on the other hand, wants to reassure pension scheme members that their savings will not disappear if a company fails, but it does not want to underwrite pension fund abuse by an open-ended commitment to a compensation fund. Over the longer term the government review will be of immense significance for an industry that has operated in an almost unregulated environment. But it will do little for the Maxwell pensioners because they would be outside the scope of any future legislation. Mr Page compared their position with that of passengers on the Titanic, if they had known that its sinking would lead to new international regulations about lifeboats and safety at sea. 'I'm sure they would be delighted that in future people would have more protection, but they are bound to be concentrating on their own predicament.'</p>

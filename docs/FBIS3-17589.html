			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gleb Pavlovskiy, editor-in-chief of the VEK XX I </F> MIR -- The 20th Century and the World -- magazine, under the  "Urbi et Orbi" rubric: "Confession of a Versifier. The Author  of the Scandalous Document Thinks That Political Hysterics at  the Top Might Have Been Provoked by Anyone but Him"]    [Text] Yesterday OBSHCHAYA GAZETA named the author of the  ill-famed "Version No. 1." It turned out to be Gleb Pavlovskiy,  a well-known journalist. Today, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes  the full text of his article that the author appears to have  offered to his colleagues from OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. Mr. Pavlovskiy  brought it to the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA editorial board on the  evening of 24 March.    All last week I listened to the news with half an ear, did  not follow the press, and did not realize that the buzz of  familiar words about a "coup" had any bearing on a rough copy  marked "Version No. 1" that flew away from me. This is why the  latest issue of the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY weekly, with an interview  by Yuriy Baturin, presidential national security adviser, under  the icy heading/notification "A Search for an Anonymous Person  Is Under Way" first elicited astonishment, then made me laugh,  and finally worried me.    Who is it that they are searching for? I state with absolute  clarity that "Version No. 1" is a working text of which I am the  sole owner as the person who ordered it, a routine working  fact-sheet, a compilation of open data -- reports of news  agencies, primarily TASS, POSTFACTUM, and RIA, and also press,  radio reports, and so forth, of course, including city rumors.    The text is least of all a proclamation by a hidden  troublemaker. It is technical in nature, that is to say, it  cannot have any author in principle. It is an analytical  semi-finished information product prepared by various people  using a production-line method, not meant for publication at  all, a fact that can be deduced at least from the inscription  "Confidential" in the left-hand corner. Who of them is the  "anonymous person?" The man who reads the current press with a  pencil, tracking the crossings of names and dates? The man who  phoned information sources to find out whether so and so really  met with N. at 1700? A school girl who puts the texts produced  in the data base? Or I -- a customer who puts the following  question to that same data base: "What would a coherent coup  hypothesis look like if rumors about one (with which Moscow is  abuzz) are added to mass media reports?"    I did not order only one theory -- there are further  numbers,  too. Having ordered a string of data on key words "Yeltsin,  B.N./Conspiracy against/Removal/Duma/March/Contacts of  officials... (followed by names)/Pro Theory," I obtained a  summary of data confirming this suggestion. If I had ordered a  summary of counterarguments -- a contra theory -- I would have  received precisely that. Both require 15 minutes of work by the  data base operator, a number of clarifying phone calls from the  editorial board, and another half an hour (maximum!) to compile  all that into a coherent text.    But an editorial board is a communicating courtyard, and  editors' tables are not a place where anything should be left.  I do not know why someone took "Version No. 1" pages from my  table and why he or she did not take, say, "Version No. 3?" But  if someone is going to tell me that unconfirmed theories should  not be written on paper, I would laugh in his face -- how else  can they be checked, I wonder?    What is important is not who wrote what, but who distributed  something that was not written for him, where, and for what  purpose. Strangely enough, this frivolous question has not been  raised, but everyone is going out of one's way to peer over each  other's shoulder.    As far as I understand it, the government is going to find  me  and the data base operator to try us for libel on... what? On  an authorized list of key words? What seems to me as another  interesting idea is the limitation of the right to consider  theories (let me remind you that none of those involved in the  production of this paper ever intended to publish it. And even  if he did? An intention cannot be punished by law).    For the information of Mr. National Security Adviser, there  are dozens and dozens of places in the country -- apart from  coup plotters, madmen, spies, and financiers -- where people are  checking every single day yet again whether a military coup is  being prepared. Whether the president is in good health. With  whom the defense minister is meeting and what the hell the  troops are doing in the capital, and so on and so forth. This  is not column writing, this is the mulling over of theories,  this is what analysts and journalists are paid for, a work that  sometimes results in an article, sometimes in a memo that will  be thrown into a wastepaper basket upon being read. A version  is advanced, checked, rejected -- and forgotten. A new one  emerges.    The fact that citizens advance and discuss theories is  beyond the security services' competence. Those who do not want  to learn something unpleasant about themselves should not  rummage through other people's papers.    Under President Dwight Eisenhower, the U.S. Congress  officially banned analysts from considering military conflict  scenarios that envisioned the United States' capitulation. The  ban, booed by the analytic community, had an important  reservation, however: "in research financed from the government  budget." He who pays the piper calls the tune! No, our money  is not from the budget, so we can look into what we think fit.  The 1991 Belovezhskaya Forest coup, unfortunately, was not  preceded by the advancing and consideration of theories  envisioning such a possibility: The first and the last theory  was advanced unopposed to be immediately implemented.    The editorial paper stolen from me (I did not consider it  secret at all) was indeed distributed with lightning speed, as  it was repackaged into a semiofficial one. Naturally, I did not  give this memo to OBSHCHAYA GAZETA -- what for? Even though the  newspaper has the right to publish a document that has been put  in circulation by someone and has turned out to be the  centerpiece of a provocative game. The immediate dispatch of a  trivial text to dozens of addresses accompanied by giving it an  air of instruction and raising a bureaucratic tide that met it  exposes, in my view, the work of the Kremlin and the ears of  mass organizers specializing in "Da-Da-Net-Da" ["Yes-Yes-No-Yes"  -- reference to April 1993 referendum presidential slogan]. At  any rate, it is the bureaucrats who commented on the rough copy  as "a conspiracy," "an action of dark forces," and even "arson"  whom I consider to be the actual publishers and instigators of  the document in a shape that was arbitrarily imposed on it! The  mass media have done in this situation what they are supposed to  be doing -- they have done their best to exploit the sensation  that has suddenly come their way. They cannot and should not do  anything else. As for the fact that we were used once again --  well, eternal fools are to be taught till the end of time.    The "anonymous person" is the one who distributed the paper  in government corridors and has been maintaining -- or affecting  -- political hysteria at the top. I would recommend that  government investigators look for an "anonymous person" in their  own offices. That is my theory.    Finally, I offer my apologies to those people to whom this  incident has brought trouble, including official trouble.  Still, it is not I who is the source of the trouble, but their  official colleagues who were stupid enough or thought it  advantageous to present a private memo as a document "concerning  all." But by issuing "Version No. 1400," B.N. Yeltsin has  caused the country much greater trepidations. How about an  investigation?</p>

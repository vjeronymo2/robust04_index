			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Sterling Sterling's periodic bouts of weakness in the past couple of days, which took it down to DM2.4050 at one stage yesterday, suggest it is becoming caught up in UK interest rate fever. On the surface this looks odd. A competitive exchange rate and economic recovery in the UK's leading export markets should not add up to balance of payments problems. The economy is growing nicely and though there are some signs of future inflation, they are as yet a matter of nuance. There is little tangible evidence that price rises are already accelerating. Yet the exchange market would have grounds for concern if the authorities botch the turn in interest rates. Poor demand from domestic institutions for this week's gilts auction is a stark reminder that the government needs foreign capital to cover its deficit. That means maintaining sterling's attraction, and by some yardsticks short-term rates are unnaturally low. Three-month interest rates on D-Marks and sterling are roughly level, but on average over the past 20 years sterling rates have been some 4 percentage points higher. The UK's progress in curbing inflation may be commendable but it is surely not enough to eliminate this premium altogether. The Bank of England's inflation report next Tuesday will provide another insight into inflationary expectations. If it paints a gloomy picture, the exchange market may demand interest rate action sooner rather than later.</p>

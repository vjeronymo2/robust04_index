			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Japan The failure of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition to carry the day on political reform might have been expected to send the yen lower. Whether or not a general election now follows, the promised package of economic stimulus measures will almost certainly be postponed. That can only be bad for Japan's growth prospects, and makes another cut in interest rates more likely. The strength of the Japanese currency in the face of these arguments stems from worries over trade. Yesterday's trade figures are a reminder that Japan's current account surplus is still growing in dollar terms. That creates a natural demand for yen which is not being offset by Japanese buying of overseas financial assets. More importantly, if Japan cannot deliver a fiscal stimulus to get its economy moving, the US might again be tempted to talk the yen higher as a way of tackling trade. With Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, visiting Tokyo this weekend - and a meeting between heads of government still scheduled for next month - much now depends on the US response. But using the exchange rate as a trade weapon could easily backfire. If Japanese industry is lumbered with an unfavourable exchange rate and deprived of a fiscal package, the outlook for growth would be bleak. Managing the trade surplus lower would then be doubly hard.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: SNP hopes to coast on to win Smith seat The Scottish National party was yesterday celebrating what it called a historic breakthrough. It now hopes that a bandwagon effect will carry it to victory on June 30 in the Monklands East by-election caused by the death of John Smith, who had a majority over the nationalists of 15,712. The SNP took the North East Scotland seat in the European parliament from Labour with an impressive majority and substantially increased its majority in the Highlands and Islands. It won 32.6 per cent of the vote in the eight Scottish Euro-constituencies, its highest share ever, crossing the 30 per cent threshold above which it can expect to win parliamentary seats at Westminster in growing numbers. Its share exceeded the 30.4 per cent it gained in the October 1974 general election when it sent 11 MPs to Westminster. The party hailed the two wins, which were complemented by robust performances in the six Scottish seats which Labour held, as 'a staging post on the way to independence'. In North East Scotland the SNP candidate, Mr Allan Macartney, achieved a majority of 31,227 over Labour's Mr Henry McCubbin, who had beaten him in 1989 by 2,613 votes. Mr Ron Harris, the Conservative candidate, came third with 40,372 votes. In 1989 the three parties' shares of the vote were within 4 percentage points of each other. This time the SNP won votes from people who voted Tory in 1989, as well as picking up some votes from Labour. The result will particularly worry the Tories, who hold three of the Westminster seats in the Euro-constituency. In the Highlands and Islands constituency Mrs Winnie Ewing, the veteran SNP MEP, increased her majority from 44,695 to 54,916, taking 58.37 per cent of the vote. Mr Michael Macmillan, the Labour candidate, pushed Mr Mark Tennant, the Conservative candidate, into third place. Both there and in North East Scotland the Liberal Democrat candidate was fourth. The SNP came second in five of the six other Scottish Euro-seats, only being narrowly beaten into third place by the Tory candidate in South of Scotland. Its 32.6 per cent share of the Scottish vote compared with 25.5 per cent in 1989. Labour took 42.5 per cent (41.9 per cent), the Conservatives 14.5 per cent (20.9 per cent) and the Liberal Democrats 7.2 per cent (4.3 per cent). Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said: 'The North East result is a decisive victory in the seat that Labour themselves called the cockpit of the election in Scotland. 'This is a disaster for the Tories - they held this seat five years ago, and now they are humiliated. The Tories' days of running Scotland on an English majority are numbered.' The SNP will tomorrow name its candidate for Monklands East.</p>

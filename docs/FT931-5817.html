			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Clearer message is demanded: Michael Cassell explains why industrialists have become dissatisfied with ministers' policies -  Spring Budget BRITISH industry is usually quick to cut through the verbiage wrapped around the chancellor's Budget proposals in search of specifics. This time, however, given the tight constraints imposed by a rocketing deficit, Mr Norman Lamont's language will have to count for a lot. Expectations of fiscal help for industry are modest although the business community has been encouraged by the government to prepare for a package targeted towards helping the process of industrial recovery. Before Christmas, Mr John Major, the prime minister, committed Mr Lamont to a package intended to raise manufacturing output. This week again, Mr Major hinted that small businesses, with their potential for job creation, would be among the main beneficiaries of any tax concessions. Having raised expectations, the government can expect little sympathy if it fails to deliver. Business leaders have become irritated and frustrated with ministerial pleas for patience and pledges of 'good times just around the corner'. They want details of a policy framework to restore investment, jobs and confidence and they want them next week. 'There remains a huge gap in understanding,' according to Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. 'The government has still not explained what it means by a policy for growth and recovery. 'Half the world thinks we are now hooked on a policy of competitive devaluation, which is dangerous and could be self-fulfilling. We want to hear ministers say revival must be heavily based on production, exports and investment, not on consumption. It has to be set out. They must say it.' Industrialists don't want tax increases, but they believe the government must provide some indication as to how additional revenues will be raised, possibly for enactment in the December Budget. Higher corporate taxes are ruled out as economic madness. Increases in personal taxation, by extending the value added tax net, are portrayed not just as a breach of faith. They are also painted as a potential broadside into a floundering economy which must expand if the public sector borrowing requirement is to be cut significantly. But with early VAT changes on the cards, some comfort is being drawn from the suggestion that an element of the additional revenue could be employed to promote investment, recovery and exports. Beyond its wider strategic concerns, industry inevitably has its shopping list of proposals, including further carefully targeted tax incentives to boost manufacturing investment, which is set to decline in 1993 for the fourth consecutive year. Following the temporary enhancement of capital allowances on investment included in the Autumn Statement, there are calls from organisations such as the Engineering Employers' Federation for them to be extended permanently to 100 per cent. The Institute of Directors prefers to concentrate on corporation tax cuts while the CBI wants last autumn's improvements in allowances to be extended for a further period. There is general agreement that the government, having acknowledged the need for changes to advance corporation tax - which encourages companies with UK headquarters to shift investment overseas - must now grasp the nettle. Relief from an unfair burden is demanded and the chancellor will win no friends if he avoids the issue again. Industry also wants lower capital gains taxes. The IoD believes the time is ripe for 'drastic reductions' in a tax which limits availability of vital venture capital. There is also pressure on the government to design a replacement for the expiring Business Expansion Scheme. Cuts in inheritance taxes and a freeze of the uniform business rate, still regarded as a slap in the face for struggling small businesses, are also on the list. Hopes are high of more help for exporters, who have complained that expensive and limited export credit cover is putting at risk jobs and overseas sales. The strictures on cover have been held up as a classic case of government doublespeak in which the Department of Trade and Industry exhorts companies to trade abroad whilst ECGD cover remains costly and elusive. Rates are currently being reviewed. According to Mr Davies: 'The current position is absurd. We should have the lowest export export credit rates because export trade is so vital to us. We cannot even get cover in countries like Argentina, which is privatising like mad and is crying out for experience like ours'.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> As one who suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (now called Chronic Fatigue  Immune Dysfunction Syndrome), I very much appreciated the two recent episodes  of NBC's "The Golden Girls" that dealt with this baffling and debilitating  ailment. The shows did not exaggerate the enormous frustration of trudging from  doctor to doctor only to be told, "It's all in your head," or dismissed  altogether.  </P> <P> Susan G.

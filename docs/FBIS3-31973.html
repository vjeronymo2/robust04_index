Gasoline prices are hereby frozen until 31 May 1994. From  that date onward, fuel prices will be adjusted monthly,  considering only the sliding exchange rate, except when  international oil prices exceed $17 a barrel.    2. Diesel fuel prices will remain frozen at a national  average price of 7.15 cordobas a gallon until 30 April 1994.    3. An in bond [preceding words in English] store is hereby  authorized for the importation of tires, spares, and other  supplies for the exclusive use of cooperative transportation  sectors so that, in accordance with Article 74 of the General  Law of Cooperatives, they can benefit from tax exonerations  established therein; exceptions to this are stipulations under  Chapter 27 of the SAC [Central American Tariff System].    4. The value added tax for local purchases of goods and  services by legally registered transportation cooperatives will  be reimbursed, beginning 1 March 1994.    5. Within the framework of the development of transportation  enterprise cooperatives properly registered with the MCT  [Constuction and Transportation Ministry] to this date, the  government will provide a revolving fund, via the appropriate  institution, to retain an annual market of 10 million cordobas,  endeavoring to obtain the lowest possible interest rate.    6. Commercial passenger and cargo trucks, as well as taxi  drivers with operating vehicles, organized under legally  registered cooperatives will receive a coupon worth 1.28  cordobas for a gallon of gasoline up to a maximum of six gallons  a day. This coupon system will be effective between 30 January  to 30 April 1994. This coupon will be handled according to the  September 1993 agreements.    7. It goes on record that there will be no additional  charges  to those currently established under Decree 62-93 for license  plates, driving licenses, and others. The Presidency will be  requested to issue a new decree to this effect, which in effect  will repeal Decree 62-93.    8. It has been agreed to appoint a commission to create the  National Land Transportation Council [Consejo Nacional de  Transporte Terrestre].    9. A review of the agreements signed in September 1993 will  take place via work commissions for each case; likewise, the MCT  communique dated 27 April 1993 will be implemented.    10. By 15 February 1994, and after studying Central American  costs, a meeting will be held with the mayors' financial  commission of the directors for the Nicaraguan Institute for  Municipal Development [Instituto Nicaraguense de Fomento  Municipal], Imifom, the Finance Ministry, and transportation  representative organizations to discuss the 1994 road tax and  methods of payment for the cargo and passenger transportation  sector. Imifom will summon a meeting for this.    11. Once this agreement is signed, the transportation  organization representatives pledge to immediately suspend the  national transportation strike.    12. At the request of the transportation organization  representatives, signatories of this act of agreement, all those  who have been arrested for their involvement in the events  linked to the transportation strike were freed, without  detriment to the corresponding procedural investigation.

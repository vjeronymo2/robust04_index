			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO EXTEND CONSERVANCY TO 1995 APPROVED BY LEGISLATURE  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy would be given a new lease on life under  a bill that passed the Legislature on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The measure, which the Assembly approved by a 59-14 margin and sent to Gov.  George Deukmejian, would extend until 1995 the life of the agency, which buys  parkland in the mountains surrounding the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The agency has acquired 10,000 acres of parkland since it was established in  1979. It is due to go out of business in July.  </P> <P> Sponsoring Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) said he was optimistic about  Deukmejian signing the measure into law.  </P> <P> "I think he will. I'm hoping he will," said Rosenthal, whose 22nd District  includes parts of Encino, Sherman Oaks, Tarzana and Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looked Upon More Favorably  </P> <P> Rosenthal said he is optimistic partly because the agency in recent years has  been looked upon more favorably by Republican legislators. Westside Democrats  have championed similar proposals on the Assembly floor, but this year Pat  Nolan (R-Glendale) handled the measure for Rosenthal in the Assembly.  </P> <P> Last year, voters approved a park and wildlife bond issue that set aside $30  million of the $776 million total for the conservancy.  </P> <P> Rosenthal cited the funds set aside by the bond issue as a major reason that he  was supporting the conservancy extension. He said that at least until the funds  are spent the conservancy should be given extra time to finish its business.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KREMLIN TRIES TO BLOCK LITHUANIA;  </P> <P> SECESSION: SOVIET PREMIER MOVES TO STOP REBELLIOUS REPUBLIC FROM DISENGAGING  ITS ECONOMY FROM NATION'S.  </P> <P> The Soviet government, acting under orders from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,  moved Monday to assert its authority in Lithuania and prevent the small Baltic  republic from implementing plans to secede from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov instructed central government ministries,  including the KGB, the Soviet security agency, to act immediately to stop  Lithuania from carrying out a program that would disengage the republic's  economy from that of the Soviet Union as a whole.  </P> <P> Ryzhkov, in his order broadcast Monday evening on radio and television, told  his ministers to assume direct management immediately of all centrally owned or  operated enterprises in Lithuania and not to enter into any negotiations with  Lithuanian authorities about their takeover.  </P> <P> He ordered the Interior Ministry and the KGB to prevent Lithuania from  establishing its own customs system and thus controlling trade between it and  the rest of the Soviet Union. Other steps will be taken to prevent the republic  from creating its own banking system and issuing its own currency.  </P> <P> The order also calls for "radically increased" security around a nuclear power  station and "other vital installations that are federal property," and this  seemed likely to bring the deployment of large numbers of police and troops  around Lithuania to guard key facilities.  </P> <P> With tensions continuing to escalate between Lithuania and Moscow, the central  government's moves were its first to counter Lithuania's declaration of  independence last week, and the official news agency Tass implied that further  measures would be taken if necessary to halt the planned secession.  </P> <P> But Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis replied in Vilnius, the  republic's capital, that for all the harshness of Moscow's statements, which  condemned Lithuania for "crude violations of constitutional norms" and damage  to the Soviet Union's interests, the move was probably "an introductory stage  of negotiations."  </P> <P> The differences between Lithuania and the Soviet government, Landsbergis said,  should and could be resolved through negotiations. In any event, he added,  Lithuania wants to maintain its economic ties with the rest of the Soviet Union  but put them on a fairer footing.  </P> <P> Lithuania's Parliament voted overwhelmingly March 13 to re-establish the  independence it had from 1918, following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia,  until it was forcibly incorporated by the Soviet Union in 1940, along with its  neighbors, Estonia and Latvia.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, while strongly opposed to Lithuania's secession, has called for a  "respectful dialogue" between Moscow and the republic with the hope that  through this means, the Soviet Union can be transformed into a truly federal  state. But failure to do so quickly will probably bring the secession of not  only Lithuania but other restive republics.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, decided Monday to put on its  immediate agenda a bill that sets out the methods and requirements for  secession by a constituent Soviet republic -- there are 15, including the  Russian Federation, the largest.  </P> <P> As drafted, the bill would require popular approval in a referendum, extensive  negotiations between the republic, the central government and neighboring  republics, and finally, approval by the Congress of People's Deputies, the  national Parliament. All that would be followed by perhaps a five-year delay to  ensure a smooth transition.  </P> <P> A government statement, signed by Prime Minister Ryzhkov, was both conciliatory  and accusatory. It said that Moscow views "with understanding the problems of  political, social, economic, cultural and ethnic development" in Lithuania and  respects "the striving of its people to strengthen the sovereignty of the  republic and renovate its society."  </P> <P> But it also accused the Lithuanian leadership of planning to turn over  state-owned factories to private entrepreneurs, to issue its own currency and  to establish customs posts on the republic's borders. All these are elements in  the economic development plans that members of Sajudis, the Lithuanian  nationalist movement, have proposed, although action depends on the republic's  legislature.  </P> <P> Lithuania's efforts to "undermine its links" with the rest of the Soviet Union  would have "pernicious consequences" for the whole national economy, the  government said in the statement, declaring its determination to protect the  economy.  </P> <P> Although most of Monday's measures were protective, described as intended to  ensure smooth functioning of the economy, their purpose was clearly to prevent  Lithuania from taking control of its whole economy and to uphold the authority  of the central government.  </P> <P> Ceslovas Iskauskas, a commentator on Lithuanian Television, denounced the  statement in a Vilnius broadcast.  </P> <P> "Such a big superpower is simply violating the constitutional law of a  sovereign republic," he said. "It is intimidation."  </P> <P> Lithuania had sent a six-member delegation to Moscow with a letter from  Landsbergis to Gorbachev replying to a resolution by the Congress of People's  Deputies last week declaring "invalid and illegal" Lithuania's proclamation  "re-establishing" its independence.  </P> <P> "We were made to understand that some sort of measures would be introduced,"  Egidius Bichkauskas, a lawyer and former Communist Party member who headed the  delegation, said after the meeting. "No one is panicking. We had to expect  this. . . . It is a warning, an attempt to put pressure on us. . . .  </P> <P> "We do not rule out that some limited contingent (of soldiers) could be sent,  but the reason given will be to safeguard the situation."  </P> <P> On Sunday, Soviet warplanes buzzed Vilnius in what many Lithuanians consider an  attempt at intimidation, and troops conducted maneuvers in the countryside in  several areas of Lithuania.  </P> <P> Gennady I. Gerasimov, chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said in  Moscow that the operations were not extensive and had been planned long in  advance.  </P> <P> But Landsbergis told Lithuanian legislators that the exercises had added to  tensions with Moscow and that he has asked local commanders to notify his  government well in advance of future maneuvers and to avoid "any coincidence  with political developments."  </P> <P> Many Lithuanians say they expect Moscow to impose an economic blockade,  depriving the republic of the fuel and raw materials that it receives only from  the Soviet Union if it proceeds with its plans for independence. But the  government statement contained no such threats and, on the contrary, emphasized  Moscow's desire to maintain present economic ties.  </P> <P> En route to Africa, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is due to meet  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze during Namibia's independence  celebrations today, said he would raise the Lithuania dispute.  </P> <P> In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Bush  Administration is "monitoring" the situation in Lithuania and repeated Bush's  desire to see negotiations take place between Lithuania and Moscow.  </P> <P> But Fitzwater declined to comment more specifically on the Soviet military  maneuvers.  </P> <P> "We don't want to say anything that would tend to exacerbate problems or  attitudes on either side," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> The Administration continues to withhold recognition of Lithuania's  independence. U.S. recognition must await the point at which the Lithuanians  are "in control of their territory," Fitzwater said, repeating a statement  President Bush made last week.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, worried about the spread of separatist feeling to the other two  Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia, also met Estonian President Arnold  Ruutel and other members of the local Communist Party leadership here on  Monday.  </P> <P> Participants in the meeting had agreed on "the need for prompt decisions to  give a clear and full answer on the content of a renewed federation and  independence of republican parties," Tass reported later.  </P> <P> The Estonian Popular Front appeared to be headed for victory in the republic's  parliamentary elections last week, but final results are not due for several  days because of the republic's complicated voting system.  </P> <P> In Latvia, candidates backed by the Latvian Popular Front have secured 120 of  the 170 seats decided in Sunday's first-round elections in the republic, and  the movement still hopes to win enough seats in the second round to give it the  two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution -- and secede. The  republic's Parliament has a total of 201 seats.  </P> <P> Free-lance journalist Esther Schrader in Vilnius contributed to this story.  </P></p>

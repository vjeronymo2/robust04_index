			<p>BFN     [Text] The trade unions delegation participating in  negotiations with the government withdrew at around 0100 this  morning from discussions, assessing that the communique of the  government spokesman is insulting for the trade unions.    After midnight, a protocol was concluded with the Free Trade  Unions in the field of education, which is affiliated to the  CNSRL [National Confederation of Free Unions in Romania]-Fratia  and with the Autonomous Trade Unions Federation in the  Pre-University Education, which is affiliated to the National  Trade Union Bloc. The protocol refers to the claim of  supplementing the education budget.    Likewise, at that hour, a memorandum on negotiations  regarding the ways to find solutions to the four claims of the  Alfa Cartel was in the process of finalization.    Our correspondent at the government headquarters informed us  that after the trade union representatives had withdrawn from  negotiations, at around 0215, the commander of the Bucharest  Police, Major General Nicolae Nitu, called on demonstrators to  clear Victoria Square and have busses and trade unions members  move to the Aviatorilor Square. After a series of discussions,  at around 0300 local time, the shield bearers who were  positioned in Victoria Square also withdrew while trade union  groups got in the cars that are at this hour still parked in  front of the government headquarters.    In a statement made last night to our radio station, Mr.  Bogdan Hosu, leader of Alfa Cartel, expressed his hope that  discussions with the government side will continue in order to  finalize the negotiations that have been held for over two days.    In turn, Mr. Octavian Partenie, special representative of  the  government for relations with trade unions and employers'  associations, reviewed the major points discussed with the trade  unions and mentioned that the sides jointly agreed that by next  Wednesday a mediation meeting will take place with the  participation of the prime minister.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED SOX ARE GETTING A HEEP OF DANNY'S HITS  </P> <P> Guess who is getting two and three hits per game for one of the best hitting  teams in baseball, the Boston Red Sox. Danny Heep.  </P> <P> Heep was one of the Dodgers' leading hitters in spring training last year, but  when the bell rang, Tommy Lasorda benched him. Then when all other Dodger  outfielders went down with injuries, Lasorda had no other choice, so for a  month Heep was the regular right fielder and among the team's leading hitters.  </P> <P> When Lasorda's beloved .200 hitters recovered from injuries, he benched Heep  again and counted the minutes until Heep would be released at the end of the  season.  </P> <P> The moral is clear: Lasorda has patience galore with .200 hitters, but if you  hit .350 it's so long, farewell, goodby.  </P> <P> H.

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: East Asiatic posts loss of DKr1.18bn THE EAST Asiatic Company, the shipping and international trading group, faces an urgent need to cut debt and restructure its capital this year, according to Mr Michael Fiorini, chief executive, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The company fell into the red last year with a loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars 184m), compared with a profit of DKr245m in the previous 12 months. The loss cuts EAC's equity capital to DKr1.75bn last year, from DKr3.14bn in 1991. EAC will not pay a dividend this year after a 9 per cent pay-out in 1991. The group made a primary operating loss of DKr55m, compared with a profit of DKr506m in 1991, although sales increased to DKr17.30bn from DKr15.63bn. After net financial expenditure, which increased to DKr615m from DKr99m, a profit of DKr281m in 1991 was turned into a loss of DKr813m. The final net loss figure was arrived atreached after income from disposals and write-offs, and loss provisions for businesses that have been or will be discontinued. The group's result in the current year would remain unsatisfactory, said the annual report, 'but the plans which have been made . . . should ensure that EAC will strengthen its financial position in the course of 1993'.</p>

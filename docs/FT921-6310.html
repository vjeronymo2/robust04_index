			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / The Property Market: A moving story for big business The blandishments of business park developers are at their most seductive on wet, grimy days in London, when the trains are delayed and escalators on the London Underground are out of action. 'When you look at our cities today, isn't it sensible to be on the outside looking in, rather than on the inside struggling to get out?' says Arlington, one of the largest business park developers in Britain and a subsidiary of British Aerospace. Glossy brochures depict well-groomed executives enjoying a sunlit world of landscaped offices, 'trim trails' and recreation centres, free from the hassles of conurbations. With some 10m square feet of business park space let throughout the UK each year, the message has clearly made its mark. However, the theory is often better than the practice. Debenham Tewson Research, a property adviser which has examined the joys and woes of business park tenants, found that many missed the shopping, leisure facilities and access to public transport to be found in cities. Even Stockley Park near Heathrow, probably the best business park in the UK, inspires mixed feelings. Its tenants wax lyrical about the park's proximity to Heathrow, a mere 10 minutes away, and the peacefulness and architectural splendour of the landscaped white pavilions in which they work. However, the park has only a handful of shops. And driving to the high streets of nearby Uxbridge or West Drayton is time-consuming and fraught with parking difficulties. 'It makes it very difficult if you are trying to run a home as well as work,' says an employee of BP Exploration which moved to Stockley last summer. Many business parks are relatively isolated and lack access to good public transport. Tenants are therefore dependent on cars; this can be tiresome as it commits people to using the surrounding network of motorways. Visitors to isolated parks also encounter transport problems. They are frequently stranded at the local railway station. Bus services are slow and it is often difficult to catch a taxi. Visitors arriving at Heathrow airport find it difficult to persuade taxi drivers to give up their place in the lengthy taxi queue for a mere 10-minute journey to the park. The environmental credentials of business parks are often exaggerated, say critics. Business parks promote car use, are situated in pleasant countryside and undermine the vitality of cities. The extra congestion caused by business parks, particularly in the south-east, is prompting some planning authorities consider restrictions on the parking provisions of the parks. The switch away from 'the great car society', the tightening of planning rules and tenants' dissatisfaction with their relative isolation may change the nature of business parks. A couple of urban parks that can plug into a town's public transport system have been proposed. And developers are talking about 'fourth generation parks' large enough to attract the ancillary amenities needed to satisfy former city-based office workers. The case against the present generation of business parks is one point that emerges from a relocation survey carried out by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Markheath, a property developer. Most companies that wished to relocate preferred town centres to out-of-town office parks, primarily because of the availability of public transport. Access to public transport was regarded as very important by 72 per cent of respondents and only 2 per cent felt it was unimportant. Some 75 per cent of respondents thought that an out-of-town office park location was not important. 'The need to be on the public transport network and close to shopping and leisure facilities would seem to be more important to firms than an efficient and isolated business environment,' said the report. But even if business parks appeal to a minority of companies, they take a share of a very large market. The London Chamber of Commerce survey found that 15 per cent of the capital's 1,000 largest companies were planning to move out of central London within the next three years. The average relocation involved about 200 employees, the report stated, meaning a potential loss of some 29,000 jobs in London mostly within the next 18 months. About two-thirds of the 145 companies intending to relocate want to stay within the south-east and nearly half of them want to move within the M25 area. The south-east is preferred because of its pool of skilled labour, easy access to the region, and the presence of other related businesses. The most common reason for relocating was the inadequacy of companies' existing premises. The need to rationalise their operations and bring staff together from scattered buildings vied with the need to cut overheads - such as rents and rates - as the next most common reason for relocation. Only four companies cited the level of wages in London as a factor in deciding to relocate. One telecommunications company said the rent it was paying on premises in the City to accommodate 25 people was almost as much as the amount paid for an outer London site housing 300 staff. The relative unimportance of high London wages as a factor in relocating was surprising, the survey stated. In fact, the impact of a London weighting of Pounds 3,000 was equivalent to a cost difference of between Pounds 15 and Pounds 20 per sq ft of office space. Dissatisfaction with London - mainly its inefficient transport system, overcrowding and, curiously, poor staff morale - was also cited as a reason to move away. Most of the relocations revealed by the survey were conceived at the height of the property price boom in the late 1980s. Since then recession and the fall in property prices have blunted the drive to move out of London, the report states. Copies of the report Moving Out are available for Pounds 10 from Markheath, Markheath House, 31 St George Street, London W1R 9SA.</p>

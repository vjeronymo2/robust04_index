			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Diversification helps Polypipe advance 16% Polypipe, the Doncaster-based manufacturer of industrial and commercial plastic pipes and fittings and other domestic plastic products, yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 7.45m. The profit improvement came on turnover which grew by 23.6 per cent to Pounds 60.8m (Pounds 49.2m) in the six months to December 31 including a full 6-month contribution from Allerton Glass which was acquired last May and merged with GCA Windows. Earnings per share advanced by 15 per cent to 3.2p (2.78p) and the interim dividend is being raised by 7.6 per cent to 0.71p (0.66p). Polypipe's shares closed 2p higher at 175p. Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, said the results reflected 'the continuing strength of both the group and its operations and the continuation of our strategy of expanding wherever possible each of our businesses, investing in plant and tooling and extensive product development.' The latest figures also highlight the success of the group's diversification since 1990 into non-core products by broadening its operating base while remaining in the fields of plastics extrusion and moulding. Sales of the group's other domestic plastic products, which now include bathroom fixtures, windows and garden furniture, advanced by 35 per cent to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 20.9m) while operating profits from these activities grew by more than 50 per cent, from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.91m. Overall operating profits increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 7.48m (Pounds 6.54m) despite relatively large increases in the purchase price of PVC which affect Polypipe's sales of above and below ground drainage systems. PVC prices have increased by 17 per cent since January last year. Since then Polypipe has increased its product prices twice. Mr Bryan Stock, finance director, said the higher PVC prices trimmed pipe margins in the first half by between 1.7 and 1.8 percentage points but added that margins should be mostly restored in the second half. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 29,000 (Pounds 132,000) and the group again ended the period with net cash and nil gearing. Capital expenditure in the first half totalled Pounds 7.69m (Pounds 4.96m.)</p>

or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The vessel intends to sail directly to another port that is no farther than 12 hours sailing time for the vessel concerned, for the purpose of loading more ferrous metal in bulk or to completely off-load the ferrous metal, and the temperature of the ferrous metal is less than 88 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (190 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) and has shown a downward trend for at least eight hours after the completion of loading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The master of a vessel that is loading or transporting a ferrous metal shall ensure that the temperature of the ferrous metal is taken_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Before loading;

and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) After loading, in each hold, at least every twenty-four hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) During loading, if the temperature of the ferrous metal in a hold is 93 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (200 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) or higher, the master or person in charge of the vessel shall notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port and suspend loading until the Captain of the Port is satisfied that the temperature of the ferrous metal is 88 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (190 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) After loading ferrous metal_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the temperature of the ferrous metal is 65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (150 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) or above, the master shall notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, and ensure that the vessel remains in the port area until the Captain of the Port is satisfied that the conditions of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section are met;

 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The most recent temperature taken;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The length of time that the temperature has been above 65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (150 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) and the rate of rise, if any;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The port where the ferrous metal was loaded and the destination of the ferrous metal;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The last port of call of the vessel and its next port of call;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) What action has been taken; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Whether any other cargo is endangered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;148.265  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Fish meal or fish scrap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (a) This part does not apply to fish meal or fish scrap that contains less than 5% moisture by weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Fish meal or fish scrap may contain not more than 12% moisture by weight and not more than 15% fat by weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) At the time of production, fish meal or fish scrap must be treated with an effective antioxidant (at least 400 mg/kg (ppm) ethoxyquin or at least 1000 mg/kg (ppm) butylated hydroxytoluene).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Shipment of the fish meal or fish scrap must take place not more than 12 months after the treatment prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Fish meal or fish scrap must contain at least 100 mg/kg (ppm) antioxidant at the time of shipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) At the time of loading, the temperature of the fish meal or fish scrap to be loaded may not exceed 35 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (95 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F), or 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (8 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) above the ambient temperature, whichever is higher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) For each shipment of fish meal or fish scrap, the shipper shall provide the master with a written certification that states_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Total weight of the shipment;

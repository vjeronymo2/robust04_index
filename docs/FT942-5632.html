			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Treasury to raise Pounds 1bn-plus in sale of company debt The UK Treasury plans to raise between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn this summer through the sale of bonds issued by privatised companies, including British Telecommunications, the power generators and regional electricity distributors. Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank acting for the Treasury, said yesterday that the privatised companies were being offered the first chance to buy back their debt. The companies have been asked to submit indicative bids for the debt by June 17, after which the Treasury will draw up a list of the bonds to be offered for sale. Investment banks will also be offered the chance to indicate the price at which they feel they can sell the debt to outside investors. The Treasury hopes this element of competition will maximise the return to the UK taxpayer. The Treasury still holds about Pounds 2.75bn of debt from former nationalised industries, about half of which was issued by BT. This summer's sale of debt forms part of the Pounds 5.5bn privatisation programme for 1994-95. The programme, announced in last November's Budget, includes receipt of final payments for BT3 shares and the sale of remaining stakes in the generators. Salomon said recent turmoil in bond markets had not affected the ability of companies to issue sterling denominated debt in the primary markets. City economists said the sale was likely to succeed because of the quality of the companies - BT and National Grid, for instance, have AAA ratings, the highest possible. But Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, cautioned: 'The price of almost all debt and equity instruments has fallen and it might not go as well as previous debt sales.' Salomon said the privatised companies had expressed considerable interest in buying back their debt. In April, Eastern Electricity bought back debt with a face value of Pounds 118m for Pounds 145m. The companies will also have the option of converting the bonds, issued at interest rates of around 12.5 per cent, into debt at current market rates. The high coupons on the outstanding bonds mean that the Treasury expects to sell them at 10-20 per cent above their face value. Lex, Page 18</p>

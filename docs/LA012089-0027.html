			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDANT IN PORT FRAUD MISSES ARRAIGNMENT  </P> <P> An arrest warrant was issued Thursday for a San Ysidro man who failed to show  up for his arraignment in a much-publicized fraud case involving the San Diego  Unified Port District.  </P> <P> Arnoldo Olivarria-Castillo, 54, is in Mexico, and his attorney, Jan Ronis, said  in court that he has not heard from him since the grand-theft charges were  filed Jan. 12. Last week, Ronis said Castillo was on vacation in Mexico, but  Thursday afternoon he said he still had not heard from him.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick issued the warrant.  </P> <P> Castillo was a sales representative for the Genuine Auto Parts/Napa store  downtown, which allegedly provided phony invoices to the Port District. The  invoices sought payment for merchandise never delivered to the district.  Instead, prosecutors claim, the invoices were used to mask the purchase of  private items for Port employees and their friends, items such as car repairs  and stereos.  </P> <P> Also charged are two former Port workers -- Rudi Enriques, 37, and Richard  Cersosimo, 48 -- and Paul Manes, 49. Manes worked for the auto parts store.  </P> <P> The other three men will be arraigned Feb. 2.  </P></p>

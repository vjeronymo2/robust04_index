			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning of end to Civil Service A BILL that would enable public-service departments to develop their own strategies on pay, grading and general conditions could mean 'the end of a national Civil Service', a Labour backbencher warned MPs in the Commons yesterday. Implementation of the proposed measure - the Civil Service (Management Functions) Bill - would lead to the replacement of a national service by 'a conglomeration of agencies' subject to different conditions, Mr John Garrett, MP for Norwich South, maintained. He was responding to remarks made by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister for public service. Introducing the bill for its second Commons reading, Mr Waldegrave said it was 'modest in scope' but would dismantle a number of barriers that prevented civil servants from doing their jobs to the best of their ability. The Civil Service needed new management structures geared to customers' requirements rather than being driven by a Whitehall-based hierarchy. It was 'more sensible to try to organise the delivery of services in ways that have more devolved accountability and more clearly specified units of management', he said. For the Labour front bench, Ms Marjorie Mowlam said that the bill would encourage managers to 'do something internally' in order to meet their financial targets, implying that they would seek to cut their pay bill - the 'main financial part of their budget'. The measure, which has already been passed by the Lords, would allow delegation only to servants of the Crown and cannot be used to transfer management functions to the private sector.</p>

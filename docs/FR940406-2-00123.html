Amendment No. 1 also clarified that the proposed rule change does not alter the Exchange's current net capital requirements applicable to Registered Options Traders (``ROTs''). See Letter from Gerald O'Connell, Vice President, Market Surveillance, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated March 1, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1'').

Currently, Rule 703(a) (iii), (iv), and (v) impose a minimum net liquid asset <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  requirement of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms which are both equity and options specialists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Phlx ROTs qualify as options market makers that are exempt from the SEC Net Capital Rule.

Specifically, the Exchange is proposing to add a new paragraph (v) to Phlx Rule 703(a) which would require a member organization or foreign currency option participant organization to promptly notify the Exchange if it ceases to be in compliance with the SEC Net Capital Rule or Phlx Rule 703(a) (iii) or (iv) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , former sections (a)(vi) or (a)(vii)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, the Phlx proposes to amend paragraph (c)(vi) of Rule 703 to add the requirement that a floor broker's clearing agent guarantee orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker, in addition to transactions and balances carried in the account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5), <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule make all specialists, except options market makers, that previously were exempt from the SEC Net Capital Rule under subparagraph (b)(1), subject to the rule. The amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, therefore, will have the following effects on Phlx specialists: instead of the current minimum net liquid assets requirements under Phlx Rule 703(a) of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms that act as both equity and options specialists, the SEC's minimum net capital requirement of $100,000 for dealer's would apply. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  The Commission finds that the proposal will conform Rule 703 to the SEC Net Capital Rule, as amended, and is therefore consistent with the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the notification portion of the proposed rule change may prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and protect investors and the public interest by providing the Exchange with the ability to respond promptly to such notification, especially respecting options market makers. Currently, Commission Rule 17a&hyph;11 requires, among other things, prompt telegraphic notice to a broker-dealer's designated examining authority, as well as the SEC, when a broker-dealer falls below its minimum net capital requirement pursuant to the SEC Net Capital Rule. This rule does not apply to options market makers, because they are exempt from the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Exchange's proposed notification provision would apply to all member organizations and participant organizations, including options market makers. As a result, the Commission finds that the proposed notification provision is consistent with the Act, in general, and with SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, in particular. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Commission finds that the proposed requirement that a floor broker's clearing agent guarantee orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker may serve to protect investors and the public interest by promoting liquidity and confidence in the credibility of floor broker orders, consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in order to ensure that the amendments to Rule 703 are in place prior to the April 1, 1994, effective date of the Commission's amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Commission believes that by granting accelerated approval, the potential for any confusion between the current net capital standards provided in Rule 703 and those that will apply on April 1, 1994, pursuant to the SEC Net Capital Rule, will be adequately minimized. Finally, the original proposal was published for the full 21-day comment period and no comments were received, and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 are simply clarifications of the original proposal. As a result, the Commission finds good cause for accelerating approval of the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization.

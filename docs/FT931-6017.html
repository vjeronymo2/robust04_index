			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 25.6m raised for Pilot Inv Trust Charterhouse Tilney has raised Pounds 25.6m for Pilot Investment Trust, which will specialise in smaller companies. The amount raised is on a par with the Pounds 28.5m raised by Hoare Govett for its indexed smaller companies trust late last year. The bulk of the shares (with warrants attached) were placed with institutions. Only 2.11m shares were applied for in the public offer. About Pounds 10.8m of the fund raised came from institutions swapping their existing small company holdings into trust shares. Dealings in the trust will start on March 5.</p>

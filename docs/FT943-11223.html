			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Engineering body decides on reforms Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council, told the annual Engineering Assembly in Cambridge last week that details are being determined for a new reformed council, which is the umbrella body for 41 professional engineering institutions. The new council would have a senate and two boards - one for the profession and one for regulation. Sir John said this would 'allow us to speak and act with unity when appropriate but allow the individual institutions to develop their own particular role and specialisation'.</p>

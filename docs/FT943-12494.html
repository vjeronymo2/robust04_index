			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Observer: Caracas chestnut That old philosophical chestnut - does something exist if nobody sees it? - has been dusted off in Venezuela, where president Rafael Caldera's government last week suspended some constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. Caldera has also imposed foreign currency exchange controls. To defeat any foreign currency black market, officials now may levy large fines and impose jail terms of up to eight years. More entertainingly, the legislation says fines up to Dollars 5,800 may be imposed on any news medium which even mentions the activities of a Venezuelan currency black market or cites anything but official exchange rates. So, not wanting to incur Caldera's wrath, let's set the record straight. You will currently get 170 Venezuelan bolivars for Dollars 1. Officially. Any other rates do not exist; even if the guy who offers them looks real.</p>

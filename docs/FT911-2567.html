			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Observer: Vintage mystery While the City of London awaits the start of the second Guinness trial, an equally complex drink-related scandal is causing deep concern in the dining rooms, if not boardrooms, of some of the most influential companies in the land. It is the case of the Pounds 1.5m worth of vintage wine seemingly evaporated from Green's, the once pukka wine vaults where generations of famous City figures have stored their liquid assets. After months of silence, last week Southwark police swooped before breakfast on seven addresses in London and the home counties and arrested two men. They were later released, and although police took possession of some wine, they are not saying whether it is necessarily the missing booze. One of the problems is that it is still not clear how much wine has gone walkabout. It could be 4,000 cases, or then again 6,000 cases or more. The records of the 200-year-old firm are in such a mess that no one is sure who owns what. The police will soon be sending questionnaires to Green's 1,000 or so customers to find out how much wine they thought they had stored at the vaults. Green's, which used to keep shop at the Royal Exchange before straitened circumstances forced it out of the City, has changed hands several times. Chris Collins, a well- connected Old Etonian and former amateur jockey, owned it for a brief period, selling it to American Donald Kurtz, who kept it even more briefly before unloading it on South African Joe Mankowitz in January 1990. Less than 10 months later, Mankowitz sold the wine-storage operation, and shortly after that, customers' wines are alleged to have begun disappearing. If readers have any clues, Detective Sergeant Simon Janes at Southwark police station would much appreciate some assistance.</p>

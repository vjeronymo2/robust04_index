			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FRIEDMAN HAS ASSEMBLY'S HIGHEST OFFICE EXPENSE TAB  </P> <P> Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) spent $332,552 -- more than any  of the Assembly's 79 other members -- on his office expenses during the 1988  legislative session, according to figures released by the Assembly.  </P> <P> Friedman's total was 19% higher than the Assembly average of $279,192 for the  12 months ending last Nov. 30. It was $10,270 ahead of the $322,282 accounted  for by the second ranking spender, Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear).  </P> <P> "I have no problem with anyone examining the way every penny was spent because  it was spent prudently," Friedman said in an interview Monday. "There's no  excessive salaries. There's no frivolous expenditures."  </P> <P> Among the reasons cited by Friedman for his top ranking are the cost of renting  his Sherman Oaks office, the cost of mailing newsletters to his San Fernando  Valley and Westside constituents and a bookkeeping delay that caused some 1987  expenses to be paid in 1988.  </P> <P> Friedman's 43rd District includes Studio City, Encino and Sherman Oaks in the  Valley and Beverly Hills, part of West Hollywood, Bel-Air, Brentwood and part  of Westwood in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The figures, released Friday, are compiled annually and released by the  Assembly Rules Committee. The totals include staff salaries, travel, cars,  district office expenses, newsletters, postage, telephones, furniture,  equipment, supplies, subscriptions and photocopying.  </P> <P> The totals do not include staff and other costs connected with committee  assignments. Some Assembly members who head committees have additional staff  and expenses connected to their extra duties. Friedman, who is not a committee  chairman, is a two-term lawmaker who easily won reelection last November.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Office Rent Cited  </P> <P> In reviewing his expenses, Friedman said his office rent is higher than rents  in other parts of the state. He paid $20,833 a year for his Ventura Boulevard  office, compared to the average annual local office rent of $15,863 for the  Assembly's 80 members.  </P> <P> "There ought to be an allowance for the prevailing rent in a particular  district," Friedman said. "The fact is that it costs more to rent an office  space in Sherman Oaks than it does in Norwalk."  </P> <P> Also included in the expenses is the cost of newsletters -- $63,490 for  Friedman. Karin Caves, a spokeswoman for Friedman, said $15,800 in newsletter  costs from 1987 were not paid by the state controller until 1988.  </P> <P> In addition, Caves said Friedman's newsletter budget was higher than most other  members because it was pegged to the number of registered voters per household.  Friedman, with 103,568 households, is among the Assembly members with the most  registered voters, she said.  </P> <P> That expense may have ended. Mass mailings by elected officials at public  expense, including newsletters, were prohibited last June when voters adopted  Proposition 73, which is being challenged in the courts.  </P> <P> After Friedman, the next highest-spending Valley Assembly member was Tom Bane  (D-Van Nuys), who listed $301,019 in expenses. Bane, chairman of the Assembly  Rules Committee, reported spending $29,343 -- more than any of his colleagues  -- on postage not connected with newsletters. He spent another $30,323 on  newsletter printing and postage.  </P> <P> The office expenses figures for other San Fernando Valley area Assembly members  were: Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), $288,864; Richard Katz (D-Sylmar),  $285,471; Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), $283,936; Burt Margolin (D-Los  Angeles), $277,030, and Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), $269,235.  </P></p>

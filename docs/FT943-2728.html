			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Next fails to please A series of profits downgrades and a steep fall in the share price hit Next, the fashion retailers, despite better than expected profits and a much higher than expected interim dividend. The stock price dropped 15 to 243p - its lowest level since July - on turnover of 13m shares, the heaviest daily volume for more than three years and the highest on the stockmarket list yesterday. The downgrades, mostly down to around the Pounds 95m to Pounds 97m level, from previous levels of around Pounds 100, followed a cautious statement from the company on second half sales. It pointed out that sales in the last quarter of last year were particularly good.</p>

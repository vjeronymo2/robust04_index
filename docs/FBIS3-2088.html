The main purpose was to simplify it,  unify tax rates, fairly share tax burdens, and create an  environment for comparatively fair competition inside and  outside enterprises according to the requirements of the market  economy. However, shortly after the adoption of the new tax  system, many manufacturers raised the prices of their products,  and many wholesalers and retail shops also "followed suit," thus  causing price disorder. In January and February, prices  increased by an average of over 20 percent. This caused  resentments among the masses. The authorities could not but  decided to adopt price control measures as of 1 March.    Reportedly, this year's taxation reform included the  following four main points:    First, reforming enterprise income taxes. In the past,  different tax rates were applied to different types of  enterprises. For example, the tax rate for foreign-funded  enterprises was 33 percent, while the tax rate for state-owned  enterprises was 55 percent. Thus, the state-owned enterprises  were situated in an unfavorable position in market competition.  After taxation reform, a unified tax rate of 33 percent was  applied to all enterprises regardless of their ownership nature.    Second, reforming circulation taxes. The original unified  industrial and commercial taxes levied on foreign-funded  enterprises were removed, and new circulation taxes, including  value-added, consumption, and business taxes, were established  and applied to all domestic-funded and foreign-funded  enterprises.    Third, reforming individual income taxes. For Chinese  citizens, the part of personal income above 800 yuan per month  is taxable; for non-mainland citizens, the part of personal  income is that above $550 per month. It is a six-tiered  progressive taxation system. The tax rate for the bottom tier is  5 percent and for the top tier 40 percent.    Fourth, reforming other taxes. This included the imposition  of land value-added taxes, securities transaction taxes,  inheritance and gift taxes, and urban maintenance and  construction taxes.    According to an official in the State Administration of  Taxation, after the completion of the taxation reforms, China's  industrial and commercial taxes will decreased from 33 taxes in  the past to 17, and the tax structure will become more  reasonable. This will be conducive to the establishment of a  market economic structure.    The authorities repeatedly stated that taxation reform was  just a structural adjustment. With the exception of a very  small number of enterprises, the tax burden on enterprises would  not increase. However, after the adoption of the new taxation  system, the prices of many commodities increased immediately.  Statistics show that in January, the prices of consumer goods  in 35 large and medium-sized cities increased by 23.3 percent  over the same period of last year. The prices of many  commodities in Guangdong increased by 22 to 39 percent over the  same period of last year. Some enterprises in Fujian even added  a 17-percent tax to the enhanced prices. Ordinary people were  naturally discontented with this situation, and complaints could  be heard everywhere.    According to a survey, the recent price hikes were mainly  attributed to two reasons. First, some tax payers did not  completely understand the new taxation system, and thought the  value-added taxes meant that an amount equal to 13 percent or 17  percent of original prices would be added; and some even thought  that a 17-percent value-added tax would be levied on every link  of commodity circulation. Second, some tax payers took  advantage of this opportunity to reap higher profits by raising  prices.    While facing the situation of price hikes, the tax  department  has more clearly explained the new taxation system, and in late  February, the State Planning Commission and the State  Administration of Taxation jointly issued a "Circular on the  Necessity of Keeping Prices Stable After the Reform of the  Taxation System" which stressed: "The difference between  purchase prices and sale prices (calculated according to the  current tax-included prices) for all consumer goods and producer  goods (including chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and other farm  production materials) must be kept unchanged in all wholesale  and retail links. All taxes will be levied within the  difference rate. No enterprise and unit can expand the  difference rate without authorization." The circular also  announced: "Severe disciplinary action should be taken to  immediately correct the practice of changing the prices of  commodities subject to prices fixed by the state without the  approval of the price control department and the practice of  raising prices without authorization in order to reap higher  profits by taking advantage of taxation reform or doing this  because of misunderstanding the new taxation system."    Because the price hikes were not checked, the government  then  issued another decree, ordering that shops in the whole country  must sell goods at prices approved by the authorities;  otherwise, they may be fined up to 10,000 yuan. Then, the  government announced that price controls will be exercised on 24  commodities which are people's daily necessities, and organized  inspecting personnel to check shops in order to stabilize prices  in the shortest possible period of time.</p>

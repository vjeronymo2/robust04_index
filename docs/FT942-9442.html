			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Figures not so different Sir, David Goodhart's article, 'Pay deals analyses differ on growth' (May 9), makes much of the 'differing analyses' of trends in pay settlements recently published by Incomes Data Services and Industrial Relations Services. A closer look at the two sets of data would have revealed a crucial difference - namely, that they cover different time periods. While the IRS figures cover the three months to March, the IDS analysis focuses particularly on settlements in April, one of the key months for pay reviews. When data is available for the same time period from both organisations, we have little doubt that the results will show a similar picture.

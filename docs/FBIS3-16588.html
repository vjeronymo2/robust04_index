Van  Eekelen told Snegur about the structures of WEU and its  purposes, the most important of which is to maintain peace and  security in Europe. Discussing the relationship between WEU and  Central and Eastern European states, the secretary general said  that nine states have joined the WEU, but with remaining states  bilateral relationship can be developed. President Snegur  estimated, in his turn, that with the adherence to the  "Partnership For Peace" program for insuring a total security  the signing of a partnership agreement with WEU would be  welcome. Snegur said that the 14th Army has to retreat  unconditionally from Moldova's territory and that WEU military  observers are welcome in Moldova's Eastern regions to eliminate  suspicion and consolidate the confidence of Moldova's population  in the constitutional organs' actions, the source notes.</p>

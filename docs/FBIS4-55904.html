Stressing that Iran is helping Bosnia-Herzegovina on the  basis of friendship and not on the basis of religion and that it  is doing so without setting any conditions, Prime Minister  Silajdzic emphasized that there is no reason for concern in some  circles because of this, since we, being a sovereign country,  choose our friends and receive our guests.    Silajdzic hailed the idea of forming a tripartite commission  for economic cooperation between (?Croatia), Iran, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

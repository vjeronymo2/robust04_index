			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Outgoing German Ambassador  to Japan Wilhelm Haas said Thursday [7 April] that  German-Japanese relations have "widened and deepened" in recent  years although Bonn sometimes devoted "probably too much"  political energy to German unification and European problems.  Speaking to reporters at the Japan National Press Club, Haas  said Germany has intensified its relations with East and  Southeast Asia, adding Bonn's new Asia policy, adopted in  October, "singles out Japan as major partner in the region."    A cooperation council for high technology proposed during  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to Japan in February 1993  will likely be formally established when Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa visits Germany as part of a European tour in May, he  said. Through the council, representatives of both governments  and the high-tech industries of both countries and research and  development personnel will meet on a regular basis to exchange  views on the latest technological developments and sound out  possible joint projects.    Haas, who will leave his Tokyo post on April 29 after more  than three and a half years in Japan, said Bonn "very warmly  welcomed" the priorities set by the Hosokawa cabinet, citing  political reform, decentralization and deregulation. However,  he indicated that political developments since August, when  Hosokawa's coalition government took power ending almost four  decades of Liberal Democratic Party rule, have put a damper on  Bonn's initial enthusiasm.    "We had high, possibly too high expectations and may have to  prepare ourselves for some disappointment," Haas said. "You  sell twice as much as you buy from us," said Haas, urging more  Japanese efforts to adjust the bilateral trade imbalance which  reached 930.44 billion yen in Japan's favor in 1993.    "The Germans feel that Japan can and should be more open to  its competitors and to international division of labor," the  ambassador said, adding that Germany hopes to solve trade  problems in a multilateral context.    Turning to cultural relations, Haas acknowledged that  Germany  should correct another imbalance -- the number of Japanese  studying in Germany is seven to eight times higher than the  number of Germans studying in Japan, he said. Haas, who is  fluent in Japanese, said, however, "it is simply not true" that  speaking the partner country's language is a prerequisite for  mutual understanding.    With the increasing global interdependence English will  become the mode of communication in German-Japan relations  anyway, he said. "This is not a bad development," Haas said,  adding that bilateral relations need to be taken somewhat "out  of the hands of specialists."    Son of a career diplomat, Haas spent almost his entire  childhood in Japan and China. In the 1960s he served as a  junior officer under his father, who was then the German  ambassador to Japan. Bonn has not decided yet who will succeed  Haas.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Deere announces record profit of Dollars 157m for term Deere &amp; Co, the US agri-cultural and industrial equipment manufacturer, yesterday reported record profits in the third quarter and said its worldwide production tonnage was up 17 per cent over last year. The company earned Dollars 157.7m, or Dollars 1.82 a share, in the quarter, up from Dollars 90.8m, or Dollars 1.19, in last year's third quarter. Excluding special accounting charges, Deere earned Dollars 100.1m in the third quarter of 1993. Sales in the quarter rose 14 per cent, to Dollars 2.327bn, from Dollars 2.049 last year. Wall Street analysts had expected Deere to report another record quarter, but the magnitude of the earnings increase caught many by surprise. The company's share price closed up Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 69 1/2 in New York yesterday. Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said: 'The company's results for the quarter reflect continued improvement compared with a year ago, primarily due to higher North American production and sales volumes, as well as improved operating efficiencies and better than previously anticipated results from our overseas operations.' For the first nine months Deere recorded income of Dollars 434m, or Dollars 5.04, on sales of Dollars 6.5bn, up from Dollars 154.9m, or Dollars 2.01, before special charges, on sales of Dollars 5.57bn. Overseas sales increased 23 per cent in the third quarter, to Dollars 535m. Although the company still forecasts a long-term downward trend for agricultural equipment sales in Europe, Mr Becherer said: 'The current outlook for 1994 anticipates industry sales being slightly higher than 1993 levels.' The company revised its 1994 full-year worldwide production schedule to be up 17 per cent over last year, from a previous forecast of 16 per cent. The increase reflects the third-quarter production totals, which the company said would have been higher had it not been re-tooling production lines for a new large row-crop tractor line to be introduced in the fourth quarter. The company cautioned that fourth-quarter output of some vehicles could be hampered by the availability of tyres, which have been in short supply.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League ideologue Gianfranco </F> Miglio by Marco Ventura in Domaso, Como province; date not  given: "Miglio: Rest Assured, We Will Reach an Agreement" --  first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "We are engaged in talks, and no doubt will  reach an agreement. I have never been an optimist, but this  time I tend to be one. If we can agree on the federal state,  the rest will follow, and I believe some people are beginning to  see our point, perhaps even some of our friends in the MSI  [Italian Social Movement]...." Speaking over the phone,  Gianfranco Miglio, the League supporters' constitutionalist  ideologue, explained his idea of federalism, during a pause  inbetween his tours of the Domaso vineyards in the Como  province. Democracy is in danger in the sense that "we are  running the risk of an authoritarian involution," not through  any fault of Berlusconi's "but because people who are  disappointed with democracy tend to say: `Then it is better if  only one person is in charge,'" and Berlusconi fits the bill.  There is a great craving for authoritarianism, especially among  young people. During the election campaign, Berlusconi gave  himself airs as the fatherland's savior, and Italians would be  capable of giving him all the power in the world, stripping  themselves of their rights -- "they have already done so before  in the past." The professor was in a good mood, predicting a  turn for the better. "What we need now is a constituent  government which will reform the Constitution, have the  amendments approved by the houses, and submit the text to the  people through a referendum."    [Ventura] Is therefore an agreement taking shape within the  pole for freedom.?    [Miglio] I will not tell you everything that is cooking in  the pot, but the First Republic's conservatives, those who are  hoping to salvage it, and the whole lot, are going to be  outsmarted. We will see who wins.    [Ventura] You will also have to make some concessions.    [Miglio] Yes, of course, without, however, renouncing  federalism.    [Ventura] Do you accept national unity and indivisibility?    [Miglio] Indivisibility can go fly like a kite, if my idea  of  two or three cantons wins the day. The whole idea of  indivisibility is outdated anyway, as is that of sovereignty,  which in the federal model has a dual nature, belonging both to  the state and the cantons. Unity is guaranteed by the directly  elected premier, who governs via a directorate made up of the  canton governors.    [Ventura] Would National Alliance's [AN] coordinator Fini  accept federalism in exchange for presidentialism?    [Miglio] The head of state is a useless encumbrance of which  we must get rid ourselves. The chairman of the Constitutional  Court could do so, but the strong power would be in the hands of  the prime minister, elected by the various peoples of the  federation.    [Ventura] Who would be in charge of public education and  internal affairs?    [Miglio] The cantons would be responsible for public  education, and the central state for universities and scientific  research. The cantonal police forces would be complemented by a  federal FBI.    [Ventura] What about fiscal autonomy? Would a certain  percentage of the taxes levied go to the center?    [Miglio] Yes, but this proportion would be decided by the  cantons, coordinated by the directorate.    [Ventura] Are you thinking in terms of a Belgian or U.S.  model?    [Miglio] Closer to the U.S. system, but rather like the  original structure of the Philadelphia Constitution, before  Roosevelt's welfare-state conception curtailed the states'  prerogatives in favor of the federal government. True  federalism is what you have in Switzerland, which is 700 years  old, as many years as my family has witnessed since it  established itself here at Domaso.    [Ventura] In an interview with LA REPUBBLICA, parliamentary  relations minister and constitutionalist advocate Paolo Barile  stated that "Miglio-type federalism is unrealizable." You can  change the form of government but not that of the state.    [Miglio] Nonsense! Barile has been fighting a losing battle  for the past 30 years. He, Matteucci and other  liberal-democrats, including well-known figures like Galli Della  Loggia and Panebianco believe that everything that has happened  to us was solely due to the malevolence, incompetence, and  dishonesty of politicians, and that, once the latter are  removed, the "new" guys will appear on the scene, and everybody  will live happily ever after.    [Ventura] Whereas....    [Miglio] Whereas this is not the case! The Constitution must  be amended. We have the right tool for doing this, no doubt.  It is enough to read articles 138 and 139. Everything can be  changed, except the republican form, by means of a majority plus  one of the deputies, and the other half just have to accept it,  whether they like it or not. Constitutions have never been made  by the people as a whole for the people as a whole, but by the  winners against the losers, as in 1956 by the antifascists, who  in fact did not even have it ratified through a referendum.    [Ventura] Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino is  proposing  moving beyond the regions by means of a structure comprising 25  to 50 "counties," somewhat larger than provinces.    [Miglio] Bringing together the local governments into a  single body is an old idea, even the papal government's  constitutionalists discussed it in their time. It is an  attractive and elegant model, but it does not fit reality in  Italy, nor federalism, which requires greater units, large  enough to counterbalance the central power. We must set out  from the regions, not destroy them.</p>

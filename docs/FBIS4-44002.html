			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN): German consulate officials in  Tehran have allegedly accepted bribes to issue visas, according  to the ARD television magazine program "Panorama." According to  the report broadcast on Thursday [23 June], genuine visas from  the embassy are available on the street from middle men for  prices ranging from 4,000 to 10,000 marks. Contrary to  regulations, the applicant does not even have to go to the  embassy to get the entry stamp. The corruptibility of embassy  staff in Iran and in other countries was on the records of  German courts and authorities, it was said.    A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that his  department  had no evidence of visa trading of this kind. If the television  program had suggestions or evidence that proved the involvement  of the German Embassy in this sort of dealing, then it was their  duty to inform the Foreign Ministry to enable them to clear up  the matter.</p>

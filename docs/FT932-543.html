			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Time to rediscover Ludwig von Mises In recent years the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the late Austrian economist and social philosopher, has become steadily better known. Hayek, however, did not generate his ideas in a vacuum. He was the product of a long intellectual tradition, the so-called 'Austrian school' of economics which originated with the work of Carl Menger in the 1870s. It is curious, therefore, that although Hayek is now internationally recognised, the work of his teacher and mentor, Ludwig von Mises, remains largely unknown. If Mises is remembered at all, it is for being the first economist to argue cogently that rational economic calculation would be impossible under communism. In later life Hayek admitted that it was Mises's book, Socialism, published in 1922, that had converted him from the socialist theories then fashionable in Vienna. In a recent FT viewpoint (May 20) Samuel Brittan reviewed Mises's critique of socialist economics. But there is much more to Mises than his attack on communism; he spent most of his life making positive arguments in favour of free markets and capitalism. A little personal history may help put Mises in perspective. He was born in 1881 and published a classic book on money and banking as early as 1912; sadly it was not translated into English until the mid-1930s by which time most of its main arguments had been popularised by Hayek. Mises was never an ivory tower academic; indeed for 25 years he was the 'Terry Burns' of Vienna, serving as the senior economic adviser to a series of Austrian governments. In his spare time he ran a regular Friday evening 'Privatseminar' that attracted many of Vienna's rising academic stars and gave him a platform to attack another orthodoxy he despised, the 'logical positivism' of the so-called Vienna Circle. The rise of Nazism destroyed his world, forcing him to flee first to Geneva and then, in 1940, to the US. Unknown in America and contemptuous of the Keynesian economic theories then in vogue, he was unable to get a full-time academic post. But he continued writing and lecturing until shortly before his death in 1973. His 900-page magnum opus, Human Action*, which contains asides on everything from religion to the nature of creative genius, was published by Yale University Press in 1949. There were a few appreciative reviews. The Economist, while nervous of Mises's libertarian conclusions, could not help admiring the force and clarity of the book's argument: 'Intellectual power roars through it like a great wind; it has the impetus of first-rate polemic and the impeccable coherence of Euclid,' it declared. Professional economists, however, totally ignored Mises's work: it was literary when they wanted half-baked maths; it was broad when they were excruciatingly narrow; it was laisser-faire when they were gung-ho interventionists. Mises believed the political disasters of the 20th century were a direct result of a loss of faith in the classical liberal philosophy espoused by thinkers such as David Hume and Adam Smith. (Austrian economics, incidentally, is really English since it is an extension of their work.) He felt this loss of faith occurred partly because economics - the core of the liberal philosophy - was hived off into highly specialised academic discipline. Tragically, most intellectuals came to regard it as a grubby science involving banknotes and factories that could safely be left to lesser minds; they assumed that how the economy was organised had no bearing on things that really mattered, such as culture and personal freedom. A good recent example of this tendency would be Bertrand Russell, who despite his intellectual breadth appeared to have little grasp of economics. Human Action is an exercise in advocacy on a grand scale. It is an attempt to convince the intelligent lay person that economics cannot be regarded as a subject such as engineering, on which it is safe to have no opinion. Mises sets himself the heroic task of demonstrating that the doctrines of market economics in fact follow logically from a few simple assumptions about the nature of all human action. You need not assume a perverted love of money or greed, only that everybody tries to remove feelings of uneasiness by exchanging one state of affairs for another presumed to be better. Step by step, Mises attempts to show how the form of social co-operation known as the market arises naturally from unforced interactions between individuals and how and why most attempts to interfere with this mechanism will cause more problems than they solve. Mises's style is admittedly an acquired taste: he is as magisterial as his near-contemporary (and fellow Austrian aristocrat) Ludwig Wittgenstein, who at 29 claimed to have solved all the problems of philosophy. But, allowing for this, Human Action remains a fascinating synthesis of economics, philosophy and political science. It offers perhaps the clearest exposition of the Austrian approach to market economics in existence: nearly all the themes that later preoccupied Hayek, from the role of the market as a discovery process to the case for denationalising money, are shrewdly analysed. Having been proved right on socialism, Mises now deserves a broader readership. *Available from The Foundation for Economic Education, Irvington-on-Hudson, New York 10533.</p>

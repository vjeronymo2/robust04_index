			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "Leotard To Bring Together </F> Defense Manufacturers for a Cost-Cutting Exercise"]    [Excerpt] Francois Leotard spoke at the National Assembly's  "Forum of the Future" presided by RPR [Rally for the Republic]  Deputy Jacques Baumel yesterday. At this meeting, the defense  minister disclosed that he will meet with defense manufacturers  soon to sensitize them on one issue: "They undoubtedly will  have to cut costs." This effort will be organized the General  Arms Directorate, whose chief, Henri Conze, in a recent article  in LE FIGARO called on manufactureres to achieve a 2-percent  productivity increase. You need not be a highly skilled  accountant to understand that this 2 percent, when added to the  0.5-percent annual growth rate provided for in the future  military programming law which reportedly has been accepted by  the Matignon [prime minister's office], will result in a  2.5-percent gain annually . This is the minimum growth rate  needed to ensure, in theory, that all major arms programs will  continue, although some staggering or downsizing still may be  required.    According to a reliable source, Leotard will invite some 15  highly placed representatives of the companies involved  (Aerospatiale, Dassault, Matra, Giat Industries, and others) to  lunch on Thursday to discuss cost cutting. Serge Dassault, who  was in the audience together with Aerospatiale chief Louis  Gallois and SNPE [National Powders and Explosives Company] chief  Emile Blanc, emphasized that his company has been undergoing  this kind of exercise for several years.    With regard to the 1995-2000 military programming law,  Francois Leotard stated that, "at the present time, the opinions  of all of the organizations involved have been returned, all the  work has been completed, and the results are now being written  up." However, its contents will not be disclosed until it has  been scrutinized closely by the Elysee [office of the  president], probably at the next Defense Council meeting on 6  April, and by the Council of Ministers on 20 or 27 April.

The march, which was staged along the camp's main roads, was  led by 'Isam al-Qadi, member of the National Command of the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party and secretary general of the Organization  of the Vanguards of the Popular Liberation War-al-Sa'iqah  Forces; members of the Regional Command of the Palestinian  Organization of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; the secretary of  Fatah-the Uprising; and the secretary generals of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Palestinian  Revolutionary Communist Party, the Islamic Jihad Movement, the  Palestine Liberation Movement, and the Palestinian Popular  Struggle Front. The march was also led by the secretaries and  members of the branches of al-Yarmuk, Palestine, and the  Palestinian Liberation Front of the Ba'th Party; the  representative of the Hamas Movement; the representative of the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and  representatives of the National Progressives Front parties in  Syria. Palestinian flags, slogans condemning the ugly crime  perpetrated by the Zionist settlers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque,  and black banners were raised in the march. The marchers set  Israeli flags on fire, cheered on the popular intifadah in the  occupied territories, and called for revenge for the blood of  the righteous martyrs.    Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad  Movement, addressed the gathering in the main square of the  al-Yarmuk Camp on behalf of the national Palestinian alliance  forces in Syria. He reviewed the massacres perpetrated by  Israel against our Palestinian people in Dayr Yasin, Qibya, Kafr  Qasim, Nahhalin, 'Ayun Kara, al-Aqsa, and the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque. He said: We will neither surrender nor bargain. The  banners of our struggle will remain high, and the sacred blood  that was shed on the holy day in the holy place from the bodies  of hundreds of the sons of brave Hebron and throughout the  homeland will water the trees of the intifadah, freedom, and  victory.    Dr. al-Shaqaqi said: This crime is a continuation of the  liquidation plot embodied in the Gaza-Jericho accord and the  subsequent accords that are aimed to disarm our people so that  they will remain defenseless in front of the Israeli Army and  settlers.    Concluding his speech, Dr. al-Shaqaqi stressed the need for  achieving effective national unity to confront Israeli  challenges.</p>

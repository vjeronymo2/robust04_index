The end of the Cold War, the failure of communism as a  global  political ideology, the collapse of the world socialist system  and disintegration of the Soviet Union have created  fundamentally new opportunities for overcoming divisions within  the international community. Virtually all leaders of the  countries of Central Europe and the new nations of Eurasia have  proclaimed "returning to the community of civilized nations" and  close cooperation with former political and ideological enemies  in the most diverse areas as their primary foreign policy  objective. Western leaders, for their part, have all welcomed  this desire of the post-communist countries and expressed  readiness to facilitate their rapid integration into  multilateral Western structures and institutions.    However, soon serious obstacles began to appear in Central  Europe on the road to such integration. The very fact of new  nations taking the place of the USSR, Czechoslovakia and  Yugoslavia has complicated the work of international  organizations and made multilateral negotiations and assessments  of subregional balances of political and military forces more  difficult. The appearance of Ukraine--the largest European  nation after Russia--on the map Europe has in itself produced  major changes in the continent's entire geopolitical landscape,  requiring extremely cautious and well thought-out reaction on  the part of the West[.sup]1[/]. At the same time, all  military-political structures and institutes created by the West  during the Cold War period (even those not designed specifically  for confronting communist countries) have been faced with the  need to redefine their functions and tasks and prove their  suitability for work in the new conditions.    Another factor that makes the integration of post-communist  states into the Western community more difficult is nationalism.  As expected by many scholars, nationalism has become one of the  prime movers of the political process in the east of the  European continent. The rise of nationalism has been, as far as  one can judge, an inevitable consequence of the crisis and  failure of communist ideology and the communist system, which  had for a long time impeded the establishment of mature forms of  social relations on both the domestic and international levels.  Following the anticommunist revolutions of 1989-1991,  national-ethnic self-identification became one of the main forms  of social existence in countries where no civic society in the  western sense had ever been established. Of course, in some  countries of Central Europe other forms of socialization  continued to exist all through the communist period: in Poland  the ferment of civic society was the Catholic Church and, from  the early 1980s, Solidarno; in Czechoslovakia (in the Czech  Republic to a greater degree than Slovakia) a stable  semi-underground dissident subculture persisted even after 1968;  in Hungary the party-state leadership headed by Janos Kadar  inclined towards liberal experimentation. However, most  post-communist states lacked even such modest counterbalances to  ethnic nationalism and statism.    Nationalist movements also thrived because considerable  segments of the former communist elites in the countries of  Central and Eastern Europe readily embraced the ideology of  nationalism in an effort to use it as a new source to legitimize  their power. Nationalistic ideas were frequently popularized by  the surviving machinery of communist propaganda, though now it  was directed not so much against the West as against adjoining  neighbors among the post-communist countries; such propaganda  contributed to rising xenophobia and a sense of national  exclusiveness. Nationalism often went hand in hand with  right-wing populism, and in some cases with various forms of  fundamentalism.    The integration of Russia and other former soviet republics  into the political, economic and military structures of the West  was complicated by the fact that it had to be effected in the  context of the formation of a fundamentally new balance of  forces in the world, and especially the European continent. By  the time of the disintegration of the USSR unified Germany was  already becoming the dominant economic and political force in  Europe. It possessed the greatest capabilities for extending  financial aid to Central European countries, as well as to the  republics of the Soviet Union. The role of NATO in the future  Europe became a topic of animated debate in the course of which  it became apparent that by the end of the decade a large part of  U.S. armed forces would be withdrawn from Western Europe. It was  suggested that even before the advent of the 21st century  Western Europe would become an independent military force. The  process of economic integration in the EC framework acquired new  dimensions, with people gradually getting used to the prospect  of confederation.    At the same time, the West was unable to avoid a degree of  political destabilization associated with the end of the Cold  War and the profound crisis of most left-wing political parties,  as well as with accumulated socio-economic problems. By the  early 1990s extreme right-wing groups and movements were gaining  strength in almost all countries of Western Europe, with the  rising popularity of nationalistic leaders (the most vivid,  though far from only, example of this trend was the rapid growth  of Le Pen's party in France). The further development of  West-European integration, to say nothing of the possible  expansion of the European Community, aroused concerns in some  countries for the preservation of independence and national  unity. Fears of the prospect of millions of immigrants pouring  in from the East and apprehensions about the influx of cheap  goods into West-European markets from the post-communist states  also contributed to rising xenophobia and even nostalgia for the  collapsed "iron curtain."    Discussions concerning the integration of Russia and other  former soviet republics became especially acute after the  1990-1991 political crisis in Yugoslavia escalated into a bloody  civil war. The question here is not only of human sacrifices and  material losses on a scale unknown to Europe since World War II.  The Balkan conflict has clearly demonstrated that the West is  not ready to develop and enforce any more or less consistent  strategy towards the post-communist world. The need for  collective action and establishing a system of incentives and  sanctions for the former Yugoslav republics was apparent already  at the initial stage of the crisis, yet neither NATO, the CSCE,  the EC, nor the UN were able to demonstrate the requisite  readiness for action or propose solutions commensurate with the  problem.    Throughout the entire initial phase of the civil war in  Yugoslavia (1990-1991) many Western experts predicted that the  internal conflict in that country would be quickly localized and  isolated from European big politics[.sup]2[/]. This view was  apparently based on the notion that, with the end of the Cold  War, the main threats of the escalation of regional conflicts  were no longer cogent. However, the civil conflict quickly began  to acquire international aspects: Hungary expressed concern over  the situation of the Hungarian minority in Yugoslavia and,  according to some reports, even declared the possibility of  intervening[.sup]3[/]; Greece and Bulgaria displayed  heightened interest in the fate of Macedonia, and Albania was  concerned with the situation in Kosovo. This course of events on  the territory of Yugoslavia substantially undermined hopes that  possible conflicts on the territory of the Soviet Union could be  fenced off from the rest of the world.    It should be noted that since the debate began in 1991 it  was  conducted as it were on two levels. On the one hand, there was  (and still is) an insistent need for urgent, immediate solutions  capable of preventing a repeat of the "Yugoslavian variant" in  different regions of the former Soviet Union. On the other,  there is the no less apparent need for long-term strategic  programs that would make it possible to organically merge CIS  countries into regional and global systems of international  relations. Whereas in the former case the main role was to be  played by existing institutions (NATO, CSCE, EC, UN), in the  latter qualitatively new mechanisms and structures could be  built. However, in the course of the debate these two levels  were frequently mixed, which led to confusion and mutual  misunderstanding.    Confusion was also caused by different interpretations of  the  very concept of "integration." Some politicians and scholars  viewed the concept as cultural-civilizational in content. To  them, the formal inclusion of Russia in Western structures  seemed essentially a secondary matter, a derivative of her  ability or inability to master and accept the basic values of  Western democracy, the Western view of human rights, etc.  Accordingly, the demands on Russia were extremely severe and the  process of integration (or, more precisely, of  cultural-civilizational assimilation of Russia) was viewed as  historically protracted and spanning at least several decades.  More, justifiable doubts were expressed as to the very ability  of Russia to meld completely with the West.    Another interpretation of the concept of "integration"  centered mainly on its political and military-strategic aspects.  The task of the quickest accession of Russia, as well as other  former soviet republics, to Western security structures was  considered to be much more important and urgent than the vague  prospects of their cultural-civilizational assimilation. That is  why, at least during the first stage of integration, the new  nations of Eurasia were faced with less stringent demands,  bearing, moreover, almost exclusively on their foreign and  military policies. As stated in a special workshop report of the  Center for National Security Negotiations in Paris, "basically,  Russia must continue to develop in a direction that does not  lead to the emergence of a new military threat against the West.  Even a Russian nationalist government could meet that  requirement: for example, an authoritarian regime relying on  centralized economic planning, provided such a regime  concentrates on the solution of domestic problems, without  attempting to restore its lost hegemony in Europe."[.sup]4[/]  According to this viewpoint, interaction among state political  institutes should precede interaction among societies as such,  creating the prerequisites for subsequent cultural integration  while at the same time resolving the most important, from the  Western point of view, problems of regional and global stability.    One of the most widespread variants of Western strategy  assumes the gradual integration of Central and Eastern Europe  into Western security structures using NATO  mechanisms[.sup]5[/]. The first step in that direction was  the inclusion of former republics of the Soviet Union in the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which is frequently regarded  as a "connecting link" between NATO and the CIS. Along similar  lines are proposals about forming a bilateral Russian-American  military political alliance which would either be a component of  NATO or would operate in close connection with it[.sup]6[/].    In the opinion of American experts, this integration variant  could be of special importance for preventing the proliferation  of nuclear weapons on the territory of the former USSR. It is  hardly possible to create a stable balance of forces on this  territory; without an element of nuclear deterrence, any  anti-Russian coalition of republics would inevitably be loose  and unable to function. Consequently, the U.S. and NATO could  face a difficult choice: either provide some countries of the  region (for instance, Ukraine) with reliable security  guarantees, including against potential threats from within the  region itself, or accept the prospect of nuclear proliferation  with vague but possibly dangerous consequences. Many Ukrainian  leaders, including President Leonid Kravchuk, directly link  Ukraine's nuclear disarmament with providing Kiev with reliable  Western security guarantees. Naturally, only NATO is capable of  assuring security guarantees commensurate with the possession of  nuclear weapons.    NATO supporters suggest taking advantage of favorable  political conditions to ensure maximum internationalization of  Russia's nuclear weapons, as well as of nuclear arsenals in the  West. In their view, NATO mechanisms can be used to integrate  Russian nuclear weapons at least at three levels: 1. Financing  the work of Russian nuclear specialists and research institutes,  help in implementing the provisions of the SALT-1 and SALT-2  treaties, increasing the safety of nuclear facilities in Russia,  and keeping Russian nuclear technology and nuclear weapons  components from going abroad; 2. Coordination of nuclear  planning, expansion of confidence-building measures in the  nuclear field, exchange of information about trends in the  development of nuclear technologies; 3. Creation of joint  multilateral nuclear forces of NATO and Russia. Noting that  "multilateral nuclear forces [were] an old NATO objective which  was never realized because of the imbalance between America and  its European nuclear allies, as well as because of European  distrust of the American strategy of expanded deterrence,"  supporters of this point of view note in a book published  recently in the U.S. that "this goal can be achieved if Russia  places a portion of its nuclear systems in a 'dual key' system  with NATO. The formation of multilateral nuclear forces could  commence if Ukraine transfers the nuclear systems on its  territory to NATO for subsequent destruction or  internationalization. Since Ukraine does not want to transfer  nuclear weapons to Russia before receiving security guarantees  from NATO, the transfer of nuclear systems directly to NATO may  prove to be a reasonable solution."[.sup]7[/]    Of course, the creation of NATO multilateral nuclear forces  is hardly possible without fundamental changes in the nuclear  strategy of the Western countries themselves. The key issue is  whether the U.S. is prepared to place a portion of its nuclear  arsenal under the control of a new multilateral structure. So  far this idea has not been seriously considered in Washington.    Supporters of this variant of integrating the former USSR  republics into Western security structures consider it  attractive because at present NATO is beginning to diversify its  functions. Along with traditional military-political tasks, NATO  agencies are seeking to contribute to the solution of problems  of converting military production and ecology, coordinate the  scientific and industrial policies of member countries, etc.  Thus, linking with NATO is especially worthwhile for the former  republics of the Soviet Union, while NATO, for its part,  receives another important lever for influencing the new  countries' foreign policies and defense strategies.    Expansion of the North Atlantic alliance's "zone of  responsibility" in the east of Europe would, in the view of  supporters of this variant, answer two fundamental NATO  questions: concerning the new role of NATO in the current  transitional period in the development of the European situation  and the basic possibility of preserving the bloc in the longer  term. As is known, the creation of NATO in the latter 1940s was  prompted by the United States' desire to resolve three  interrelated problems: creation of a force center in Western  Europe capable of withstanding Soviet military might and  political influence; creation of a structure for controlling the  postwar development of Western Germany in the political and  military spheres; and the establishment of mechanisms capable of  overcoming, or at least alleviating, contradictions within  Western Europe. In addition, the U.S. had a fourth objective,  apparent to all but never expressed officially: the formation of  reliable instruments of American influence on the European  continent.    These objectives were never fundamentally revised over the  course of four decades of Cold War and guaranteed the  maintenance of a stable consensus in questions of NATO actions  among its participants. Moreover, even the unofficial fourth  objective was never challenged in Western Europe (except for  Gaullist France in the 1960s), since American political  leadership created an additional guarantee of stability on the  continent.    The end of the Cold War and disintegration of the Soviet  Union, coupled with the changed correlation of forces between  Western Europe and the U.S., as well as the process of  West-European integration, cast doubts on the earlier objectives  of NATO, albeit not to the same degree. The first--confronting  Soviet might--had virtually disappeared. Although some NATO  generals and Western politicians claim that even given all the  changes in the geostrategic situation Russia remains a major  military power of the continent, an objective assessment of  Russia's offensive capabilities (to say nothing of an analysis  of her political objectives) indicates the absence of any  military threat from her against Western or Central Europe.    At present the quantitative ratio of the military potentials  of NATO and Russia is approximately 3:1, with NATO's clear  superiority in the quality of its weapons and the combat  readiness of its troops. When assessing the force ratio between  Russia and the rest of Europe (including the countries of  Central and Eastern Europe) the figure is approximately 1:6.  That is why many Western military experts have a much more sober  and restrained assessment than politicians of the actual  prospects of a "new threat" to Europe from a right-wing regime  in Russia.    The rationale of preserving NATO for the purpose of  preventing or settling Western contradictions or conflicts is  also strongly questioned. In the last few decades political and  economic structures have been set up outside the NATO framework  to deal precisely with the resolution of such problems, and in  many cases they operate much more effectively than NATO.  Moreover, the center of gravity of problems dividing  West-European countries has shifted from the military-political  to the commercial, economic and social spheres, i.e., to areas  in which NATO has neither the requisite experience nor authority.    The possibility of maintaining NATO out of concerns on the  part of West-European countries to keep a unified Germany in a  rigid NATO framework also appears to be fairly problematic. In  general, it is hard to imagine how a leading European nation  (when the unification process is completed Germany will have a  quarter of the population of Western Europe, its industrial  potential will be the second in the world, and its GNP will be  equal to the combined GNP of France and Great Britain) can be  kept in modern conditions in any kind of "rigid framework."  Already in 1990, Germany's position with regard to the crisis in  Yugoslavia differed significantly from that of other  West-European countries, as well as from American approaches to  the crisis. Moreover, neither consultations within NATO nor  coordination of the foreign policies of EC countries brought the  Germans to an "Atlantic common denominator." Apparently,  Germany's attitude towards the Yugoslavian crisis can be seen as  a precedent for its future policy, and in future it may be even  more clearcut.    At the same time, it would be unrealistic to expect Germany,  with thousands of economic and political ties with the U.S. and  West-European countries, to opt for any open confrontation with  its NATO partners by taking a nationalistic course and acting  unilaterally. Germany's policy will be guided for the coming  years, if not decades, by balancing between multilateral and  unilateral solutions, between preservation of Atlantic  cooperation and the building of a "Middle Europe." It is,  however, obvious that NATO's impact on Bonn's foreign policy  decisions will increasingly decline.    For the United States, the question of the potential for  NATO  intervention in affairs on the territory of the former Soviet  Union is additionally linked to the broader question of the  future role of the U.S. itself in NATO. As noted before, one of  the bulwarks of the bloc's existence throughout the entire Cold  War period was America's desire to use NATO mechanisms as a  means to secure its political interests in Western Europe.  Washington's readiness to carry a disproportionate burden of  NATO expenses allowed it to overcome many differences among the  allies. Today the need for, or even expediency of, preserving  NATO as a conduit of American influence in Europe is being  increasingly challenged, both in Europe itself and the United  States. The shifting of the center of gravity of relations  between the U.S. and Western Europe to the sphere of trade,  finance, competition in world markets, etc., in large measure  devalues NATO mechanisms created to coordinate actions in the  military-political sphere. The Americans were unable to adjust  NATO to U.S.-EC relations even during the Cold War years, still  less since the end of the Cold War.    That is why, ever since the beginning of perestroyka in the  USSR and the development of Soviet-American cooperation in the  latter 1980s, anti-NATO sentiments have been on the rise among  the American political elite, both liberal and conservative;  questions of reorganizing the bloc and reducing U.S. armed  forces in Europe are more than ever linked with reduction of the  federal budget and "redistribution of the financial burden"  among members of the alliance. A wide range of arguments in  favor of "getting out of Europe" have been presented. Some  political scientists and public figures were guided primarily by  financial considerations[.sup]8[/]. Other experts felt that  reducing the American presence would make U.S.-European  relations more stable and help consolidate political mechanisms  of cooperation. They also called for expanding economic links  between the U.S. and Western Europe to prevent it from becoming  a closed center of regional integration[.sup]9[/]. Still  others felt that the close linkage of the U.S. to West-European  security restricts the maneuverability of American policy and  impedes the use of opportunities opening up in other regions. It  has been suggested that politically Western Europe, if not  losing its significance for the U.S., should at least give way  to East Asia (or in some cases the Western Hemisphere) as the  main area of American foreign policy strategy[.sup]10[/].  Finally, some claim that large-scale American military presence  is simply meaningless, insofar as the linkage of American  security to Western Europe can be secured by purely symbolic  contingents of U.S. troops on the continent and that a sharp  reduction in American forces will have no effect on nuclear  deterrence[.sup]11[/].    President Bush, who undertook the initiative to develop a  NATO disarmament plan in 1990, proceeded from the idea that U.S.  forces in Central Europe should not go below 195,000. One year  later the Republican administration revised its plans in the  direction of further reductions down to 150,000. Senator Sam  Nunn, who favored an alternative approach, called this  "unrealistic" even before the disintegration of the USSR and  called for a reduction down to 75,000 over five years. The  Clinton administration has supported the "Nunn plan," with  emphasis on preserving the potential for rapid transfer of  American troops from the continental U.S. to Europe in case of a  crisis. However, even more radical proposals have been aired in  the new Congress, including the complete withdrawal of American  troops from Europe and a revision of U.S. military commitments  towards its allies.    From this point of view the plan to integrate the new CIS  countries into Western security structures through NATO has the  purpose of stabilizing the situation not only in the East, but  in the West as well, giving the bloc new functions and new  incentives for development. It is not accidental that it is  actively supported by American politicians and experts close to  the bloc's leadership. More, certain steps have already been  made in that direction: throughout 1992 NATO representatives  were involved as intermediaries in negotiations between Armenia  and Azerbaijan over the Nagorny Karabakh problem[.sup]12[/].  Here the concept of "integration" is interpreted very broadly,  not only in the military-political sense, but in the  historical-philosophical as well: NATO is seen as a mechanism  facilitating the modernization of societies, the overcoming of  nationalism, the formation of new political elites,  etc.[.sup]13[/]    Historically, four models of integrating individual states  into NATO's political and military mechanisms have already  formed. The first (the "German" model) presumes complete  integration of a state's armed forces in NATO structures. The  second ("French") model, on the contrary, is restricted to  political cooperation while retaining complete independence in  the military sphere, which does not preclude consultations and  collaboration on specific military issues. The third ("NATO"  model, which applies to most of the other European NATO members)  provides for subordinating the greater part of national  contingents to the NATO joint command in case of war or a major  crises, while retaining autonomy in military planning, command  and control in peacetime. Finally, the fourth ("American") model  provides for allocating a smaller portion of national forces  (deployed in Europe) to the joint NATO command, with a  commitment to place approximately one-half the national forces  deployed in other regions of the world under it.    Which of those models is applicable to Russia? The most  conservative authors consider that the most plausible, at least  in the foreseeable future, is the "French" model of integration,  since any other would require too much painful restructuring  within NATO. Besides, exponents of this point of view note, at  present Russia is not ready for closer ties with NATO; like  France in the 60s and 70s, it must go through a period of  nationalism (if even in moderate and nonaggressive form),  including in foreign and defense policies. Only after 10 or 20  years would it be appropriate to speak of Russia's full  integration into NATO political and military institutions.    The "American" model also has its supporters. They note a  certain "symmetry" in the location of America and Russia  vis-a-vis the European continent. Since Russia, like the U.S.,  is not a purely European power and its strategic interests  extend to other regions of the world, it is hardly worth  insisting on total geographic integration. On the other hand,  the other old, and possibly new, NATO members are hardly  interested in automatically making any commitments with regard  to the southern and eastern borders of the Russian Federation.    At the same time, from the point of view of the interests of  strategic and political stability in Europe, both the "French"  and "American" variants of the integration of Russia may prove  inadequate. In the final analysis, the main problem of Russian  foreign policy in Europe is not a shortage of political links  with the West but the fact that most of Russia's immediate  western neighbors, both former soviet republics and in Central  Europe, view Russia as a potential threat to their security and  even existence. One may argue over how justified such fears are  and whether it is legitimate to regard Russia as a direct  successor of imperial policies. But one cannot deny the  existence of distrust and suspicion in the capitals of  neighboring states with regard to Moscow's policies.    In that sense the problem of Russian integration into the  Western security system indeed has much in common with the  problem of integrating West Germany into NATO in the 1950s.  Germany after World War II, like Russia today, was faced with  distrust and suspicion on the part of its immediate neighbors,  which, actually, was what required the development of a special  "German" model of integration. It was precisely the complete  integration of Germany into the North Atlantic alliance, the  "dissolution" of the Bundeswer in NATO structures, that made it  possible to overcome anti-German fears and suspicions in Western  Europe.    It is hard to imagine that the "German" model of the 1950s  could be literally copied for Russia in the 1990s, if only  because Russia is not a conquered and occupied country, its  sovereignty is not restricted, and its war machine is far from  destroyed. But if we are speaking of incorporating Russia into  NATO, such an inclusion would be politically significant only if  it were comprehensive and far-reaching. The higher the degree of  internationalization of Russian armed forces, the easier it will  be for Russia to resolve its political problems with its  immediate neighbors.    In the view of proponents of the integration of Russia and  other CIS members into NATO structures, an additional incentive  for them could be a proposal to create a single  American-European-Russian market of weapons and military  technologies, in which Russia and Ukraine would occupy a worthy  place. Such a market would envisage standardization of basic  types of weapons, the removal of restrictions to the access of  former soviet republics to Western military technologies, the  adoption of uniform rules of producer competition in the  framework of a common market, creating a system for controlling  exports of military technologies to developing nations, etc. In  addition, as noted before, in a NATO framework it would be  possible to coordinate efforts to convert military enterprises,  in the sphere of political and military intelligence, and also  to develop and deploy a multilateral system of strategic  antimissile defense.    Radical restructuring of NATO, changing the composition and  functions of this military-political alliance, and the creation  of new mechanisms and institutes--all this raises the question  of revising the North Atlantic treaty. Indeed, the necessary  changes are so great that they could hardly be codified in  several new protocols supplementing the 1949 treaty. New  negotiations, a new treaty and, perhaps, even a new name for  NATO would seem preferable for a number of reasons. Firstly,  such an undertaking would be a clear demonstration that both  West and East are ready for really radical changes. Secondly,  negotiations would make possible a frank discussion of problems  unrelated to the legacy of the Cold War. Thirdly, they would  involve states truly interested in creating a security system in  Europe, while those NATO members which favor preserving the  status quo would not be able to prevent the signing of a new  treaty.    At the same time, such negotiations and a new treaty also  have some drawbacks. First of all, a break with the old North  Atlantic treaty would signify a rejection of established  traditions. For all its shortcomings, NATO enjoys a certain  legitimacy which may not necessarily be inherited by a new  organization. Furthermore, the current international situation  (the end of the Cold War, acute economic conflicts between the  U.S. and Western Europe, isolationist trends on both sides of  the Atlantic) do not contribute to the acceptance of rigid  binding documents by the participants in future negotiations. In  such circumstances the new treaty could prove to be a step back  rather than forward. This problem could be resolved if the  parties to the negotiations committed themselves in advance to  preserving the basic principles of the NATO alliance in a future  treaty.    However, this variant of Western strategy gives rise to  serious objections, including from experts close to the current  Democratic administration. On the one hand, it is not hard to  predict that the U.S. and NATO will try to avoid providing any  reliable security guarantees to the countries of Central and  Eastern Europe so as to avoid being drawn into a conflict  against their will. It should be said that historically the U.S.  has always carefully selected its military-political allies and  allowed various interpretations of the concept "allied  relations." The tendency toward more restrictive interpretations  clearly took the upper hand after the American defeat in  Vietnam, when President Nixon identified the group of U.S.  allies for which Washington was "prepared to fight." That  privileged group included the members of NATO and the ANZUS  bloc, Japan and Israel. These are the allies which can be viewed  as full-blooded military-political partners of the U.S. All  others would be more correctly characterized as aid recipients,  as clients belonging to the zone of American influence. The U.S.  has especially many such semi-allies in its own hemisphere (for  example, the OAS, countries that signed the Rio de Janeiro  Treaty in 1947), as well as in Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, the  Philippines, Thailand, Singapore).    Equally apparent is the rigid hierarchy of  military-political  alliances to which the U.S. belongs. Thus, it is apparent even  from diplomatic rhetoric that the Rio de Janeiro Treaty does not  rank among priority links like the North Atlantic alliance or  the American-Japanese treaty. A graphic example of the practical  choices of American diplomacy was the Falkland crisis, when  prior to the active phase of the conflict the U.S. expressed  allied sympathies with both Great Britain and Argentina, but  during the conflict itself unequivocally sided with the former.  It is obvious that with respect to the former republics of the  Soviet Union the U.S. will seek to apply the second model of  allied relations which, in particular, provides no guarantees of  automatic military help in crisis situations.    But even if it provided such guarantees NATO would hardly be  capable of convincingly confirming their veracity. (We could  recall the years of debate between Western Europe and the U.S.  concerning the reliability of American security guarantees to  Europe; throughout the entire Cold War American leaders were  never able to fully convince their West-European colleagues that  U.S. security was inseparable from the security of its NATO  partners.) Furthermore, the new role of the U.S in NATO and  NATO's new role in the world is still an open question, and the  integration of new states into the system of Atlantic relations  may complicate its solution even more.    The transformation of NATO into an embryo of a new security  system for Europe is also being criticized from another aspect:  the phases of integrating East-European countries remain  unclear, as well as the criteria to be used in selecting  candidates. If in the first phase NATO were to include countries  from Central Europe, the former republics of the USSR could  justifiably claim discrimination. If in the second phase the  alliance were joined by Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states,  then Russia would be in a highly vulnerable geostrategic  situation. If progress in democratization and movement towards a  market economy are adopted as criteria the political landscape  of Europe may acquire the weird shape of an incorrectly  assembled child's jigsaw puzzle. In addition, selective  participation of countries of Eastern and Central Europe in NATO  could indirectly provoke new conflicts on the continent. For  example, if Hungary became a NATO member while Rumania did not,  Budapest could doubtlessly be tempted to take advantage of its  new status and the institutional support of the West to increase  pressure on Bucharest concerning the issue of Transylvania.  Selective inclusion in NATO of individual republics of the  former Yugoslavia is also capable of changing the balance of  forces in the Balkans, with possible negative consequences.    Finally, it is extremely doubtful that NATO can radically  expand its zone of responsibility in the east of the continent,  to include such distant areas as, say, the Caucasus or Central  Asia. According to optimists, NATO's reaction to the Persian  Gulf crisis in 1990-1991 could serve as a model for other crisis  situations, including on the territory of the former USSR.  Indeed, when NATO policy towards the Iraq-Kuwait crisis was  being formulated none of the alliance members had any  reservations about participating in a confrontation not  associated with the Warsaw Pact organization. More, all members  stressed the need to display a united front, using the NATO  infrastructure in place in Europe. This was all the more  significant as the U.S. and its European allies had frequently  clashed over so-called security interests outside the "NATO  zone." West-European allies have traditionally opposed  Washington's attempts to expand NATO's role beyond its charter  tasks.    It would, however, hardly be right to draw any conclusions  regarding NATO's capabilities in Eurasia or even in Central  Europe from this experience. The Persian Gulf crisis was in many  ways a unique case, when the strategic and economic interests of  the leading Western powers coincided, it was possible to gain,  as a minimum, favorable neutrality on the part of Moscow,  achieve unity in the UN Security Council, clearly define  military objectives, and conduct the military operation in the  shortest possible time. None of these conditions will be present  in potential conflicts in post-soviet territories. The economic  and strategic interests of the U.S. and Western Europe will not  coincide (for example, in the Caucasus and some Central Asian  countries they may not be apparent at all), Russia will take a  position of its own, which will in large measure determine  NATO's capabilities, there may be no clearcut military goals,  and instead of a quick war one may expect protracted  "low-intensity conflicts." In fact, the Yugoslavian experience  (the apparent inability of NATO to influence events in the  country despite their impact on the strategic security interests  of at least two of its members, Greece and Turkey) is in most of  its parameters much more applicable to the CIS than the  experience of the Gulf war[.sup]14[/].    Besides, the idea of expanding the "NATO zone" clashes with  trends towards strengthening the role and significance of the UN  Charter, which are increasingly manifest in today's  international relations and gaining growing support in Europe  and the world. Extension beyond the sphere of the NATO mandate  is a violation of provisions of the UN Charter regarding the  right to regional defense and the creation of regional security  organizations. More importantly, it is getting harder and harder  to define where the "NATO zone" ends. If Russia became the  bloc's eastern frontier, like Germany was during the Cold War,  and the "NATO zone" was extended to the Pacific Ocean, the bloc  would objectively acquire an anti-Chinese and anti-Islamic  aspect, which hardly corresponds with U.S. objectives.    It is hardly accidental that in late 1993 it was Washington  that actively resisted attempts of some West-European countries  to consider the question of giving Poland, Hungary and the Czech  Republic NATO membership and appealed to its partners to make  greater use of other mechanisms to integrate the East-European  nations into Western security systems, in particular, CSCE and  UN mechanisms.

Some Western observers consider that the political,  military and historical significance of Ukrainian independence  is comparable with the unification of Germany and Italy in the  19th-century.

The new function of integrating Central and East  European  countries does not necessarily mean that the NATO bloc should  abandon its more traditional functions. Several publications  suggest merging its old and new tasks, thereby ensuring needed  succession and gradual evolution. Thus, the report of the  American Center for Negotiations in the Sphere of National  Security, prepared jointly with the French Institute of  International Relations, formulates eight NATO tasks in the  transitional period: 1) Continuation of American leadership and  American political presence on the continent; 2) Providing  security guarantees for countries of Central and Eastern Europe;  3) Discussion of nonmilitary problems of transatlantic  relations; 4) Securing a place for united Germany in the system  of Western democracies; 5) Maintaining an "insurance mechanism"  in case of a rebirth of Russian expansionism; 6) Maintaining an  infrastructure to support operations outside the area of NATO  responsibility, for example, the Middle East; 7) Development of  instruments to prevent nuclear catastrophes and minimize their  consequences; 8) Formation of forces which could be used in  multilateral peacekeeping operations.--European Security and the  U.S. Role: 1990s and Beyond.    13.

Virtually the only effective measure undertaken by NATO  in the Yugoslav conflict was implementation of the Security  Council mandate to set up a naval blockade of Serbia and  Montenegro. See W.

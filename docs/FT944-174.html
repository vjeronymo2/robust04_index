			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Honours for Labour leader's widow and Tory aide Mrs Sarah Hogg, out-going head of Mr John Major's policy unit, and Mrs Elizabeth Smith, widow of former Labour leader John Smith, are made life peers today in a New Year honours list that rewards 1,080 people for political or public service. The two women, who plan to play active roles on opposite sides of the House of Lords, are among four new life peers, two Companions of Honour, three privy counsellors, 53 knights and dames, and 1,018 commanders, officers and members of the Order of the British Empire. Downing Street said that 393 of the people on the list had been nominated by members of the public under Mr Major's 18-month-old initiative to democratise the honours system - 140 more than last year. The identities of the publicly-nominated recipients were not revealed, but are likely to include Joanna Lumley, star of the TV series Absolutely Fabulous, who was appointed OBE, and Eric Clapton, the rock guitarist, also made an OBE. Other high profile recipients included Felicity Kendal, the actress (CBE), Michael Bentine, the former Goon (CBE), Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United manager (CBE), Jimmy Hill, the football commentator (OBE), and Jonathan Davies, the rugby league footballer (MBE). Knights include Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, thought to be the first trade union leader to accept a knighthood since Sir John Boyd, his predecessor, was knighted in 1979. Also knighted are David Puttnam, the film maker, Robert Stephens, the actor, Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of the Forte leisure chain, and Mr Ronald Hampel, chief executive of ICI. Other businessmen knighted include Mr Bruce Pattullo, chief executive of Bank of Scotland, Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, Mr Geoffrey Whalen, former managing director of Peugeot Talbot, and Mr Gerald Whent, chief executive of Vodafone. Downing Street said 40 per cent of those honoured had been recognised for their contribution to voluntary service, compared with 330 in the previous list. Officials pointed to awards to a range of 'ordinary people', including a roadsweeper and blacksmith, as evidence that Mr Major's campaign to make the list more open was succeeding.

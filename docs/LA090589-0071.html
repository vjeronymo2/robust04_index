			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUNDED TO AID KING HOSPITAL;  </P> <P> DREW SCHOOL STRUGGLES TO FIND A STEADY COURSE  </P> <P> Across the street from Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital is a new medical  school that was founded in hopes of providing King with the brainpower,  research opportunities and high academic standards critical to any public  teaching hospital.  </P> <P> But despite a promising beginning, the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine  and Science in Watts has more recently struggled with fiscal problems and has  had troubles recruiting top-flight doctors as faculty members.  </P> <P> The medical director at King, Dr. James G. Haughton III, has complained that  the Drew school -- far from helping the hospital -- has become its "albatross."  </P> <P> In particular, he blamed the school for problems in recruiting and retaining  top doctors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Serious Financial Problems  </P> <P> University President Dr. Walter Leavell denied that the school is an albatross.  He acknowledged serious financial problems in the past, but said they have been  resolved.  </P> <P> Last year, a wrenching financial crisis and looming $2.5-million deficit at  Drew forced the layoffs of more than 50 employees. Since then, the faculty has  been hit by wholesale salary cuts and suspension of payments to the employee  retirement fund.  </P> <P> Independent auditors who examined the university's books from the recent past  noted that school officials had failed to consistently obtain bids for  purchases, employees were given monetary advances without supporting documents  and received loans from school funds without a repayment schedule. Bank  accounts had not been reconciled for two years, wire transfers were not  recorded, bounced checks were not followed up, petty cash accounts were  replenished without proper authorization and vacation hours taken by faculty  members could not be verified.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Light at the End of the Tunnel'  </P> <P> Since then, school officials have struggled hard to put the university on a  steady course, and as a result, Leavell said, "We can now see the light at the  end of the tunnel and know that it is not another train."  </P> <P> Founded in the early 1970s, the university was named in honor of a famous black  doctor and scholar renowned for his research on blood plasma. The school was  established with the help of doctors and officials from the UCLA and USC  schools of medicine, which continue to have representatives on Drew's Board of  Directors.  </P> <P> The university as a whole is unaccredited, but the medical school, which began  accepting students in 1980, is accredited through its affiliation with UCLA.  Drew medical students spend most of their first two years in study at UCLA.  </P> <P> At the outset, Drew attracted a host of top doctors dedicated to the mission of  creating a medical school that would train minority medical professionals and  serve the surrounding community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tumultuous Time  </P> <P> But problems begans surfacing more recently, and the last 18 months have proven  to be a tumultuous time at Drew, whose $25-million annual budget is derived  mostly from county, state and federal funding.  </P> <P> * Doctors doing research at Drew have complained that important research has  ground to a virtual halt. They have complained that they could not get access  to their grant money to buy even mundane supplies -- including food for  laboratory animals.  </P> <P> * The Los Angeles County sheriff's forgery-fraud unit has launched an  investigation into the alleged theft by school employees of about $130,000 in  payroll funds.  </P> <P> * Collection agencies and unpaid vendors have hounded school officials for  overdue bills. In one example, the school received a final notice from the  electrical company threatening to shut off service unless an overdue bill for  $12,521 was paid immediately.  </P> <P> * The school's personnel director reported last fall that "it takes months to  obtain routine office supplies because we have not paid our vendors." The IRS,  she reported, had assessed "severe delinquent penalties" against the school for  late payment of payroll taxes, and the school is "consistently behind (two or  three months) in processing premium payments for health insurance because of  cash-flow problems."  </P> <P> * In May, the chairman of the department of neuroscience, Dr. George Locke,  complained that "monumental problems that exist in Drew's accounts payable and  procurement sections" were bringing research to a halt at his nationally  recognized epilepsy center. "Promises have been made to me by every official in  the school that bills would be paid and that everything would be done to assist  me in the research program and invariably these promises have not been kept,"  he stated.  </P> <P> Leavell said the school has had problems but added emphatically that laboratory  animals have never starved and that fiscal controls have been put into place to  ensure that bills are paid promptly. He said he has made a "sincere effort and  significant progress" in implementing sound fiscal practices. But even so, he  said of the school's financial plight: "It hasn't turned around as fast as I  would have liked."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Educational, Research Arm  </P> <P> The Drew medical school serves as the educational and research arm of King --  in much the same way that USC and UCLA serve the two other county-owned major  acute-care hospitals. By and large, the medical school faculty serves as the  senior doctors of the hospital, ultimately responsible for patient care.  </P> <P> The 130 senior doctors at King are dependent upon Drew for important research  and academic opportunities as well as supplemental stipends to boost their  hospital salaries. Indeed, the doctors at King are recruited, hired and  promoted jointly by officials at King and Drew.  </P> <P> As one indication of the overall quality of the school's faculty, 48% of Drew's  faculty members are certified specialists in their fields of medicine, compared  to more than 80% at County-USC and Harbor-General.  </P> <P> Over the years, the turnover among faculty members has left some gaping holes  at Drew. Three key medical services -- orthopedics, emergency services and  medicine -- have long lacked full-time permanent chairmen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lacks Established History  </P> <P> Part of the problem, according to a 1987 management review of King, is that the  Drew medical school "lacks an established history to which highly qualified  potential faculty may be attracted." The medical center "has not yet  established a longstanding reputation for excellence as a teaching  institution," the report said.  </P> <P> Dr. Marshall Morgan, chief of emergency medicine at UCLA who served on a search  committee several years ago to recruit candidates for a key vacancy, recalled:  "No qualified candidate was willing to come forward and take the job. People  felt it was not a good career opportunity."  </P> <P> Drew's financial problems have not made recruiting any easier, even though  Leavell said that recruiting top faculty and students is his "highest  priority."  </P> <P> Haughton, King's medical director, complained that Drew officials have set up  search committees but provided no budget.  </P> <P> He said, for example, that the university set up a search committee a year and  a half ago to recruit a chairman for the department of emergency medicine -- a  post that has been vacant for more than seven years. But Haughton said the  committee "did nothing for a full year" because it had no budget to reimburse  candidates for their travel expenses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Superior Candidates Were Lost'  </P> <P> In another case, Haughton pointed out that during the search for a chairman of  the department of internal medicine "two superior candidates were lost because  more than six months after their visit, their travel expenses had not been  reimbursed."  </P> <P> They were both excellent candidates, Haughton said, but they figured, " 'Why  get involved with a place like this?' "  </P> <P> Leavell countered: "I do not believe that is why we lost the candidates." He  added that the school has earmarked funds for recruiting but conceded that he  does not know whether the search committees have actually "accessed the  budget."  </P> <P> Doctors have complained that Drew's failure to reimburse its visitors had  proven embarrassing.  </P> <P> "We are constantly being 'dunned' by people who have visited Drew in the last  six months and have not been reimbursed for out-of-the-pocket expenses. This  includes candidates for department chair positions, visiting professors and  faculty being recruited," the doctors declared in a March, 1988, memorandum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cash-Flow Problems  </P> <P> Given the school's significant cash-flow problems at the time, Leavell said,  "That could have happened."  </P> <P> It is the school's administration of research funds that has prompted the  angriest complaints from some doctors and researchers. They say that after  complaining for more than a year, the problems are still largely unresolved.  </P> <P> Mamdooh Ghoneum, a researcher at Drew with a grant to study cancer immunology,  said in an interview that "very elementary supplies" he ordered for his  experiments the first week in December still had not arrived five months later.  "I've got a $30,000 to $40,000 grant," he said, "But we are doing the very  minimum level of work, borrowing (supplies) from here and begging from there,  doing everything I can, even paying for things out of my own pocket."  </P> <P> In March of 1988, Dr. Clarence Grim, an authority on hypertension at Drew,  convened a meeting of concerned researchers, declaring that "it has become  clear that the ability to carry out funded grant goals and objectives at Drew  has virtually stopped because of the school's administrative problems with  grants management."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints Dismissed  </P> <P> In an interview, Leavell dismissed the complainers as an unrepresentative  minority of all the researchers. He said they exaggerated a few minor problems,  which have mostly been resolved. "I'm not aware of anyone's research coming to  a halt," Leavell said.  </P> <P> But Grim complained in letters to top school officials that researchers could  not readily purchase supplies because the school took "weeks to months" to  process purchase orders and suppliers took equally long to ship items. "This  stems from many suppliers no longer accepting Drew's credit and refusing to  ship to us," Grim said.  </P> <P> Food for laboratory animals had run out "in the middle of critical  experiments," Grim asserted, and doctors had been forced to dip into their own  pockets to buy food to prevent the animals from starving.  </P> <P> Furthermore, a special school committee, responsible under federal law for  reviewing the use of human subjects in research grant proposals, had virtually  ceased to function since its secretary was laid off, Grim charged.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Secretary on Loan  </P> <P> Haughton said he loaned the committee a secretary after doctors complained that  their grant applications were jeopardized by the hamstrung committee.  </P> <P> "I can't let all the research in the hospital stop because there's nobody to  take the minutes of a committee meeting," he declared.  </P> <P> Leavell said, "Secretarial help was not denied from the school. . . . I even  offered it out of this office . . . but no one took me up on it. . . . We don't  have a lot of secretaries, but that's an . . . extremely important function. We  have a moral and a legal obligation for that function to go forward."  </P> <P> The frustration level among some researchers reached the point last year where  they threatened to demand their grants funds be turned over to some other  institution for better handling and safeguarding. They also threatened to  report alleged irregularities to funding authorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threat Alleged  </P> <P> But Grim said the doctors backed off from filing a formal complaint because "we  were essentially threatened with being dismissed if we complained about this."  </P> <P> Leavell denied any such threats, but said that some of the statements made by  the school's dean at the time could have been misinterpreted.  </P> <P> He said in an interview in March that virtually all complaints involving  research money had been resolved and that he has set up a process to expedite  research grant applications and procurement of supplies needed in experiments.  </P> <P> But in a letter to school officials in May, Locke, chairman of neuroscience,  complained of recurrent problems that had seriously undermined his  multimillion-dollar epilepsy research at Drew. He stated that it was his "moral  and scientific" responsibility to alert authorities at the National Institute  of Health, which has funded his research. A formal complaint was filed with NIH  in July.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Documents Subpoenaed  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Drew's attorney, Joe Duff, acknowledged that a different funding  agency -- the U.S. Agency for International Development -- has subpoenaed  documents from Drew pertaining to research money awarded the school's former  president, Dr. M. Alfred Haynes. Duff said he has provided federal  investigators with batches of credit card receipts relating to Haynes' travel  expenditures.  </P> <P> Haynes left Drew in 1987, at a time when the school's financial problems were  mounting.  </P> <P> About a year later, Leavell implemented severe cuts to head off financial  disaster.  </P> <P> In explaining the cuts to faculty members at a meeting Jan. 12, 1988, Leavell  said:  </P> <P> "You are familiar as I am with the shortcomings that have existed for some  period of time in our fiscal systems and the credibility of those systems. I  think your lack of confidence was justified, because those systems were not  solid, sound and not as responsive as they should have been."  </P> <P> But now, Leavell said he believes that the school is being properly managed.  "We have rebounded from significant fiscal crisis," he said.  </P></p>

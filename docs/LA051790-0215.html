			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: AT A LECTURE ON POWER, HE LOST THE URGE BEFORE SURGE  </P> <P> I've been going through this power thing with my editor and my wife and the  trash collector and some Republican politicians, among others, so when a friend  sent me a ticket to a lecture by Anthony Robbins last week, I was instantly  intrigued.  </P> <P> Robbins, the accompanying publicity told me, has written a "national  bestseller" called "Unlimited Power," and he was prepared to tell me and anyone  else who cared to show up at UC Irvine's Bren Center on the evening of May 9  how to tap into it.  </P> <P> He would also explain how to "DISCOVER keys to Mastery of Excellence," "HEAR  how to Communicate with Confidence to Anyone," and "EXPERIENCE how to Conquer  Limiting Fears and Beliefs."  </P> <P> Since I have some problems in all those areas, I went.  </P> <P> So, it turned out, did about 6,000 other people. Even the University of Nevada  Las Vegas-UCI basketball game has never drawn as many people to the Bren Center  as Robbins did. I had to outflank the worst traffic jam I've even seen on the  UCI campus just to get out of my car.  </P> <P> When I finally got into the Bren Center, I was struck instantly with the  remarkably efficient crowd control exercised by several dozen young men in  white shirts, ties and walkie-talkies, men who had clearly done this before for  Robbins Research International -- the blanket name for Robbins' operation. We  were filtered through a single entrance and given no seating options. The crowd  was a curious amalgam. About half were men in business suits and women in chic  dresses, who appeared to have come directly from the office. The rest were a  mixture of young and old, trim and tacky. There were a lot of couples and  probably a majority of women.  </P> <P> By way of introduction, we were shown films of several TV news segments done on  Robbins. The centerpiece is usually Robbins walking barefoot on a bed of hot  coals, followed by a group of his trainees. I remembered seeing this on  television but hadn't associated it ahead of time with the evening's program.  The fire walk has become a kind of trademark for Robbins. He referred to it  later in the evening as "metaphor for turning fear into power. If you show  yourself you can walk on hot coals without injury, then you ask: 'What else can  I do that I didn't think was possible before?' "  </P> <P> He was introduced by his marketing director, and we were asked to stand when he  appeared. Everyone dutifully did, like greeting visiting royalty. The same kind  of audience manipulation permeated the evening. Robbins -- a 33-year-old  dervish of animated movement and old-time-religion fervor, clad impeccably in  white shirt, tie and jacket -- constantly exhorted the crowd to action. We were  asked to raise our hands in response to a multitude of questions, massage the  back of the person next to us, clap our hands, groan, and shout in a kind of  Messianic heat -- and virtually everyone did.  </P> <P> I have a lot of problems with this sort of things -- which I presume Robbins  would see as an inhibiting character defect that needs correction. But Robbins'  enthusiasm and the hunger of most members of the audience for what he was  offering made them totally malleable to his suggestions.  </P> <P> I'm hard put to summarize what he was offering, but it came off to me as  Pavlovian show business, Skinner with a Spin -- and I don't mean to be flip.  Robbins has taken two precepts generally accepted in the scientific community  -- that we have barely scratched the possibilities of the human mind and that  one's mental state exerts a profound influence on the physical -- and  metamorphosed them into a system called Neuro Linguistics Programming (NLP).  </P> <P> This appears to contain generous elements of Skinner's behaviorism, positive  thinking, Christian Science, physiology, "The Little Engine That Could" and an  especially heavy dose of a technique called modeling. Developed by  psychotherapists Richard Bandler and John Grinder, successful modeling can  systematically produce the same behavior in a subject as the person being  modeled.  </P> <P> Robbins combined an intensive study of these techniques with a driving need to  be successful and the growing skills of a professional entertainer to create  his company. Over the past decade, he has built up an imposing list of people  -- some quite well known -- who say their lives have been changed by his  teaching.  </P> <P> Robbins' performance at the Bren Center alternated between lecture, jiving with  the audience and demonstration. He asked people to tell him their fears and  went through a great many before a young woman said she was afraid of animals.  Then he asked if there was an animal in the audience, and lo and behold,  someone had a seeing-eye dog. So he brought the dog and the fearful lady to the  platform and went through 20 minutes of hand manipulation, what to me was  totally incoherent talk, and exhortation that ended, finally, with the woman  petting the dog. Maybe he changed a lifelong phobia or maybe she just wanted to  get off the platform. I don't know.  </P> <P> He repeatedly returned to the theme -- scarcely new -- that all of our behavior  is conditioned by fear, and by neutralizing the fear, we can open up new vistas  of living. He pointed out that we all say we would like to make more money, but  subconsciously part of our brain is saying that more money might bring pain.  </P> <P> "So we have a mixed association in the nervous system as to what money means,"  he explained. "The ability to do anything grows out of one's ability to control  the nervous system. Your state of mind changes your body's chemistry."  </P> <P> Although there was a lot of talk about money, it took him 90 minutes to get  into his own commercial. He pointed out that we could take what he said tonight  or read his book and put NLP into practice. But the system works much better  with teaching and supervision. I didn't get the full significance of that until  I left early.  </P> <P> Almost two hours into the program, Robbins was still going strong, and I was  giving out. He had promised to tell us the four areas we must master to change  the quality of our lives but then got sidetracked, and I couldn't wait. I  presume he got to them since the auditorium still hadn't emptied as I drove  past it on my way home.  </P> <P> As I departed the Bren Center, several rows of tables had been moved into the  lobby. The person in charge of each table was identified by a prominent name  card. I asked one young woman what they were up to, and she said they were  signing up students for an "Unlimited Power Weekend" to be held at Bren on June  8 to 11. It would normally cost $895, she explained, but if I signed up  tonight, I could get $200 off. Each table had a credit-card machine to expedite  the sign-ups. Since I can't pass those crucial areas we need to master along to  you, I guess you'll have to enroll at the Power Weekend to find out -- or  perhaps ask someone whose staying power that evening was greater than mine.  </P> <P> I don't think I'll attend the Power Weekend. The first day ends in a fire walk,  and I have this gnawing fear that if it didn't work, I wouldn't be able to play  tennis for a month. So I guess I'll look for my metaphors in a less risky  place. After all, Jesus refused to throw himself off that mountain to prove his  powers to doubters, and that's still good enough for me.  </P></p>

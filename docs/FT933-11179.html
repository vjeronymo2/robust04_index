			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: LWT improves to Pounds 16.5m - Conversion of preferred and management shares expected next month LWT (HOLDINGS) yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.5m for the six months to June 30 - an increase of 20.5 per cent on the same period of 1992. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, claimed that an increase in underlying profit margins from 19.6 per cent to 26.6 per cent gave the company among the highest margins in the industry. The announcement also set the clock running for the conversion of the preferred and management shares which is now expected to take place next month. On the present price level - the shares rose another 14p to 483p yesterday having performed well since Granada recently acquired a 17.5 per cent stake  -more than 40 managers are likely to hold ordinary shares worth a sum approaching Pounds 70m. Sir Christopher said he expected managers to sell some shares almost immediately, partly to pay off loans taken out to purchase management shares. Sir Christopher said he expected managers to retain about 10 per cent of the shares out of the 15 per cent they will hold on conversion. He added that the group was performing well and a 'good result' was expected for the whole year, although advertising revenue continued to be short-term and difficult to forecast. Turnover at Pounds 121.2m was down Pounds 13.2m, largely because of the loss of Channel 4 airtime. The company's share of net advertising revenue was up 3.8 per cent compared with 4 per cent for ITV as a whole. LWT's share of London advertising was down by 0.25 per cent with the London share of ITV down by 1 per cent. Operating profit before payments to the Independent Television Commission rose by 39 per cent to Pounds 32.3m. LWT's share of the Pounds 10m losses of Good Morning, the commercial breakfast service, was Pounds 2m. Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive, said he hoped the service, which had run into stiffer-than-expected competition from Channel 4's The Big Breakfast, could break even next year although it might take until 1995. Fully diluted earnings per share were up 24 per cent to 10.2p. The company has already paid a fixed preferred dividend of 2.95p and another is likely in September. After that the board said it will adopt 'a progressive dividend policy reflecting LWT's performance and cash position.' The first ordinary dividend will be a final for the year to December 1993. Barring unforeseen circumstances the total for the year will be 'significantly ahead' of the current fixed dividend of 5.9p. See Lex</p>

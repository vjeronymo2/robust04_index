Every  year enterprises discharge more than 30 million tonnes, and  motor vehicle transport 20 million tonnes of these substances  into the atmosphere. There are 400 kg to every inhabitant of  the country.    One-half of our population drinks dirty water. Around 28  cubic km of dirty water are discharged into reservoirs every  year.    Participants in the first scientific and practical  conference  on "Problems of the Rehabilitation of the Population in Zones of  Ecological Violations," which concluded in Moscow yesterday,  spoke about all this with alarm. It was organized by the  International Fund for Socioecological Aid and a number of trade  union, state, and other organizations in the framework of  preparation for the All-Russia Day of Defense Against Ecological  Danger. The assembly discussed draft normative documents on  ecological state of emergency and ecological disaster zones and  the compensations procedure for damage to the health and  property of citizens caused by pollution of the environment.    The conference appealed to the Russian president and the  organs of legislative and executive power to adopt urgent  measures to fulfill the Russian Federation Law "On Protection of  the Natural Environment," drawing attention to the fact that  ecological policy should become a component of economic and  social transformations.</p>

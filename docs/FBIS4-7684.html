			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Lukanov commentary: "Does the Constitution Apply to </F> the President?"]    [Text] Loyal to his bad habits, the president of the  Republic again chose a foreign audience in order to tell tales,  about which he would again probably have to make clarifications  to the Bulgarian public. Indeed, the things are clear even  without any clarifications, because the basic theses that the  president recently expressed in London continue to specifically  express the same thoughts of his he has been trying to impose on  our public in the last few months. According to Zhelyu Zhelev  it is not the prime minister, Lyuben Berov, who is sick, but  rather the Bulgarian Government and the formula on which it is  based. Therefore, according to him, it is necessary to change  the formula, find a new parliamentary configuration, or go to  new elections by the end of the year. He even warned the  sovereign Bulgarian voter not to reach out for the red ballot,  because if the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] wins the  elections it would not know what to do with this victory and  could not succeed to form a government.    If those words would have been uttered by another Bulgarian  citizen, public figure, or deputy, they would have hardly  impressed anyone. Under conditions of political pluralism  everyone has the right to an opinion, and the rest can agree or  disagree with this opinion. This applies to everyone but the  president. Assuming the grave constitutional burden of  personifying the unity of the nation, he also assumes the  commitment to the people to limit his public statements to the  framework of those strictly defined functions and obligations  which the constitution prescribes. He does not have the right  to jabber everything that comes to his mind, because every word  he publicly utters has a political effect which also is the  subject of constitutional assessment.    What is disturbing in Zhelyu Zhelev's London revelations?  First of all the fact that the president allows himself to  determine the date of eventual early elections and engage in  reshaping the parliamentary configuration, despite the fact that  all this is not a part of his constitutional prerogatives. In  this case Zhelev crudely and unceremoniously interfered with the  prerogatives of the parliament and the parliamentary forces,  which are the only ones empowered by the people to assess the  cabinet, approve its composition and policy, and determine its  fate. In this case I do not mean to defend the government and  its policy, but defend the fundamental and constitutional  principles of a parliamentary and not a presidential republic.  In this republic the president only has the right of setting  new elections if the parliament fails to form a cabinet, rather  than the right of expressing an opinion whether there should be  new elections and when should they take place, while the  hypothetical situation described in detail in the constitution,  which allows him to do this, does not exist.    It also is scandalous that the president finds it possible  to  call his country's cabinet a sick cabinet, and declare the  country's legislative and executive powers provisional powers at  a moment when difficult and delicate negotiations are being  conducted with foreign governments, international institutions,  and commercial banks, and decisions of fateful importance for  the national economy and the future of the reforms in Bulgaria  must be adopted. This is not only a violation of the  constitution, but also an act that contradicts Bulgaria's  interests. This reminds one very much of 1990, when the  political configuration led by Zhelyu Zhelev was prepared to  destroy the civic peace in the country in order to prevent the  successful completion of the negotiations which the government  at that time conducted with the international financial  institutions and the Western partners. Now Zhelyu Zhelev  decided to speak in London -- one of the world's basic financial  centers, and thus ensure maximum response to his suggestions.    For some time already Zhelyu Zhelev usurps the right of  evaluating one of the legitimate political and parliamentary  forces in Bulgaria, supported by no less than one-third of the  country's mature citizens. This testifies not only to the lack  of political and civic culture, but also to an insurmountable  prejudice, which obviously contradicts Zhelev's claim to be the  president of all Bulgarians. Instead of reading lectures abroad  on the topic of tolerance, the president should grasp his  constitutional duties and understand that he could implement his  functions of an honest arbiter and guarantor of national unity  only if he equally respects all public forces and conducts a  tolerant and equal dialogue with them, while at the same time he  does not forget even for a moment the limits of his rights and  prerogatives. Otherwise he could turn, and indeed he already  has turned into a factor of public destabilization and national  division. If he heads along this way he alone would relinquish  the responsible role that the constitution assigns to him.    I would like to stress again that those infringements of the  Constitution are not an accidental matter. They outline a  consistent and insistent line of the president, which becomes  ever more a threat to the constitutional order in Bulgaria. I  will remind the readers of Zhelev's claim that the specific  character of the transitional period in the postsocialist states  justifies the establishment of a presidential rule. Thus those  states would have faced the serious threat of restoring  authoritarianism. Let me also remind the readers of his  anticonstitutional interference in the progress of the agrarian  reform, whose essence it was to restrict "from the top" the  rights of the owners of the agrarian land and maximally extend  the life of the liquidation councils, despite their lethal  effect on the national economy and the normal supply of the  people with acceptably priced foodstuffs. We would hardly  forget soon the other anticonstitutional act of the president --  his attempt to create parallel structures to lead the Armed  Forces outside the legitimate structures envisaged by the basic  law, and as a counterbalance to those legitimate structures.  Without claiming that we mentioned everything, we could not  ignore his comment on the upcoming extraordinary elections,  which he made for the national mass media after visiting  Professor Berov in the hospital. In addition to its  anticonstitutional character, this comment also impressed with  its lack of political tact and elementary human ethic.    Those are grave words and harsh conclusions, but the  president must hear them, also because his post involves special  moral, political, and constitutional responsibilities, and  because in the final analysis, we are discussing here the  fundamental rules and principles of democracy and the democratic  public culture. There was a moment during the president's term  of office when the hope emerged that Zhelyu Zhelev would  overcome his political bias and would really assert himself as  the president of the entire nation, as a uniting figure capable  of contributing to overcoming confrontation and asserting  civilized social habits. Unfortunately, the last public  statements of the president are far from those expectations.    His thesis regarding him being a "president of the  transition  period" is also insolvent. Obviously, this thesis justifies in  his own eyes and the eyes of his advisers his recent and  repeated liberties with the constitution. There is not and  cannot be a "president of the transition period." We have a  legally elected president of the Republic of Bulgaria, whose  functions and rights are clearly spelled out in Chapter 4 of the  Bulgarian Constitution. If Zhelyu Zhelev does not want to comply  with the text of the Constitution by which he was sworn in, the  National Assembly would have no other choice except invoking  Article 103 of the Bulgarian Constitution, which envisages the  procedure of terminating the presidential mandate ahead of time.</p>

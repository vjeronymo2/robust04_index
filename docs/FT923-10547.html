			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Games war on the cards in Barcelona American visitors at the Barcelona Olympics could be forgiven for being confused about their choice of credit cards, writes Gary Mead. Should it be Visa, or maybe American Express? The arch rivals traded punches during February's Winter Olympics at Albertville where Visa - one of 12 leading official sponsors sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) - accused Amex of 'ambush marketing'. Visa is believed to have paid Dollars 20m to join the IOC's sponsorship programme. In return, Visa may use the five Olympic rings on its advertising and promotional materials. Visa complained that although Amex was paying nothing, its advertising implied a close association with the Games. In February, Amex was sued by the IOC for alleged improper use of Olympic symbols. The French courts found against Amex on one count but rejected the IOC's claims on another, related accusation. The recriminations have now resurfaced. In the US, where comparative advertising is king, Visa is exploiting its Dollars 20m payment with television advertisements which hint that not only does Visa have an exclusive connection with the Barcelona Olympics, but that its main competitor, the green Amex card, is positively unwelcome. Thus Visa has run a series of 30-second commercials showing a range of field and track, wrestling and basketball events. The commercials cut from sport to disgruntled clerks behind a grille, with the voice-over commentary: 'You think they're tough? Wait till you see the guys at the ticket window if you don't have your Visa card. Because once again the Olympics don't take American Express.' To combat that truth-economical slogan, Amex have replied with their own Barcelona-connected television ads. One commentary begins: 'American Express first came to Barcelona in 1921' and quickly runs through all its Spanish-based services. It concludes: 'So if you go to Barcelona, take the American Express card - obviously we are here for more than just the fun 'n games.' Another Amex ad puts it more bluntly: 'Remember, to visit Spain you don't need a visa.' A word of warning to US readers; cash does very nicely in Spain.</p>

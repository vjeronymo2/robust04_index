			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Change of style and substance - Erskine Bowles, the top US small business policy maker Erskine Bowles, administrator of the US Small Business Administration, is having a rough ride in Washington. Bowles has been besieged by critics of President Clinton's healthcare programme. In particular, he is feeling the heat from small business lobbyists upset that he is supporting the president's call for the so-called 'employer mandate', which would force employers to pay some of their employees' healthcare insurance premiums. 'We have had a big bump in the road called healthcare which has hurt the credibility of Erskine Bowles and the SBA,' says Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Businesses. But the flak directed at the Bowles healthcare stance has obscured the fact that big changes both in style and substance are taking place at the SBA. There is little doubt that an agency, that was for years a backwater led by a string of failed senatorial candidates, has been enjoying something of a renaissance. Bowles arrived in Washington as a political outsider. Armed with real business experience first at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, and then at the North Carolina bank he set up to serve small and medium-sized enterprises, he caught the president's eye during the election campaign. Bowles was appointed to the White House's influential National Economic Council, the first time an SBA administrator had been included at that level of policy making. 'The SBA has historically been moribund,' says Bowles. 'For eight years Reagan tried to get rid of it and for four years Bush ignored it.' Now, Bowles says, the SBA has direct access to the president and can act as his eyes and ears in the small business community. And the seat on the National Economic Council means the SBA can provide an input before policy is made. The SBA's starting point is that smaller businesses are creating more jobs than big business in the US, a view that has altered little in the wake of recent studies which suggest this case is over-stated. The latest assault on this conventional wisdom came in March from economists working under the auspices of the Commerce Department who questioned if there was any relationship between the size of manufacturing companies and their ability to create jobs. But the administration remains convinced that smaller companies are the engine of the economy. 'My bottom line is jobs - and not just any jobs, good jobs,' Bowles says. 'The jobs are created by the private sector, by smaller businesses.' But the SBA is trying to focus its scarce resources more on those companies most likely to create jobs. Bowles's most immediate impact has been to reduce the bureaucracy surrounding the agency's largest offering, the Loan Guarantee Programme, which is available to businesses refused credit by banks. 'I have heard people say: 'I would rather throw up than borrow from the SBA',' Bowles says. A new programme, called Lowdoc, has dramatically reduced the time businesses need to prepare applications for smaller loans. With a simple one-page application for loans under Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 67,000), rather than one that required the help of a consultant to complete, businesses are returning to the programme, Bowles says, a view supported by the small business lobby. The programme is now expected to guarantee more than Dollars 8bn in 1996, against Dollars 6.5bn this year. Responding to a growing lament that small businesses are 'most starved for working capital', Bowles is also making the SBA's working capital guarantee more flexible and more like a private-sector revolving facility. The administration has also successfully supported the introduction of a more user-friendly version of its Small Business Investment Company programme, an unusual partnership between government and venture capitalists, described in the article below. Such enthusiastic application is something that has not been associated with the SBA. The change has been welcomed by groups such as the National Small Business United, a lobbying organisation which represents larger businesses than the NFIB. John Galles, its executive vice-president, says Bowles has 'galvanised the SBA and given it a new sense of mission'. Faris says Bowles should be applauded for speeding up the Loan Guarantee Programme process and for moving SBA staff from Washington closer to the customer at district level. But he says small businesses are far more concerned by the 'alphabet soup of government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration'. By comparison to the ills these agencies can visit on small businesses, the SBA's contribution is marginal, he says. Bowles recognises the problem and has made the attack on regulations a priority. He has set up regular judicial reviews to look at the implications for small businesses of new legislation. But whether his attack on red tape will be believed is open to question. The doubt stems, again, from his healthcare position which critics say would heap extra costs on the shoulders of small business. 'We were impressed (by Bowles' seat on the National Economic Council) until he started arguing on healthcare reform,' says Faris. 'We are not sure now he is a good thing for small business.'</p>

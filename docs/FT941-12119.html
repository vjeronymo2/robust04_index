			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Japanese market buoyed by accord on reform The Tokyo stock market yesterday posted its third largest daily rise as investor confidence was boosted by the parliamentary agreement on political reform. The weekend compromise reached by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, with the opposition Liberal Democratic party on changes to the country's scandal-prone electoral system will enable him to concentrate on stimulating the economy, including a much-awaited income tax cut. The Nikkei average soared 1,471.24 points, or 7.8 per cent, to 20,229.12, rising above 20,000 for the first time in three months. The momentum carried through to trading today with the average up about 220 points to just over 20,450 at mid-morning. The parliamentary passage of the reform bills before Mr Hosokawa's meeting with US president Bill Clinton next week will give the Japanese premier room to take a political initiative on trade. But no sooner was the accord on political reform completed than Japan's seven-party coalition was plunged into an internal row on economic policy. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, hit back against a suggestion by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, that the government should cut income taxes in its next economic stimulus package, expected on Thursday, while deferring a decision on a rise in sales taxes. The government hopes to make an income tax cut the centrepiece of the package. Mr Fujii said Mr Takemura's remark made it hard for him to fulfil his responsibilities and complained to Mr Hosokawa. The finance ministry believes an income tax cut and a sales tax increase should be decided in tandem, because it does not wish to raise government debt by issuing deficit bonds. Mr Hosokowa has sided with the finance ministry and early today it appeared that Mr Fujii was winning the argument. He told a press conference that there had been 'no objections' in a cabinet meeting to his proposal that the two issues be handled together. Coalition members will meet tomorrow to try to settle tax policy, to allow the package to be launched a day later. Data released yesterday, meanwhile, painted a mixed picture of the economy. The construction ministry said housing starts in December rose 4.9 per cent from a year before. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, on the other hand, said sales by wholesalers and retailers in 1993 fell 4 percentage points from the previous year.

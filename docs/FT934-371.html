			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Singh threatens to quit: The Indian market scandal report that has upset the finance minister India has been thrown into political and economic uncertainty by the threatened resignation of Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister and principal architect of the country's wide-ranging economic reforms. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is under intense pressure to reject the resignation of Mr Singh, who offered to quit late last week after the publication of a parliamentary report into last year's Rs40bn (Pounds 856m) Bombay securities market scandal. MPs who wrote the report criticised failings throughout the financial system and held Mr Singh responsible for the shortcomings of officials entrusted with financial supervision. The ruling Congress (I) party, leading Indian business figures and newspapers and foreign companies dealing with India are all urging the prime minister to keep Mr Singh in the government. Supporters of economic reform said his departure would harm India's international reputation. Mr Bansi Dhar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, an employers' body, said: 'The resignation of Mr Singh would be a jolt to the process of liberalisation.' Mr Singh's resignation move was made public late on Christmas Eve, by which time the Bombay Stock Exchange, the country's largest, was already closed. It does not reopen until January 3. However, prices have fallen sharply in out-of-hours deals. The balance of opinion in Delhi last night was that Mr Singh's resignation would be rejected. But much would depend on a parliamentary debate on the scandal, due today and tomorrow. If his record comes under further attack he may quit, even if the prime minister wants him to stay. Mr Singh may also want to hear a whole-hearted statement of support from the prime minister, who has yet to make any public comment on the resignation. Mr Narasimha Rao's position is complicated by the fact that two other ministers are also criticised in the report, both more seriously than Mr Singh. But neither of these two men - Mr B Shankaranand, health minister, and Mr Rameshwar Thakur, rural development minister - wants to quit. Persuading Mr Shankaranand and Mr Thakur to go, while urging Mr Singh to stay, will test even the wily Mr Narasimha Rao's political skills. For 61-year-old Mr Singh such horse-trading could be too much to bear. An academic economist and career bureaucrat, he dislikes dealing with the dirt in Indian politics. Loyal as he is to the prime minister, he is even more loyal to his own sense of honour. He feels deeply hurt by the scandal committee's criticisms; probably nothing less than their withdrawal would fully satisfy him. He has said little about his resignation offer except that reform would continue, even without him. His officials are busy preparing the 1993-1994 budget, due in mid-February, which is expected to contain a new tranche of reforms, including measures to further open financial markets to competition. While a new minister could easily pick up the reins of budget-making in time for February, Mr Singh's departure would damage morale in the ministry because he is so closely identified with the liberalisation programme. Finance Ministry officials have had to fight frequent battles with other ministries to advance reform, and have relied on Mr Singh's support. But what really matters - more than the person of the finance minister  - is the prime minister's and the ruling party's commitment to reform. In his first 18 months in office, Mr Singh achieved much because the mid-1991 economic crisis, when India sought emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund, was so serious that even the most conservative Congress MPs accepted reform was necessary. Import duties were cut, internal controls were partly liberalised and foreign companies made welcome for the first time in over 20 years. Mr Singh and his fellow reformers gradually moved closer to reforming the core of India's economic weakness: its subsidy-pampered farmers, inefficient bureaucracy and overmanned state-owned industry. But they have been forced to hold back from really overhauling these vested interests, because they include some of the Congress party's staunchest supporters. For the past year, the prime minister has been unable to tackle these thorny issues because of the political turmoil caused by the storming of the Ayodhya mosque and the unrest which followed. But, although Mr Narasimha Rao says he fully supports more reform, he has yet to demonstrate a willingness to press ahead with politically difficult changes. Losing Mr Singh might erode his will further.</p>

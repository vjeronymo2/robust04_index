			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] On 3 February the Social Democrats for  the EU [European Union] presented their manifesto of arguments  for EU membership. According to an article by Ewa Stenberg in  the 3 February DAGENS NYHETER on page 9, the kickoff of the  Social Democratic campaign for membership ends what some SDP  [Social Democratic Party] members had criticized as a period of  passivity in which the party left it to the conservatives to  argue for membership. Anders Lindstrom, a member of the group's  board, said that this passivity gave many Social Democratic  voters the impression that "the European Union is a rightist  project that will require reduced social benefits in Sweden."  The manifesto tries to convince voters otherwise, arguing that  EU membership is necessary to maintain the welfare state.  Sweden can only take measures to stimulate the economy and  eliminate the high unemployment that threatens the welfare state  in the context of a larger market; the massive speculation  during the 1992 currency crisis showed that a small country  cannot keep the economy in balance by itself. The manifesto also  cites a common security policy and joint action on the  environment as benefits of membership. Lindstrom believes that  if Europe had had a common security policy, "the war in the  former Yugoslavia could have been prevented."    Even the liberal DAGENS NYHETER praised the Social  Democrats'  manifesto. In an editorial on 4 February on page 2, the paper  said: "The program is aggressive and modern. It focuses not on  the Swedish exception but on a radical ambition to join in and  improve Europe's employment situation, welfare, environment, and  security together with other countries and parties."</p>

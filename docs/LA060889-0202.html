			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. PRESSURE BLAMED FOR HONG KONG REFUGEE CRUSH  </P> <P> The United States is partly to blame for a huge influx of Vietnamese boat  people into Hong Kong, a relief official said today.  </P> <P> Chris Bale, Hong Kong director of the British-based charity organization Oxfam,  said Washington had applied pressure on Southeast Asian nations to provide  asylum to boat people fleeing Vietnam but then failed to resettle enough of  them in the United States.  </P> <P> Bale told a news conference that Washington must accept that eventual mandatory  repatriation of many boat people to Vietnam is the only solution.  </P> <P> He said U.S. officials are telling Asians: "No, no, you can't send them back to  Vietnam because that's a nasty Communist regime. But on the other hand, we're  not going to resettle them."  </P> <P> He added, "They can't have it both ways."  </P> <P> Hong Kong has more than 41,000 boat people crowded into camps and detention  centers and says it is no longer able to cope with the influx.  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Can watchdog stop another Maxwell? - Serious Money Two cheers and one hiss for the pensions White Paper. Overall, it is a lot tougher than expected. Company pensions will be more secure and personal pensions will be more flexible. So, most people should be able to make sensible provision for their retirement. The worry is that the new watchdog might not be tough enough to stop another Maxwell. (Analysis: page III). The pension proposals underline, yet again, the conflict between having total security and getting the best investment returns. Understandably, given their genesis in the Maxwell pension raids, these proposals give security top billing. The new solvency rules are calculated on the assumption that the scheme might be closed tomorrow. Fair enough. But the cost of this security blanket is that some funds may produce a lower level of return than they could have done without the new restrictions. Those with a high proportion of older members will need to hold a correspondingly high proportion of gilt-edged stocks, rather than equities. But, if historic patterns hold true, equities are likely to do much better than gilts over the long term. Initial calculations suggest that if pension funds kept their present asset mix (80 per cent equities/20 per cent bonds), they would provide an annual return of 17 per cent over 20 years. If they move to a 50/50 split, the return would drop below 16 per cent. This calculation is as relevant to your own investments as it is to pension funds. As a very rough rule of thumb, an individual investing on a reasonably long-term basis should benefit from investing the majority of his money in equities. In a real sense, they are the safer choice - if 'safe' is re-defined as 'likely to produce better returns'. This counter-intuitive logic can be applied also to overseas investment. Many people instinctively regard investing in foreign stock markets as riskier than confining themselves to the UK. But Britain is a mature economy with only a few growth businesses. The emerging markets story has been horribly over-hyped. Yet, the basic argument for an international investment portfolio with at least some money in emerging markets remains valid. Sticking to the UK is the global equivalent of keeping your life's savings in a box under the bed. Will Jeremy have the last laugh? Jeremy is the name given by venture capital group 3i (see page V) to the private investors who buy its shares. Sid, you will remember, was the plebian purchaser of British Gas shares. Jeremy has a better education and more money. And, so far, 385,000 Jeremies have registered to receive prospectuses for the 3i offer, which closes on July 6. This week, some critics argued that Jeremy had more money than sense. What was he doing buying a new issue when the equity market was collapsing and lesser issues were being pulled in all directions? Was he really prepared to buy on a 13 1/2 per cent discount to net assets when seemingly comparable trusts were trading on more? Well, perhaps. But there is another way of looking at it. At last, private investors are learning to look for value, invest for the long term, and buy near the bottom rather than the top of the market. Now for something altogether more practical: the BP dividend. Shareholders are this year being given a novel choice. Do they want to take their dividend in cash - or would they prefer extra BP shares worth 25 per cent more than the cash dividend?* The novelty lies not in the choice, as such, but the fact that shareholders are being offered the equivalent of the gross (rather than the net) dividend. BP's 460,000 private shareholders should certainly consider taking the shares. But there are several caveats. First, if your shares are held in a personal equity plan, there is no significant advantage in opting for the share alternative. You need also to be careful if you are thinking of selling the extra shares - as many income-orientated investors may. Conventional stockbrokers have minimum charges ranging from Pounds 9 to as high as Pounds 40. So, BP shareholders with relatively small holdings will find that the extra value of the share alternative could be swallowed up by the costs of realising it. The way round this is to use Hoare Govett's cheap dealing service, which has a basic commission of 1 per cent with no minimum. But the hassle factor means it is probably not worth considering unless you expect to use it more than once. *Inquiries: 0279-444 488.</p>

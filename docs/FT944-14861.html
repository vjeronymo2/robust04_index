			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Croatia peace plan takes shape Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN official in former Yugoslavia, said yesterday that a 'complex and ambitious' peace plan for Croatia would be completed soon. His comment was the latest hint of intense diplomatic activity aimed at resolving the future of Serb-occupied parts of Croatia, and thus paving the way for normal relations between Belgrade and Zagreb. Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman said last week that 'various initiatives in various places' were in progress which would give journalists 'a lot to discuss' once they were made public. Mr Peter Galbraith, US ambassador to Zagreb who is one of the four members of an international mediation group on Croatia, has suggested that Croatia could draw on the US, Canadian or Swiss models in granting autonomy to Serb-dominated areas. About a third of Croatia's territory is under de facto Serb control following the Serb-Croat war of 1991-92. Diplomats say that Serb politicians in the occupied areas of Croatia - who claim to have established an independent state - have become more flexible recently, apparently under pressure from Belgrade.</p>

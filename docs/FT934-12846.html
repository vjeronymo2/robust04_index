			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Industry will argue against tax increases INDUSTRIALISTS are expected to put more pressure on the government this week to refrain from increasing taxes in next month's Budget on the grounds that this would damage faltering signs of an upturn. The message is to be delivered at a private meeting on Thursday between Treasury and Department of Trade and Industry officials and representatives of about 20 companies including Grand Metropolitan, TI, Unigate, Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury, British Steel and Barclays Bank. The gathering is expected to feature arguments that any rise in taxes in the November 30 Budget, coming on top of tax increases of nearly Pounds 7bn already announced for next April, might damage confidence and delay the recovery. Two Treasury officials at the meeting will relay any substantive messages to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Government figures on Friday showed that the pace of growth in non-oil gross domestic product slowed in the third quarter of this year. Chairman of Thursday's gathering will be Mr Walter Eltis, economic adviser to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. It is being held as part of a general effort by the government to form closer links with companies to follow better their perceptions about the recovery. The most senior person from the business world will be Mr David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, formerly the speciality chemicals subsidiary of ICI. Northern Foods, the Weir pumpmaking company, ICL, Rover and the Meggitt engineering group are due to send their finance directors. Other businesses to be represented at the meeting are Courtaulds Textiles, George Wimpey and the Post Office. Executives from the companies involved have fed data to Mr Eltis to enable him to gain a better feel of the recovery independently of the Treasury. Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, who has been closely involved with Mr Eltis's project, said he was 'extremely nervous' about the recovery. Mr Martin Beer, a Unigate executive, said the business world was worried about tax increases. Mr Clarke is meeting Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, and Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, at the Treasury on Wednesday to hear their ideas for his Budget strategy. They are expected to add to warnings about how tax rises could harm business.</p>

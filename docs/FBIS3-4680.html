			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroaki Ito, AERA General Bureau for America: </F> "Japan and the United States Should Cool Themselves"]    [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Kantor's stern face,  which was reminiscent of a bird of prey, was more reddish than  usual: "Please take a look at this chart. The market shares of  Japanese and U.S. companies where Motorola Inc. can carry on  free competition, in areas of Japan other than Tokyo and Nagoya,  are fifty-fifty. However, the same company's share in Tokyo and  Nagoya is only 1.17 percent." "This is the result of nine  years' negotiations and of three agreements. This is the fact  which is most illustrative of why we have adopted new economic  framework talks which emphasize results."    The two line graphs on the chart clearly illustrated the  difference of the shares: one graph showed that the number of  users of NTT's [Nippon Telephone and Telegraph's] cellular  telephones exceeded 300,000, while the other showed that the  number of users of Motorola's cellular telephones did not reach  13,000.    Concerning the opening of markets for automobiles and  cellular telephones, Trade Representative Kantor stated on 15  February that sanctions would be imposed on Japan on the grounds  of violations of an agreement reached between Japan and the  United States in 1989. That was four days after the breakdown of  the new Japan-U.S. economic negotiations.    The yen rate, which was 108 yen to the dollar on 10 February  in the Tokyo market before the consecutive holidays, rose to 103  yen to the dollar on the European and U.S. markets on 14  February and to 101 yen to the dollar temporarily on 15 February.    The line graph, "which is close to the ground," was shown on  television and it disarmed the criticism within the United  States that the U.S. Government intends to enforce managed trade  on Japan, as Representative Kantor, who delivered a fervent  speech, had expected    President Clinton repeatedly said at a news conference that  "it was a mere accident that Kantor's speech coincided with the  summit," but the miraculous timing is not "a mere accident."    At the end of last year, the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative suddenly moved up consideration of the agreement  between the two countries, originally scheduled for March this  year, to immediately after the summit.    On 10 January and on 13 February, the U.S. Government and  Motorola Inc. leveled a new demand with punitive provisions that  "unless improved measures are implemented, the license of JMCC  [Japan Mobile Communications Company] -- a firm which handles  Motorola's cellular telephones along with NTT's cellular  telephones -- will be confiscated. Thus they have cut off  Japan's retreat, creating a situation in which nothing is left  but imposing sanctions.  <H5>  Everything Went as Planned by the U.S. Government </H5>   At a Japan-U.S. joint news conference held on 11 February,  President Clinton twice suggested: "The exchange rate may be  used as an index of objective criteria." The dealers twice  received "a signal leading to a higher yen," and it was natural  for the yen to rise.    Huge uproars, which lasted for several days following the  breakdown of the talks, were merely the results of a series of  explosions of time bombs carefully planted by the U.S.  Government up to that time. Everything went as planned by the  U.S. Government.    There are more "gambits" in store for shaking Japan.    U.S. Trade Representative Kantor said: "We will make a list  of sanctions reaching the scale of several hundreds of million  dollars and will announce the list. The targets of sanctions  will not be confined to the field of telecommunications." There  is a strong possibility that a wide variety of items will become  targets, in addition to automobiles and auto parts. If a list  of sanctions is actually announced, it is inevitable that the  industries thus designated will scream.    The United States expects the displeasure of Japan's  industrial community and the Japanese public to be vented on the  bureaucrats of the Finance Ministry who formulated a  comprehensive package of economic measures -- which was  criticized sharply by Vice President Gore as "disappointing" --  and on the bureaucrats of the International Trade and Industry  Ministry who "were prepared for a breakdown in the negotiations."    The Super 301 clause, which is soon to be reinstated by  executive order, is "very effective" as a tool for shaking  Japan. In principle, on the basis of reports which are compiled  by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative at the end of  March every year, countries and sectors engaging in unfair trade  practices will be specified, and if negotiations break down,  sanctions will be imposed.    Under Article 301 of the Trade Act, investigations can be  initiated following a complaint of the business community, but  under the Super 301 clause, the government can periodically  investigate and expose unfair trade practices. Therefore, it is  easy to make political use of Super 301.    First of all, the mere fact that Super 301 "has been  revived"  is a threat to Japan. In addition, by setting specific  deadlines for trade partners or practices prior to the next  Japan-U.S. summit in July, pressure can be brought to bear on  new economic conferences.    Toward the end of March, the shares of foreign products in  the Japanese market for 1993 will be determined on the basis of  the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement. It is certain that the  share for 1993 will drop below the 20 percent figure for 1992;  this situation can also trigger sanctions according to the  intention of the United States.  <H5>  The Interest of the U.S. Public Is Not in the Trade Deficits </H5>   Richard Gephardt, a Democratic floor leader in the House of  Representatives who takes a hard-line attitude toward Japan, is  exerting pressure by saying, "We are preparing a law affecting  Japan, under which sanctions can be imposed on the basis of the  market share of foreign products." A banking law, which is  aimed at imposing sanctions against Japan, is expected to pass  Congress soon.    However, Director Kurobushi [name as published] from the  Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation looks at the  situation in this way: "Such an upsurge is confined to part of  the government and Congress and has rather lost the support of  the whole." Because of an economic recovery, the interest of  the U.S. public is not in the trade deficits. Compared to the  times when radio-cassette recorders produced by Japanese  companies were destroyed, "pressure on the government and  Congress is almost nil."    The imposition of sanctions will inevitably affect related  industries in the United States. It is necessary to show in  detail at public hearings how to reach an estimate of damages  due to unfair trade practices, or how to tell what effects the  imposition of sanctions will have on domestic industries.    Further appreciation of the yen will dampen the Japanese  economy. This appreciation is capable of thwarting the Clinton  administration, which is attempting to increase employment and  maintain economic growth through the promotion of exports.  Furthermore, if Japan's current account surplus, which is a  matter of great concern, increases due to a decrease in imports,  which in turn is a result of recession, there will be more  difficulties.    Threats are not effective unless they are seen as serious.  Elaborately planted time bombs and a host of laws providing for  sanctions will have no effect unless they are seen as serious.</p>

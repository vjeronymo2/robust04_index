			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in the transport fleet,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Develop corrosion-directed inspections and prevention programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Review the adequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Review and update the Supplemental Inspection Documents (SID); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Assess repair quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The working group assigned to review the Fokker Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed its work on Item (2) and has developed a baseline program for controlling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness of the Model F&hyph;27  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fleet. The program is contained in Fokker Document SE&hyph;291, ``F&hyph;27 Corrosion Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program,'' with revisions through October 1, 1993. (Hereafter, this publication is referred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to as ``the Document.'') The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority for the Netherlands, classified this Document as mandatory and issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 91&hyph;113, Issue 2, dated June 26, 1992, in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in The Netherlands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2.1 of the Document defines three levels of corrosion: Level l corrosion is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that which does not exceed certain limits; Level 2 corrosion is that which exceeds those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits; and Level 3 corrosion is significant corrosion which is potentially an urgent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airworthiness concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the Document provide general guidelines to develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion prevention and control program. These guidelines address such things as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline program, implementation ages, access for inspection, repetitive inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals, operating environment, newly-acquired airplanes, general cleanliness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane, and the fact that sampling is unreliable in effectively controlling corrosion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2.4 of the Document sets forth the general implementation schedule for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion inspection/control program. As described in that section, each ``aircraft zone'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned an ``Initial Inspection Time'' and a ``Repeat Inspection Time.'' The program is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to each aircraft zone on all Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes whose age has reached  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or exceeded the Initial Inspection Time for that zone. For airplanes that have not reached  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or exceeded the Initial Inspection Time of the specific aircraft zone, a particular inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> task has to be performed before the airplane has reached the Initial Inspection Time for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific aircraft zone, or before the Repeat Inspection Time of the task is exceeded (a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum of 6 years), whichever occurs later. For airplanes that have already reached or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded the Initial Inspection Time of the specific aircraft zone, a particular inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has to be performed before the Repeat Inspection Time of the task is exceeded or within 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, whichever occurs first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2.4 of the Document also identifies the specific aircraft zones that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the program, and describes the ``basic task'' to be accomplished in each defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft zone as part of the baseline program, along with the initial inspection time and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeat inspection time for each area, and other information necessary to carry out the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for each area. The Document defines a ``basic task'' as including not only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertinent visual inspections of all primary and secondary structures, but any necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repairs, application of sealants or corrosion inhibitors, and other follow-on procedures, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well. A basic task may also include detailed visual and non-destructive inspections (NDI);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where NDI's are employed, adequate standards and procedures must be developed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly recorded for the area inspected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2.5 establishes the procedures for reporting the results of the inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted under the corrosion prevention and control program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2.6 provides for periodic review and update of the data contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since corrosion is likely to exist or develop on airplanes of this type design, an AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is proposed which would require adoption of a corrosion prevention and control program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is equivalent to or better than the program specified in the Document previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described. Operators would be permitted to accomplish this either by performing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific basic tasks described in the Document (the ``task-by-task method''), or by revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their FAA-approved maintenance program to include such a program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) of the proposal sets forth the proposed compliance times for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial basic task of each affected aircraft zone. These compliance times are measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a date one year after the effective date of the final rule. (The proposed compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times are consistent with those of other similar AD's that the FAA has issued on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject.) Generally, operators would be required to complete the initial basic task before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaching the ``Initial Inspection Time'' plus one ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft zone, as detailed in the Document. The basic task would be required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeated at a time interval not to exceed the ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, as detailed in the Document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) includes paragraph (a)(1)(iii), which states that, for each area that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the initial inspection time for that area, operators must accomplish the initial basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> task at a minimum rate of one such area every two years, beginning one year after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of the final rule. The FAA recognizes that this may cause a hardship on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some small operators; in those circumstances, the FAA anticipates evaluating requests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment to the implementation rate on a case-by-case basis under the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (h) of the proposed rule. (A note to this effect is included in the proposal.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators should note that the proposal does not contain a paragraph specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to address repair actions. The FAA considers that any repairs would be carried out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily as a part of each basic task, as it is defined in the Document. As discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously, a ``basic task'' is defined in the Document as including not only the pertinent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection, but any necessary repairs, application of corrosion inhibitors, and other follow-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on procedures, as well. Paragraph (a) contains a note to reference the portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document that defines a basic task, and to emphasize the importance of these corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of the proposal provides for an optional method of complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule. In lieu of performing the task-by-task requirements proposed in paragraph (a),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators may revise their FAA-approved maintenance/inspection programs to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion prevention and control program defined in the Document or an equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program approved by the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) also would require that, subsequent to the accomplishment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial basic task, any extensions of Repeat Inspection Time intervals specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document must be approved by the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any operator electing to comply with proposed paragraph (b) would be permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use an alternative recordkeeping method to that otherwise required by Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations (FAR) section 91.417 or section 121.380, provided it is approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA and is included in a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to questions raised previously concerning recordkeeping and record retention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements as they relate to the programmatic approach proposed in this AD action and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other similar proposals that have been issued applicable to other airplane models, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offers the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Sanchez] </F>   [Text] Saltillo, Coahuila, 26 May -- Ernesto Zedillo fended  off bad omens of an electoral process that is just 12 weeks  away, rejecting predictions of a split within the PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] that would make it weak like  in 1988, which in turn could cause its downfall in the  presidential elections. "I do not share such a catastrophic  outlook; not only will we be a competitive party but a winning  party," the PRI presidential candidate said.    The presidential hopeful also mentioned his visit to the  National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and said the  arguments made by members of the University Student Council  (CEU) -- that the university's autonomy had been violated --  "speak for themselves," because apparently some members of the  CEU participated in violent acts, and "I suppose they must feel  very embarrassed about their conduct in view of how they are  being condemned by other parts of the university."    Zedillo insisted he was at UNAM "under absolutely normal  conditions" and said political arguments that try to make it  seem otherwise do not jive with UNAM's tradition of culture,  plurality, and tolerance. He noted: "I was respectful, knowing  full well that other candidates had already been there --  Zedillo was the first PRI candidate in UNAM's history to  campaign there -- and I believe, for the university students,  this has been a break with an intolerant past, a past where a  minority infringed on the rights of a majority."    Zedillo explained that as a public official, he had visited  the School of Economics once, the School of Chemistry three  times, and research centers several times under exactly similar  conditions.    In a meeting with reporters who are covering his  presidential  campaign activities shortly before traveling to the pro-PAN  [National Action Party] state of Chihuahua, Zedillo answered  other questions, all of them linked to expectations about the  results of August's federal elections.    [EL FINANCIERO] Perhaps we are on the verge of entering a  period in which the percentage of votes won by the winning  presidential candidate will be less than 50 percent, which would  break new historical ground. Are we ready for this? Will the  PRI continue to be a strong party with this kind of percentage  of the vote?    [Zedillo] The PRI is competing with eight parties. The  Constitution does not include any particular provision on voting  percentages; the Constitution refers to a relative, not an  absolute, majority. The Constitution and the law clearly  establish who wins the elections and how they are won. I am  very concerned about this obsession with percentages. The  Constitution is very clear. We are just going to enforce the  law.    In a good mood, Zedillo answered reporters' questions and  said his new invitation to opposition candidates that another  debate be held is not a matter of seeing who extends the  invitation first. He said: "The thing is to hold the debate,  but I have no doubt in my mind that on 24 April I called for a  debate and on 12 May reiterated my call. For a minute there,  they had me as the loser." He said that he has still not  received a formal response, adding that he hopes all candidates  agree to a new debate.    A difficult issue to face was the internal conflict within  the PRI during the selection process for candidates to Congress.  Zedillo termed these irregularities or incidents as "normal for  a party with the PRI's democratic and decisive participation."    Zedillo remarked that according to the PRI's past  experiences  and those of other parties now, the PRI "has had an exemplary  process." He hopes these will be isolated events, although in  the end the number of conflicts is minimal compared to the  complexity of the very process.    [EL FINANCIERO] Are there risks of breaks or a repeat of  what  happened in 1988?    [Zedillo] No, in the process held three years ago [number as  published] there were more incidents than there are now. Given  circumstances in the country, it is an exemplary process; these  incidents are normal. There is freedom in the party, and I am  satisfied and do not foresee a risk. To the contrary, I see a  united party, a party strengthened to wage the campaign we need  to wage to give it our best shot.    Zedillo emphasized that he does not agree with the  catastrophic vision of the country. Mexico has made  considerable progress and although it is facing serious  problems, the population is recognizing its own effort, Zedillo  added. And he concluded: "I think the basic conditions, those  that count in an electoral process will allow us to move toward  an orderly electoral process, in terms of legality, and, in the  PRI's case, with a strong and united party."</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft falls 27% and restructuring continues WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based group which last week announced a severe dividend curtailment to dampen expectations ahead of its results, yesterday reported a 27 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.49m for the year to end-March. The figure for the previous year amounted to Pounds 6.11m before taking into account an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.3m. Whitecroft is undergoing a reconstruction to get through the recession. It is still disengaging from property but has largely completed reorganisation of its lighting, building products, medical cotton fibre and textiles businesses, with cost savings now likely. The final dividend curtailment to 0.7p making a 4p (10p) total, resulted from an extraordinary item, an extra Pounds 8m gross provision for withdrawal from property development. The figure worked out at Pounds 6.43m net and was on top of a Pounds 5m net provision made last year. The commercial property portfolio has now been revalued at Pounds 20m. Whitecroft sold its housebuilding division in January, reducing borrowings by Pounds 6m. The ongoing sales of houses retained are expected to bring in Pounds 4m, with another Pounds 800,000 of deferred consideration to come. Mr Peter Goold, chairman, said all construction was completed and several lettings had now been achieved. The biggest single development was a complex of shops and offices in Sheffield. Smaller ones were mainly scattered in the Thames Valley. Likely prices would be balanced against financing costs to optimise future disposals. On the pre-tax line the pre-tax comparison of Pounds 6.11m has been restated as Pounds 2.81m following the Accounting Standards Board's new consensus on restructuring costs. This required Whitecroft to charge restructuring of its textiles division to the 1990-91 current account, although one gain was to reduce last year's tax bill by Pounds 1m. Turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 129.19m and operating profits 48 per cent to Pounds 4.6m. However, sustained investment in computer aided design and flexible manufacturing systems enabled the lighting division to make a profit of Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 6.68m) in spite of recession. It used technology to process larger numbers of smaller orders efficiently as big orders for office blocks withered. The niche market, medical cotton fibres business, fell slightly to Pounds 1.79m, while textiles - a dyeing, finishing and coatings business - held at Pounds 700,000. Building products lost Pounds 1.02m after breaking even last year. Demand fell for textured wallcoatings, but Mr Goold was expecting good progress from high performance, fire-resistant doors as safety regulations push up standards in offices and public buildings.</p>

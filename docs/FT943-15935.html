			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Economic policy restated in wake of Keys' departure The following is the edited text of an open letter from Mr Alec Erwin, deputy finance minister, to be published today by the Johannesburg-based Business Day newspaper. It sets out the economic policy position of South Africa's government of national unity under President Nelson Mandela following the decision of Mr Derek Keys to step down as finance minister. 'Mr Derek Keys has the full support of the president, his cabinet colleagues and those who work with him in the decision he has taken. He was prepared to enter the government of national unity to help it on its way. There can be very little doubt that he has done this magnificently. He will be in government for a few more vital months as we draft the white paper on the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), work on the 1995-96 budget, prepare to enter international markets and set in motion the wide-ranging work programme of the new government. We will benefit from his surgical insights, knowledge and deep understanding. . . 'Speaking from the ranks of the ANC there is no doubt a sense of disappointment that such a capable minister needs to withdraw. But President Mandela has also set a humane precedent that even in these historic times the individual lives of leaders are deserving of respect. . . 'What is remarkable in our circumstances is how quickly a common strategy on the key socio-economic area has emerged. . . This rapid progress has been possible because an elegant and fiscally and administratively sound mechanism was developed to implement the RDP. This arose out of an important cross-fertilisation of ideas in which Mr Keys provided catalytic insights and understanding. A clear strategy is emerging. . . broadly supported by all parties in the national assembly. 'The essential features of this strategy are: An overall programme that addresses basic needs, human resources, viable economic growth and democraticisation of society. The mobilisation of resources in all areas, not only in government. . . .reordering expenditure priorities of government to facilitate implementation, rather than an increase in the level of government expenditure. Rising inflation and balance of payments bottlenecks would destroy the RDP, hence fiscal and monetary discipline are integral to the RDP. They are not just expedients to encourage people to lend us money. . . 'Three things flow from this. First, the RDP Fund acts as an incentive to effect savings in government expenditure that are then applied to immediate needs. . . It focuses on organising delivery efficiently rather than throwing money at problems. 'Second, we are not going on a borrowing spree to fund. . . the RDP. Our borrowing strategy will focus on containment of the deficit, lowering costs of borrowing, establishing a favourable strategic position in international markets and developing links between finance, technology, expertise and markets. 'Third, Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio with responsibility for the RDP, will be working to co-ordinate and channel a wide range of resources in the private sector, parastatals and non-governmental organisations towards the RDP. 'The strategy and mechanism are coherent, bold and touched with the Keys magic. They are fully supported by the government of national unity. Markets understandably respond to events but countries reshape their destiny by determination and the combined efforts of their people. We have started well and will continue on this path.'</p>

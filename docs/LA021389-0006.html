			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 99: 'THE BIG RAID'  </P> <P> In six years as chief engineer and general manager of the Los Angeles City Fire  Department, I have never felt more impelled to address the public on a pending  community peril as I do now. Recent trauma care events in our city and  surrounding areas have convinced me that lives are in grave jeopardy.  </P> <P> By way of example, on Jan. 25, in the middle of the week, eight trauma care  centers temporarily closed due to saturation and diverted our paramedic units  away from their vitally needed services. The closure of 19 emergency rooms on  the same day, and for the same reason, further exacerbated the situation. We  are drastically extending our precious transport time, delivering trauma  patients to more distant emergency facilities. To compound matters, our fire  companies that respond to many Emergency Medical Services calls, as well as to  fire and similar emergency incidents, are less available due to this rapidly  deteriorating situation. Further hospital closures that appear imminent,  according to health officials, could cause our city's EMS system to suffer  cardiac arrest!  </P> <P> Since 1983, eight of our original trauma centers have closed permanently due to  lack of funds for the medically indigent. With the recent announcements that  the governor has reduced the proposed 1989 budget for medically indigent funds  by $27 million and the inability of the county to continue its funding, many  other hospitals have discussed closing. If this happens, our increased  paramedic transport and out-of-service time spans will place traumatized  citizens in mortal peril needlessly. The county does not have the financial  resources to make up the losses of every hospital in the system. The state,  however, does have funds available from Proposition 99, but the governor has  diverted these funds for other purposes.  </P> <P> I have written the governor, urging him to redress the emergency room closure  problems by utilizing the tobacco tax funds. You can help change his mind on  this vital matter by also writing to him.  </P> <P> DONALD O. MANNING  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Fire Dept.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORK FOR PRISONERS  </P> <P> In response to David Glidden's column "Put Inmates to Work, Make Prison  Produce," Opinion, April 1:  </P> <P> Obviously, Glidden has no contact with prisons or their inmates. Prison slave  labor is alive and well, it is called UNICOR, the Federal Prison Industries.  Prisoners are paid from 22 cents per hour to $1.10 per hour to produce goods  for the military (in direct competition with "major corporations"), the  judicial branch of government and prisons themselves. It is a  multimillion-dollar industry. UNICOR makes military uniforms, sheets, curtains,  furniture, cables used on aircraft carriers, safety glasses/goggles, business  forms, etc. Part of the profits are used to fund the education programs at all  federal prisons.  </P> <P> I have a master's degree in education. I taught school for 10 years. When I was  arrested, I was an executive assistant at a concert company. I have no prior  arrests. I've never been in trouble. I am 42 years old, white, female. I teach  the GED program to fellow inmates who are helping themselves to be more  productive when they leave here. My crime -- I unwittingly carried 2 kilos of  cocaine from Los Angeles to Seattle by air. My sentence -- 8 years, 1 month  with no possibility of parole. We are not "caged animals." We don't live  "passively like domestic pets." We work very hard. Before teaching GED, I  worked in the prison kitchen cleaning dishes, floors and pots and pans. For 98  hours of work, I was paid $10.78. Candy bars cost 55 cents and copies cost 15  cents a piece.  </P> <P> I am not "plotting" my next crime. I did not plot the last one. I have  discovered many women like myself, who were working, trying to make ends met,  but ended up supplementing their income. We are not waiting for our next  opportunity "to prey on society." We want to go home and take care of our  children.  </P> <P> Perhaps, if inmates had been given decent-paying jobs, they would have had the  "byproduct of self-respect," and never been incarcerated. It costs $25,000 per  year to keep me in prison; that is more money than I ever made teaching school.  </P> <P> JACQUELINE HENDRICKS  </P> <P> Dublin, Calif.  </P></p>

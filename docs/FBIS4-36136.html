			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Al-Majali Unable To Carry Out </F> Major Reshuffle of Jordanian Cabinet"]    [Text] Amman -- Reliable Jordanian political sources said  yesterday that Prime Minister Dr. 'Abdal-Salam al-Majali has so  far been unable to persuade a number of political figures to  join his government in a major reshuffle he intended to carry  out to enlarge the government's political base and contain  opposition to his government's internal and foreign policies.    The sources added that al-Majali told people close to him  that he would not be reshuffling his government "because many  qualified political figures have refused to join that  government." They noted that al-Majali "has renewed his  accusations claiming that certain political forces considered  loyal to some former prime ministers were trying to bring down  the government," and that the government now has no clear vision  regarding the question of the reshuffle which has been pending  and which has resulted in "complete paralysis and chaos in  government organs."    According to parliamentary sources, the efforts made by some  ministers to pacify the House of Representatives' Financial  Committee have failed. One of the committee members told  AL-HAYAH that the committee "will not allow its members to be  used in a government ploy to pass future decisions to raise the  prices of water, electricity, and other services." The  parliamentary sources emphasized that the government's future  "is now in the hands of his majesty the king," who "might take  surgical and dramatic steps."    The political circles are unanimous that al-Majali's failure  to carry out a cabinet reshuffle means that the end is near for  his government, perhaps not more than a few weeks away.  Observers believe that al-Majali's government has been lumbered  with some ministers who are seen as a burden on its shoulders  and who have failed to promote basic relations with the National  Assembly and the political parties. Some sources say that  al-Majali had hoped to replace a number of ministers through a  cabinet reshuffle, including First Deputy Prime Minister Dr.  Ma'n Abu-Nuwar and Second Deputy Prime Minister and Education  Minister Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, because of the reservations of the  House of Representatives and political circles about their  characters and political trends." [quotation marks as published]    Al-Majali's government has also been the target of severe  criticism by senior Royal Court officials because of what they  describe as the government's "excessive enthusiasm" for the  Palestinian-Israeli agreements. They believe that "it would not  be wise" to keep the present government because the peace  process requires "a different strategy" for dealing with the  future Palestinian entity in the occupied Arab territory.</p>

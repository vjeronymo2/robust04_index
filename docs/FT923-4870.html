			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Collor scandal has put Brazil's economic reforms on ice: Political uncertainty has frozen the process of financial modernisation and seen old evils return TO MANY Brazilian businessmen 1992 has been a wasted year in the quest for economic stabilisation. They have already transferred their hopes to next year. In some ways, however, the economy has proved remarkably resilient to the corruption scandal which this week led to the initiation of an impeachment process against President Fernando Collor. Since the scandal began in May, stock markets have swung with the day's rumours but the currency has remained stable. August's monetary expansion was the lowest this year at 15 per cent and this week the central bank succeeded in selling Dollars 1bn of government bonds. Investment decisions are generally on hold, though the central bank said yesterday that the stock market last month suffered a net outflow of Dollars 80m in foreign capital. What apparent stability there is is a tribute to Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, who says his biggest achievement has been preventing Mr Collor resorting to massive spending or an economic shock programme alleviating the recession in the hope of winning some popularity. 'You can't imagine how many people are going to the president each day and suggesting this,' he says. However the political uncertainty is producing a return to the process of protective pricing, pushing inflation above the 20 to 22 per cent a month level it has stuck at for almost a year. Mr Moreira, who once predicted 2 per cent inflation by December, now admits that 'to push inflation down in this climate is very difficult and I don't expect it to decrease much this year'. The 'Collorgate' crisis has had even worse effects on the government's attempts to balance its budget, distracting congressional attention from a USDollars 20bn tax reform package which the ministry warns must be approved this year if Brazil is to avoid 'fiscal disaster' and the collapse of its agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Failure to implant fiscal reform means the economic team is continuing to rely on a policy of high interest rates as its only weapon against inflation. This has deepened industrial recession, causing a fall in tax revenues, while domestic debt grew 156 per cent in real terms in the first six months of this year - a problem the central bank governor refers to as 'the elephant in the basement'. More than 40 per cent of next year's budget is devoted to debt servicing and amortisation. Tax revenues are expected to be down 13 per cent this year partly because of increased evasion spurred by the revelation of high-level corruption. Next year's deficit-based budget, completed this week, highlights the parlous state of government finances. Unable to increase revenues, the government plans 22 per cent cuts in investment. This follows a 35 per cent, or USDollars 8bn, reduction this year. Mr Moreira admits: 'It's incredible how things are not collapsing with the cuts we have made.' Some Brazilian economists argue that the country is trapped in a cycle where tight money produces deeper recession leading to falling tax revenues and the issuing of more domestic debt to raise funds. The policy is taking its toll on the private sector. Last year 249 of Brazil's 500 biggest companies finished in the red with combined losses of USDollars 2.5bn. Some joke that the only people making money are those selling black cloth for use in the anti-Collor demonstrations. But there is some good news. This year's exports are expected to reach a record USDollars 36bn-38bn, producing a surplus of Dollars 15bn, partly because of a strong agricultural performance. The country hopes to achieve growth this year of 2 to 3 per cent compared with 1 per cent last year. Liquid foreign exchange reserves are at the record level of USDollars 21bn, reflecting high foreign capital inflows - USDollars 7.7bn in the first five months. Mr Collor's supporters claim that the corruption charges against him were provoked by objections of 'invested interests' to his modernisation programme of dismantling cartels and reducing tariff barriers. They are now spreading fears that a government led by Mr Itamar Franco, the man who would take over in the event of Mr Collor's ouster, would abandon this and resort to a shock programme, wasting all Mr Moreira's efforts at austerity. However, what Mr Collor has done is forge a consensus behind modernisation which it would be difficult to go against. Mr Ulysses Guimaraes, an opposition congressman, says: 'History will give Collor credit because he had the courage to confront monsters and taboos in the economy.'</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / French deficit growth slows: Economic Watch The French budget deficit last year stood at FFr315.7bn (Pounds 36.2bn), widening from 1992's deficit of FFr226bn, but FFr1.9bn below a previous official estimate. Budget minister Nicolas Sarkozy said government policy and the stirrings of economic recovery had put a stop to the upward drift in the budget deficit. He said the Treasury's receipts were above expectations last year, outstripping higher spending than expected. He said the sharp fall in interest rates had allowed the state to save FFr16.5bn on debt servicing. Germany's income from federal and state taxes rose 2.4 per cent last year to DM697.99bn (Pounds 271.5bn), of which general tax income rose 4.9 per cent to DM562.27bn. Western German wholesale prices rose 0.5 per cent in February and were up 0.3 per cent from a year earlier. Eastern German unit labour costs remained 44 per cent higher than those of western Germany in 1993, despite a sharp rise in the region's productivity. Unemployment in the Netherlands surged 115,000 in the three months to February to around 495,000 from a year earlier, its highest since early 1988, and just over 7 per cent of the workforce.</p>

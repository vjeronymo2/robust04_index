			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> 2-A;  </P> <P> TOP TEAMS WILL RECEIVE TIME OFF FOR GOOD RECORDS  </P> <P> On the schedule, the 2-A Southern Section boys' basketball playoffs begin  today.  </P> <P> But in a division that coaches say will be dominated by Orange Lutheran and  Santa Clara, the important competition doesn't start until Friday.  </P> <P> The top three seeded teams, which have a combined 61-8 record, won't be playing  in today's first round.  </P> <P> Instead, top-seeded Santa Clara (20-3) and No. 2 Orange Lutheran (21-3), will  play their first games on Friday. The same goes for third-seeded Paraclete  (20-2).  </P> <P> In fact, of the teams that play today, only St. Anthony (10-11) is expected to  be any kind of threat.  </P> <P> "I think it will come down to us, Santa Clara and St. Anthony," Orange Lutheran  Coach Jerry Simmons said. "But I'm sure there's other teams out there that can  win it. Anytime you put five guys on a court anything can happen."  </P> <P> Other coaches aren't quite that open-minded.  </P> <P> "Santa Clara is the team to beat," Beaumont Coach Alex Boyd said. "But then  again you can't count out Orange Lutheran."  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran, which swept through the Olympic League with a 14-0 record, can  rest today while Beaumont and Notre Dame of Riverside fight for the right to  meet the Lancers in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> "Actually, I'd rather not have a bye in the first round," Simmons said. "I'd  rather we play in the first round, especially if we don't get a home game."  </P> <P> Chances are, Orange Lutheran, led by Pat Bagatourian and his 20 points and 11  rebounds per game, will be rooting for a Beaumont victory, which would mean a  home game for the Lancers Friday. Otherwise, the road to the Los Angeles Sports  Arena and the finals March 4 will begin for Orange Lutheran at Notre Dame in  Riverside.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2-A IN A BOX  </P> <P> Top teams: Santa Clara (20-3), Orange Lutheran (21-3), Paraclete (20-2).  </P> <P> Dark horse: St. Anthony (10-11).  </P> <P> Top players: Alan Aragon (St. Anthony), Pat Bagatourian (Orange Lutheran),  Shaun Tarver (Santa Clara), Jeff Zelenski (Paraclete).  </P> <P> Best first-round games: St. Anthony at Valley Christian/Cerritos (16-8);  Beaumont (15-6) at River side Notre Dame (11-12).  </P> <P> Final four prediction: Santa Clara vs. St. Anthony, Paraclete vs. Orange  Lutheran.  </P></p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Opening up with an eye on confidentiality: The Treasury's efforts to collaborate more with the world beyond Whitehall are assessed by Peter Marsh When Alan Budd, now chief economic adviser at the UK Treasury, attacked the department 15 years ago for ignoring advice from outside, he was a London Business School economist. Now that he is on the inside he may recall his criticisms as he answers charges today from industrialists that the department is divorced from reality and too secretive. Budd, who has been at the Treasury since 1991, will be one of four senior Treasury officials addressing a private meeting in London with 70 business executives. The meeting, 'Treasury: Villain or Victim?', has been organised by the Whitehall and Industry Group, a charity trying to dismantle barriers between the private and public sectors. The Treasury, Britain's most important government department, which controls public spending, taxation and interest rates, has for years been criticised for paying too little attention to the world outside Whitehall. Critics reckon its introverted style has contributed to policy mistakes, in particular the lack of preparedness for the inflationary boom of the late 1980s, the recession which followed and the currency crisis which forced Britain out of the exchange rate mechanism. That attacks on the Treasury are nothing new is clear from Budd's 1979 comments, made in a speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs. But as the criticism grew during the 1990s, the department tried to recognise its failings, grappling with issues similar to those faced by many private-sector organisations. A leading part has been played by Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, who engaged as a part-time adviser Wendy Pritchard, a consultant specialising in helping organisations to make cultural shifts. Pritchard was behind recent moves by the Treasury to reduce the number of top posts and improve the effectiveness of decision-making, while Budd - who came to the Treasury from Barclays Bank, where he was economic adviser - has put into practice some of the prescriptions in his 1979 address. He has set up a committee of business people who meet three times a year to relay views from industry to the department's economic forecasters. He also oversees the work of the Treasury's panel of seven (now six) 'wise men' - outside economists who supply policy advice and forecasts to the Treasury. Budd has also encouraged Treasury officials to be more receptive to thinking from outside Whitehall. Charlie Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics who works part-time at the Treasury, says Budd has been 'an outstanding success' in 'encouraging the flow of ideas into the Treasury'. Roger Humber, director of the Housebuilders Federation, a trade body for construction companies, has noticed a difference, too. In the late 1980s, he says, the Treasury spurned the federation's efforts to promote a dialogue about economic trends. 'The Treasury view was that we (housebuilders) were responsible for inflation - they wanted nothing to do with us.' But around 1992, says Humber, 'the Treasury became more interested in hearing our views'. Talking to outsiders does not always go smoothly. Treasury officials fear that they may let slip some piece of policy advice which government ministers would rather keep to themselves. Greg Parston, director of the Office of Public Management, a consultancy specialising in public-sector organisation, recognises that because of confidential policy discussion, there are limits to how much officials can open up. 'But because the Treasury is spending our (taxpayers') money they should recognise the public has a right to inquire how it manages itself.' Budd says the principle that officials advise ministers in confidence must be safeguarded. 'The challenge is to ensure that the analysis on which such advice is based reflects the best possible sources of knowledge . . . I think the Treasury is more exposed to independent advice than ever before.' The changes have not satisfied everyone. Bill Martin, UK economist at Swiss bank UBS and among the Treasury's fiercest critics, thinks it 'is still too secretive'.</p>

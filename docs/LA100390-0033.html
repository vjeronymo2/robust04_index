			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAMUEL'S SINGLE IN 10TH GIVES DODGERS 2ND PLACE  </P> <P> The Dodgers clinched second place in the National League West in style Tuesday  night before 22,883 at Dodger Stadium, defeating the San Diego Padres, 8-7, in  10 innings.  </P> <P> The Dodgers had staged a wild comeback to take a 7-6 lead in the eighth, only  to have the Padres tie the score in the ninth.  </P> <P> The Dodgers needed only four batters in the 10th inning against Craig Lefferts  (7-5). Mike Sharperson led off with a single to right field, Eddie Murray  singled to right and Hubie Brooks was intentionally walked to load the bases.  Juan Samuel followed with a single to center, scoring Sharperson with the  winning run.  </P> <P> Dave Walsh pitched the 10th inning and got his first major league victory.  </P> <P> It all looked so easy against a pitcher with whom the Dodgers have had loads of  trouble. Lifetime against the Dodgers, Lefferts was 9-0 with five saves and a  2.04 earned-run average. But on this night, the Dodgers weren't to be  restrained by the usual.  </P> <P> Trailing, 6-2, with two out and none on in the bottom of the eighth inning, the  Dodgers suddenly came to life. They scored five runs on a walk, four singles  and an error to take the lead.  </P> <P> The rally started when Padre starter Dennis Rasmussen walked Jose Gonzalez and  wild-pitched him to second. Sharperson followed with a single to center,  scoring Gonzalez to bring the Dodgers to within 6-3. Murray lined a single to  left, sending Sharperson to third and Padre Manager Greg Riddoch to the mound.  </P> <P> Exit Rasmussen; enter Lefferts.  </P> <P> No matter. Brooks lined Lefferts' first pitch into right field, scoring  Sharperson and sending Murray to third base. Samuel followed with a grounder to  second, but Joey Cora bobbled it and then threw it away. Murray scored, Brooks  went to third and Samuel made it to second.  </P> <P> Up stepped Mickey Hatcher, pinch-hitting for relief pitcher Jim Gott. Hatcher  hit a single into right, scoring Brooks and Samuel. Lefferts then struck out  Jose Offerman, but it was too late. Dodgers, 7-6.  </P> <P> Jay Howell, who replaced Gott, got two quick outs before Jack Clark -- who was  eligible because he decided to appeal a one-game suspension earlier in the day  -- Joe Carter and Mike Pagliarulo singled consecutively to make it 7-7.  </P> <P> The Padres took an early lead thanks to two home runs by Jerald Clark. The  first traveled over the right-center field fence in the fourth inning, a  two-run shot off Dodger starter Mike Morgan. That put the Padres ahead, 3-0.  Clark's second homer came two innings later against relief pitcher Tim Crews, a  two-run shot to left that increased the Padre lead to 6-1 and Clark's RBI total  for the evening to four.  </P> <P> Morgan was removed after the fifth inning, having allowed eight hits and four  runs.  </P></p>

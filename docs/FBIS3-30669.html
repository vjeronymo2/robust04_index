The strengthening of the Czech Republic's international  position was also something to be assessed positively, Havel  said, pointing to the visits of U.S. President Bill Clinton and  Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Prague.    Also important were the building of a civic society, of the  non-profit sector and public institutions, Havel said. Although  it was the business of parliament and the government to decide  such things, the president's voice ought also to be heard, he  said, and the president ought to look to the long-term, which  was also true in foreign policy.    Relations with neighbouring states had to be redefined and  clarified, Havel said. He added that he had many foreign visits  awaiting him, including ones to India, Thailand and the Vatican.  In addition, he said, he was to make a speech to the European  Parliament and perhaps open the plenary meeting of the UN  General Assembly. He would also be representing the Czech  Republic at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  summit.    Asked if during his second year as president he would avoid  conflict with the premier, foreign minister and parliament, or  whether he saw such conflicts as a normal part of Czech  political life, Havel said that "it is a feature of democracy  for there to be a certain tension between individual  constitutional institutions." He did not have the feeling that  he had serious conflicts with anyone, he said, adding that he  identified with the basic line of the Czech Republic's policy  and supported it.    "Of course, we are all a little different, we have different  characters and different tendencies, and here and there might be  hitches, but I really do not think this is a subject that the  public need worry about. They are our problems," Havel said,  adding that what was important for the public was the results,  and these were good.    Reform of local government will definitely strengthen  democracy, but it depends what sort of reform it will be, Havel  said. A relatively wide consensus was beginning to appear, and  reform had to take note of the real state of things, he said.  The electoral system to the authorities of the higher  administrative units would be very important, Havel said, adding  that "a strictly proportional system, like the one used for  parliamentary elections, would not be good."    "Instead of one parliament we would have thirteen or  fourteen. All the little parliaments would play at being the big  one," he said, adding that the regions would only suffer.    The Czech Republic ought to gain membership in the European  Union and NATO, and to perfect privatisation, he said. "I would  be glad if we became a country to which people no longer  attached the label of post-communist," he said in conclusion.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance on surveys which were conducted prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of this regulation should be counted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of whether there is repeated noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with this comment. The survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process specified in the OBRA '87 provisions was effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all surveys conducted on or after October 1, 1990. Even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> though the implementation of the corresponding enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions was not concurrent, any standard survey completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on or after October 1, 1990 must be considered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of whether there is repeated noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that resulted in substandard quality of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that to be consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the intent of the Act to have facilities maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, regulations should require that facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain compliance with the deficient requirement after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction. The commenter recommended requiring termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if a facility corrects the deficiency, but then falls out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the same requirement during the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Act provides that when a facility has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had findings of substandard quality of care on three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consecutive standard surveys, the Secretary or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must impose a denial of payment and a State monitor. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act require that the denial of payment for new admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and State monitor remedies must remain in force until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility not only achieves substantial compliance but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates that it can maintain substantial compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we have explained earlier, substantial compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutes compliance for the purpose of imposing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lifting a remedy, as well as issuing a certification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not foresee the situation described by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter as a problem. If a facility has corrected a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency, or is at least considered to be in substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, any remedy(ies) in effect would be lifted as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as compliance certified. We would not normally revisit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a facility after compliance has been certified unless there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a complaint or some other impetus. If, at some later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date after compliance has been certified, the facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found to have a recurrence of the same deficiency that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causes the facility to be out of substantial compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either a new continuation of payment period would begin, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination (or cessation of FFP payments) would occur,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on the seriousness of the noncompliance. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any termination would be based on the fact that the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not in substantial compliance with sections 1819 (b),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d) of the Act by the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the correction period, and not on the fact that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance was repeated. We have not adopted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter's suggestion to terminate a facility solely on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis of repeated noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.415&blank;Temporary Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked that we clarify the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``disciplinary action'' and state that the temporary manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must not have been found guilty of misconduct by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensing board or professional society, and another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter recommended that HCFA maintain a national registry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of nursing home administrator disciplinary actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To avoid confusion surrounding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation of ``disciplinary action,'' we will not use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term in the requirement at &sect;488.415(b)(2) as we did in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.215(b)(3) of the proposed rule. Instead, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structuring the provision to read that the temporary manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must ``not have been found guilty of misconduct by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensing board or professional society in any State.'' We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree that it may be beneficial to have a misconduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registry for nursing home administrators, and we intend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examine the feasibility of developing one.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters recommended that we include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that the temporary manager must have had no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse ties to the problem facility, and must not have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fired from the facility in the past. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that we include a requirement that the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager have had no business or professional relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the facility for a minimum of 3 years prior to his or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her appointment to operate the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with the commenters that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual chosen to be temporary manager must not have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently employed by the facility to be managed. We believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an individual's previous employment relationship with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility could positively or negatively prejudice that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual in his or her present dealings with the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we are incorporating into the regulation, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.415(b)(4), a requirement that the temporary manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must not currently serve, or, within the past 2 years, have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> served as a member of the staff of the noncompliant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. This requirement is similar to the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for surveyors, which we believe is appropriate, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective evaluation is a necessary tool of both surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and temporary managers and requires their objectivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

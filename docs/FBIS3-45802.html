Now,  pilot projects have been started in some organs directly under  the regional authorities selected to introduce a civil service  system on a trial basis, and all local government organs and  service organizations are expected to pay wages and salaries  according to the new pay scale by the coming Spring Festival.    The main objectives of the current regional meeting on  introducing a national civil service system and reforming the  wage and salary system, which opened on 11 January, are to plan  and assign personnel work for 1994, with the focus placed on  reforming the wage and salary system; to step up the  establishment of a civil service system, wage and salary system  reform, and other reforms in the region; and to gradually  establish a personnel administration structure which suits the  socialist market economic structure.    Yuan Zhengzhong, a member of the standing committee of the  regional party committee and executive vice chairman of the  regional government, attended and addressed the meeting.  [passage omitted]    In 1994, this region is to actively and conscientiously  introduce the national civil service system. The region's aim  is to build up a basic framework of the civil service system in  three years and to gradually perfect this system thereafter.  All service units must change their existing personnel  administrative patterns; they should be distinguished from  government organs in terms of administrative structure,  personnel system, and wage and salary system; and they are to  establish a personnel system with distinct characteristics which  is specially designed for service units. Meanwhile, a modern  enterprise personnel system will be gradually established as  well.    In 1994, as far as the income distribution system is  concerned, this region is to establish different wage and salary  systems and normal pay-rise mechanisms corresponding to  different characteristics of government organs and service  units, and to introduce a series of reforms in such fields as  social security and the human resources market.</p>

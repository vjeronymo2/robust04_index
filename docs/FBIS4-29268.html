			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Choe Won-sok] </F>   [Text] Korea and China agreed yesterday to set up four  subcommittees to strengthen industrial alliances in the fields  of automobiles, aircraft, time division exchanges (TDX) and high  definition TVs (HDTV).    The four subpanels will hold their inaugural meetings in  September but the venues have yet to be decided.    The agreement was reached in the inaugural meeting of the  Korea- China Industrial Cooperation Committee held at the  Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy in the Kwachon government  office complex.    Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Kim Chol-su led a 31-  member Korean team to the conference, while Wang Zhongyu,  Chinese minister of State Economic and Trade Commission, headed  his country's 36-member delegation.    Industrial cooperation in the four areas was initially  agreed  on in the summit talks between President Kim Yong-sam and  Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng held in Beijing in March. At the  summits it was also decided to set up the Korea-China Industrial  Cooperation Committee.    As for cooperation in cars, the two ministers agreed to  focus  efforts on automotive parts for the time being.    In particular, China requested Korean investment in its  development of 30 kind of automotive parts.    On the list are fuel and ignition systems, pistons, filters,  drum brakes, steering systems, shock absorbers, air conditioner  compressors, air bags, door locks, motors, auto lamps and  special bearings.    In the field of TDX digital switching systems, the two  ministers concurred on the necessity of expanding the Chinese  communications network through a Korean-Chinese joint venture in  Shandong which is now manufacturing small-sized systems capable  of handling 2,000-3,000 phone lines.    Wang promised that his country will help Korean companies  take part in the construction of a communications network in the  province of Hunan.    In the case of aircraft, the two ministers agreed to equally  share expenses in the development and manufacture of  medium-sized planes with some 100 seats in accordance with a  memorandum on bilateral cooperation in the development of  commercial aircraft signed in Seoul June 6.    Korea and China will consider allowing third countries to  take part in the project in case they have high tech which is  not available to them.    The two countries will jointly conduct a market survey as  soon as possible to choose an appropriate model to be developed.    With regards to HDTVs, the two ministers agreed in principle  to jointly develop and manufacture them.    But they decided to collaborate from the research stage over  what type of HDTVs they will develop as the world is still  undecided about type.    To substantiate cooperation, Korean and Chinese HDTV experts  will gather in a workshop to be held in October, probably in  Seoul.    In the meantime, Korea and China agreed to pursue industrial  alliances in natural resources and electricity in additions to  the four areas and expand exchanges of industrial specialists as  well.</p>

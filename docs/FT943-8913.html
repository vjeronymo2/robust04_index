			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Knapp accuses Railtrack of bullying and misleading Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT transport union, yesterday accused Railtrack of bullying and refusal to compromise as a further 48-hour strike by signal workers started last night. He also accused Railtrack of misleading the public with its Pounds 100,000 newspaper advertising campaign yesterday. The company said its offer would mean an average of 7.2 per cent on earnings between April and October, with a final agreement giving increases of up to 10 per cent on earnings. Mr Knapp said average earnings under Railtrack's proposals would go up by less than 4 per cent, 'but signalling grades have to give up a tremendous amount for even this'. He added: 'And if Railtrack are so confident about the fairness of the package, why do they continue to refuse to tell the union how much they will save? 'Personal contracts mean a worsening of conditions as Railtrack's restructuring package shows. It is also an invitation for Railtrack to continue their campaign of harassment and bullying.' The union said the company's arguments in the advertisements had been 'dismissed by a sceptical public', and welcomed a MORI poll in the Mail on Sunday showing that 56 per cent of the public believed signalling grades should get more money, while only 20 per cent backed Railtrack. A spokesman for the company rejected Mr Knapp's claims, saying it was the union which was inflexible for insisting on an interim pay deal before it would discuss restructuring. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said: 'The government has been stringing out the strike because it thought it would be to their political advantage, and people would turn against the signal workers. 'The MORI poll shows this is not happening. The government should cut its losses and let the dispute be settled.' The Department of Transport said Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, had changed his holiday plans and was now spending two weeks somewhere in the UK to keep in touch with developments.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Elf-Aquitaine expected to replace chief this week MR LOIK Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil and gas company which is France's largest industrial group, will be replaced this week, official sources said yesterday. Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman of Credit Agricole, one of France's most powerful financial institutions, is expected to be voted on to the Elf board today and confirmed as chairman by the government council of ministers tomorrow. The move largely reflects political motives. Mr Le Floch-Prigent was appointed head of Elf by the socialist President Francois Mitterrand in 1989. He has been regarded as vulnerable since the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur took office in March. The government is keen to remove a socialist appointee from the head of Elf because the oil group has been named among the first four companies to be sold as part of the government's privatisation programme. The move reflects the practice of replacing the heads of important state-owned companies following a shift in political power between the left and the right. So far, however, the government of Mr Balladur has been restrained in replacing company chiefs. The only other change has been the replacement of Mr Rene Thomas as head of Banque Nationale de Paris by Mr Michel Pebereau in May. The relatively conciliatory approach of the Balladur government is reflected in the fact that Mr Le Floch-Prigent is expected to be given another important post. Official sources said that he would probably take control of Gaz de France, the state-owned utility. Mr Jaffre has no previous experience of managing an industrial company. He worked in the French treasury between 1977 and 1987, and for Mr Rene Monori, then economy minister, in 1979 and 1980. He was executive chairman at Banque Stern and was appointed chairman of Credit Agricole in 1988. A government official said that Mr Jaffre had been selected because of his management expertise and because the Elf privatisation would be a complex financial challenge. The government has indicated that the size of the group - it has an estimated market value of about FFr100bn (Dollars 16.8bn) - might mean that it is privatised in tranches. The government currently holds 51.4 per cent of the shares.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (4): Stability spurs trading surge - Bourse generates interest among small investors SUDDENLY everyone in Lima is talking about the stock market. Middle-class housewives and small entrepreneurs who have never owned a share in their lives are swapping tips by telephone, or puzzling over late-afternoon coffee and cakes as to why a particular stock rocketed or plunged today. Much of the euphoria - or collective hysteria, as one analyst prefers to put it - springs from the small but active bourse's performance last year, when the index turned in a spectacular 125 per cent profit in dollar terms. That thrust Lima into the international limelight as the world's second most profitable bourse of 1992. In the first eight months of this year, the general shares index put on an impressive 76 per cent in dollar terms. The rise continued throughout the first half of September before profit-taking caused slight second-half falls. Trading volume has increased significantly during the past couple of months. On August 19, an all-time record Dollars 16.9m changed hands in one day on the stock exchange floor. The record was beaten again less than three weeks later when trading topped Dollars 21m in a day. Total volume traded this year has already exceeded USDollars 1.02bn - well over double the first nine months of last year. By the middle of September, daily volume was averaging Dollars 7.5m with more than 1,000 transactions handled daily. Market capitalisation has also spurted - from Dollars 1.4bn at the end of 1991, to Dollars 2.6bn twelve months later and around Dollars 4.5bn today. This makes Peru a pygmy by comparison with Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Argentina but puts it in the same league as Venezuela and Colombia. Volumes traded daily in Lima are now considerably larger than in the last two bourses, and on occasion exceed amounts handled in Santiago. Stepped-up activity has spawned a series of Lima-based brokerages, often offshoots of local banks. Stock exchange managers, meanwhile, have forged ahead with modernising antiquated systems - computer terminals now allow brokers to follow trading movements in real time from their offices. And a series of agreements has been signed with other Latin American and European exchanges to allow closer integration. Brokers attribute the recent boost in trading to improved perspectives for political stability. Trading took off immediately congress approved the new constitution in mid-August - with its deregulated, liberal economic framework and the possibility of a second consecutive term for President Fujimori. Also inspiring foreign investor confidence were opening talks with banking creditors in New York aimed at finding a solution to Peru's USDollars 6bn commercial debt. Increased trading has involved both the known foreign investors who have been represented in Lima for around two years, and a rash of new, first-time punters. Among these is Mr George Soros whose Quantum Fund managers have already invested in the Peruvian stock market and remain bullish about future growth. Brokers say that, as well as the inevitable speculators attracted by last year's spectacular performance, the Lima bourse is now drawing a significant number of foreign institutional investors who are looking at the medium to long term. Foreign investment accounts for more than two-thirds of all volume traded. The specialist Peru fund launched earlier this year by Latin American Securities, now Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets, has done well. Some Dollars 19m was invested and assets, helped by some well-chosen second-line stocks and smaller company shares, have put on around 40 per cent since April. Institutional investors however, seeking elasticity and volume, tend to go for Peru's few, highly liquid blue chips. These include the two main breweries, Backus and Johnston, and CNC; the Banco de Credito, Peru's largest private bank; Southern Peru Copper Corporation, Buenaventura and Milpo in the mining sector; and the soon-to-be-privatised telephone company CPT plus two state-controlled cement companies, also due for sell-off late this year. The principal problem facing the bolsa at present is the lack of instruments. 'There's too much money chasing too few shares,' says Mr Jose Luque Otero, the Lima stock exchange president. 'With only 300 stocks quoted, demand is exceeding supply.' This has led certain shares, for long undervalued, rising too sharply. Mr Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton of Inverlat International's London office calculates that some Peruvian stocks are now overpriced by perhaps ten per cent. 'This particularly applies to mining sector shares, which have rocketed on rumour alone,' he says. For Mr Luque Otero, the solution lies in convincing more Peruvian companies to launch new share issues. Peru's traditional economic power groups and family businesses, he says, have long been accustomed to raising capital through bank borrowing. He says a recent, highly successful, share issue by the brewery CNC could be a pointer for the future. While he expects larger companies to start issuing bonds in the near future  -recent legislation means there is no longer any tax on capital gains from bonds or from shares - share issues should be an attractive option for smaller businesses. 'We and Conasev, the securities commission, still need to work hard on raising consciousness about the stock market at all levels,' Mr Luque says.</p>

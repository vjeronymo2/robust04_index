			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  decided Tuesday [18 January] to accept the Liberal Democratic  Party's [LDP's] call for talks aimed at striking a compromise  over LDP proposals to modify a government-proposed political  reform package, its chief negotiator said.    Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, told  reporters  the coalition will resume bargaining with the LDP over the  package of four bills designed to revamp Japan's electoral  system for the House of Representatives and alter political  fund-raising methods.    Ichikawa made the remarks minutes after Yoshiro Mori,  secretary general of the main opposition LDP, told a news  conference that the ruling coalition should accept three out of  the 10 demands it had put forward to the coalition Monday.    The first of the three demands calls for increasing the  number of single-seat lower chamber constituencies from the  government-proposed 274 to 280 out of a proposed 500-seat  chamber, while reducing the number of seats to be appropriated  under proportional representation to 220 from 226.    The second is for splitting up a proposed nationwide  proportional representation constituency for the 220 seats into  several regional electoral blocs.    Political analysts say many LDP legislators fear the package  might force them to run in alien constituencies located far from  their home based electoral districts where they have a  well-cultivated network of supporters.    The third demand calls for authorizing business firms to  hand  over donations to the fund-raising organizations of individual  politicians by dropping the proposed legal requirement to unify  fund-raising channels into a political party.    In contrast, the government-proposed bill would obligate  potential corporate donors to give money to a political party,  which would then be entrusted with distributing the money to  individual politicians.    Mori said, "If the LDP and the coalition could strike a  broad  agreement to accept the three demands, including the bloc-based  proportional representation constituency, the two camps would  have to work out, in a next Diet session, the details of  modifications that may not be hammered out due to technical and  time constraints."    Mori said the LDP leadership would instruct its legislators  to vote for the government-proposed package in Wednesday's vote  in a crucial committee of the House of Councillors, if the  coalition accepted the three demands.    The LDP wants to finalize the details of the compromise deal  in a proposed summit between LDP President Yohei Kono and Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, expected to take place Wednesday,  LDP sources said.    The coalition decided to resume bargaining with the LDP in  view of a growing number of dissident socialist legislators who  have remained adamant in rejecting the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) leadership's calls to vote with the coalition, Diet  sources said. The SDP is the largest in the seven-party  coalition.    Political analysts predicted that if more than 10 SDP  legislators voted against the reform package in the 252-member  upper chamber, the package could be rejected. The coalition has  only a slim majority.    The coalition also fears that if it agrees to give too much  ground to the LDP, it might antagonize the SDP legislators who  have called for minimizing the number of seats to be contested  at single-seat constituencies, the sources said.    Meanwhile, the leaders of the coalition partners decided to  try to strike a compromise by arranging a meeting between Juro  Saito, chief of the group of the LDP's upper chamber  legislators, and Manzo Hamamoto, Saito's SDP counterpart,  coalition officials said.    If necessary, the officials said, the coalition will seek to  reconcile differences that may remain unresolved even by the  Saito-Hamamoto talks, by arranging another bargaining session  between Mori and Ichikawa or even the summit between Hosokawa  and Kono.    The coalition leaders also confirmed that they will not  scrap  their own parliamentary schedule of trying to push the package  through the upper chamber committee on Wednesday, whatever  developments might occur at these forums for a compromise. They  said the coalition will try to push the package through the  plenary session of the upper chamber by Friday.</p>

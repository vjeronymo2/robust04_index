			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondent Huang Qunwen (7806 5028 2429) and </F> reporter Liu Jianxin (0491 1696 2450): "Feature: A Sharp Sword  of South China and Shield of Peace -- Hong Kong Notables Watch  Military Show by a Guangzhou Military Region Unit"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 1 May (XINHUA) -- The smoke of gunpowder  filled the air as guns roared. Under the cover of tanks, troops  from a reconnaissance squad launched a fierce attack on a high  area guarded by the "enemy." Machineguns on the tanks spurted  flames [as received], while mortars continually shelled  positions afar. Before we knew it, brave soldiers who kept  appearing and disappearing in the billowing smoke had planted an  army flag on the "enemy's" position ... [ellipses as received]  Hong Kong notables seated on the reviewing stand burst into  applause.    Yesterday, 216 Hong Kong notables arrived for a visit to  Guangzhou-based troops under the Guangzhou Military Region  [GMR]. This morning, the Hong Kong compatriots went to the GMR  firing range in Guangzhou's suburbs by car to watch a military  show put on by a unit.    At 0930, Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice chairman of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference; Lu Ping, director of the State Council Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office; and Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY Hong Kong branch, reviewed Guangzhou-based unit in the  company of GMR Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao amid powerful and  majestic martial music.    "Its military spirit was shaped by strict discipline, its  fame shakes the southern territory." This unit possesses  triphibious capability for ground, sea, and air battles. Highly  difficult and dangerous training programs, such as the  10,000-meter swim at sea, emergency maneuver across 1,000 km,  field survivorship, and parachuting produced this "sharp sword  of Lingnan [Guangdong and Guangxi]," which is well known  throughout south China.    Two signal flares lifted into the air with a pop, raising  the  curtain for the military show. Four shooters shot down their  targets to display 20 big red characters -- "politically  qualified, militarily skillful, functionally sound, observing  strict discipline, providing powerful safeguards" -- in front of  the audience, winning a burst of warm applause. After that, the  officers and men performed 10 programs, including "rapid mobile  firing," "hand-to-hand combat," and "sub-squads seizing  important positions behind enemy lines." Nine officers and men  accurately shot the head, chest, and right and left legs of a  "human body" at the first try. Mr. Henry Fok Ying-tung, seated  on the reviewing stand, picked up the microphone and said:  "Will shooter No. 2 please shoot the left leg of human target  No. 1?" As his voice died down, the rifle immediately fired and  got the target's left leg. Lu Ping and then Zhou Nan also  instructed in succession specific shooters to shoot specific  spots and the targets were missed not even once.    "I have been to many countries and watched some military  shows. Our Liberation Army's military skills and caliber are  among the best." Before Mr. Li Jinwen [7812 6930 2429], a  lawyer at a Hong Kong legal firm, could finish his words, his  wife chipped in at his side: "These young men are all excellent  in martial arts. It is really amazing that each one could  skillfully handle eight or nine different kinds of weapons."    As the Hong Kong notables were praising the sharpshooters, a  dozen or so fully armed soldiers wearing camouflage coats fired  from the top right-hand side of the reviewing stand. All acted  like tigers with wings and compelled admiration when they  performed the program of "traction and traversing" [qian yin  heng du 3677 1714 2897 3256].    Mine-laying with rockets pushed the show to its climax.  Rockets shot into the sky one after another, making piercing  whizzes. Like petals slipping from the hand of a fairy maiden,  mines hanging on small parachutes showered on the ground and  thick growth of grass, building a formidable defense line and  creating a sea of death.    At 1100, the military show concluded amid applause and  praises. Madam Zhang Yongzhen [1728 3057 3791], vice president  of the Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, told reporters  with feeling: "I shed tears with joy after watching the  soldiers' brilliant performance. The people's safety and  well-being and the country's strength and prosperity are  inseparable from the strong army of the people. I am proud that  our country has such a powerful and civilized army."    On behalf of the visiting group of Hong Kong notables, Mr.  Henry Fok Ying-tung presented the troops with a silver plate  engraved with the characters "Steel Great Wall" and also wrote  "Steel Great Wall" as his message in the visitors' book. The  Hong Kong notables enthusiastically posed with the officers and  men for photographs and shook hands with them in farewell.</p>

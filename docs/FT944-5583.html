			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Montedison's rehabilitation moves a step further - The Italian group is focusing on implementing the industrial part of its rescue plan Last month, Mr Stefano Meloni, a senior executive at Montedison, told Les Echos, the French business newspaper, that the Italian industrial company and its parent, Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), were destined to rejoin the Milan stock exchange's small band of blue-chip stocks. Only a year earlier, the Ferruzzi-Montedison group came within four and a half hours of a very different fate: a bankruptcy filing, followed by ignominious break-up and sale. The team brought in last June to rescue Ferruzzi-Montedison has talked little, outside shareholder meetings, about how this recovery is being achieved. When they do talk, it is in clipped understatements. In last year's annual report for Ferfin, Mr Guido Rossi, now chairman of both companies, described 1993 simply as 'a year full of events'. Given the group's recent history, such discretion is understandable. In the late 1980s, under the flamboyant chairmanship of Mr Raul Gardini, who committed suicide last year while under investigation for corruption, the group invested in television, newspapers, yacht-builders, property and objets d'art, and was often in the headlines. This extravagance, coupled with corruption and alleged mismanagement, helped bring Ferfin and Montedison to their knees. By the end of June 1993, the two companies were labouring under a burden of gross debt which topped L30,000bn (Dollars 18bn). They have survived the last year due mainly to the willingness of most of the group's bank creditors to reschedule debt, cancel 1993 interest income and underwrite 'rescue' rights issues, converting debt into equity. By June of this year, net debt at Ferruzzi-Montedison had fallen to just over L18,000bn, following the capital-raising and a continuing asset sales, which have contributed more than L2,300bn towards a target of L7,000bn for disposals. That Ferruzzi-Montedison was saved does not seem so surprising now. It was, after all, the second largest listed industrial group in the country, and the political implications of bankruptcy would have been enormous. It was not clear until the last moment, however, whether Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank advising Ferruzzi-Montedison, could cajole enough creditor banks to sign up to the programme. Although the debt restructuring has been the focus of attention, staff at the group's regal Milan headquarters (for sale, like many of the company's property assets), know Ferruzzi-Montedison must now consolidate its position. That means implementing the ambitious industrial part of the rescue plan contained in the four slim green paperbacks - the road-map to the group's future. This is the main task of Mr Rossi, a company law expert and former head of Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, and Mr Enrico Bondi, former managing director of Gilardini, a Fiat unit, who joined the group as managing director at the same time. The industrial part of the plan is founded on three main pillars within Montedison - the agro-industrial side, represented by Eridania Beghin-Say, the quoted French subsidiary, chemicals (Montecatini) and energy (Edison). The plan also envisages Ferfin retaining its 30 per cent stake in Fondiaria, one of Italy's leading insurers, even if market speculation suggests a sale is possible. More than 61 per cent of the L5,900bn of investment envisaged over the four years of the plan will be spent on developing capacity, 29 per cent on renewing plant and most of the rest on environmental improvements. As the biggest contributor to turnover, the agro-industrial business will receive the largest share of investment. Agro-industry also provides the stable basis on which to expand the energy and chemicals arms of the business. Defence against cyclical recession is one reason why the group says it has stuck together as an unfashionable multinational conglomerate, rather than splitting into three or four smaller, more vulnerable units. In certain areas, the group may even be doing better than the plan's forecasts. For example, a surge in the price of polypropylene - an area in which Montedison is the world leader - has helped the chemicals sector. US regulatory approval for Montell, the polypropylene joint venture with Royal Dutch/Shell, would provide a further morale boost for the company, and rid Montedison of more debt. By 1997, the group also hopes to double turnover at Edison, Italy's biggest private electricity producer, and may also benefit from the privatisation of the state company, Enel, which will have to sell off parts of its production capacity in the next three to four years. If enough progress is made, the group is also likely to consider further expansion, by acquisition, and growth in new geographic markets, such as China. Analysts admit they are impressed by the new team's work, although they believe some of the group's forecasts - particularly on Edison's development  -could be over-ambitious. However, Ferfin and Montedison are showing the benefits of the work put in by Mr Rossi, Mr Bondi and other new managers. Both companies returned to pre-tax profit in the first half of this year. The apparent success of the programme is raising questions about the future structure of the whole group. Investors have begun to wonder whether the Ferfin holding company might merge with Montedison once once the main outstanding asset sales have been achieved. Ferfin's rights issues at the beginning of the year were almost entirely underwritten by creditor banks, which have seen the share price tumble from around L1,800 to about L1,300 now. Apart from Serafino Ferruzzi, the troubled Ferruzzi family holding company, the top five shareholders in Ferfin are Italian banks. Montedison's share register, by contrast, includes a spread of investment funds which subscribed to the rights issue. Over the same period, Montedison shares have risen from about L960 to more than L1,160. Ferfin and Montedison may already answer with one voice, and share the same chairman and managing director, but in the last month they have formally denied rumours of an imminent merger. It is not, the companies patiently explain, in the plan.</p>

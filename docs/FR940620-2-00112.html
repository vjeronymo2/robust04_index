Selection Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the fiscal year 1994 School-to-Work Opportunities Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants competition, a careful evaluation of applications will be made by a panel of (a) peer reviewers and/or (b) specialists within the Departments of Labor and Education. Each panelist will evaluate the applications against the criteria listed below, with emphasis on the scope and quality of the proposed plan and with careful consideration to the effectiveness, rather than the presence, of each program component. The panel results are advisory in nature and not binding on the Government. In providing grants under this notice, the Departments shall give priority to Urban/Rural Opportunities local partnerships that have demonstrated effectiveness in the delivery of comprehensive vocational preparation programs with successful rates in job placement through cooperative activities among local educational agencies, local businesses, labor organizations, and other organizations. Final funding decisions will be made based on the results of the panel review process and such other factors as: geographic balance, diversity of programmatic approaches, replicability, sustainability, innovation, and relative degree of poverty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Government will use the following selection criteria in evaluating applications: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scope and Quality of Local School-to-Work Opportunities Initiative  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (25 points). Is there an innovative and effective strategy for implementing a School-to-Work Opportunities initiative in the high poverty area that integrates school-based learning and work-based learning, integrates academic and occupational learning, and establishes effective linkages between secondary and postsecondary education? Does the application demonstrate an effective strategy for targeting high-demand, high-wage jobs and relate that strategy to the partnership's goals? What steps will the local partnership take to generate paid high-quality, work-based learning experiences? How effectively are the common features and basic program components described in Part II., a., of the Statement of Work included in the local School-to-Work Opportunities initiative? Have promising existing programs been considered for adaptation? Have new directions and approaches been planned to ensure that these programs include the common features and basic program components? As the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities initiative becomes established within the targeted area, is there an effective long-range plan for integrating other existing school-to-work programs with the initiative? Is the proposed local initiative effectively tied to a plan for educational reform? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

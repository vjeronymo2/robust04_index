			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CELTICS, TRYING TO FLY WITHOUT BIRD, BEAT DENVER  </P> <P> This is the time that Larry Bird was expected to return from surgery to lead  the Boston Celtics into the playoffs.  </P> <P> But there has been a snag in the rehabilitation program following the operation  Nov. 19 on both Achilles tendons. Bird is limping and the struggling Celtics  will probably have to get into postseason play without their best player and  inspirational leader.  </P> <P> The Celtics moved a little closer to their goal Sunday at Boston by coming from  behind for a 121-115 victory over Denver, also missing its best player -- Fat  Lever.  </P> <P> Boston trailed, 112-109, with 2:28 remaining against a team that was road-weary  and had won only six of 30 games away from home. But old pros Robert Parish and  Kevin McHale scored the points to put the Celtics ahead and Reggie Lewis and  Jim Paxson finished off the Nuggets.  </P> <P> Denver Coach Doug Moe complained about poor bench play when he took his  regulars out for a short rest after building a 13-point lead. But in truth, it  was the failure of Alex English to shoot well that was the undoing.  </P> <P> English had 27 points, one fewer than Lewis, but, after getting 51 points in  his previous game, he missed one easy short jumper after another. He was 12 for  27, but six of his baskets were layups. With Lever, the playmaker and top  rebounder, ailing, they needed a hot shooting English.  </P> <P> Bird predicted he would be back by early March. He said he would fool the  doctors. Last week it was decided he could engage in three hard workouts in  four days. He came out of them with a swollen, very sore left foot. He will  back off for a few days.  </P> <P> According to Peter May of the Hartford Courant, the Celtics aren't considering  it a major setback.  </P> <P> "But it would be fair to say that it has not progressed the way we hoped it  would," trainer Ed Lacerte told May. "We're going to take a step back until the  tendon calms down. We're not ruling him out for the season."  </P> <P> Although the Celtics are 30-30 and only three games ahead of Washington in the  battle for the final playoff spot, there have been some pluses. Two youngsters  who would not have played so much on a pennant-contending team, Lewis and Brian  Shaw, have matured with regular action. They appear to be the backcourt combine  for the next decade.  </P> <P> Also, the Celtics, even if they make the playoffs, will get a high draft choice  for the first time in a long time. A year ago, although Bird was beginning to  hurt, they were 41-19 after 60 games.  </P> <P> The Nuggets, also in a tough struggle for a playoff berth in the West, sent  Lever home for examination of a knee injury. If he is out for any time, the  Nuggets will be hard-pressed to make the playoffs.  </P> <P> Detroit 110, Washington 104 -- Isiah Thomas scored four of his 22 points in an  11-4 run in the fourth quarter at Auburn Hills, Mich., that finally subdued the  stubborn Bullets.  </P> <P> The Pistons, the hottest team in the NBA, kept building a lead, but the Bullets  kept fighting back. It was the 10th win in the last 11 games for the Pistons.  </P> <P> Bill Laimbeer had a big game against the Bullets, who lack only a good center  to be a tough foe, getting 24 points and 16 rebounds.  </P> <P> Cleveland 123, Portland 110 -- The Cavaliers, temporarily at least, put an end  to their skid on the road when Larry Nance had 16 points and 14 rebounds and  Brad Daugherty had 23 points.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers, who had lost two in a row, were playing their fourth game on the  road in six nights. The hard-earned win kep the Cavaliers a game ahead in the  tight race in the Central Division.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers led by six points at halftime, fell behind, 66-64, in the third  quarter, then put on a 12-5 spurt to take the lead for good. The lead jumped  top 95-81 in the fourth quarter and breezed to the victory.  </P> <P> Sacramento 114, Charlotte 105 -- The addition of Wayman Tisdale and Danny Ainge  have made the Kings better than an expansion team.  </P> <P> Tisdale had 28 points and Ainge had 15 points and 10 assists at Charlotte to  lead the win over the expansion team.

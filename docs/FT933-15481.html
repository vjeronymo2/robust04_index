			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Portugal bank sale raises Es32.3bn THE Portuguese government has raised Es32.3bn (Dollars 209.7m) from the sale of 17.5 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, following the announcement yesterday of results for the third phase of the privatisation of the country's largest commercial bank. A core of 15 Portuguese investors, led by Mr Belmiro de Azevedo, increased their stake in the bank to 26 per cent from 22 per cent to remain the largest investor group. As part of this third phase of privatisation, three stakes of 2.5 per cent each were sold to three European banks but the names of the banks, called strategic partners, are not likely to be revealed until October. The project is being negotiated by Credit Comercial de France for the Portuguese government. Demand for shares exceeded supply by 21 per cent. The state has a 24.3 per cent stake in the bank. The rules for the privatisation stipulate that no entity, single or collective, may acquire more than 15 per cent of the institution. Shares must be held for a least a year. Foreigners are limited to purchasing 7.5 per cent of the bank and Portuguese companies are prohibited from buying shares on behalf of foreign companies. Bankers Trust, the US merchant bank, yesterday made the first derivative issue for Portugal to help the problem of supply and demand in the Portuguese debt market. The bank pre-placed the bulk of 3m warrants for 12.5 per cent domestic fixed rate bonds dated January 1998. Each warrant has a face value of Es10,000. Mr Antonio Beck, who is responsible for the bank's Portuguese business, said that overcoming the liquidity problem was the main motive behind the issue.</p>

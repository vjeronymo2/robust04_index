			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Hosokawa to fight on even if reforms fail Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, said yesterday he plans to fight on, even if parliament fails to pass his political and electoral reform plans by Saturday, the end of the present session. Mr Hosokawa denied earlier reports from one of his own top advisers that he would resign or disband the cabinet if the plans remained blocked by then. 'There's no chance of that,' he was reported as saying. His remarks added to the confusion over the ruling coalition's intentions following Friday's surprise parliamentary vote against the four reform bills on which Mr Hosokawa has staked his future. The bills propose tough controls on political funding and the abandonment of multi-seat electoral districts, blamed for encouraging politicians to compete for votes on their ability to shower voters with cash and favours. Many members of parliament fear they would lose their seats as a result, but public support for reform is strong. Mr Hosokawa was planning to make a television appeal for public backing yesterday, but apparently changed his mind on the grounds that this might jeopardise his final attempt to reach an accord with the opposition Liberal Democratic party. In a sign of encouragement for Mr Hosokawa, Mr Masaharu Gotoda, a leading member of a 70-strong group of pro-reform LDP members of parliament, said he would back the government's bill if it came to a forced final vote. However, the rest of the LDP seemed as unclear about the next step as the coalition. The opposition LDP set stiff conditions yesterday for a compromise deal with Mr Hosokawa, in the latest stage in an increasingly arcane round of horse-trading. But the LDP then confusingly told a parliamentary panel, set up to discuss the possible compromise, it was not prepared for a debate. The panel session lasted a bare five minutes. Mr Yoshio Mori, the LDP's secretary general, later told television news that he was 'not in a position to comment at this time on what we plan to do'. The LDP's latest compromise plan calls for an increase in the number of single-seat constituencies proposed by the government from 274 to 300, and reducing the number of seats chosen through proportional representation from the coalition's 226 to 200. This is an increase on the LDP's previous demand last month for a 280-seat constituency system  - and as such can be taken as a hardening of its position. Proportional seats would come from 11 districts, rather than the government's proposed single national constituency, under the LDP's latest plan. The proposed ban on corporate donations to individual politicians would be lifted. The seven-party coalition, however, cannot afford to accept the LDP's latest plan because the Social Democratic party, on which it depends for a majority, is unshakeably committed to a ban on corporate donations to individuals.</p>

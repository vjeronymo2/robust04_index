			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Chieftain 20% ahead at Pounds 620,000 Profits of Chieftain Group, the USM-quoted supplier of specialist insulation and fireproofing services, rose from Pounds 517,000 to Pounds 620,000 pre-tax for the six months ended June 30. The 20 per cent improvement was achieved from a turnover Pounds 1.22m ahead at Pounds 7.63m. Earnings rose by 0.83p to 4.85p and the interim dividend is being lifted from 1.9p to 2.1p. Mr Peter Wardle, the chairman, said the group was well supported from its activities in selected sectors of industrial construction, shipbuilding and offshore oil and gas. He added that his 1991 year-end forecast that 'we would see some improvement in market conditions in 1992' was late in coming. However, he went on to say that 'given that there will be some improvement, we anticipate the progress achieved in the first half of 1992 will be maintained for the full year.' At the half year-end the order book was standing at Pounds 12m.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEAVY CRITICISM UNFAIR TO 'CALIFORNIA LIGHT'  </P> <P> In spite of Cathy Curtis' flippant "Ho-Hum" critique, I went to see the exhibit  and I found it beautiful!  </P> <P> A good art critic puts aside his or her personal preferences when judging art.  Curtis does not do this. She uses ridicule and should stop her silly comments  about "expecting a broadly sociological look at the connection between art and  sun-dazzled land."  </P> <P> You owe an apology to these fine artists of another era, when beauty was not  ridiculed.  </P> <P> MRS. ALBERT AUKERS, Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

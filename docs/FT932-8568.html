			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexico seen buying more US meat under Nafta US LIVESTOCK farmers will boost their exports of meat and animal products to Mexico significantly if the North American Free Trade Agreement is ratified, a Texas University study predicts. At a time of fierce debate in the US over who will gain and who will lose under the ambitious agreement, a team of farm economists at the Texas A &amp; M University predicts a five-fold increase in beef and veal exports from the US to Mexico over the decade ahead, with a three-fold rise in pork sales and a doubling in poultry exports. Exports of livestock products like hides, dairy products and fats would also increase, with US grain farmers selling an additional 430,000 tonnes of grain as poultry and cattle feed. In the past, Mexico's farm sector has been heavily protected from foreign competition, mostly by non-tariff barriers. As a result, imports are comparatively small - for example, barely more than 1 per cent of beef consumed in Mexico is imported. Liberalisation under the Nafta is expected to provide a double benefit to US livestock farmers - not only will barriers to their exports fall but rising standards of living in Mexico are forecast to boost meat consumption significantly. US farmers already account for 85 per cent of Mexico's livestock and meat product imports, with exports valued at Dollars 558m in 1990. The preferential access under the Nafta is expected to raise this share to 90 per cent. The US has maintained a large surplus in its trade in livestock products over the past decade, rising from Dollars 137m in 1980 to Dollars 200m in 1990, the study shows. Live animal exports to Mexico peaked at Dollars 163m in 1989, accounting for almost one fifth of the US total. The study assumes meat prices in Mexico will fall by 5 per cent as a result of the Nafta, with incomes rising by 5 per cent. It estimates that this will boost US beef and veal exports from 26,000 tonnes in 1990 to 129,000 tonnes by the end of the decade, with pork up from 18,000 to 63,000 tonnes, poultry up from 44,000 to 113,000 tonnes, and mutton and lamb up from 8,000 to 12,000 tonnes.

We will now broadcast  President Izetbegovic's comments on the next round of the peace  talks scheduled for 10 February in Geneva, the opening of Tuzla  Airport, and on the possibilities that UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] and the UNHCR might withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Begin recording] [Izetbegovic] I am reluctant about going  on  the scheduled date. When they asked us whether we agree to the  resumption of the talks on 10 February, I told David Owen that I  most probably would not be attending these negotiations.  Namely, I assessed at the time -- and I still do -- that this  will be another futile attempt, a waste of time. Of course we  have to take part. I am not sure whether we all have to go and  waste time. I told them that Silajdzic would come with a  delegation, fully authorized to negotiate. I might join in if I  see there has been some progress and if Silajdzic informs me  that things are going well.    I have many responsibilities here, so does Silajdzic, but  someone has to stay; I believe it is me. Silajdzic is younger,  so he can keep up with the pace. The pace at the negotiations  is terrible, indescribable. Sometimes one works for 13 to 15  hours without a break -- working, negotiating, haggling, and so  on. The negotiations so far have shown that there has been very  little progress. I reckon that no miracle will happen on 10  February, but on the other hand that is not ruled out.    Now there is this four-part initiative from America,  England,  France, and Germany. It is expected that they could propose  something new which would make a breakthrough at the  negotiations possible. If that happens -- the details of the  initiative have not yet been revealed -- I might decide to go,  and the complete delegation will go to try to solve [word  indistinct]. [passage omitted]</p>

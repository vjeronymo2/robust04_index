			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Political parties showed  mixed reactions on the resignation Friday of Prime Minister Yi  Hoe- chang.    The ruling Democratic Liberal Party said it was  inconsiderate  of outgoing Prime Minister Yi to resign without wisely striding  over a mountain of important state affairs.    "We regret it that Prime Minister Yi, whom we expected to  wisely surmount many important state affairs, tendered  resignation all of a sudden," party spokesman Ha Sun-pong said.    "We believe Prime Minister-designate Yi Yong-tok, with his  high virtues and rich experiences, would wisely overcome today's  difficulties to make the people feel easier."    The opposition Democratic Party said the party regrets Prime  Minister Yi's resignation which it said was caused by "reckless  checks" by those in power.    "The people expected much from Prime Minister Yi. But, he  couldn't unfold his policy and had to step down due to reckless  checks," party spokesman Pak Chi-won said.    "We fear if Yi Yong-tok's appointment as prime minister  won't  turn the administration more conservative," he said.    The United People's Party said the party was shocked at  Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang having resigned for the reason that he  couldn't fulfill the duty given him under the Constitution.</p>

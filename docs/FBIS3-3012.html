			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) held its  third plenary meeting here today, hearing explanations on a  draft law and a draft NPC decision, a report by the NPC Standing  Committee and two reports by judicial departments.    The meeting was presided over by Executive Chairman Cheng  Siyuan.    Finance Minister Liu Zhongli dealt on reasons for the  enactment of a budget law, whose draft has been presented to the  session for deliberation.    Liu said the law aims to strengthen the management of, and  supervision over, budget planning, examination, implementation  and enforcement. Such a law is needed, he said, to guarantee  and promote a healthy social and economic development.    State budget, as an important macro-control means, plays an  important role in the country's political and economic life, Liu  said.    Xue Ju, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, made a speech  explaining an NPC draft decision to grant legislative power to  the Xiamen Special Economic Zone (SEZ).    As one of the earliest SEZs, Xiamen has become the  mainland's  important window of economic and trade relations with Taiwan and  the outside world, he said.    To open the zone wider and to attract more overseas  investment, the Law Committee suggests that the Xiamen People's  Congress and its Standing Committee be authorized to enact local  laws and regulations and that the Xiamen municipal government to  formulate regulations for implementation locally, he said.    Tian Jiyun, a vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,  delivered a report on the work of the NPC Standing Committee  over the past year.    Tian defined the five-year term of the current NPC Standing  Committee as a period when establishment of a socialist market  economy is to be speeded up and China's second-phase  modernization goals are to be attained.    The guiding thinking of the Standing Committee is, under the  guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, to take as its fundamental task the  strengthening of a socialist democratic and legal system,  further improve the People's Congress system, guarantee the  implementation of the constitution and other laws, and promote  the development of a socialist market economy, he said.    To attain these goals, Tian said, the Standing Committee  will  continue to give economic legislation top priority so as to  gradually establish a legal system that conforms to a socialist  market economy.    Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, said  in  his work report that courts throughout the country should  provide a strong judicial guarantee for a sustained, rapid and  healthy development of the economy, and maintain social  stability through strict law enforcement.    In 1993, people's courts at various levels handled more than  3.4 million cases of the first instance, of which three fifths  were civil cases.    In his work report, Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the  Supreme People's Procuratorate, said in 1993 procuratorates  throughout the country and military, railway and other special  tribunals reinforced their function of legal supervision. They  devoted much efforts to handling major cases of embezzlement and  bribery. Criminal cases were severely dealt with, and cases  involving infringement of people's democratic rights and  dereliction of duties were also handled, Zhang said.    According to Zhang, in the last four months of last year,  procuratorates investigated more than 8,000 serious cases of  bribery and misappropriation of public money for personal use.  Each bribery case involved more than 10,000 yuan and each case  of the latter category more than 50,000 yuan.    Seven hundred and fifteen officials at or above the country  level implicated in such cases were dealt with according to law,  he said.</p>

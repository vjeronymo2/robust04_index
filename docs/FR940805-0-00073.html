The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments provide a temporary exception from provisions of the regulation that prohibit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creditor from using a preprinted form by a creditor to obtain a consumer's waiver of the right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to rescind certain home-secured loans when loan proceeds are needed immediately to meet a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer's bona fide personal financial emergency. In addition, a consumer's need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain funds immediately shall be regarded as a bona fide personal financial emergency for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of Regulation Z for transactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in areas of the South recently declared to be major disaster areas because of extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooding. Generally, Regulation Z requires a mandatory three day waiting period on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rescindable transactions before funds can be disbursed. The special exceptions expire one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year from the date the area was declared a major disaster.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  July 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Jane Jensen Gell, Staff Attorney, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adrienne D.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under the Truth in Lending Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (TILA), 15 U.S.C 1601&hyph;1666j, and Regulation Z, 12 CFR Part 226, with some exceptions, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer has the right to rescind a credit obligation secured by the consumer's principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dwelling for three days after becoming obligated, due to the risk of loss of the consumer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home in the event of default. There is a mandatory waiting period of three business days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before funds can be disbursed in order to give consumers an opportunity to reflect on the loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms and to elect to cancel the transaction (12 CFR 226.15 and 226.23). A consumer may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify or waive this right of rescission to meet a bona fide personal financial emergency. The consumer must provide the creditor a written, signed and dated waiver statement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describes the emergency. Under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 226.15(e) and 226.23(e), the waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement may not be executed on a preprinted form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has previously adopted an exception to Regulation Z for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions in areas affected by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and the April 1992 Los  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Angeles civil unrest (57 FR 53545 (1992)); extensive flooding in the Midwest (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40582 (1993)); and most recently, a major earthquake in California (59 FR 6532 (1994)). The Board's exception permitted a temporary waiver of the provisions in Regulation Z that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibit an institution's use of a preprinted form to obtain a consumer's waiver of the right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rescind certain home-secured loans when loan funds were needed immediately to meet a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer's bona fide personal financial emergency. In addition, a consumer's need to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds immediately was regarded as a bona fide personal financial emergency for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation Z, where the home securing the loan was located in the disaster area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Relief for Flood Affected Communities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> During the summer of 1994, extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooding has occurred in several Southern States, including Alabama, Florida, and Georgia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, the President has determined that extensive major disaster areas exist in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states. In order to aid consumers in obtaining credit speedily to begin repairs in these areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to ease the paperwork burden on banks extending credit in these areas, the Board has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to provide a temporary exception in this situation to the restrictions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;226.15(e) and 23(e) of Regulation Z in flood affected areas. This exception will expire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one year from the date the President determined that an area was a major disaster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board is amending Regulation Z to permit a temporary exception to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions that prohibit the use of a preprinted form by an institution to obtain a consumer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver of the right to rescind certain home-secured loans when the home is located in an area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the President has determined, pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relief and Emergency Assistance Act , (42 U.S.C. 5170 (1989)), is a major disaster area as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the extensive flooding in 1994 in the South. The Board notes, however, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer must still sign and date the waiver statement. The following counties in Alabama,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida, and Georgia have been declared major disaster areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=3 --> Alabama: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->  Barbour, Coffee, Covington, Dale, Geneva, Henry, Houston,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Randolph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=3 --> Florida: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->  Calhoun, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson, Walton, Washington  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=3 --> Georgia: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->  Baker, Bibb, Butts, Calhoun, Clay, Clayton, Coweta, Crawford,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crisp, Decatur, Dooly, Dougherty, Early, Fayette, Fulton, Henry, Houston,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jones, Lamar, Lee, Macon, Meriwether, Miller, Mitchell, Monroe, Peach, Pike,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pulaski, Randolph, Seminole, Spalding, Stewart, Sumter, Talbot, Taylor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Terrell, Troup, Twiggs, Upson, Webster, Wilcox, Worth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Comment and Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific exemptions from its notice and public comment requirements for rulemakings when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these requirements are contrary to the public interest (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B)). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments in the final rule provide a temporary exemption to Regulation Z and remove a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restriction that may impair the availability of loans to consumers who have encountered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bona fide personal financial emergency as a result of having a home located in an area where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a major disaster has occurred. The Board finds that it is in the public interest to permit this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief immediately and without advance notice and public comment. As explained above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment to Regulation Z may reduce the paperwork burden on banks extending credit in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain disaster areas and aid in making credit speedily available to consumers in these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, consumers continue to have the right to rescind certain loans unless that right is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically waived. Moreover, the exemption is limited in scope and duration and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide immediate assistance to consumers' and lenders' ongoing efforts to reconstruct and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitate only in certain areas that have been affected by recent major disasters recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the appropriate federal relief statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For reasons explained above, the Board also believes that deferring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of this action is contrary to the public interest in connection with the adoption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the final rule. The APA grants a specific exemption from its requirements relating to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> item in these instances (5 U.S.C. 553 (d)(3)). Accordingly, the amendments to Regulation Z  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are effective immediately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / B&amp;B to sell home loans by telephone Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society is set to become the first high street lender to provide a 'phone alone' service, offering mortgages at a lower interest rate than those provided through its branch network. The scheme, to be launched in the spring, is intended to compete with Direct Line, the telephone-based insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland. Direct Line began selling home loans earlier this year and offers repayment mortgages to existing customers at 7.14 per cent. The standard interest rate charged by most mortgage lenders is between 8.09 per cent and 8.14 per cent. B&amp;B's telephone-based mortgages will have an interest rate similar to that of Direct Line, which will be achieved partly through not having to carry the costs of a branch network. The pricing is also helped by the fact that it should be a lower-risk operation. The percentage of the property value available as a loan is likely to be about 75 per cent - some mortgages sold through branches are available for up to 95 per cent of the value of the home. B&amp;B, the UK's seventh-largest society, aims to attract new customers through the venture. To differentiate the product, the marketing will use just one bowler hat where the society's trademark is two. The scheme carries some risk that the society may deter potential customers, as they will not be able to apply for this type of mortgage with branch help. Other building societies and banks have already set up telephone services, but these have been combined with a branch service and complement the branches rather than competing with them. Interest rates charged have been the same throughout, and have not reflected the lower costs of not having to maintain a branch network. That trend will continue next year when the UK's two largest building societies - Halifax and Nationwide - enter the telephone mortgage market in a substantial way.</p>

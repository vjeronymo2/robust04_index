			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- The first meeting of the  Russian State Duma, one of the chambers of newly-elected  parliament, was today addressed by Vice-Chairman of the Central  Election Commission Aleksandr Ivanchenko. He noted that the  elections to the new Russian parliament were held at a dramatic  period of the country's life. Their main result is that they  have laid a good foundation for national concord.    Ivanchenko said that more than 58 million people had taken  part in the elections. As a result, the country got a new  constitution. All the parties and movements have expressed their  readiness to create a new parliamentary system. The elections  were held for the first time in Russia according to the  proportional system. They refuted the view of some sceptics  that elections in Russia could be held only according to the  majority system.    Ivanchenko noted the openness and glasnost of the election  campaign. The Central Election Commission was able to guarantee  equal rights and opportunities to each of the 13 registered  election unions.    "The elections were monitored for the first time by  international observers. More than one thousand of them came to  Russia for that purpose," Ivanchenko stated.    "The Election Commission had accomplished a huge amount of  work during a very short space of time," he added. Ivanchenko  noted that only 150 complaints and appeals were received by the  Central Election Commission after the voting, and that they were  all carefully studied and corresponding measures were taken. He  said that there was no doubt that the elections were absolutely  legitimate. Ivanchenko also stated that the financial  activities of all the election unions were now being checked and  the results would be published.    The vice-chairman of the Central Election commission said  that 144 deputies were elected to the State Duma of the Federal  assembly (parliament), including 225 in federal constituencies  from parties and movements, and 219 -- in single-mandate  constituencies. He recalled that no elections were held on the  territory of the Chechen Republic due to the stand assumed by  its leadership. No elections were held also in several  constituencies of Tatarstan. Six seats are yet to be filled in  the State Duma.    Ivanchenko said that the newly-elected deputies of the Duma  included people of 32 nationalities. More than one-third of the  deputies have scientific degrees or titles. Representatives  from presidential structures account for about five per cent of  all the Duma members. The State Duma includes 68 former  people's deputies of the Russian Federation, 32 of whom were  elected in single-mandate constituencies. Ivanchenko dwelt also  on shortcomings of the present election system. He stressed  that the electoral legislation should be improved.</p>

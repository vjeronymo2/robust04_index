			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, June 20 (AFP) -- A Somali group on Monday  [20 June] assailed Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction for signing a  peace agreement with the son-in-law of former dictator Siad  Barre.    The Somali Patriotic Movement, which is part of Aidid's  Somali National Alliance, said that by signing the agreement,  Aidid contravened the alliance's constitution and objectives.    "It is an accord that infringes (on) the principal  constituency of the Somali National Alliance, conspiring  (against) the cause and the struggle of its supporters," the  movement said in a statement.    It said the alliance, an umbrella organisation of various  factions which fought and toppled Barre in 1991, had vowed never  to associate with members of the former regime, including his  son-in- law, Mohamed Said Hersi.    The peace pact, signed in the southern Somali port city of  Kismayo on Saturday, was aimed at strengthening an existing  ceasefire agreement.    The accord, signed by 19 clan elders, was endorsed by Hersi  and Osman Ato, who represented Aidid's group.    Omar Jess, the Somali Patriotic Movement's leader and the  main warlord in the Kismayo region, did not sign the agreement.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (8): Sector yet to recover from the crisis - The industry, which suffered more than most from the effects of recession, has still a long way to go in rebuilding its competitiveness in export markets / German machine tools The German machine tool industry has long prided itself on its powerful presence in export markets, claiming a 27 per cent share of world trade. Even during the now-fading recession, it boasted that it was gaining share at the expense of the Japanese who were labouring under a high yen and relatively high dependence on their weak domestic market. But the gains came at the cost of evaporating profits and a slump in production which dragged output last year to half its record 1989 level. The machine tool business was the first part of the German engineering industry to plunge into recession. The blows rained hard and fast, starting in 1990. Much of the rest of the sector was enjoying the fruits of the German unification boom, shipping cars, consumer durables and building machinery equipment. But east German demand for machine tools failed to materialise as the region's industry crumbled. Meanwhile, recession and political and economic turmoil struck the sector's main export markets elsewhere in Europe. German machine tool makers have traditionally exported a good 60 per cent of their output, maintaining a 20 per cent share of world markets. Some 70 per cent of all foreign sales go elsewhere in Europe (17 per cent to the former east bloc), and only 10 per cent each to the US and south-east Asia. This dependence on Europe was arguably the worst structural problem exposed by the economic turmoil. The VWD manufacturers association pointed out last year that the industry was most strongly established in the slowest-growing markets. Its products were too expensive and failed to meet market needs. Without counter-measures, it said, German volume output would fall to 50 per cent of that in Japan by the end of the decade. Much management energy has been expended on regaining cost-competitiveness. The main methods have been reductions in staff and vertical integration. Schutte, a typical medium-sized private company, for example, has halved its workforce to about 660. Pittler, one of the bigger concerns, claims its new policy of buying certain components from low-cost east European suppliers, has reduced overall materials costs by 20 per cent. Inventive, customer-specific technologies and software - increasingly developed in partnership with the end-user - have helped German manufacturers compensate partially for the losses in the market for mass-produced standard machines which is falling increasingly under Asian control. But convincing ways have yet to be found for the industry to establish itself firmly in fast-growing Asian markets. Some observers believe the industry should accept that opportunities are limited and concentrate on specialist niches and the 'home' European market. They argue that 'local' suppliers in Asia are already firmly settled, and that the risks and the costs of establishing plant or even distribution and service networks are too high for most German companies in the sector. Many are small or medium-sized, highly-specialised enterprises with only modest volumes. They are often privately-owned, and their finances have been weakened by the recent crisis. Suggestions that they may gain critical mass through merger or takeover have been met with a resistance peculiar to Germany's fiercely independent entrepreneurial Mittelstand. Indeed, the board of the only significant recent merger - between Deckel and Maho - filed for protection from their creditors within a year of the deal's conclusion. However, not everything has been lost. The joint distribution and service network between Deckel and Maho, which was seen as one of the main sources of synergies, has been taken over by Gildemeister, which is in turn interested in building a reciprocal sales/service relationship with Cincinnati Milacron of the US. Even wider synergies are apparently being sought within a holding group, Autania, which last year came under the control of the publicly-owned WestDeutsche Landesbank. Autania, which claims to be Europe's biggest machine tools 'group', has stakes in about 20 different companies. It was built up by the Rothenberger family as an investment vehicle, but WestLB has grander plans. On taking control, the bank announced the individual stakes were to be increased, and Autania was to be transformed into a 'world market alliance'.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Japan and Russia take step towards better relations THE Japanese government yesterday breathed a sigh of relief that relations with Russia, traditionally regarded as a dangerous and untrustworthy neighbour, had taken a step towards normality. In spite of the bad omens for the three-day visit of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, which ended yesterday, the two nations claimed they had made real progress towards ending nearly five decades of mutual hostility. Their agreement to open negotiations on the future of four Pacific islands, seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war, might seem modest but it will attract wide attention among the Japanese public, which values the Northern Territories, as the four Kurile islands are called in Japan, as a symbolic national asset. 'President Yeltsin's visit has opened the first page towards normalising relations ..We have established the foundation for new negotiations,' said Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister. This could reduce the split between Japan and its partners in the Group of Seven industrialised nations on how to handle Russia. Until yesterday, Japan was in danger of being the only industrialised country not to have responded to the end of the cold war by moving towards normal relations with Moscow. The progress achieved on this visit, while short on concrete detail, will strengthen Mr Yeltsin's legitimacy at home, as no doubt he intended. It will also bolster the position of Mr Hosokawa, who had come under opposition attack for allowing the visit to go ahead. Officially, Japan continues to deny large-scale economic aid to Russia until there is more substantial progress on the row over ownership of the islands. Yet Japan has been unable to hold this line rigidly, under pressure from its G7 partners which have been boosting aid to Russia to help its transition to a market economy. Pressure on Japan came to a head last April when Tokyo was chairman of a G7 emergency meeting on aid to Russia, at which it pledged Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.19bn). As a result, Japan is now Russia's third largest donor, despite the islands dispute. Thanks to the improvement in relations over the past few days, Japan will now further increase the flow of aid to Russia, officials say. But this will merely mean faster disbursement of the nearly Dollars 5bn so far pledged, of which only 10 per cent has been paid out, they add. Examples include a Japanese-financed Dollars 200m fibre-optic telecommunications link between Moscow and the Russian far east, part of an aid package agreed two years ago but yet to be implemented. Separately, they signed an economic accord, in which Japan offered its expertise to help Russia shift to a free market economy. The accord listed 11 sectors for increased co-operation, including nuclear power, space technology, environmental conservation, agriculture, transport and communications. They also agreed, for the first time, to seek foreign policy co-ordination, 'based on shared values,' the Japanese foreign ministry said. The omens had indicated that any progress was unlikely. Mr Yeltsin had snubbed his hosts by cancelling plans to visit Tokyo twice in the past 13 months, blaming the former LDP government's hard line over the islands. Japan, meanwhile, was more interested in pouring money into China's fast-developing economy. Many people, especially in the LDP were suspicious that Mr Yeltsin had chosen now to make good his promises to call on the Japanese government. Coming only a week after using tanks to put down the rebels in Moscow, it looked to some that Mr Yeltsin was pulling a propaganda stunt, at Japan's expense, to demonstrate his confidence. As Mr Yeltsin left Moscow, he confirmed Japan's worst misgivings by warning that he hoped the Tokyo government would not spoil the visit by bringing up the question of the islands. Japanese officials felt as if a diplomatic earthquake was on the way. In the event, Mr Yeltsin's arrival did coincide with a real earthquake, the worst to hit Tokyo for several months. But his surprisingly conciliatory stance, including an unscripted apology, repeated several times, for Soviet treatment of Japanese prisoners of war, left the diplomatic landscape rather improved.</p>

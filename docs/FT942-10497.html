			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India expected to miss its foodgrain target despite good monsoon India's foodgrain production during 1993-94 is expected to be 179.1m tonnes, falling short of the target of 188m tonnes, and marginally lower than last year's record production of 180.01m tonnes, despite a good monsoon for the sixth consecutive year. The ministry of agriculture said in its annual report released yesterday that an uneven distribution of rainfall with very wet periods at the beginning of the monsoon season followed by long dry spells in August over north-west India, had resulted in most targets not being met. Production of some oilseed crops has been affected, with the groundnut crop in the Saurashtra and Kutch regions suffering from a deficient south-west monsoon. But a bumper soyabean crop is expected to boost oilseeds production to 20.5m tonnes from 20.27m tonnes last year. Floods in nine Indian states in the north and the east, and inadequate rainfall in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh at the beginning of the season have also played havoc with cash crops. The production of jute and mesta during 1993-94 is expected to fall to 8.3m bales (of 180kg each), from 9m bales last year. Cotton production is also expected to be lower than last year's, falling to 10.6m bales from 12.5m bales. Sugar-cane production is likely to remain at last year's figure of 231.01m tonnes, falling short of the target of 250m tonnes. The ministry has initiated a series of programmes to help state governments to increase crop productivity, for wheat, maize and millet, rice, cotton and jute. Farmers are being encouraged to use new, high-yielding varieties and environment-friendly pesticides.</p>

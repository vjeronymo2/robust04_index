			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK vows to back Brittan at Corfu summit The British government insisted yesterday it would maintain its backing at the European Union summit in Corfu this week for Sir Leon Brittan as the next president of the European Commission. Hinting that Mr John Major, the British prime minister was prepared to see the decision on the successor to Mr Jacques Delors deferred until a special summit in the autumn, senior officials refused to discuss the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister. Instead they said the prime minister would insist that Sir Leon would make an 'excellent president'. But the officials pointedly side stepped the question of whether Mr Major would use Britain's national veto, stressing instead that the 12 heads of government were obliged to reach a 'consensus'. In Rome, the Italian government made clear yesterday it was prepared to bargain hard over the choice of a successor to Mr Delors. Mr Antonio Martino, the Italian foreign minister, told parliament it was vital to link the choice on the succession to the broader issue of obtaining a strong Italian presence in running international organisations. 'All the current candidates have the qualities to make excellent presidents,' Mr Martino told the foreign affairs commission of the chamber of deputies. 'But the issue is of the utmost importance and cannot be resolved in a hurry.' In weighing up the various candidates, it was important 'to take account of the balance among member countries in the allocation of senior posts in other international organisations which are shortly due to be filled'.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Market 'crash' in view unless rules reformed Dr Henry Kaufman, an influential US market economist, warned yesterday that structural changes in the global financial system have left world stock and bond markets vulnerable to a crash in prices. Without reform of international financial regulation, that crash 'will dwarf what we have experienced so far this year'. He told a global banking conference in New York that recent dramatic movements in bond and stock prices were a prelude to much greater volatility because structural changes in financial markets had made them more susceptible to sharp swings in prices. Those changes included: The expanding role of households, mostly via mutual funds, as investors in the markets and providers of capital to borrowers. A sudden collapse of confidence in mutual funds could precipitate a market crash, with severe consequences for the economy. The growth of complex trading strategies and financial instruments such as derivatives. The increasing presence in financial markets of unregulated 'high octane' portfolio managers with very near-term financial goals and no special loyalty to any one national market. He estimates these managers of hedge and other similar high-risk funds control as much as Dollars 500bn (Pounds 336bn) in capital. The increasing importance of non-bank financial institutions as suppliers of credit, which means future restraint on credit creation will come from variations in asset prices rather than traditional squeezes on credit supply by banks and traditional lenders. As a result of these changes, Dr Kaufman believes, the world has 'moved into a more hazardous environment in which new financial excesses are practically unavoidable'. A complete overhaul of the supervision of markets and institutions was required to contain future volatility, he said. Dr Kaufman also recommended that, in order to prevent a sudden sell-off of mutual fund shares sparking a massive collapse in financial markets, investors should be forced to give 60-90 days' notice before redeeming shares of bond and stock funds.</p>

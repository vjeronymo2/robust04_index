			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE;  </P> <P> U.S. REGULATORS RUNNING LINCOLN S&amp;L HIRE MANAGER TO LIQUIDATE JUNK BONDS  </P> <P> Federal regulators running Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan have hired a former  Orange County thrift executive to liquidate much of Lincoln's junk bond  portfolio, which consists of more than $400 million in high-risk, high-yield  corporate bonds.  </P> <P> Kevin Becker, 31, will sell the junk bonds over the next year in his role as  manager of Irvine-based Lincoln's $1.7-billion securities portfolio, which also  includes less-risky bonds that are backed by home mortgages.  </P> <P> Becker will be working out of Lincoln's administrative offices in Phoenix, a  few steps away from the S&amp;L's parent firm, American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> Lincoln's junk bonds will not be sold at fire-sale prices, nor will all of them  necessarily be sold, said Mark Randall, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  agent managing the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Much of the proceeds from the junk bond sales will go toward defraying expenses  that have been increasing the deficit at Lincoln, he said. The S&amp;L slipped  into insolvency last month.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L's deficit -- liabilities in excess of assets -- was more than $150  million at the end of May, according to William J. Crawford, commissioner of  the California Department of Savings and Loan.  </P> <P> Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, saying that American Continental was  operating the S&amp;L unsafely and dissipating its $5.3 billion in assets.  American Continental had filed a bankruptcy petition the previous day to  protect itself from creditors while it tried to reorganize its debts under  Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.  </P> <P> Becker has worked for regulators for the last 3 1/2 years at the insolvent  Security Savings &amp; Loan in Scottsdale, Ariz. Previously, he was an  assistant controller at Western Empire Savings &amp; Loan in Yorba Linda and a  chief financial officer at Brookside Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

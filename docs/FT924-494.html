			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool WOOL The market in Australia closed last week with prices tending slightly dearer and the AWC market indicator at 509 cents a kg, after a low point in the week of 502. There were however quite heavy withdrawals by farmers, either at thier own reserve prices fixed earlier, or prior to the sale itself. The Christmas recess in the selling season is expected to be a dull period for the trade. Prices are as usual subject to currency movements and strengthening in the US dollar has tended to firm up UK calculations of overseas costs.</p>

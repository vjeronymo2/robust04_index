			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Birt launches counter-attack on BBC 'snipers' MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, yesterday launched a counter-attack against his critics, describing them as traditionalists, opportunists, society's hecklers and old BBC soldiers 'sniping at us with their muskets'. The riposte, which included an unprecedented attack on the past inefficiency of the BBC, came the day after Mr Mark Tully, the BBC's veteran India correspondent, had attacked what he called the atmosphere of fear and sycophancy in the corporation. Mr Birt told the Radio Academy Festival in Birmingham yesterday that the BBC had been 'an unwieldy, almost soviet-style command economy' where money was allocated from the top down to every activity. Programme makers needed the skills 'of supplicants at some Byzantine court', and a lack of adequate financial information and control had permeated the whole organisation, he said. He set out examples of waste and inefficiency: A new radio studio used for 3 per cent of the time. A graphics suite used for one full day a fortnight. A large programme-making area spending Pounds 200m a year without a single accountant to track expenditure. A tendency for every department to invest in its own expensive facilities and staff whether necessary or not. Overheads of Pounds 300m a year. Mr Birt argued: 'Millions of pounds were wasted through the years, frittered away on over-provisioned overheads, and equipment lying idle. Waste is money that should have been spent on programmes.' Since 1990, Mr Birt added, Pounds 180m had been saved and savings now running at around Pounds 100m a year were being ploughed into programmes. He told the festival that there was no choice but Producer Choice, the system introduced in April that allows full costing of programmes and gives producers the right to buy services on the open market. Mr Birt conceded that modifications were necessary - a smaller number of business units inside the BBC and block contracts to reduce the number of individual transactions between them. Mr Birt appealed to his critics to face realities rather than looking back with nostalgia.</p>

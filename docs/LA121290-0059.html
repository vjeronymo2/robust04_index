			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SKILLS WITHOUT THRILLS AT CALTECH CONCERT  </P> <P> Janos Starker, aloof, magisterial, the great stone face of the cello, and  Menahem Pressler, that most animated and passionate of pianists, proved an  oddly matched pair at their Coleman Concerts recital in Beckman Auditorium at  Caltech on Sunday.  </P> <P> In an afternoon of orderly, low-key music making, Pressler consistently  deferred to his partner in what should have been a melding of the disparate  strengths of two commanding artists.  </P> <P> Starker seemed particularly ungenerous with emotional nuance and variety of  tone, whipping speedily, sometimes perfunctorily through three core components  of the repertory: Brahms' Sonata in E minor, the Debussy Sonata, and  Beethoven's Opus 69. Pressler offered consistently polished work, but with only  a fraction of the dynamism we expect of him.  </P> <P> Still, there were rewards in encountering the Brahms sonata in such an  uncluttered reading as theirs, and the notes, if not all the mysteries, were  for once projected in Debussy's elusive work, which Starker executed with  sovereign control.  </P> <P> Rhythmic acuity and lack of affection were not enough, however, in Beethoven's  sonata, which demands a more heroic stance, more drama and weight of tone than  was encountered on this occasion.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Loshchilin] </F>   [Text] Washington April 13 TASS -- "High-ranking U.S.  officials are displaying much interest in the continuation of  Russia's diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and are stressing  the importance of coordinating actions with us," ITAR-TASS was  told by Russian envoy to the Middle East talks Viktor Posuvalyuk  after his consultations with U.S. counterparts.    "Much attention during the consultations was devoted to the  presentation and comparison of the Russian and American national  interests in the region. In spite of some understandable and  inevitable differences, we are nevertheless guided by the belief  that we have a common task to do -- to bring the peace process  to a happy end, which will contribute decisively to stability in  the Middle East," Posuvalyuk noted.    "The consultations focused both on the Israeli-Palestinian  talks on self-government in the Gaza Strip and in the Jericho  area, now under way in Cairo, and on some other directions,  particularly the Syrian-Israeli relations," he added. "The sides  have agreed that we should not copy each other's course, but  should make use of our own means in the pursuit of our common  goal. We have traditional contacts with Damascus and a definite  reserve of confidence, which we are striving to exploit in order  to strengthen bilateral relations and promote the Syrian-Israeli  dialogue."    "Both co-chairmen of the Middle East process are interested  in the early success of the Cairo talks. We expect them to be  rounded off by the signing of an agreement already at the end of  this month. It would have been premature to speak now about an  early breakthrough in the Israeli-Syrian direction, which is the  key and very difficult area. But this does not mean that we  intend to sit on our hands. The visits of PLO chairman Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to Moscow,  which are to begin on April 19 and 24, are among the most  important events of the foreseeable future. In addition to  bilateral relations, accent will be laid on the discussion of  the situation at the Middle East talks, on Russia's role as  co-chairman of the peace process," Posuvalyuk stated.</p>

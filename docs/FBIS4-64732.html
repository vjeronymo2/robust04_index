			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["J.A.S." report: "Matutes States: `I Also Request </F> Gonzalez' Resignation'"]    [Text] "May it be very clear that I fully endorse Jose  Maria Aznar and the position adopted by my party," Abel Matutes,  People's Party [PP] candidate in the European elections, stated  yesterday in response to a question from ABC. The head of the  PP list emphasized that "on various occasions, I, too, have  called for the prime minister's resignation, since the grave  situation currently ravaging Spain affects the credibility of  the whole government and, especially, of its leader."    After stressing that he does not question the prime  minister's personal integrity, the former European commissioner  insisted that "the resignation of Felipe Gonzalez is necessary."  Asked about his former, rather reserved declarations, Abel  Matutes emphasized that "my party requested the prime minister's  appearance before the Congress of Deputies, and I deemed this  appearance necessary on previous occasions, just like the  assumption of political responsibilities."    "At any rate," Matutes concluded, "the problem is that,  whatever the prime minister will say at his appearance, I am  afraid that it will be too late."    M.L.G. Franco reports that in Bilbao Matutes added that "the  corruption had damaged Spain's international reputation,  traumatized the Spanish people, and would prevent or slow down  our country's economic recovery."</p>

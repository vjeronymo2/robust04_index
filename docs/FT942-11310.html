			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Tories fail disastrously in Birmingham The Conservatives failed disastrously last night in their attempt to win their main target outside London - Birmingham City Council, the UK's largest metropolitan authority. A succession of Conservative ministers had visited the city, and Labour had only to drop four seats to lose control. Instead, in an election covering 40 wards, the party won two seats from the Conservatives but lost one to the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives made no gains at all. With all the results counted Labour had 62 seats, the Conservatives 40 and the Liberal Democrats 14. Labour thus has an overall majority of eight. Mrs Theresa Stewart, who became the Labour leader of the council last autumn, attributed the victory to an unpopular government, responsive council services and excellent candidates. Labour penetrated Conservative strongholds with its two gains. One was in prosperous and leafy Edgbaston, which has never gone Labour before. The other was in Quinton, where last month Labour upset the political odds with a by-election victory. Turnout was patchy, ranging from 29.6 per cent in the inner city and Asian-dominated ward of Sparkbrook, to 50.9 per cent in the southern ward of Sheldon. This reflected the generally low-key nature of the campaign, in which the Conservatives had sought to tar Labour with the 'loony left' brush and to win votes by promising better management of council affairs. Also in the west Midlands, Labour gained control of Wolverhampton, thanks to a net gain of two seats from the Conservatives who had targeted the council. Elsewhere, however, Liberal Democrats were the biggest winners. To an extent this reflected the parties' differing bases in the last equivalent elections four years ago, when the Liberal Democrats did badly with only 18.5 per cent of the vote outside London, while Labour did exceptionally, with 43.8 per cent. The Conservatives, who in 1990 hit 'bedrock' support of 30.2 per cent, made only one gain, in Tandridge, Surrey. Liberal Democrats celebrated a psychologically important result in the Kent town of Tunbridge Wells, with a gain of five seats from the Conservatives. Only 16 seats were up for election. This left the town, a traditional Tory bastion, with only 24 Conservative councillors, balanced by 20 Liberal Democrats, three Labour councillors and one independent. This appeared to boost the Liberal Democrat claim that it could pose a genuine threat to the Conservatives in the south. Liberal Democrats won overall control of Eastleigh, Hampshire, which will be the scene next month of the by-election caused by the death of the Conservative MP Mr Stephen Milligan. However, four gains were not enough to win Weymouth &amp; Portland in Dorset for the Liberal Democrats, which has suffered from defence cuts. It remains under no overall control. Congleton, in Cheshire, also saw the Liberal Democrats take overall control, having taken three wards from Labour and four from the Tories. The council had previously been hung. Liberal Democrats also took Bath in Somerset, Colchester and Rochford, both in Essex, St Albans in Hertfordshire and Winchester in Hampshire - all targeted and previously under no overall control - and Mole Valley in Surrey. Liberal Democrats also inflicted heavy losses on Labour in traditional strongholds such as Southampton without wresting con-trol. In spite of its high base of seats from 1990, Labour managed a gain from the Conservatives in Welwyn Hatfield, and from no overall control in West Lancashire. Two gains each for Labour and the Liberal Democrats were enough to deprive the Conservatives of overall control of Hertsmere in Hertfordshire. Liberal Democrats also scored a number of gains from Labour in northern authorities, robbing them of control in Kirklees, Oldham and Pendle. Labour celebrated a morale-boosting victory in Derby where it won enough wards to take overall control.</p>

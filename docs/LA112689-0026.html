			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BLACKLIST  </P> <P> "Children of the Blacklist," by Jack Mathews (Oct. 15), gave me a jolt. I was  one of the blacklisted, although not important enough in either "the party" or  "the industry" to be called before HUAC. Needless to say, I avidly absorbed the  photos and the text -- and then I came to Hugo Butler. I worked with Hugo for  many, many months and became friends with him and with his wife, Jean. I can  tell you that he was one of the most original, delightful, engaging  personalities I ever knew. It is simply not possible that he could have been a  monster in private.  </P> <P> Jack Mathews was irresponsible in using only the interview with Mary Hugo. He  had to see that her input was not pertinent. He mentioned that Hugo had five  daughters. Why didn't he interview any of the others?  </P> <P> ANNE F. TAYLOR  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Battle Royal The Crown Estate, which manages property owned by the sovereign, is being sued by the operators of one of the oldest ferry services in Europe over moves to close the route, Tim Burt writes. White Horse Ferries is seeking damages after the Crown Estate ordered the company to halt services between Tilbury and Gravesend, the Thameside towns linked by a river crossing since 1086. The Crown Estate says White Horse is breaching the sovereign's 'ancient rights to run a ferry' on the river. The company bought the service last year from Sealink Stena, but the Crown Estate says the route franchise was non-transferable. Franchises from Tilbury are issued at the discretion of the monarch and the Crown Estate says White Horse has the right to operate in only one direction - from Gravesend to Tilbury. The Crown Estate is seeking talks in an attempt to avoid legal action and negotiate a franchise.</p>

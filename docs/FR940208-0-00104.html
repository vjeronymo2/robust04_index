			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Consultation Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7 consultation for critical habitat will focus on the effects of actions on tortoise habitat whether or not it is currently occupied. The presence or absence of tortoises will not factor into the determination of actions that trigger section 7. Any action that may affect critical habitat will trigger section 7 consultation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement to consider adverse modification of critical habitat is an incremental section 7 consideration above and beyond section 7 review necessary to evaluate jeopardy and incidental take. As required by 50 CFR 402.14, a Federal agency must consult with the Service if it determines an action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat. Federal agencies are responsible for determining whether or not to consult with the Service and should consider a number of factors when determining if a proposed action may affect critical habitat. To the extent possible, agencies should consult on a programmatic basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service will consider the effect of the proposed action on the primary constituent elements along with the reasons why that particular area was determined to be critical habitat. The trigger to initiate section 7 consultation (under adverse modification) is any action that may affect any of the five primary constituent elements of critical habitat or reduce the potential of critical habitat to develop these elements_this is independent from any action that would affect known individuals. The evaluation should also take into consideration what happens outside of critical habitat because such projects may also impact habitat within critical habitat. It should also consider what effects the action may have on other adjacent CHUs, the recovery unit, and the overall range of the desert tortoise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Examples of Proposed Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any final regulation that designates critical habitat, a brief description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by such designation. Regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities that disturb or remove the primary constituent elements within designated CHUs might adversely modify the tortoise's critical habitat. These activities may include actions that would reduce the area of a recovery unit below that which can sustain a viable population or provide for movements, dispersal, and gene flow; reduce the quantity and quality of forage species, either directly or through soil modifications, thereby affecting the tortoise's nutritional requirements; reduce the suitability of substrates for burrowing, nesting, and overwintering; reduce the number and availability of burrow sites, caliche caves, and other shelter sites; appreciably modify the function and/or availability of vegetation to provide shelter from temperature extremes and predators; and increase the potential for future habitat disturbance and human-caused mortality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of Federal agencies or departments fund, authorize, or carry out actions that affect lands that the Service designates as critical habitat. Among these agencies are the BLM, Department of Defense (DOD), Bureau of Mines, Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, National Park Service, Federal Highway Administration, and Department of Housing and Urban Development. Federal agencies and the Service are currently consulting on numerous activities proposed within the range of the desert tortoise. These activities include Federal land management plans; Bureau livestock grazing operations; road, trail, and utility construction and maintenance; mining plans of operation; land sales, leases, and exchanges; Federal housing loans; BLM recreation and public purpose leases; permits for OHV activities; military operations; sand and gravel operations; rights-of-way; landfills; and a number of smaller actions. The economic analysis provides more details on specific projects affected by critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

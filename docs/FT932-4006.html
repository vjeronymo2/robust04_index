			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Ford plant rivals Japanese output FORD'S ENGINES plant at Bridgend in south Wales is achieving greater productivity than rival Japanese car manufacturers, Mr Ray Pittman, European engine operations manager, said yesterday. He made the claim as Ford disclosed that pan-European demand for its new Mondeo family car range had led to Bridgend almost doubling production of Zeta engines. Mr Pittman said Bridgend was capable of building 100 units an hour. Comparable Japanese plants were building equivalent 16-valve engines at 60 to 70 units an hour.</p>

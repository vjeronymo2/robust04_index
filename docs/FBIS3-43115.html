BULGARIA      COMMERCIAL BANKS REPORT 9 BILLION LEVA LOSS IN OCTOBER:  According to figures published in the information bulletin of the  Bulgarian National Bank (BNB), commercial banks reported profits of  497 million leva during October, but the banks' balance sheets still  showed losses in excess of 9 billion leva, mainly arising from bad  loans to loss-making enterprises.  The banks' stability continues to  the threatened because of the failure to settle the problem of  enterprise bad debt, delays in privatization of the banking sector,  and the holdup of the structural reform.  The recorded losses stem  chiefly from financial operations -- the banks' principal activity.  Expenditures for wages, insurance, and allowances are also running  at a high level, although these make up only a small proportion of  the banks' costs.  BNB experts are unanimous in declaring that the  commercial banks' problems are primarily due to bad loans to  enterprises.  It is said that, because of this, one state bank will  be unable to pay a dividend to shareholders this year.

Shell Bulgaria is a wholly owned  subsidiary of the London-based company, Kortenhorst explained.  He  expects at least another $10 million to be invested here in 1994.  So far, none of the invested money has been borrowed from Bulgarian  banks.  The completion of the first gas station that Shell built in  Dragichevo at a cost of $1 million is being now followed by four  more stations -- one each in Montana and Asenovgrad and two in  Pazardzhik -- all of which are under construction.  Shell Bulgaria  controls less than 1 percent of the petroleum-products market but  aspires to bring this percentage up to 5-30 percent, Kortenhorst  said.  Kortenhorst is pleased with his main Bulgarian partner  Nef tokhim and says that "the Burgas Refinery works well and its  products meet our standard requirements."  He denied allegations by  the Union of Private Oil Business Companies in Bulgaria that Shell  bribes public officers to obtain building permits for its gas  stations.

Its authorized capital is 107.3 million leva, of which  90 percent (98.7 million leva) is held by the Foreign Aid Agency.  Balkanbank is the exclusive distributor of loans.  The credit center  aims to help the land reform through medium- and long-term  investment lending to Bulgarian agriculture, its executive director  Dimitur Keremidchiyski explains in an article published in the  latest issue of the "Capital Press" weekly.  Loans to sole farmers  range from 40,000 to 180,000 leva, while up to 500,000 leva is lent  to cooperatives.  The money can be invested in equipment, livestock,  construction, and repairs.  The center lends at an annual interest  rate of 7.9 percent, with a one-year grace period.  The maximum term  for repayment of the principal is seven years.      The sources of financing are the credit center's owned capital  and reserves, leva loans from banks and lending institutions at 6  percent annual interest, an anti-inflationary scheme, foreign  currency funds borrowed abroad, and funds granted under specialized  assistance programs.  According to Keremidchiyski, so far the only  source of financing has been the center's own share capital.  Since  the start of 1993, the credit center has opened two credit lines of  107 million leva and 17 million leva each.  Shares in the credit  center can be held by juristic and physical persons, industrial  companies, nonprofit corporations, and so on.

The  grounds for the board's decision included the irregular deliveries  of petroleum from Russia last month and certain weaknesses in  concluding contracts for processing.  The company's Supervisory  Council has also recommended that the board remove Managing Director  Georgi Sarustov.  The board will consider this matter at a meeting  later this week.

The company documents will be  registered at Sofia District Court next week.  The Irish partner in  the joint enterprise is the Navan company, which will transfer $4  million to the credit of Biokhim to finance its 25-percent share in  the venture.  The Bulgarian share of the new company consists of  long-term assets belonging to the erstwhile Chelopech Limited  Company.  Navan managed to convince Bulgarian experts of the  economic viability of a new process to eliminate arsenic from the  gold-bearing ore concentrate produced at the Chelopech mine, and the  new venture will install the necessary equipment.  The existing  mining and ore-concentrating plant, which came into operation in the  seventies, is outdated and standing idle at present, but is  nonetheless capable of producing and concentrating up to 0.5 million  tons of ore annually.  Up to two years ago, when work at the mine  was suspended, the mine produced 57 percent of Bulgaria's gold  output.  The mine is estimated to have about 50 million tons of ore  reserves, with a content of 47 grams of gold and 120 grams of silver  per ton.

The customs duties will  be reduced 20 percent during the first year, 40 percent during the  second year, and 60 percent from the third year on.  For their part,  the member countries of the European Union will be able to export to  Bulgaria 42,000 hectoliters of bottled and cask wines and 1,000  hectoliters of sparkling wines at 10, 20, and 30 percent reduced  duties during the first, second, and third years respectively.

An  international system of notification and control of pollution  incidents will be set up.

(Sofia BTA in English 1640 GMT 28 Nov 93 AU)      MINISTRY REPORTS ON MEAT PRICES, LIVESTOCK NUMBERS:  In late  1994, Bulgarians will pay 108 leva for a kilogram of pork,  Agriculture Ministry experts stated on 1 December.  Pork presently  costs 80 leva per kilogram, while chicken costs 50 leva.  The  minimum monthly wage in Bulgaria of 1,400 leva would 18 kg of pork  or 28 kg of chicken.  Meat prices are rising in line with the annual  inflation rate, which, according to the national budget bill, will  average 45 percent in 1994, ministry experts said.  Demand for meat  slackened dramatically in 1993, and state-owned companies reacted by  cutting meat output by 43 percent in January-September 1993, as  compared with the same period in 1992.  The output of chicken meat  alone plummeted 63 percent.      Lowered domestic demand was the main reason for the decline in  animals purchased and in livestock numbers, according to the  figures.  In January-September 1993, cattle numbers went down by  266,000 head, pigs by 677,000 head, and sheep by 1 million head.  The belated land reform and high feed prices were further factors  contributing to the livestock decimation.  In January-September  1993, meat exports dropped to one-tenth of their 1992 level, while  meat imports doubled.  Meat purchase prices are expected to lag  behind retail prices and will probably go up by no more than 10  percent.  The margin between purchase and retail prices tends to  widen and this ruins meat producers, while the profits are  distributed down the chain of middlemen.  Experts expect domestic  meat consumption to rise gradually if the economy recovers.  The  Agriculture Ministry is contemplating measures to encourage meat  exports and reduce export taxes on furs, wool, and other products.

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 2 CONGRESSMEN BACK PROPOSITION 115  </P> <P> Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Robert Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) on  Friday announced their support for Proposition 115, the so-called "speedy  trial" initiative.  </P> <P> "It is long overdue that we start giving as much consideration to the victim as  we do the criminals," Gallegly said. "Victims have civil rights as well as  criminals."  </P> <P> Gallegly and Lagomarsino said the June ballot measure will not only help speed  trials, but ease jail crowding and reduce the cost of prosecuting criminals.  </P> <P> If it passes, Proposition 115 would eliminate some pretrial hearings after  grand jury indictments, give judges rather than lawyers the right to question  jurors before trial and consolidate trials of multiple defendants accused of  the same crime.  </P> <P> The congressmen announced their support for the initiative at a news conference  outside the Ventura County Government Center. Also attending and endorsing the  ballot measure were Ventura County Sheriff John Gillespie, Assistant Dist.  Atty. Toy White and Camarillo resident Patti Linebaugh, whose 2-year-old  granddaughter, Amy Sue Seitz, was raped and murdered in 1978.  </P> <P> "I am outraged at the mockery of our court system, the intentional delays, the  millions of dollars of taxpayers' money spent to protect the defendants,"  Linebaugh said in a written statement.  </P> <P> "It's time for the voters of this state to demand their rights for an  expeditious trial and swift carry-out of the punishment rendered. Use the  taxpayers' dollars to prevent crime, not encourage it."  </P></p>

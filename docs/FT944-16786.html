			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Hanley forecasts recovery in government fortunes Mr Jeremy Hanley yesterday predicted a sustained revival in the government's fortunes as he shrugged off his accident-prone image in a confident opening performance as party chairman at the Bournemouth conference. Setting the official tone for the four days of debates, Mr Hanley presented the Conservatives as the party of realism and achievement - and Labour and the Liberal Democrats as the parties of cheap rhetoric. He also signalled the start of a co-ordinated strategy to rebuild Mr Major's public image as a quiet but effective and gritty prime minister. Hailing Mr Major as the architect of what may prove to be an historic peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Hanley told the conference that Britain was led by 'the right man in the right place at the right time'. His comments came as colleagues said that, in spite of the expected squalls at the conference over Northern Ireland and Europe, Mr Major was convinced that his government was at the start of sustained revival. Mr Hanley condemned Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, as a man without memory or conscience: 'He may dream of a new socialism, but his party remains a nightmare of old socialism.' He predicted a fifth victory for the Conservatives in the election due by mid-1997. He added that it would be 'a victory not through deals and pacts with other parties, not by casting aside our long-held principles and values because of a lust for power, but by our determination and our dedication and on the realities of our achievements.' Insisting that the government was listening to the concerns of the electorate, Mr Hanley said that the economic recovery would bring 'confidence, jobs and prosperity'. He sought to forestall a threatened grassroots rebellion in Thursday's debate on crime by pledging that the government would continue to take tougher action to protect law-abiding citizens: 'We are the only party of law and order and we will never stop being the party of law and order.' Mr Hanley also picked up the theme of Mr Major's opening remarks at the conference on Monday evening by accusing Labour of planning a 'massive transfer of power and sovereignty to Brussels'. The warm applause for the new chairman lifted some of the shadow over Mr Hanley after his recent succession of gaffes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A nationwide economic  data system has been established in China, which is expected to  play an important role in economic policy-making and  administration.    So far, data banks have been set up in all the 30 provinces,  autonomous regions and municipalities, all the cities with the  status of municipalities, and all the 280 major cities and  prefectures as well as 1,500 counties throughout the country.    These data banks provide governments at various levels with  timely, accurate and useful data for medium- and long-term  economic forecasts. Last year the State Information Center  submitted a report to the central government, warning that the  country's total investment in fixed assets had surpassed 1,000  billion yuan, thus helping the central government to immediately  strengthen macro control over investment in fixed assets.    In particular, the administrative data banks have been  systemized. The administrative data bank on projects to absorb  foreign funds has collected over 100,000 pieces of information  on 3,000 projects. The data is updated regularly. In addition,  the national data bank of investment in fixed assets, the  national data bank of laws and regulations and the national data  bank on macro economic control have all gone into regular  operation.    Besides, a joint service network of data banks has been set  up to cover 13 provinces and municipalities. The services will  cover foreign investment guidance, tourism, international  finance and enterprise laws and will charge fees.</p>

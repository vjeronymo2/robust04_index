Writer Stefan Heym, 80, felt as if he were back in his  former job as a U.S. Army sergeant during World War II: "I am  engaged in psychological warfare." So Heym permitted rumors to  circulate for months on whether or not he would be a Bundestag  candidate for the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism].    He will. Last Sunday [6 February], the heirs of the Honecker  party proudly presented Heym as their direct candidate for the  Berlin-Center/Prenzlauer Berg electoral district. Says flashy  PDS man Gregor Gysi: "A great thing." And eternal illusionist  Heym in the lightning storm of flashbulbs: "I run as an  independent candidate."    The two have arranged a mutually beneficial deal: The man of  letters is assured of media attention, and the PDS can hope for  a few more votes in the Bundestag election.    So far, however, almost all opinion researchers see little  chance for the SED [Socialist Unity Party] successors to get  above the 5-percent hurdle in October; the prognoses fluctuate  between 3 and 4 percent of the votes. But Gysi and comrades bank  on the PDS gaining at least three direct mandates; then the  party would be sure of its Bundestag presence even below the  5-percent cutoff.    The strategy is "Illustrious Names for Direct Election"--a  will-o'-the-wisp like Guenther Maleuda, whom the SED had  promoted as high as deputy chairman of the Council of State, let  himself be wooed and won.    With someone like Stefan Heym, the PDS could actually outrun  the competition in eastern Berlin. According to a Forsa poll, 31  percent of the voters there will "definitely" vote for  "prominent direct candidates" of the PDS, and 13 percent  "perhaps."    According to election campaign manager Andre Brie, in the  race for ballots the PDS seeks to win above all protest voters  and "people attached to the GDR." So it is raging nostalgia for  which Stefan Heym, the cool observer and critic of the GDR,  becomes a willing tool.    At any rate, his sharp eye has dimmed increasingly since  German unification.    "The old SED had me censored, watched and harassed," Heym  sums up the years after he had graduated from the "eternal  beating around the bush" and could publish bestsellers such as  his novel "Collin" (1979) only in the West. The Stasi spied on  the writer even in his bedroom.    The bestknown nonperson of the GDR after Wolf Biermann, he  now shows leniency. With its offer the PDS signals not only  "that its members have found a very different relationship with  me than the crusty old comrades formerly had." At the same time,  the PDS "makes clear that it is undergoing a process of internal  change." So quickly do Honecker's heirs purify themselves.    The writer does not want to report on a PDS meeting where he  could have tested his judgment.    Instead Heym proclaims "in the interest of the citizens of  the GDR" a "true, strong, left opposition," together with the  new fellow travelers. Most of all he would like to have along  the SPD [Social Democratic Party], quite in line with the  People's Front ideology, "if you will."    Since the turnaround, the mulish "superior Ossi" [eastern  German] has called several times for similarly successful  projects. On legendary 4 November 1989, speaker Heym believed  that hundreds of thousands of East Berliners had assembled in  Alexander Square not only "of their own free will for freedom  and democracy," but also "for a socialism worthy of the name."    Shortly thereafter, after the opening of the Wall, Heym was  shocked by a "fierce horde"--debased by the West--"which,  pushing backs against bellies, streamed to Hertie and Bilka  [department stores] in the chase of glittering junk."    Heym and other intellectuals, who had been permitted to get  to know the West despite the Wall, protected themselves from the  new, complicated reality. In the proclamation "For Our Country"  they still saw a chance at the end of November 1989 "to develop  a socialist alternative to the Federal Republic."    Later, it seemed sometimes as if the grand old man wanted to  own up that the new reality overtaxes him. He once admitted in a  small circle debating unification, crisis and the Stasi: "All  that bores me." What does he find fascinating? Terse answer:  "Myself."    But he did not withdraw to edit his novel about communist  Karl Radek. In summer of 1992, the much-practiced first  signatory lent his name once more, this time to the "Committee  for Justice," founded jointly by Gysi and the CDU [Christian  Democratic Union] grumbler, Peter-Michael Diestel.    "Everyone in this country has a lobby," said Heym at the  time, "only the people have none. We want to create that  possibility now." The people rejected it, so its new wannabe  tribune now himself looks for access to the rostrum. "If you  call that vanity--I am so vain that I want to test whether  people really like me."    Some are worried about the outcome of the experiment. For  example, Lothar de Maiziere, the last GDR president, warned his  friend Gysi: "Must you deface a monument?"    Deputy SPD Chairman Wolfgang Thierse, who is a candidate in  the same electoral district as Heym, also questions whether his  competitor "knows what he is doing to himself and his admirers  by changing sides."    His rival evidently considers such friendly objections by  politician and Germanic linguist Thierse a misunderstanding:  Admirers are "buyers of my books"--and there were plenty of  them. Heym cannot see a change in sides: Like the PDS, he had  "always been for democracy and socialism, and I still am."    The 80-year-old candidate does not want to proclaim great  tidings, and he promises nothing. Heym even distanced himself  from the idea of at least assuring the voters: "I will not bore  you."    The gray panther is looking forward with devilish glee to  being able to open the 13th legislative period as president by  age with a tremendous speech. Unless another party "finds an  even nicer elderly gentleman than myself."</p>

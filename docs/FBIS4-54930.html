			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.Cz. and E.K.: "Government Versus Media; </F> Everyone Bad, Television the Worst"]    [Text] The most recent conflict between the prime minister  and television has been the classic example of a case that, by  virtue of the law, should be handled by the National Council of  Radio and Television [KRRiT]. The council has already expressed  its desire to deal with the issue; it has been in a state of  alert for a week. However, none of the parties of the conflict  have requested it to take a stand. Therefore, KRRiT itself  asked Waldemar Pawlak whether the fragment of his Sejm speech,  in which he criticized the mass media and accused them of  censuring government communiques, might be treated as an  official complaint. If so, KRRiT will look into the conflict  and assess who was right.  <H5>  Who Has the Right To Criticize </H5>   Relations between the government and the media are based on  strange principles. The government, via its Press Office,  informs only about whatever it wants, and it often evades  journalists' questions. For example, a day before the general  strike of Solidarity, instead of hearing a commentary,  journalists were sent from one minister to another, from a  minister to the prime minister, from the prime minister to the  communique, which was finally signed by the director of the  Government Press Office. Such policy is facilitated by the lack  of a press spokesman. It is not the spokesman but the ministers  themselves that should represent their policy, Minister Michal  Strak stated in the Sejm. At the same time, the government  wants the media to issue information about everything it does,  regardless of the gravity of the matters, statements, visits.  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has several times voiced his  dissatisfaction with the fact that his speeches are not  published in their entirety, that the television broadcasts only  brief summaries of events concerning him. In important  situations, when asked about a comment, he himself evades  answers.  <H5>  Luckily, There Is Television </H5>   For some time now, the attack on the media has been  stronger;  politicians have been complaining mostly about the television.  Minister Michal Strak keeps asking for special "windows" for the  government, for Labor Minister Leszek Miller, who, when he took  over the office, officially gave up the television succession  from Jacek Kuron. Right now, he is discussing this matter with  Television President Wieslaw Walendziak by mail. The television  president agrees to prepare jointly the programs concerning the  most important issues related to social policy; however, he  consistently refuses to grant any "windows" to politicians.    The most resounding conflict so far has been the one between  the prime minister and "Wiadomosci" over the reading of the  entire governmental communique concerning the strikes. The  television employees admit that the government is exerting the  greatest pressure on information programs. As for public  affairs programs in the first program of the television,  including the "Bilans" ["Balance"] program, the Government Press  Office is for the time being submitting merely remarks.  Walendziak's Adviser Rafal Matyja admits that political  pressure on the television is quite frequent, but its directors  do not want to publicize this. Most of it can be handled by the  television itself. Only the most serious pressure, exerted most  brutally, leaks outside.    KRRiT member Andrzej Zarebski concedes that, as a result of  the recent tensions around the television, KRRiT must "again  lean over" the provisions of the law on radio and television  that pertain to the possibility of making it possible to "the  chief organs of the state to present directly and explain the  state policy on the radio and television." This may alter the  content of the KRRiT disposition in this matter, which has been  prepared but not yet announced.    The pressure has not so far been exerted to the still  state-owned Polish Press Agency [PAP]. The PAP journalists say:  Luckily, there is the television. The various governments,  except for the Olszewski Cabinet, understood that this is only  an information agency.  <H5>  Hand in Hand </H5>   It is hard to tell whether there is a joint information  policy of the coalition. Both the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] have their own vision  and experience in contacts with the media. They only go "hand  in hand" as far as criticizing the media, especially the  television, is concerned. Not long ago, Aleksander Kwasniewski  admitted that a lot more is being written about the left than a  year ago, which is understandable. "However, if anyone thinks  that this is because of well-wishing, he is naive," Kwasniewski  believes. However, he calls this attitude of the media toward  the left a constant element of the political game. Criticism  became stronger as reports on the Solidarity strikes appeared.  The coalition politicians unanimously accuse journalists of  heating the strike atmosphere. As usual, television receives  the greatest rap on the knuckles.    The PSL, which does not have a daily or a major weekly and  which has always complained about the negative attitude of the  media toward them, hoped to improve this image when it came to  power. The SLD, which can always count on TRYBUNA, has not so  far turned it into a source of solid, firsthand information. It  seems that its politicians are more interested in the image  presented in media other than TRYBUNA.    The PSL, apart from complaints of a purely political nature,  is also criticizing the programs of the television Agricultural  Section. PSL Deputy President Franciszek Stafaniuk complained in  a letter to the television directors that the journalists  present the arguments of the consumers, not of the peasants,  that they are not propeasant, and, finally, that they devote too  much attention to general information instead of typically  agricultural affairs. Politicians, on the other hand, are  trying to see to it that such people and not others are invited  to the studio. Agricultural Section Director Leszek Spalinski  admits that the source of the differences between his team and  part of the PSL is the outlook on the future of agriculture.  The team is in favor of changes, transformations of the  structure of the rural areas, while some of the PSL politicians  want to maintain the status quo.  <H5>  Search Within a Small Circle </H5>   Rafal Matyja believes that, among such conflicts, the model  of public television and its relation with the world of politics  is being created. The definition and the role of public  television in a democratic state will be the subject of a  seminar that is scheduled for Friday [6 May]. Participating in  the seminar will be members of the Board of Directors and the  Supervisory Board of the television and KRRiT members.  Journalists will not participate.</p>

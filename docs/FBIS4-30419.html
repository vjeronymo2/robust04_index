			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 26 June that the government is  reviewing a draft proposal to be presented to the North Korean  side regarding the North-South summit suggesting that the top  leaders of the two sides take turns in visiting Seoul and  Pyongyang and that the first talks be held in Seoul over two  nights and three days, preferably in mid-July, if North Korea  agrees.    However, if North Korea persists on having talks in  Pyongyang  first, the government will accept this on the condition that the  first talks be held in Pyongyang in July and the second are held  in Seoul in August.    In the event that the two sides fail to reach an agreement  to  designate Seoul and Pyongyang as the venue for the talks, the  government will propose Panmunjom as the first alternate place,  and Seoul or Pyongyang as the venue for the second talks.    The government will submit to President Kim Yong-sam for  approval on 27 June a draft of "the agreement for holding a  North-South summit between the North and the South," which will  be presented to the North Korean side during a preliminary  contact for a North-South summit slated for 28 June.    This draft agreement includes various conditions and forms  to  be proposed by the South side pertaining to the summit,  including the time and place of the talks, itineraries,  entourages, and the number of accompanying reporters.    Earlier on Sunday 26 June, the government made a final  review  of the preparatory works for the preliminary contact by  conducting a mock conference in the office of the North-South  talks in Samchongdong, Seoul, attended by our side's delegates  to the preliminary contact, including Yi Hong-ku, vice prime  minister and unification minister; Chong Chong-uk, senior  presidential secretary for diplomatic and security affairs; and  Yun Yo-chun, special assistant to the prime minister.</p>

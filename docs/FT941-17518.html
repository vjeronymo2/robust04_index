			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / People: The rise of Alfredo Saenz - Last week saw the latest chapter in the saga of Spanish banking Mario Conde, sacked last week as president of Banesto, Spain's fourth largest bank, used to dominate the vast dark green office he had at the bank's headquarters in Madrid's old financial quarter. Its current occupant does not. The tall green tapestried folding screens, the white marble busts over the fireplace and the soft light filtering through the louvred windows somehow do not suit Alfredo Saenz Abad. Where Conde was immaculate, forceful and handsome, Saenz seems quietly dressed, harmless and plain. Smaller too. On the face of it, Conde's removal and the nomination of Saenz by the Bank of Spain to put in place a rescue package for Banesto has replaced the extraordinary with the merely normal. But occupancy of that overdecorated office is a great personal triumph for an opera buff who is well connected in banking and politics. Alfredo Saenz's rise to the top of Spanish banking has taken him from a top Jesuit university through lecturing to a string of senior jobs in the 1980s at Banco Vizcaya - then one of the most aggressive banks in the country. Alfredo Saenz has every intention of staying at Banesto now that he is finally in charge of one of Spain's 'Big Five' banks. Sometime this year the bank's shareholders should elect a new board and despite a possible challenge from Conde, the backing of the Bank of Spain would make Saenz a near certainty for president. He has been made to wait long enough. Four years ago he came within an inch of securing the co-presidency of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) the biggest privately owned bank in the country. It was the intervention of the Bank of Spain that was to blame for his failure. The Banesto post may be a reward for taking that loss like a gentleman. The race for the BBV leadership was a spiteful affair and Saenz was one of the few people to come out of it well. It started when one of the big Basque banks, Bilbao, made a bid to buy Banesto at the end of 1987. It was partly foiled by an injection of capital into Banesto by Mario Conde, then 39. Saenz' career as a banker took off under the patronage of Pedro Toledo, a clever banker with very close ties to the socialist government, who for many years ran Banco de Vizcaya, the highly regarded Basque bank. Saenz' rise is in many ways a posthumous tribute to Vizcaya and to Toledo who died just over four years ago. Toledo had a talent for hiring bright, ambitious people. Carlos Solchaga, the former finance minister, worked for him. So did Francisco Luzon, now chairman of Argentaria, the big federation of government-owned banks. Another was Saenz, an alumni, like Conde, of the prestigious Jesuit university of Deusto in Bilbao. He had taught management there (a former student is now minister of the interior), turned down the job of deputy defence minister and worked in industry in the Basque country, from where Toledo hired him in 1980. Spanish banking was in deep crisis at the time. The Bank of Spain was pressing larger banks to take over about 50 troubled smaller ones to prevent them collapsing. The biggest concern was in Barcelona, where Banca Catalana, one of the emblems of Catalan banking, had come close to failure before the Central Bank fired its management just as they did Banesto's last week. Catalana had overestimated its assets by some Pta800bn (Pounds 3,791m) and there were attempts to bring charges against the board, including Jordi Pujol, now leader of the Catalan regional government. They got nowhere. But after a brief stewardship by a pool of banks at Catalana, Vizcaya took it over and Toledo packed off Saenz to put it back together. At the time, Toledo was assumed to have acted very recklessly in buying Catalana. Yet Saenz' sojourn in Barcelona had a happy ending. By borrowing from the Bank of Spain and other Spanish banks, he converted Catalana into one of Spain's most profitable banks and remains its president today. Unusually for a Basque, he is revered in Barcelona. He made his first speech to Catalana shareholders in Catalan, which he had learnt in just nine months. After Bilbao's bid for Banesto failed, it sought and won a merger with Vizcaya. Toledo and Bilbao's ageing president, Jose Angel Sanchez Asain, became co-presidents of the merged bank in 1988. The clear implication was that Toledo, the younger of the two, would rule on his own when Sanchez Asain retired. It was not to be. Toledo died suddenly in late 1989 of liver failure. Former Vizcaya people on the new BBV board quickly nominated Saenz as his successor as co-president, which the Bilbao side rejected. In the clash of cultures that followed, former Vizcayans would accuse their new colleagues of being pen-pushers and counters of paper clips. The other side claimed Toledo had bred a team of flashy Rambo-bankers, unfit to run a bank as big as BBV. In early 1990 the then governor of the Bank of Spain, Mariano Rubio, was asked to arbitrate and name a single president. Sanchez Asain stepped aside but it was another Bilbao man, Emilio Ybarra, whom Rubio selected. He named Saenz as first vice president; he has run the BBV's retail side since. Since then there has been a steady leakage of Toledo's bright young men from BBV, where former Bilbao managers now hold sway. Many have gone off to Argentaria with Luzon. For those that remained behind, biding their time along with Saenz, Banesto and its 2,600 retail branches is their glittering reward. Within hours of Conde leaving Banesto, a stream of senior BBV managers began to take control of its operations. With few exceptions, they were former Vizcaya people; more are likely to follow. They long to recreate the upbeat, snappy atmosphere which marked Toledo's reign at BBV. Mario Conde is unlikely to maintain silence on his ousting for very long. He owns 4 per cent of Banesto and he may challenge the decision to remove him. But it will be difficult. The Bank of Spain's blessing is essential to the survival of any bank president. Conde cannot win back that approval; Saenz has bucketfuls of it. Saenz is well qualified to revive the ailing bank. Banesto headquarters staff warmed to him; he was quick to remember names and let it be known he was not there as the vanguard of a BBV takeover. He wants Banesto independent and for himself and his people. Fortunately, his friends run the country. They will help him.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Born: November 1942 in Las Arenas, Basque Country Academic qualifications: degree in Law from University of Valladolid and in Economic Science from Deusto University, Bilbao  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Career: 1965 to 1980: board member of Tubacex, Basque steel pipe producer 1981: director of planning, Banco de Vizcaya 1983: managing director, Banca Catalana 1988: managing director; 1990: first vice president, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya 1993: president, Banco Espanol de Credito  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

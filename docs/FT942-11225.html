			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: EuroDollar set for Pounds 100m summer float EuroDollar, the UK's second-largest short-term car rental company, plans to come to the market this summer through a placing and public offer which is expected to value it at more than Pounds 100m. EuroDollar has about 10 per cent of the UK market, compared with Avis's estimated share of 14 per cent. About 77 per cent of EuroDollar's revenue comes from corporate customers. Its UK fleet of more than 12,000 vehicles operates from 104 branches. EuroDollar has a master franchise agreement with Dollar, the US car rental company, which grants EuroDollar a perpetual licence to operate an international rental network in 33 countries. Last August EuroDollar was the subject of a Pounds 118m management buy-out from TSB Group, which was backed by Prudential Venture Managers. The company was established as Swan National in 1973 by UDT, the credit financing business which was bought by TSB in 1981. Swan National was relaunched in 1989 as EuroDollar, to reflect its growing international strategy. It is now the fifth largest vehicle rental company in the world. Mr Freddie Aldous, EuroDollar's chairman, set up the original business in 1973 and led last year's 11-strong MBO team. He said: 'We believe that now is the right time to obtain a listing to establish a sound financial footing for the long-term development of the group.' The issue will be sponsored by Schroders, with Warburg Securities acting as broker.</p>

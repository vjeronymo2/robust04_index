			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Haiti's de  facto government has affirmed its determination to confront a  military invasion at a time when a U.S. senator visiting the  island has indicated that the Haitian Army could not possibly  repel an invasion. [passage omitted]    U.S. Senator Robert Graham, at the end of a brief visit to  the Caribbean nation, said, "The Haitian Army could not repel an  international intervention." [passage omitted]    Haitian Senator Bernard Sansaricq, a supporter of the de  facto government, said Graham "is attempting to provoke a civil  war. Can you imagine? He even went to Cite Soleil (stronghold  of Aristide supporters) to meet with members of popular  organizations."    Sansaricq, leader of the parliamentary faction that supports  the military, also said Graham "wants to polarize the situation.  He should never have come here." [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, a source close to the government confirmed the  Army could be having serious internal problems. He made his  statements after confirming that two soldiers were killed in  their garrisons on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince during  incidents that still have not been officially disclosed.

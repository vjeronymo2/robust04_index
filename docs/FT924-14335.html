			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): No end to the nickel nightmare THE FAILURE of the nickel market to respond to production cuts by the western world's biggest producer underlines the continuing gloom in the base metals market, which once again suffered price falls across the board. However, analysts have not been surprised by the nickel market's lack of reaction to news from Toronto that Inco is cutting production by 18,000 tonnes over the next 12 months, equal to about 3 per cent of Western consumption. 'It was too little, too late,' commented one yesterday. The cuts at Inco were needed because of a fall in stainless steel production, which accounts for more than half of nickel consumption, and sharp increases in exports from Russia, which is now shipping about 100,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to 15 per cent of total supplies. A seminar in Sudbury, Ontario, heard on Wednesday that output from Russia's Norilsk complex would remain flat in the near future if productivity could be maintained. Geologists said that reserves are estimated at 70 years, and that there are several new mines in development in Norilsk with good enough grades to offset depletion of some of the area's high-grade deposits. Canadian analysts said the Russian news suggested a price recovery was some way away. There is no doubt that Inco feels it should not have to suffer alone, and the company has made it quite clear that it intends to maintain its market share of 25 to 30 per cent. But on Thursday Falconbridge, the next biggest western producer, said that, while a production cut was 'likely', no decision would be made for at least a few weeks. At the same time French producer SLN (Societe Metallurgique le Nickel) and Finland's Outukumpu said they had no plans to curb production. SLN already expects output to fall to some 39,000 tonnes this year, compared with 43,500 tonnes in 1991. Outokumpu pointed out that its annual production of 13,800 tonnes is less than Inco's planned cut. Yesterday a further inflow of Russian metal took nickel stocks in LME warehouses up 2,886 tonnes, taking the total to a record 49,410 tonnes. Cash metal closed at Dollars 6,615 a tonne, down Dollars 90 on the week and equivalent to Dollars 3 a lb. Other base metals have been 'whiplashed by a torrent of poor economic data' from the US, Japan and the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, according to Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett. The OECD, which was predicting gross domestic product growth of 2.2 per cent in member countries this year, said it would now not exceed 1.5 per cent. 'The onus is back squarely on metal producers,' said Mr Moore. 'The choice is simple - cut back refined metal output or spend another year in purgatory.' The LME's first totally new contract for 13 years was launched on Tuesday for secondary aluminium alloy. It has got off to a slow start - but the exchange was not expecting anything else. 'It will take time to bed down,' said Mr John Wolff, LME chairman. 'But it is a very large market and growing.' Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, chairman of the exchange's aluminium committee, pointed out that in unofficial trading over the past two months alloy had been traded at a Dollars 10 a tonne discount to the primary aluminium contract, and also at a Dollars 65 discount. This showed that the primary contract was not a satisfactory proxy for alloy and that the new contract was necessary. Cash trading will start on January 4. The three-month price closed at Dollars 1,158 yesterday, down Dollars 17 on Tuesday's close. Cash aluminium closed at Dollars 1,186, down Dollars 26.50 on the week. In the bullion markets gold has maintained its level at the top of its recent trading range, but platinum has fallen back, losing Dollars 8.75 a troy ounce this week to Dollars 356 yesterday. Most of the fall came on Wednesday as sales by a US investment bank focused dealers' attention on the deteriorating economic situation and the weak base metals market. On Thursday sentiment was further clouded by reports of the Japanese market awash with platinum and investors selling nearby positions on the Tokyo Commodities Exchange. The silver market was sceptical about a study for the Washington-based Silver Institute which suggested that conventional world silver stocks are 2.6bn troy ounces, but that 1.5bn ounces were unavailable to the market. Silver closed in London at 379.50 cents a troy ounce, up 4 cents on the week.  ----------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  ----------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium    -950 to 1,371,575 Copper       +350 to   300,125 Lead       +1,850 to   176,350 Nickel     +2,886 to    49,410 Zinc       +4,375 to   372,750 Tin           -90 to    14,905  -----------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> STATES SPEND MORE ON AIDS EDUCATION  </P> <P> AIDS education and state dollars to pay for it are on the rise, with all but  nine states now requiring or recommending what should be taught about the  disease and when, according to a new survey. The survey of education  departments found that 41 states have a curriculum or curriculum guide for use  in teaching students about AIDS -- 13 more than last year. The number of states  appropriating their own money for AIDS instruction has more than tripled, from  8 to 27, since last year. The findings are based on a December, 1988, survey of  AIDS education coordinators in all 50 states, the District of Columbia,  American Samoa, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands by the Council of Chief State  School Officers.  </P></p>

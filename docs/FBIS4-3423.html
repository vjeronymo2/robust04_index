			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Zhihong 7115 1807 1347] </F>   [Text] Zhejiang's private economy has developed rapidly.  When it comes to paying taxes, Zhejiang's individual and  private businesses ranked first in the nation by delivering 2.23  billion yuan in taxes to the state in 1993, up 39.5 percent from  the previous year. Private economy has become Zhejiang's  important economic growth sector. Not only Zhejiang saw a rapid  increase in the number of individual and private businessmen  last year, it also witnessed the constant improvement of the  quality of those who are involved in the private economic  sector. In 1993, there were 1,238,000 registered individual  businessmen employing 1,972,000 people, representing an increase  of 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, over the previous  year and making 1993 the year of fastest growth in term of the  number of individual businessmen and the number of people they  employed since the beginning of the 1990's. The number of  private enterprises rose to 19,400 and the number of people they  employed to 255,000, marking an increase of 68 percent and 67  percent, respectively, over the previous year. And the trend in  the composition of those engaged in the individual and private  economy tended to become younger, more educated, and more  professional. Many of the individual businessmen were former  street vendors. They then turned to retail business, to running  companies and factories, to large-scale production, and to  production of upscale products. By the end of last year,  individual businessmen's registered capital in the province  stood at 8.67 bilion yuan. There are 641 private enterprises  with a registered capital over 1 million yuan, 566 of them  registered last year. The number of enterprises with an annual  output value of over 1 million yuan and over 10 million yuan was  877 and 77, respectively. The annual output value of an  enterprise in Tiantai and another one in Linhai topped 100  million yuan.    Now the business scope of individual and private economy has  expanded to all sectors that are permitted under the state  policy. Transcendng regions, trades, and ownership system, many  individual and private enterprises are adopting diverse  management, combined management, and intensive management  through share acquisition, merger, contracting, and leasing.    At present, the province has five enterprise groups whose  members are mainly from private enterprises. In 1993, 639  individual and private enterprises exported 500 million yuan  worth of goods, up two-fold over the previous year. Private  enterprises attracted $110 million in foreign funds and formed  170 joint-venture enterprises with foreign businessmen. Nine  private enterprises in the province also set up plants in other  provinces.</p>

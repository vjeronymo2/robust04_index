			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by George Jones: "Tory Battle To Succeed Fowler as </F> Party Chief"]    [Text] Power struggle for the key post of Conservative  Party chairman was triggered at Westminster last night by the  decision of Sir Norman Fowler to step down before next month's  Cabinet reshuffle.    Although his resignation came as no surprise, the timing  threatens further turmoil within an already demoralised Tory  Party.    Last night Right-wing Conservative MPs were mobilising to  try  to block the appointment of Mr David Hunt, the Employment  Secretary, who is on the Left and a committed pro-European.    A head of steam was also building up behind backbench calls  for Mr Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade,  to take on the high-profile role.    Mr Heseltine has made it clear to friends he does not want  the chairman's job. But more and more MPs are telling Tory  whips that they believe he alone has the flair and dynamism to  pull the party back from its worst ever defeat in last week's  European elections.    According To Government insiders, Mr Major has not yet made  up his mind on a successor, and there are at least four or five  candidates.    Other front-runners include Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish  Secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Agriculture Minister; Mrs  Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary; Mr Jonathan Aitken,  currently outside the Cabinet as Minister for Defence  Procurement; and Mr Tony Newton, the Leader of the Commons.    Sir Norman will carry on as chairman until a successor is  appointed in a reshuffle expected in mid to late July. Although  he was not a member of the Cabinet, it is traditional for the  party chairman in the second half of a Parliament to be a senior  minister.    It had been known for some time that Sir Norman wanted to  quit Conservative Central Office to concentrate on his business  career, but the timing of the announcement caused surprise at  Westminster.    It was seen as a deliberate attempt to distance his  resignation from the reshuffle, and show that he is stepping  down of his own free will rather than being dropped.    However, his departure will put pressure on Mr Major to  speed  up the Government changes. Earlier this week he ruled out a  reshuffle in the immediate aftermath of the Euro-elections, but  confirmed he would carry out a mid-term reconstruction by the  end of July.    Sir Norman's announcement is bound to increase speculation  at  Westminster about the scale of the Cabinet changes.    Already there are signs that talk of a reshuffle is having a  destabilising effect on Whitehall, with some key Government  announcements including a policy paper on Civil Service reform,  delayed until the future shape of the Government is clear.    The vacuum at the top of the party could also increase the  infighting between the Tory Euro-sceptics and pro-Europeans. In  the wake of the more sceptical line adopted by Mr Major during  the Euro- elections, with the call for a "multi-speed" EC, his  choice of chairman will be seen as an indication of the  direction of the party in the run-up to the next election.    In a letter to Mr Major last night, Sir Norman promised he  would give the "sturdiest possible support" from the  backbenches. It was a strong signal that he would use his  influence to prevent any challenge to Mr Major this autumn.    Sir Norman singled out party unity as one of the main  problems he had faced as chairman. Although the Tories lost 14  Euro-MPs and saw their share of the vote fall to the lowest  level this century, he said the European elections had shown  they could fight a ``united and successful campaign, confounding  predictions.    ``In the next two or three years the Conservative Party must  behave as it did in the last three weeks, not as it did in the  18 months before that,'' said Sir Norman.    Mr Major praised Sir Norman's efforts in streamlining the  party organisation and putting it back on a sound financial  footing.</p>

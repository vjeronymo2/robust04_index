			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / State of the Art: Raiders of the cultural past - Cinema: hopelessly infatuated with its own image / Why post-modernism has become crit-speak for narcisism THE WORLD of art-critical jargon today resembles one of those surreal lumber rooms in a Giorgio Di Chirico painting. Across the floor weird constructs like 'deconstruction' gaze at sinister compounds like 'post-modernism.' In a corner, obscure once-meaningful diagrams gather dust. On a chair sits a tailor's dummy, bereft of the tailor's creations that once gave it life and purpose. But occasionally in a Di Chirico painting something real or organic peeps through - a flower, a human hand - to bestow a telling irony: to remind us that there are still traces of life as we know it. Just so, the prolix usually co-exists with the real and simple - however much it tries to camouflage them. Post-modernism in the cinema has now become camouflaging crit-speak for a very simple concept: narcissism. Back in the 1970s and '80s movies such as David Lynch's Blue Velvet or Brian De Palma's Dressed To Kill in America, or Fassbinder's films in Europe, might have been justly graced with terms from the post-modern lexicon like 'ludic', 'eclectic,' 'self-reflexive.' They gazed in the mirror of popular culture past and present - not just cinema but novels, pop art, TV - and subtly, sardonically plucked meaning from reflection and allusion. But the habit has now spread from semi-fringe film-makers to mega-budget directors such as Tim Burton (Batman, Batman Returns) and Francis Coppola (the new Dracula). The art of subtle invocation has turned into the art of show-off quotesmanship. The Batman movies, especially, are megaliths of compressed cultural bricolage: plundering their invocations from old movie styles (James Whale), Gothic Edwardiana (Edward Gorey), Saturday matinee serials and the revamped Batman comics themselves. Originality begins to die a slow death on the altar of hommage: which is, as we know, a French word for plagiarism. Today the cultural pay-off is becoming clear. Too often the consequence of gazing too long in the mirror is a hopeless infatuation with one's own image. This year we have had movies recycling bygone film noir styles: from Light Sleeper to Alien 3, with The Public Eye and Night And The City due in the new year. We have had films about film-making (Barton Fink, Bugsy, The Player, Chaplin). We have had European films holding tribunal on the century's audio-visual culture, from old movie styles to recent movie/video developments (Europa, Until The End Of The World). And for British filmmakers like Terence Davies (The Long Day Closes), Derek Jarman (Edward II) and Peter Greenaway (Prospero's Books), no film is complete without a built-in concordance of references to cinema and/or its companion arts. Not all these works are bad. Indeed some are good. But the trend's spreading dominion disturbs. We could dismiss it as fin de siecle stock-taking: a century's natural instinct as it closes down to count the bills and mark the ledgers. (For changing millennia, multiply this by ten). But first: who wants another eight years of aesthetic auto-erotism at the movies? And second: how do we know that the cinema, once hung up on its own image, will get un-hung as soon as we reach 2000? There are two main kinds of narcissism practised today: active and passive. The active is marginally less perilous because at least it knows what it is up to. Taking past movie styles, it either processes them into multi-referential camp - Lynch's Wild At Heart (cruder than Blue Velvet but at least self-aware), Baz Luhrmann's Strictly Ballroom, Tom DiCillo's Johnny Suede - or uses them as overt commentary on a modern story (The Long Day Closes). Then there is passive narcissism. Thriving in the commercial sector, this is the short-memory self-love that produces, almost without thought, lazier and lazier theme-and-variations packages. The motto of these films is: Close down mental enterprise and lull the senses with familiar signals. From the makers of Lethal Weapon and Batman here come LW3 and B2. From the makers of Aliens 1 and 2, here is Old Scaly Claws in space again. From the makers of Home Alone, here is another date with the kid who keeps losing his parents. The audience approves of this studio laziness because it too likes a lazy time. You do not have to dress up so much on a second date, and all the introductory small talk was got over on the first one. But then with narcissistic romances you do not really have to dress up at all. Modern cinema is in danger of becoming a hall of mirrors in which filmgoers and filmmakers alike can gaze into an endless vista of self-gratifying, self-imaging sameness. An art for which the mirror, in great cinematic hands, was once an eerie leitmotif that deceived, distorted or seduced - in Welles, in Losey, in Lang, in Cocteau's Orphee - now shows signs of falling headlong into its reflective, oblivion-inducing depths.</p>

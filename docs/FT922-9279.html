			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Lego profits gain 15.6% to DKr517m LEGO, the Danish toy construction kit group, increased group sales in 1991 by 14 per cent to DKr4.47bn (Dollars 703m) and pre-tax profits by 15.6 per cent to DKr517m. The family-owned group expressed disappointment at the result saying that sales rose rather less than expected. Sales to retailers rose faster than sales by retailers to customers, resulting in some build-up of retailers' stocks. The published figures cover only 14 of the 36 companies and 4,100 of the 7,550 employees in the worldwide Lego organisation, which has four parent companies, two in Denmark and two in Switzerland. Group equity capital increased to DKr1.95bn from DKr1.62bn and assets to DKr3.58bn from DKr3.21bn.</p>

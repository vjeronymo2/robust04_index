			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profits taken as turnover recedes SOME OF the bounce went out of the UK stock market yesterday as it approached the end of a successful equity market account without any sign of the interest rate cuts which have been predicted in some quarters. Share trading volume was reduced and share prices were led downwards for much of the session by weakness in stock index futures. UK equities opened lower and extended their losses in early trading, without waiting for confirmation from the Bundesbank policy meeting that no action was being taken on German interest rates. With the June contract on the FT-SE Index at a discount at one time, there was little support for the blue chips, although ICI continued to benefit from switching out of Zeneca as investors backed away from pharmaceutical stocks. The Footsie was 18 points off at just under 2,845 by mid-morning, but then rallied in moderate trading as some rate cut optimism returned. The early loss was cut by about one half before a poor start on Wall Street, which shed 18 Dow points in early trade, put London into reverse again. The final reading of 2,852.8 on the FT-SE Index showed a loss on the day of 10.2 points. The two week account has brought a recovery in the equity market which had touched the lower end of its perceived trading range, and dealers said that some profits were being taken yesterday ahead of the close of the account tonight. Property shares, which bounced ahead on Wednesday in response to the joint Pounds 284m joint venture between Mr George Soros and British Land, gave back some ground yesterday. Banks followed a similar path. BT's move to take a Dollars 4.3bn stake in MCI, the US telecommunications group, prompted excitement in the telecoms sector as industry experts looked for the next move in the global communications struggle. The Footsie remained last night around the middle of its trading range, but traders began to show renewed concern over valuation of the equity market and its rating against government bonds. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index which has been outperforming the Footsie and closed at a new peak on Wednesday, slipped back by 7.8 to 3,183.6 yesterday. However, trading in the non-Footsie stocks which make up a significant part of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, provided only about 56 per cent of yesterday's Seaq volume total of 568.2m. On Wednesday, 601.9m shares traded through the Seaq network for a retail or customer valuation of Pounds 1.19bn. Market strategists hope that institutional liquidity will soon begin to improve as the ICI/Zeneca demerger is absorbed and the BT3 sale gets under way. Lack of liquidity has been a restaining factor in an equity market still overshadowed by government financing plans in the government bond sector. While the change of UK chancellors of the exchequer has raised hopes that the new man, Mr Kenneth Clarke, might be inclined to take the political benefits of cutting domestic interest rates, some dealers were pointing yesterday to the relatively soft performance of sterling in recent sessions. But, on the other side of the debate, there are widespread expectations in London that other continental European countries may cut rates in the near future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alexey Ryshenko, acting commander of the </F> Ukrainian fleet, by an unidentified correspondent; place and  date not given: "We Will Torpedo Them"]    [Text] [DIE WOCHE] Have you already considered the  withdrawal of Ukrainian warships from the Crimea?    [Ryshenko] That would suit the Russians very well. The  Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Our countrymen live there. We will  defend them with weapons, if necessary.    [DIE WOCHE] Ukrainian and Russian warships are berthed in  the same harbor at Sevastopol. Is a conflict not inevitable  there?    [Ryshenko] The Russians want to force us out of Sevastopol.  We are prepared for any provocation, for they know that as long  as our fleet and soldiers are stationed in the Crimea, we will  not permit an annexation to Russia.    [DIE WOCHE] The division of the Black Sea Fleet has been a  subject of negotiations for two years. Does this fleet still  have any strategic significance?    [Ryshenko] The fleet is outdated, its fighting power exists  only on paper.    [DIE WOCHE] Then why does Ukraine not want to give up its  share of the fleet?    [Ryshenko] Ukraine would do so immediately provided that the  Black Sea Fleet left the Crimea. But the Russians will not hear  of it.    [DIE WOCHE] Will the Fleet support the Crimean separatists  in an emergency?    [Ryshenko] The commanders are doing what they want. They do  not even obey Moscow. But I hope things will not get that far.  And even if they do, we have enough strength in the Crimea to  control any such mutiny.    [DIE WOCHE] The Russian commanders are warning against  provocation. A clinic is supposed to have been stormed by  Ukrainian special units.    [Ryshenko] Those are all lies. Why should we do anything  like that? Everything in the Crimea belongs to Ukraine. It is  the Black Sea Fleet that is stealing Ukrainian property.    [DIE WOCHE] What do you mean?    [Ryshenko] Many officers are engaged in business deals.  Lubricants, spare parts, and maritime electronic equipment are  being stolen from the bases. Vessels of the Black Sea Fleet are  just like freighters that are transporting goods. They ignore  Ukrainian customs and tax laws.    [DIE WOCHE] Is there any proof of that?    [Ryshenko] In April, the ship Tshelekyen left Odessa harbor  without permission. It had smuggled goods on board. Should  anyone ever try that again, we will torpedo the ship.    [DIE WOCHE] Is Kiev not heating up the situation in the  Crimea unnecessarily?    [Ryshenko] There is no Republic of Crimea. The Crimea is a  part of Ukraine. It was a great mistake to give the Crimea  special status in 1992. Now the tension is increasing every  day. The Black Sea fleet and the so-called Crimean president  are to blame for that.</p>

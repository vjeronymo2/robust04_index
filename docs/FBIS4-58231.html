			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, April 29 (AFP) -- The Arabs have nothing  to fear from Israel in a common market for the Middle East, a  Gulf study said Friday, as the PLO and Jewish state signed a  landmark economic accord.    But the study by the al-Shariqah chamber of commerce and  industry in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said the Arab  League's 22 members must first integrate their economies before  joining Israel and other countries in a single market.    Although Israel has built a relatively large export-oriented  industrial base, its exports are equivalent to less than 10  percent of total Arab imports, said the study, published in the  UAE daily Al-Khalij.    Israel's exports of consumer goods stood at between 11 and  12  billion dollars in 1992 while Arab imports of such products  exceeded 40 billion dollars and their total imports have  remained above 100 billion dollars.    Israel's exports of transport equipment stood at 900 million  dollars in 1990 and those of electrical appliances at 1.6  billion dollars while Arab imports of such products stood at  around 42.6 billion dollars, the study said.    "Trade is a key component of Israel's Gross Domestic  Product,  accounting for nearly 46 percent in 1991," it said. "But the  figures on Israeli exports show that they will have little  impact on the imports of Arab countries."    In Paris, Israel and the PLO signed a landmark economic  agreement on Friday, as part of an overall accord to launch  Palestinian self- rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of  Jericho.    Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, who signed for Israel,  urged  Arab countries to "remove the walls of economic boycott" and  lift the embargo in force since the Jewish state was created in  1948.    "None of us can afford economic boycotts," he warned,  referring to stiff competition from other regions.    The al-Shariqah chamber of commerce study saw benefits for  both Arabs and Israel from a common market although the latter  would reap more gains given its superior industries.    A free trade zone in the region would give Israel access to  new markets and enable it to ensure its needs in oil and other  raw materials, according to the study.    In return, Arab states would find a new market for their oil  and gas, but their exports of other goods would not rise greatly  as the Israeli market is small.    The United States and other countries have proposed a  regional common market encompassing Israel, the Arabs, Turkey  and Iran, saying this would bring about prosperity and boost  confidence in peace.    But several Arab officials and businessmen have warned such  a  project would allow Israel to dominate Arab economies.    Gulf Arab states are playing a key role in the multilateral  track of the Middle East peace process. Oman hosted talks on  water resources last week and Qatar will be the venue for a  working session on arms control next week.    In an interview with AFP in Oman, Israeli Deputy Foreign  Minister Yosi Beilin said a common market would benefit all  parties but stressed the project needed long discussion.    "We believe that the realistic option for Arab states to  brace for the Middle East market is to set up a free trade  zone," the UAE study said.    "Another point is that Israel has a governmental,  institutional, legal and administrative structure that is far  superior to that in all Arab countries," it added.    "This should prompt our governments to consolidate democracy  in their political and economic systems and revise their  policies on education, training, planning and exploitation of  resources."    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, in an interview  published Friday in the Qatari newspaper Al-Sharq, criticized  Arab states, saying they were "not up to the European standards  of democracy."</p>

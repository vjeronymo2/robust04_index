			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc survives important test THE FRENCH franc and Danish krone were victims of a short burst of speculative selling yesterday morning following the 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish punt against all the currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. In recent months, the devaluation of ERM currencies has been followed by strong selling of the next weakest in the system, and this pattern was repeated yesterday. The French franc fell sharply in the first hours of trading, to a low of FFr3.3950 against the D-Mark, while the Danish krone was seen as low as DKr3.8750 to the D-Mark, near to its floor of DKr3.9016. Three-month French francs were quoted as high as 15 per cent at the peak of the pressure. However, the selling of both currencies eased off later in the morning, even though their respective money market interest rates remained high. The French franc closed at FFr3.380 per D-Mark, while the krone finished at DKr3.8501. The tensions were partly relieved by the market's acceptance of the size of the punt devaluation. The Irish currency climbed to the top of its new ERM bands. The French franc and Danish krone even spent part of the day on their ERM floors against the Irish currency. The punt's strength allowed a remarkable cut in Ireland's overnight rate of lending from 100 per cent to 14 per cent. Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London, said the franc's swift recovery from selling pressures was highly significant. 'People were prepared to take big speculative positions against the franc in September, but they are not prepared to any more,' he added. 'If the crisis does not come on the big day, it will not come at all.' Mr Mark Austin, Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the franc and krone are not safe yet. 'There is still the fundamental problem of real interest rates that are too high and show no signs of coming down,' he said. Sterling recovered sharply against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday after plunging to a historic low of DM2.3550 in Monday's Far East dealing. The recovery, to a close of DM2.3800, gave the impression that the sell-off had been the result of speculative trading by banks rather than the off-loading of long-term positions. In Tokyo, the pound bottomed out at Dollars 1.4500 against the dollar, a level not seen since 1986. It finished European trading at Dollars 1.4535 and later ended in New York at Dollars 1.4590. Mr Brett, of BZW, said the most worrying problem for the pound is that one-year sterling interest rates are now an unprecedented 200 basis points or so below the D-Mark's. This puts the current one-year forward rate for buying D-Marks at around DM2.4150 to the pound. In Mr Brett's view, this is an attractive rate for D-Mark purchasers and will keep the pound weak well into the future.</p>

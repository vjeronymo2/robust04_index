In Prague, the Thai official  discussed trade relations with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus,  Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, and other representatives.    "In the course of the talks, I have introduced some other  commodities, like consumer goods, fruit, and several farm  products. I also spoke about projects that might be of interest  to Czech businessmen, that we invest in the development of the  infrastructure--the railroads or road construction, for  instance. We need chemicals. It would be expedient to found  joint Czech-Thai ventures for the production and distribution of  numerous items. I am thinking particularly of glass  manufacturing, but also engineering and car-manufacturing  projects."    In the interview, the Thai deputy prime minister emphasized  that he considers the conditions in the Czech Republic suitable  for opening branch offices of Thai commercial banks that would  not only support the financing of mutual trade, but also trade  with third countries. "I used my sojourn for informative talks  with the Komercni Banka. We also want to trade with the other  countries of Central and East Europe, including CIS. We know  that the Czech Republic has substantial experience on these  markets, including banking experience. Thus, it could play the  role of a mediator for Thailand. And, vice versa, Thailand has  good contacts with the developing economies of Vietnam--for  instance, Cambodia, Laos, and China. So, it could become a good  basis for your activities on these markets. I also can imagine  a free trade zone."    Before his departure for Warsaw, Suphachai Phanitchaphak was  also supposed to meet President Havel, who, however, fell ill  with influenza.</p>

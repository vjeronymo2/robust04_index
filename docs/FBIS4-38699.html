			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Margarita Ziangirova: "U.S. Consul </F> `Discovers Russia'"]    [Text] Omsk -- Representatives of U.S. big business know  practically nothing about Russia. That view was expressed by  Jack Segal, the consul general from the United States, on his  arrival in Omsk.    A U.S. consulate opened nearly two months ago in  Yekaterinburg -- the only one in central Russia thus far -- with  Segal as its head. The U.S. diplomat was the first of his  colleagues to come to the city on the Irtysh, visiting several  industrial enterprises and the pedagogical and medical higher  educational establishments as well as Omsk Oblast's  Bolsherechenskiy Rayon. Jack Segal had a meeting with Omsk  Oblast Governor Leonid Polezhayev. The consul promised to  inform the U.S. Embassy and American business circles of the  potential of the region's industry and to help establish  business contacts. In Jack Segal's opinion, only a stable  political and economic situation in Russia can promote the  emergence and strengthening of such contacts in the first  instance. This may also explain the fact that many foreign  firms, having signed a considerable number of protocols with  major industrial enterprises in Omsk, are in no hurry to  complete the matter; which, indeed, causes some skepticism among  the people of Omsk.</p>

Earnings by industrial companies for 1993-94 will sharply outperform those by resource companies, the Barclays Australia Investment Services (Barcep) consensus earnings forecast said. Industrial earnings are expected to rise 21 per cent, while resource earnings are seen down 12 per cent, according to the survey, compiled of projections from 28 brokers.

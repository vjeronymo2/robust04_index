			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: BBA calls for Pounds 79m to cut acquisition debt BBA GROUP, the manufacturer serving the automotive, industrial and aviation markets, yesterday launched a Pounds 79.1m rights issue to reduce borrowings. News of the 1-for-4 issue of 72.2m shares at 112p came one week after a Pounds 119m cash call from T&amp;N, the automotive and industrial group. The gloomy setting for these rights issues was spelt out yesterday by Mr David Lees, chairman of GKN, the fellow engineering company, who warned that profits for the first half of 1991 would be well below the already depressed second half of last year. He said GKN has already cut 1,100 jobs in the first four months of this year. When it released its 1990 figures in March it said it planned to make at least 1,000 people redundant in the full year. BBA said that acquisitions to reduce its dependence on the motor sector were the main reason for increased borrowings. Mr Peter Clappison, finance director, said that by December net debt had risen to Pounds 196m, or 61 per cent of shareholders' funds. Applying the rights issue proceeds to those figures would reduce gearing to 29 per cent. The up-to-date figure after the issue is expected to be nearer 40 per cent, partly reflecting a seasonal build-up. Mr John White, managing director, said that in 1987 the group derived 80 per cent of its operating profit from motor components. Last year the figure had fallen to 36 per cent, although they still accounted for 51 per cent of the Pounds 1.23bn turnover. Since the beginning of 1989, all but one of BBA's 14 acquisitions were non-automotive, adding Pounds 106m to group debt. He said the group was raising funds retrospectively partly because of the unforeseen speed and depth of the motor industry recession. BBA has also continued with a strong capital spending programme. Last year's Pounds 69.8m was 1.6 times depreciation and a further Pounds 60m is planned for this year. As with other motor components makers, the installation of labour-saving machinery coupled with the downturn of demand has led to job cuts. Mr White said 1,800 jobs had gone since last summer, mostly in the UK and Australia, reducing the total workforce to just over 23,000. Group pre-tax profit is expected to fall to Pounds 60m-Pounds 65m this year, from Pounds 75.1m. A maintained dividend of 7.5p is promised, from forecast earnings per share of about 11p. BBA's share price shed 12p to close at 127p yesterday.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / London School of Economics and Political Science say student loans should be privatised The government's student loans scheme should be privatised, with repayments collected via National Insurance contributions, say a group of academics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. In a report they say that government spending per student has been reduced by more than a third between 1974 and 1990, and 'the result has been an erosion in quality'. Student loans are organised by the Student Loans Company, an education department quango, and repaid in fixed instalments. The academics say asking for repayments via an extra percentage point of income on National Insurance contributions would minimise the deterrent effect. Average repayment periods would be longer but low earners or part-time workers would repay more than under the current scheme, which exempts all those paid less than 85 per cent of average earnings from repayments.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The leaders of two  splinter parties called Wednesday for an end to  government-opposition political strife until the nuclear row  with North Korea is settled.    In a joint statement issued that day, Chairman Kim Tong-kil  of the United People's Party and Chairman Park Chan-chong of the  New Political Reform Party also urged social organizations to  halt internal strife and concentrate on easing the tension over  North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program.    They warned that Pyongyang's withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency would lead to "a dangerous  consequence of threatening to break the peace and security on  the Korean peninsula," urging the North to "suspend all military  intimidation and resume inter-Korean dialogue for a peaceful  solution of the nuclear problem."    The government should establish a national consensus on how  to overcome the crisis before the inter-Korean confrontation  over the nuclear issue leads to a tragic result, they said,  calling for an emergency national meeting on the current  situation and an inter-Korean summit.    They charged that the government's fickle and unprincipled  policy has pushed the nuclear issue to a critical phase and that  President Kim Yong-sam is partly responsible as he has wavered  from the basic principle of Seoul's North Korea policy.</p>

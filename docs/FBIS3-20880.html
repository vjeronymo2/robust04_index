			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.G.: "Together"] </F>   [Text] The establishment of voivodship and gmina [township]  patriot-Solidarity coalitions by groupings opposed to the "thick  black line" [i.e., to forgiveness for the communist  nomenklatura] and to the "roundtable accord" [between  communists and Solidarity, in 1989] was appealed for unanimously  by participants in the Second National Center-Right Conference  held in Krakow on 29 January.    That conference was attended by some 400 burgomasters,  mayors, aldermen, and representatives of self-government  dietines from more than 50 cities, along with politicians from  the Movement for the Republic [RdR], Union for Real Politics  (UPR), Christian-National Union [ZChN], Center Accord [PC], RTR  [Movement of the Third Republic], Polish Peasant Party-Peasant  Accord [PSL-PL], and National Party, along with Solidarity  activists. They supported the protests of NSZZ Solidarity  [Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity"] against  the crisis budget of the state and the impoverishment of Polish  families, and they encouraged their supporters to take part in  the demonstration announced by NSZZ Solidarity for 9 February.    Those present also protested the amending of the law on war  veterans by the Second-Session Sejm as conflicting with  principles of justice and Polish tradition of honoring the  sacrifices made in defense of national independence.    J. Olszewski warned, "Nowadays, we are facing an attempt to  turn back the clock of ownership. We must revert to the ideas of  Solidarity. The tasks facing us transcend the strength of any  one political party or even bloc. We must reach an accord on the  principles of the Poland of the future, of the Third Republic,  or otherwise we shall not topple the old order." A program for  economic measures was presented by A. Glapinski (PC) and for  gmina finance by H. Klata (ZChN).    "Not just the pilot program but the reform of public  administration is at stake," Lodz Mayor G. Palka (Solidarity,  ZChN) pointed out, while S. Pastuszewski (Christian-Democratic  Labor Party) voiced his satisfaction that the draft law on  communal savings and loan associations, prepared by deputies of  the previous Sejm, became championed by the PSL.    L. Pruchno-Wroblewski, deputy chairman of UPR, praised the  ideal model of the gmina as consonant with the principles of his  party. Malopolska local-government activists B. Bubula and K.  Barczyk (ZP-RdR) shared their experience in carrying out the  center-right's local-government program in Krakow and  Malopolska. Criticisms of the new administrative division of  Poland into "powiats" were substantiated by the chairman of the  Rakow Gmina Council, W. Switalski (Christian-Democrtic Labor  Party).    The coming elections to the gminas are the first chance to  halt the advance of the Left. In this connection, the  center-right and patriot and Solidarity groupings still have  much to accomplish, but there is less and less time left.</p>

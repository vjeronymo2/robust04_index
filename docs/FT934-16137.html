			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Georgian side ready for talks: UN mediator hopes to bring warring parties together THE GEORGIAN government has agreed to attend peace talks in Geneva which will try to find a political settlement to the bloody civil war between government forces and separatists from the western region of Abkhazia. Mr Edouard Brunner, the Swiss diplomat who is mediating the peace talks on behalf of the United Nations, said yesterday the Georgian side was ready to come to Geneva 'in the next few days'. He hoped subsequently to get both parties around the same table, along with Russia which, he said, had a 'legitimate interest' in the outcome. Leaders of the self-proclaimed Abkhazian government yesterday concluded two days of talks with Mr Brunner in Geneva. Mr Anri Djergeniya, its attorney general, told a news conference that his delegation was ready to 'have a dialogue' with the Georgian government. 'That's why we're here.' Mr Djergeniya made clear that the Abkhazian leadership was not insisting at the outset on full independence from Georgia. He said this would be for the people to decide, once emotions had cooled and some stability had returned to the war-ravaged region. Mr Brunner said later that, despite their military success, the Abkhazians were realistic enough to know that they might have to moderate their political demands. The Geneva peace talks were postponed twice last month because of the renewed fighting in Abkhazia which left the rebels in control of the disputed region. These hostilities have now ended. However, the Georgian government is facing another armed challenge from insurgent forces supporting the ousted president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Aid agencies say an estimated 200,000 refugees fled Abkhazia during last month's fighting, which shattered a Russian-brokered ceasefire agreed on July 27. The Georgian government has appealed for helicopters to evacuate up to 50,000 people trapped in the Caucasus mountains where many are already said to have died from cold and hunger. Mr Djergeniya said yesterday that all refugees, of whatever nationality, were welcome to return home. He blamed reported acts of violence by Abkhazian soldiers against ethnic Georgian civilians as the work of 'criminals'. Mr Brunner said he had been assured by the Abkhazian delegation that such acts would be sternly dealt with and that 2,000 criminal cases were already pending.</p>

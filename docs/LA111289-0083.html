			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TUSTIN ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Re the article on the Tustin City Council election (Nov. 2):  </P> <P> Tustin citizens have a golden opportunity to improve the council's quality and  effectiveness if final approval is given to moving municipal elections up to  April next year, instead of delaying until November.  </P> <P> Elections in April will allow voters to concentrate specifically on Tustin,  without being distracted by the many state propositions and national and state  candidates and issues.  </P> <P> Because April elections are less costly for candidates, they allow more people  to run, thus typically providing a larger field of office seekers from which to  choose, and making it less likely that only those with ties to special  interests will campaign.  </P> <P> Some of those opposed to April elections refer to additional costs to the  "taxpayer." But in reality, the expense of April elections is only about 25  cents per citizen, a minuscule amount compared to the millions of dollars that  have been at stake, and lost, to the city in recent months. Moreover, cost is  usually not the real reason for opposition.  </P> <P> Incumbents, for example, know they have a much better chance for reelection if  their record is obscured as voters are overwhelmed with the last-minute  scramble to go through national and state campaign materials in November.  Obviously, in an April election, voters have a greater chance of clearly  knowing the issues and candidates.  </P> <P> There is no doubt that Tustin will benefit by an early opportunity to have our  very own elections, again.  </P> <P> CARL KASALEK  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

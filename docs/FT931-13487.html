			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Clinton lifts restrictions on abortion PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday lifted a series of restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and Bush presidencies. Mr Clinton, in one of the first acts of his presidency, signed executive orders ending restrictions on: Abortion counselling at clinics which receive federal funding; Research using tissue from aborted foetuses; Abortions performed at military hospitals; Funding for United Nations population programmes. The newly installed president also ordered a review of the ban on RU-486, the abortion pill produced by France's Roussel Uclaf. The end of the ban on counselling at federally funded clinics by anyone other than doc tors, known by its critics as the 'gag rule', was viewed as the greatest symbolic victory for supporters of the right to choose an abortion, but may have less practical significance, since the ban's implementation was already suspended by court order. Overturning the Bush administration's prohibition of federal funding for foetal tissue research, though still controversial, was supported by some prominent anti-abortion Republicans. The moves came on the 20th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Roe vs Wade that the right to privacy, which is grounded in the 14th amendment to the US constitution, protects a woman's decision whether or not to bear a child. Congressional leaders, who are worried that today's more conservative Supreme Court might overturn the decision, plan legislation embodying Roe vs Wade's principles. These principles give entire freedom to a woman and her physician in the first trimester of a pregnancy, allow some state regulation in the second trimester and permit states to ban all abortions in the third trimester, except where the mother's life is in danger. Although opinion on the issue of abortion does not split entirely along party lines, Democrats have in general supported the right to choose an abortion, while Republicans have taken an anti-abortion position. Some abortion rights campaigners hope that the arrival of a Democratic president who supports their views will allow them to move off the defensive and place more emphasis on education and contraception, to help reduce the number of abortions take place. The Center for Disease Control has estimated that around 1.4m abortions were carried out in the US in 1990.</p>

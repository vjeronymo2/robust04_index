			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Management: The myth of the bloated head office SHORT OF increasing its profits and dividend, there is one sure way for a company to please its shareholders and the vast majority of its managers: to cut the size and cost of its head office, or 'corporate centre'. But as the past month has shown, it is also the best way to sow confusion - and possibly something worse. That HQ-cutting has become such a totem of good management is the result of a number of long- and short-term pressures. They include: The trend towards flatter, simpler, faster-moving and more outward-looking organisations, which delegate much more decision-making to the front line. The 'shareholder value' movement of the past decade, which drew alarmed attention to the fact that a multinational's corporate centre can easily cost upwards of Pounds 200m a year. The realisation that many activities, from catering to data processing, insurance, accounting and tax, can be contracted-out to specialist consultancies. The fashion for small HQs which was set by predatory UK conglomerates such as GEC, Hanson and BTR. All these have been reinforced over the past 18 months by a fifth pressure: the very straitened financial circumstances in which many large companies have found themselves. All well and good, you may say: those remote, unproductive, paper-pushing HQ staff have had it so cushy for so long that they deserve every cut they get. But this machismo has reached such a pitch that it risks putting pressure on companies to ignore what ought to be the foundation of every head office redesign: a cool assessment of the nature of the company's various businesses and the best way in which the corporate centre can add value to them. This should almost never mean increasing the size of an HQ, but nor does it mean that every company's should be slashed. Take three announcements of cuts over the past month, including two within the past week - first from buoyant Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch packaged goods group and then from two hard-pressed chemicals combines, Britain's ICI and America's Dow. Not only did each move cause confusion, but together they underline some of the many questions surrounding the right role of head office in different circumstances. Four weeks ago Unilever, with annual revenues of Pounds 25bn, announced it was trimming its HQ, which is split between London and Rotterdam, by 120 people to 1,075. This was widely criticised for being too mild because of lack of financial pressure. Last Friday ICI, with revenues about half as large, won wide acclaim by saying that within two years the HQs of the two companies into which it is demerging itself, Zeneca and new-ICI, would together employ barely half its current head office staff of 450. On Monday Dow, with roughly the same revenues as ICI, declared a cut of only about 250 in its own current complement of no less than 4,000. So which of the three will have the most productive HQ? Zeneca and ICI, it would seem, with Unilever trailing a fair way behind and Dow bringing up the rear. Not necessarily. For the three define their corporate centres in such different ways that comparisons are well-nigh impossible without the detailed activity-by-activity analysis for which consultants charge handsomely. Even then, packaged goods and chemicals are so different as to render much of this analysis subjective. If ICI were not so intent on showing how lean it has already become, it could re-express its current total of 450 as either 650 - including 'central services' working in London - or 870, which adds in pensions experts, patents people and other staff outside the capital. Some of these staff spend part of their time supporting ICI's various 'businesses', or divisions. But none of these figures includes divisional managers themselves, who at ICI are rightly counted separately. Not so at Dow - well, not entirely. As with other US companies, its headquarters in Michigan seems so vast because it includes not just many of the sort of service staff whom ICI counts separately, but also quite a number of divisional managers. Moreover, the Dow figure contains not only those with corporate roles, but also staff working for the company's North American regional HQ. Many people work for both HQs, so separate numbers are impossible to determine. On a host of grounds, not least those of staff motivation and clear cost control, ICI-like transparency is clearly preferable. But it has been far from the rule among multinationals, even in Europe. Hence some of the Unilever changes. In addition to the cut of 120 (all in London), they also involve a clear separation from the corporate centre of 260 staff who work for the group's operating companies, plus 330 who are engaged in either British or Dutch national management. Then there is the dreaded subject of synergy. One of the reasons why Unilever may need a larger head office than either Dow or ICI, pro-rata for its size, is that its businesses have more in common with each other. This inter-dependence tends to create many more issues in which the corporate centre needs to get involved. If one also takes into account the different degrees to which the three companies sub-contract various activities, or have begun to join the trend towards dispersing HQ tasks around product divisions, the comparisons become fuzzier still. The only solution is to subject each corporate centre to a microscope and to judge on real merit. Appearances are almost always deceptive.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (40): An economic bottleneck - Coal and energy shortages People are not complaining too much about the price rises - 'not yet anyway,' say the blue-boilersuited staff of the coal depot in Beijing's grimy backstreets. Several years ago the cylindrical bricks of pressed coal dust were three fen each - now they cost five times as much. The overhaul of the loss-making coal industry, one of the central parts of China's modernisation, is also one of the most publicly sensitive. It implies not just sharp price rises but huge job cuts in China's coal industry - with 7m workers, it is the world's largest. The use of coal is woven into almost every part of Chinese life. In winter, the cities' hutongs - crowded lanes of huts - pump out black coal smoke from their heating stoves, while most electricity is generated from coal. In total, it makes up three-quarters of the country's energy consumption. But the need for reform is inescapable. After years of explosive economic growth, during which energy production failed to keep pace, the southern and coastal regions now see their growth threatened by coal and power shortages, one of the economy's tightening bottlenecks. Although annual coal production doubled between 1977 and 1992 to 1.1bn tonnes, it has failed to meet demand. Similarly, electricity generation, which has risen by around 8 per cent a year in the last decade, has been outstripped by GNP, which has risen nearly 9 per cent a year in that period. According to the State Planning Commission, the energy shortage may be the equivalent of 500m to 600m tonnes of coal by 2000 if the economy grows by around 9 per cent a year. Part of the problem has been artificially low state prices. Although the range between provinces is wide, the level has frequently been less than a third of world market prices of USDollars 35 a tonne. In the past year, the huge China General Coal Corporation, which accounts for a third of the industry's output, has taken the first steps to reform by allowing coal prices on 57 per cent of its output to float at market prices, compared to 20 per cent in 1992. The rest of the industry is made up almost entirely of mines run by provincial and local governments, which must sell specified amounts to China General and state enterprises at set prices. According to a World Bank report in June, prices for this mandatory production were raised by 27 per cent to Yn71 per tonne. The government has also, gingerly, begun to tackle overmanning. Since last year, China has laid off or has made plans to lay off 200,000 employees. The government has given it some Yn2bn a year to pass on as compensation. But even if profitability returns to the industry and production rises, the creaking rail network threatens to choke off supplies. Guangdong province, in China's booming south, imports some coal from Australia because freight deliveries from the north are so erratic. Hundreds of kilometres away, stockpiles of Chinese coal smoulder while waiting months for freight trains. The problem is made acute by the regional imbalances between production and consumption: while China's main coal deposits are in the north, the main consumption in the east, south and north east. One of the government's proposed solutions is to build more power plants inland near the mines. However western diplomats point out that electricity transmission along power cables is currently so inefficient that much electricity is lost on the way. Given China's coal reserves - estimated by western observers to be some 900bn tonnes - coal will remain the backbone of China's energy supplies for decades. If the transformation of the industry is successful, Beijing expects annual production to rise by nearly 40 per cent by the end of the century to 1.5bn tonnes. But between now and then, Beijing must navigate some of the most publicly contentious issues of its programme of reform.</p>

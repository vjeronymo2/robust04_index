			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Mowlem losses grow to Pounds 27m JOHN Mowlem, the contractor, is strengthening its balance sheet with the Pounds 52m sale of its HSS tool hire business, which it announced yesterday alongside deepening pre-tax losses. The pre-tax deficit grew from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 27.2m last year after Pounds 4.8m losses at London City Airport and a further Pounds 20.2m of reorganisation costs and write-offs. The final dividend is cut from 4.85p to 2p, leaving a total of 4p (10.5p). Losses per share were 20.7p (9.4p). Sir Philip Beck, chairman, said the HSS disposal, to Davis Service Group, cut year-end net debt from Pounds 69.1m to about Pounds 17m and gearing to 9 per cent. Since then there had been a seasonal increase in borrowings of about Pounds 24m. The sale price was about 57 per cent of the group's market value at yesterday's opening price of 85p. It gained 3p to close at 88p. Turnover fell to Pounds 1.25bn (Pounds 1.37bn) and operating profit to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 19.3m). This partly reflected the tightening squeeze on contracting, but also a sharp fall in profits from scaffolding hire. Housebuilding slipped into losses and the airport registered a deficit after using up provisions. In contracting, the group had no large loss-makers. It concentrated on smaller regional contracts. The division's Pounds 904m (Pounds 1.05bn) turnover was expected to hold steady this year. Profit after interest income declined to Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 26.5m). The SGB scaffolding business saw profits fall to Pounds 5m (Pounds 11.4m). This division bore the brunt of the Pounds 9.3m reorganisation charges. Housebuilding lost Pounds 1.4m and the land bank was further written down at an exceptional cost of Pounds 5.2m. About Pounds 23m was brought in from property development sales. COMMENT Mowlem's sale of HSS met a mixed reception. On the one hand, it gives balance sheet strength that would be the envy of Costain or Taylor Woodrow and underpins the ability to maintain the dividend. On the other hand, it has got rid of its highest margin business and one that should come out of recession earliest. Sir Philip's talk of selling a cash absorbing business smacks of battening down the hatches on the core contracting arm, which points to the long haul back to decent margins in that industry. Mowlem does, however, deserve credit for avoiding black-hole contracts and looks one of the better bets in that sector - long term, of course. Meanwhile scaffolding's recovery is the main hope. The risks involved at London airport are reflected in the failure so far to find a partner. A small loss is expected this year before a goodwill hit resulting from the HSS sale. Patient investors will hold the stock for the 5.7 per cent yield.</p>

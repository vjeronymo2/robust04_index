White and green paint was sprayed on the walls of Nippon  Motorola Ltd., the Japanese subsidiary of Motorola in central  Tokyo, to create slogans such as "(We Are) Against America" and  "(We'll) Crush the Hard-Selling Diplomacy of U.S. Imperialists."    The graffiti covered an area of two meters by 1.4 meters. An  unidentified man called the Tokyo media around 4 A.M., saying  the Motorola building has been defaced.    The United States said last week it would impose sanctions  against Japan by raising tariffs in a dispute over Motorola's  access to the cellular phone market in Japan. Washington  accused Japan of breaching a 1989 trade accord meant to boost  imports of U.S. cellular phones and said it will retaliate by  raising tariffs on Japanese telecommunications products and  possible other products.</p>

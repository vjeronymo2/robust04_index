			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bouygues forecasts 13% advance in revenues Bouygues of France, one of Europe's leading public works and construction groups, expects full-year 1994 consolidated revenue to grow by 13 per cent to FFr69.3bn (Dollars 13.4bn) from FFr61.2bn in 1993, agencies report from Paris. A 2 per cent increase in its construction revenues, to FFr53.1bn, will be offset by an 18 per cent drop in revenue from real-estate operations, to FFr3.8bn, Bouygues said. Revenue from other operations is set to decline by 1 per cent this year, to FFr19.7bn. However, this will be boosted in coming years by the recent French government decision to award a third license for a cellular telephone network to a Bouygues-led consortium. Buoygues plans to pay an interim net dividend of FFr5 a share. Last year it paid out a total of FFr15.</p>

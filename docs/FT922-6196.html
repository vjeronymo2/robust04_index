			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Thailand's acting rulers lift state of emergency THAILAND'S acting government yesterday lifted a state of emergency imposed on Bangkok and four surrounding provinces during violent confrontations between pro-democracy demonstrators and troops last week. The authorities banned public gatherings under the state of emergency, but protesters ignored the order. At least 48 people were killed by the armed forces before the king of Thailand brokered a compromise and Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister, was forced to resign. The five-party coalition government which appointed Gen Suchinda bowed to popular pressure on Monday and approved constitutional amendments demanded by the opposition to reduce the power of the military. Yesterday the pro-military coalition appeared to be on the brink of falling apart as its members attempted to choose a new prime minister and faced demands for the punishment of the senior military officers responsible for the shootings. Various solutions are being aired, including a new coalition which would bring in some of the opposition parties, and the possibility of new elections. There is widespread concern the military will feel cornered by demands for retribution and stage a coup d'etat. Opposition parties have asked the constitutional tribunal to rescind an amnesty decree signed by Gen Suchinda which pardons demonstrators and those who gave the troops the order to shoot.</p>

"The United Nations has sought the request for additional  troops. The United States was among the group of countries  approached by the United Nations," State Department Spokeswoman  Christine Shelly said.    The United States has all the way insisted that it will not  send ground troops to Bosnia unless the three warring sides  reach a peace settlement in good faith.    Shelly refused to give more details on the request, but said  "The U.S. position on troops remains unchanged."    A senior State Department official was quoted as saying that  the administration was looking at the request at the "highest  levels."    The United Nations protection force in Bosnia is asking for  2,500 to 3,000 more troops to demilitarize Sarajevo to  consolidate a ceasefire.    France, Britain and The Netherlands have all refused to  dispatch more troops.    Russia has also dismissed a request for its paratroops to be  transferred from Croatia to Bosnia.    France, Britain and The Netherlands are the major  contributors of troops to Bosnia under the U.N., with 6,000,  2,500, and 2,400 troops respectively.</p>

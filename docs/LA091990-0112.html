			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> STRIVING TO SERVE GOD AND FAMILY;  </P> <P> MARRIED ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS STILL YEARN TO SERVE THEIR CHURCH. THEY SEEK AN  END TO MANDATORY CELIBACY AS THE CHURCH FACES A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF ACTIVE  CLERGYMEN.  </P> <P> They have acquired new loves along the way in wives and children. But an old  love still burns in the hearts of many married Roman Catholic priests -- the  desire to serve their church as ordained ministers.  </P> <P> That is officially forbidden and only the Pope can change it. Many of the  estimated 19,000 U.S. Catholic priests who have married in the past 20 years  remain loyal, believing that they can function both as married men and  effective ministers of the sacraments.  </P> <P> Meantime, their church is being hurt by a clergy shortage that grows steadily  worse each year: 43% of the world's parishes -- and about one-tenth of the  19,500 U.S. parishes -- do not have a regular priest. In the United States,  according to studies, half of the priests under age 60 have married, and by the  mid-1990s, the number of married priests is expected to equal or surpass the  26,000 unmarried active parish priests.  </P> <P> So, when several hundred married priests and their spouses held an annual  meeting here recently, it was not surprising that they gently confronted the  nation's Catholic bishops -- who by chance were attending their own retreat at  nearby Santa Clara University. At a prayer vigil, and later with four bishops  officially selected to meet with them, leaders of Corpus, the National Assn.  for a Married Priesthood, pressed for the return of married priests to full  sacramental service and an end to mandatory celibacy.  </P> <P> "The people are ready for a married priesthood," said Philip McGovern, a  married priest living in Placentia and a West Coast representative of Corpus.  "They are not dumb, not sheep as the church has treated them. They don't care  if a priest is married or not, as long as they are fed with the Gospel and the  Eucharist."  </P> <P> A social gathering for married priests, held in Buena Park last Saturday, drew  73 of an estimated 750 married priests from Los Angeles to San Diego, including  Matthias Ryder, who stepped down as pastor of St. Callistus Church in Garden  Grove this summer to get married, McGovern said.  </P> <P> McGovern predicted the grass-roots movement for a married priesthood will  succeed this decade.  </P> <P> Although priestly celibacy is not on the agenda of a worldwide bishops  conference in Rome next month, Brazilian and Canadian bishops have said that  they will recommend that married men not previously ordained be eligible for  priesthood.  </P> <P> Even officials at the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington admit to an  uncertainty about what to call the priests: resigned, inactive, or married.  </P> <P> Since the 4th Century, the Roman Catholic Church has decreed that its priests  must be celibate, basing the requirement on the assumption that Jesus was  unmarried, upon the words of Apostle Paul that "an unmarried man can devote  himself (fully) to the Lord's affairs" (1 Corinthians 7:32), and upon church  tradition.  </P> <P> Some priests seek "laicization," an often lengthy process whereby the Vatican  releases a man from the priesthood and grants him full standing as a lay  Catholic. Others skip the formalities.  </P> <P> Priests who marry find it is not always easy to deal with the guilt that  lingers after having forsaken the vow of celibacy, or to change careers and  take on family responsibilities at midlife.  </P> <P> Joseph Buko, a former Maryknoll missionary priest to Japan, said the toughest  adjustments he faced when he resigned 22 years ago and married were retooling  for another career and learning to be a family man.  </P> <P> "I went back to Fordham and got a degree in social work," he said. "I had a  theology degree but that won't buy you any groceries. And getting used to kids  again was difficult. I hadn't seen a child for all those days I was in  seminary, so I got a job as a trainee at a foster-care agency."  </P> <P> Now, he and his wife, Ann, have four daughters. He works for the San Diego  County Adoption Services. She is campus nurse at the University of San Diego  and a consultant on sex education for the local diocese.  </P> <P> The Bukos are typical of couples who adjust well. Most married priests, who  tend to be high achievers, are healthy, well-rounded persons, according to  Terence Dosh, a former Benedictine monk who is national coordinator of  Minneapolis-based Corpus. Most land on their feet financially.  </P> <P> "Ninety-nine percent of the men who left (in the late 1960s and early 1970s)  were successful in making a good living -- sometimes to the amazement and  disappointment of those who stayed," said Tom McMahon, a licensed family  counselor who leads a weekly Eucharistic meeting in San Jose for a group of  about 15 families. Younger priests, he added, typically have acquired degrees  or skills that make it easier to find employment when they leave.  </P> <P> Some married priests never quite make the transition.  </P> <P> "It's still very painful," confided one resigned priest who asked that his name  not be used. "We'll never get rid of the fact that we're priests . . . I'm  recovering from realizing they'll never let me return to the priesthood just  because I'm married."  </P> <P> At least 5,000 married priests would like to serve their church in an ordained  capacity, according to Dosh. About 30 to 40 of the nation's 188 dioceses permit  married priests to function in church jobs, he said, although they cannot  administer the sacraments. Another 80 to 100 married priests teach theology at  the university level -- half of them at Catholic schools.  </P> <P> About 60% of those doing secular work are in social service professions; most  of the rest are in a variety of businesses, according to a survey of 5,500  married priests made by Corpus.  </P> <P> For example, social worker James Mulligan counsels on legal, financial and  family matters during the week in his job for the state of California and  assists a Sacramento parish priest on Sundays. John Ilg of Portland runs his  own rug- and upholstery-cleaning business. Nick De Los Reyes, who brought his  wife and four young children to a recent conference of several hundred Corpus  members, is a clinical psychologist in Seal Beach.  </P> <P> Priests who attended the conference at San Jose State University said celibacy  was what drove most of them to resign.  </P> <P> "What happens," said Buko, who led a workshop at the conference on how to cope  with resigning from the priesthood, "is they meet a woman who is loving and  sensitive, and they fall in love and that changes everything . . . Women teach  us about intimacy -- the opposite of clerical control and power."  </P> <P> Corpus, he added, "is enormous help as a mutual support system . . . It's a  kind of Priests Anonymous."  </P> <P> With some exasperation, the married priests noted that since 1982 the Vatican  has permitted dozens of married Episcopal priests and several Lutherans to  convert to Roman Catholicism, remain married and celebrate Mass, hear  confessions and perform other priestly duties.  </P> <P> "That's a double standard," said Guy Murning of Mill Valley, who was ordained a  Catholic priest in 1970, but left to marry eight years ago.  </P> <P> In Zaire and Indonesia, according to Dosh, married priests are clandestinely  serving because of specialized tribal needs and a priest shortage.  </P> <P> Speaking last month at the International Federation of Married Catholic Priests  in the Netherlands, Anthony T. Padovano, president of Corpus, declared that  "obligatory celibacy is the church's Berlin Wall, its Eastern Europe under  Soviet domination, its Stalinist and Brezhnev era before Gorbachev."  </P> <P> On this issue, said Padovano, who presided at the San Jose meeting and spoke to  a West Coast meeting of married priests in Buena Park last Saturday, Pope John  Paul II "presents the image of an avenger, a Grand Inquisitor who holds married  priests under house arrest until they recant by denying their marriages and  their choices."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony does not think optional celibacy would  help the church in the long run because Eastern rite Catholic churches, which  permit married clergy, also have a priest shortage.  </P> <P> Opinions differ over whether a married priesthood would decrease the mounting  reports of sexual misconduct by Catholic clergy.  </P> <P> "Certainly, priests are vulnerable from the inside because of their own sexual  drives and from the outside because they become very attractive sexual  targets," said A. W. Richard Sipe, a former Benedictine monk who is married and  practices psychotherapy in Baltimore. He will publish a 25-year study next  month based on 1,000 interviews with priests and 500 of their intimates,  concluding that half of all priests break celibacy vows.  </P> <P> Sipe's findings come as surveys indicate a rising majority of U.S. priests and  laity favor "optional celibacy" for priests who choose it.  </P> <P> While a number of married priests are seeking to refocus their sexuality,  others are working their way through feelings that they let the church down  when they were sorely needed.  </P> <P> A lot of priests, said Paul Dion, who served under Bishop Leo T. Maher of San  Diego before marrying in 1977, "have had to work through many layers of guilt .  . . inculcated from their youth and the family values of being Roman Catholic."  </P> <P> Part of it, he said, is feeling that, "I made a promise, a vow to God, and I  haven't been faithful to that vow, so now in my human weakness I have turned my  back on him."  </P> <P> Priests who resign may also feel bad about letting down their parishioners or  the missionary society or seminary that trained them.  </P> <P> "I went through some of these things myself," said Dion, "and still have to go  through them."  </P> <P> McMahon, who grew up in a staunch Irish Catholic family in San Francisco and  served as a priest for 26 years, insists that he "never resigned." He was  ordered out of his parish in 1980, when the bishop learned that he had been  quietly married for five years and had two children.  </P> <P> "I knew I would be cut off completely -- pension, health benefits and work in  the line I was trained in and accustomed to for over 38 years. I spent four  years in therapy getting ready for the change and delighted I did," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lynn Smith contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Promotions help Iceland to Pounds 32m Iceland's shares jumped 14 per cent to 165p yesterday as the frozen and chilled food retailer announced a 10 per cent increase in the interim dividend and a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.1m. Helped by strong promotional activity and new stores, sales advanced 12 per cent to Pounds 621.5m for the 26 weeks to July 2. The payout was increased from 1.2p to 1.32p. Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 7.67p. Mr Malcom Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the 'Great Iceland Giveaway' - in which the group offered free food with certain purchases - had helped to return like-for-like sales growth in a fiercely competitive sector. At one stage during the first six months, weekly like-for-like sales had been down 4 per cent, Mr Walker said. At the same time, customers were spending some 3 per cent less per visit, about Pounds 6.70p per basket. While the spend had not improved, promotional activity helped Iceland finish the first half with an overall 0.5 per cent increase in like-for-like sales volumes. Food sales were running approximately 1.5 per cent ahead of last year. The promotions had an adverse effect on operating margins which slipped from 5.9 per cent to 5.6 per cent. The bulk of the growth in turnover came from new stores, which saw a 14.2 per cent increase in food sales. The group has opened 35 new stores, with a further 20 planned to bring the total to 705. Mr Walker said that although customers continued to search for value, the price pressures which have afflicted the food retailing sector for the last two years were expected to ease in the second half. Although competition would remain intense, Mr Walker was confident that Iceland's role as a second-stop shop would protect it from the worst of the competition. 'The supermarkets might be reaching saturation, but we have identified 1,500 sites we can trade from,' he said. 'Saturation is not a word in our vocabulary.' COMMENT This was a decidedly more subdued Malcolm Walker than has been seen in the past. For all his insistence that the bloodletting between superstores does not affect Iceland, the group has introduced attention-grabbing promotions and commissioned market research to look into declines in volume. Yet the company has nevertheless delivered the goods. That may be why the shares, which have languished in recent months, moved ahead so strongly. Forecasts of Pounds 70m pre-tax this year make the shares look pretty cheap on a prospective p/e of about 11. While there may be a little upside left on the back of these results, longer-term questions over the durability of promotion-led sales gains and the company's discount retailing strategy are likely to overhang the stock.</p>

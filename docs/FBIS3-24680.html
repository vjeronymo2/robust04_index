			<p>Europe     Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 08, 25  February 1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Lat in America Group featuring brief summaries of  foreign media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most  recent sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Latin America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for suuary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications. The EER is published in two  editions, one for Western Europe (also including media coverage of  Canada and Turkey), and the other for Eastern Europe.  Drawing  primarily from domes tic media sources of these countries but also  using other foreign media where appropriate, the EER focuses on  national and regional economic issues, such as economic  competitiveness, regional economic integration, economic reforms and  other changes in economic policies, and foreign trade and  investment.      FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.

Matthaeus-Maier writes in the  Duesseldorf daily HANDELSBLATT that, although she supports the goals  of Commission President Jacques Delors' "White Book" plan for  growth, competitiveness, and employment, the plan's provision for an  independent EU financing capacity is "neither necessary nor  desirable."      According to Matthaeus-Maier, such a capacity is not necessary  because the EU budget already offers a sufficient number of  financing plans, including the Cohesion Fund, the Structural Fund,  and the Medium-Term Research Program.  Additional funds, she argues,  could be raised through the existing European Investment Bank and  the European Investment Fund, which is to be established this year.  Taken together, these financing sources could raise around 30  billion European Currency Units (ECU), an amount Matthaeus-Maier  contends should be sufficient to fund the job creation program.      Matthaeus-Maier also maintains that an independent EU financing  authority is undesirable.  First, she points out, there is good  reason for the provisions in the Maastricht Treaty which require  that the EU budget not be financed through debt but exclusively  through the resources of the member states.  An EU financing  capability, she argues, would create a new source of indebtedness  which would take on a life of its own.  Member states would have a  new loophole enabling them to escape limits on indebtedness at the  national level.  Second, Matthaeus-Maier asserts, new indebtedness  at the EU level would undermine the convergence criteria the  Maastricht Treaty requires member states to meet to join the  European Monetary Union (EMU).  Any financial obligations taken on  by the EU ultimately would have to be divided up among the member  states, making it even more difficult for them to meet EMU's limits  on debt as percentage of GDP.  Third, Matthaeus-Maier contends, new  EU debt would make a decline in interest rates even more difficult,  thus hindering investment in new jobs.  The deeper the EU went into  debt, the greater the eventual pressure for counterbalancing  spending cuts and tax increases, steps which would be  "poison for  economic growth."  Fourth, the interest on new indebtedness at the  EU level would still have to be paid by the member-states, and any  increase in member-state contributions would probably increase  opposition to the EU.      What the EU really needs, Matthaeus-Maier suggests, is not a new  way to increase debt but rather a reduction of debt at all levels  and strict adherence to Maastricht's convergence criteria.  If  available financial resources are insufficient, she concludes, then  the Union's existing budget must be redistributed to fund the  measures envisioned in the "White Book."  (RoH)  (Duesseldorf  HANDELSBLATT in German 21/22 Jan 94 p 3)      DENMARK      MINISTER ANNOUNCES APPRENTICESHIPS--Danish Labor Minister Jytte  Andersen has announced that recently enacted legislation gives  municipal authorities a new tool in the fight against youth  unemployment:  local government authorities can now offer poorly  educated youth a two-year apprenticeship program.  Authorities will  have three months from the time of application to decide whether the  candidate is needy enough to qualify.  While there are only 3,OOO  apprenticeships available for 1994, Andersen saw the new program as  filling a major gap in the left-center coalition's comprehensive job  stimulus effort.      Andersen made the announcement in response to a study--conducted  by the Counties and Municipalities Research Institute--indicating  the inadequacy of existing programs in finding lasting jobs for  poorly prepared youth.  Under these programs, municipalities had  been charged with finding jobs or vocational training slots for all  unemployed between the ages of 18 and 25 within 14 days of  application.  This meant that, as a last resort, municipal  governments had to create "artificial jobs" and training courses for  some 80,000 individuals annually.  The study generally lauded the  results of these efforts, citing a high degree of participant  satisfaction and success in eventually finding nonsubsidized jobs.  The effort was deemed to have failed, however, in helping those in  the youngest group (ages 18-20) without high school diplomas and/or  work experience.  Among these "weak" youth, only half subsequently  moved into the regular job market. (RB)  (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE  TIDENDE in Danish 15 Feb 94 Sect. 1 p 1; Sect. II p 4; 16 Feb 94  Sect. 1 p 4)      FRANCE      COMMENTARY NOTES CLINTON SAUDI DEAL ANNOUNCEMENT--LES ECHOS  editor Gilles Senges, referring to President Bill Clinton's  announcement of the Saudi Airlines purchase of U.S. aircraft, noted  that it was the first time in aircraft history that a president of  any country had substituted for the management of the manufacturer  in announcing a purchase of aircraft.  According to Senges, the fact  that President Clinton did just that and organized this announcement  as a "grand occasion" in the presence of McDonnell Douglas and  Boeing Aircraft management and the Saudi ambassador, is testimony to  the scope of the battle that preceded the Saudi purchase.  It seems,  Senges writes, that the Saudi Airlines purchase was clinched by the  ''generous'' U.S. agreement to reschedule Saudi Arabia's debt and by  repeated visits to Saudi Arabia by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.  These visits were countered by those of French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe, Defense Minister Francois Leotard, Foreign Trade  Minister Gerard Longuet, and finally by a visit by Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur.  However, Balladur came back "empty handed."  Senges observes that the United States had also put "all the weight  of the Eximbank" behind its bid by guaranteeing the total contract.  (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in French 17 Feb 94 p 8)      COMMENTARY ON CLINTON TRADE POLICY--According to Pascal Aubert  writing in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, the Clinton administration has  shown its capacity to conduct negotiations and to have its point of  view heard, with "an efficiency all the more frightening since  (Clinton) does not have the free market inhibitions of his  Republican predecessors."  The U.S. Government does not seem to care  that it is contradictory to force open foreign markets with the  threat to close its own and to accuse others of corrupting free  trade while the United States is doing so itself, Aubert writes.  This practice rests on the end justifying the means, with the only  argument on its behalf being that U.S. economic security is the best  guarantee of total security.  This presumption has justified forcing  a "vassal (Saudi) monarchy" to buy U.S. aircraft, Aubert concludes.  (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 18 Feb 94 p 4)c      EDITORIAL ON HIGHER U.S. INTEREST RATES--Nicolas Beytout, editor-  in-chief for the Paris financial daily LES ECHOS, writes that the  first rise in U.S. interest rates in five years was dictated by  purely domestic concerns and will endanger the weak recovery  currently taking place in France.  The increase in U.S. rates  threatens to unravel the slow but progressive lowering of rates in  France and Germany.  The risk now is that the German Bundesbank will  raise German rates.      European economies, especially that of France, cannot afford  continued recession, Beytout writes.  He observes that while the  newly raised interest rates in the United States may slow down the  U.S. recovery, they may have a greater effect in Europe, reducing  growth and halting recovery.  The United States is raising interest  rates to fight inflation at the same time as the German Bundesbank  is reluctant to lower its rates because of inflation.  But the  inflation they fear is in their countries, argues Beytout, not in  France.  In raising interest rates, the United States is rendering  French economic policy more difficult. (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in  French 7 Feb 94 p 3)      SPAIN      IMPACT OF NEW HIRING CONTRACTS VIEWED--The news of higher  unemployment in January announced by the National Employment  Institute (INEM) comes at a bad time for the Spanish Government,  which has been pushing for passage of a labor reform bill.  The  trade unions are contesting the reform on the grounds that it will  not create new jobs, and opposition leader and People's Party (PP)  President Jose Maria Aznar characterizes the government's policies  as a "failure."  During a press conference, INEM director Alberto  Elordi attempted to mitigate these concerns by explaining that the  high unemployment rate in January can be attributed to seasonal  employment ending after the Christmas season.  The Spanish  Confederation of Employers' Organizations (CEOE) further downplayed  the January figure by focusing on the increasing number of jobs  which have been created since the first of the year.  Referring to  the labor reform bill approved in January, which provided for  apprenticeships, part-time jobs, and training contracts, Elordi  noted: "Of the 400,000 job new job placements registered from 1  January through 6 February, 80,4O7 resulted from apprenticeship,  short-term, and training contracts."  These contracts represent a 9-  percent increase in job contracts over January of last year.  According to Elordi, women have a difficult time finding jobs, yet  almost 61.1 percent of the part-time contracts have been signed by  women.  Some 67.1 percent of the apprenticeship contracts have gone  to men.  These types of jobs are encountering a wider acceptance in  business circles.  For example, 5O0 of these contracts were signed  daily in January and by February, this number had risen to between  600 and 650 contracts a day. (CH)  (Madrid EL PAlS in Spanish 15 Feb  94 pp 1,45)      SPAIN LEADS EU IN NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS--According to an  internal document from the Ministry of Public Administration to  which DIARIO 16 had access, correspondents Isabel Duran and J. Diaz  Herrera report that the government created 800,000 civil service  jobs during the past decade, including those in government-owned  companies and local governments.  Earlier, the People's Party (PP)  had estimated the number of government workers at 500,O00 and made  these findings public, accusing former Secretary of Public  Administration Juan Manuel Equiagaray of keeping information from  the public and denying reports concerning increases in the number of  public officials.  On average and during the same time period, the  number of public officials in other EU countries was 10 percent in  contrast to Spain's 32 percent.      The state has become the largest employer in the country, the  authors claim, even overshadowing the automobile industry, which  employs approximately 5OO,OOO people and represents 28 percent of  Spanish exports.  The Public Administration document reports that  the number of public officials in Spain rose from 1,646,4OO to  2,269,562 in a decade, indicating that between 12 and 15 percent of  the Spanish work force is employed in the public sector.  The CEOE  notes that Spanish industry has lost 340,000 jobs and more jobs will  be lost in the agricultural sector as the country adheres to EU  agricultural guidelines by reducing the number of farm workers.  The  authors note that the service industry cannot absorb this large a  number of unemployed people.  Economics professor Ramon Tamames  describes the unemployment rate as "extremely alarming."  In his  book "Alternative Spain," Tamames characterizes the causes of  Spain's unemployment as an example of excessive "bureaucratization  and waste."  He adds, it is "incomprehensible" that the birth rate  in Spain should have only grown by a modest 3 percent during the  past decade while the government bureaucracy increased by 32 percent  in the same timeframe.      The problem is more serious in the autonomous communities,  according to PP deputy Manuel Nunez where "veritable colonies" have  developed around the governing parties, "which goes against Title  VIII of the Constitution."  In Andalusia, for instance, the bloated  bureaucracy has led to an increase in high level posts.  Nunez  writes: "Compared to Catalonia, the Basques have three times as many  public officials and compared to Madrid, the Catalans have twice the  number of public officials."  A PP study indicates that the  excessive  number of high level posts is hindering government  administration. (CH)  (Madrid Diario 16 in Spanish 24 Jan 94 p 8)      SWEDEN      ABB SETS UP JOINT VENTURE IN RUSSIA--The Swedish-Swiss  electronics firm Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), which already controls 45  companies in Central and Eastern Europe, has announced the formation  of a joint venture with Nevsky Zavod, the leading Russian producer  of gas and steam turbines.  The new firm, to be based in St.  Petersburg, plans not only to supply Russian power plants with ABB  equipment and technology but also to sell entire prefabricated  facilities as well.  Percy Barnevik, the head of ABB, foresees  Swedish manufacturers making components that can then be assembled  in Russia.  Barnevik noted that, at a time when many firms are  skeptical about investing in Russia, "it means a lot to the Russians  psychologically that there are some companies who are continuing to  invest in the country."  (WS)  (Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in  Swedish 28 Jan 94 p C1)      TURKEY      COMMENTARY SCORES GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICY--According to Al tan  Oymen writing in MILLIYET, Turkey's current economic situation will  continue to get worse unless the Turkish Government takes "radical"  steps to improve it.  Such steps need to be radical enough that the  public can accept them with a "sense of self-sacrifice."  Despite  the government's intervention in currency markets to support the  value of the lire, 0ymen criticizes the government for not also  addressing the problem of high interest rates, which increase the  burden of the public debt the government has allowed to accumulate.     Oymen points out that everyone, especially the government, knows  there is a solution.  However, nobody seems "to have the strength"  to do anything.  For example, the government, "accustomed to living  above its means," is only partially reforming the tax system--a last  minute, legal arrangement which does not solve the debt problem.  The government also continues to tolerate large losses of the Public  Economic Enterprises (KIT).  Furthermore, the government is not able  to control the huge growth in imports nor stimulate stagnating  exports.  Oymen questions how long this can continue.

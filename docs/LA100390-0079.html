			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZULU CHIEF REJECTS BID TO MEET WITH MANDELA  </P> <P> Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi on Tuesday declined an invitation from  the African National Congress to join homeland leaders in meeting Nelson  Mandela to discuss ways of ending the recent surge of black factional fighting.  </P> <P> The surprise decision dampened hopes of an early reconciliation between South  Africa's two main black rivals, Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party and Mandela's  ANC. Much of the recent fighting, which has claimed 760 lives since Aug. 13,  has been between supporters of Inkatha and the ANC.  </P> <P> A meeting between the two leaders and a political settlement between their  parties is viewed as an important step toward ending further bloodshed in  Johannesburg-area townships as well as in Inkatha's home base of Natal  province.  </P> <P> Buthelezi, who is chief minister of the Kwazulu homeland as well as head of  Inkatha, had been invited along with other leaders of self-governing black  homelands to meet Mandela at his Soweto home this Friday.  </P> <P> The Zulu chief has issued more than 50 public requests to meet Mandela since  the ANC leader's release from prison in February. But Buthelezi had in mind a  one-on-one meeting, something the ANC has refused to arrange because of  widespread animosity toward the Zulu chief among its members.  </P> <P> Buthelezi told reporters in Geneva, where he is attending an economic  conference, that he declined the invitation because "it's not the kind of  meeting that can contribute to defusing the violence. The meeting must be  between leaders whose followers are involved in the violence."  </P> <P> In a statement, the ANC expressed its "sincere regret" that Buthelezi had  decided not to attend. However, the ANC said it would do everything possible to  ensure that efforts to end the violence continue. It added that it would  maintain a dialogue recently initiated between other ANC and Inkatha leaders.  </P> <P> Three years of internecine warfare in Natal between Zulu supporters of Inkatha  and Zulu supporters of the ANC has claimed nearly 4,000 lives.  </P> <P> Buthelezi had previously expressed reservations about attending the meeting  because he had been invited in his capacity as a homeland leader, rather than  as head of the 1.8-million-member Inkatha Party.  </P> <P> The invitation to leaders of the five other black homelands, which are not  directly involved in the recent fighting, was an indication that the meeting  was not intended to seriously discuss ways of ending the violence, he said.  </P> <P> Buthelezi broke with the ANC in the mid-1970s. Although he consistently  pressured the government to release Mandela, Buthelezi angered many ANC members  by agreeing to participate in the government's homeland system and then  campaigning internationally against the ANC's support for economic sanctions  and guerrilla war.  </P></p>

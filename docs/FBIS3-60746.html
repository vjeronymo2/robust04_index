Addressing the Consultative Committee Meeting of members of  parliament attached to his ministry, the minister of state for  external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, described as untrue the  observation that the Simla agreement has not been functional.  Mr. Bhatia reiterated India's total commitment to human rights  and stated that the Human Rights Commission Bill has been  introduced in parliament.    Regarding declaration of Pakistan as a terrorist state, Mr.  Bhatia said that all requisite evidence available with India has  been passed on to the United States. The U.S. has not taken the  final step for its own reasons.    On Indo-U.S. relations, Mr. Bhatia allayed the apprehensions  of the members and asserted that New Delhi will not compromise  country's sovereignty and its independent position under  pressure. He said India has explained its point of view  frequently in detail and will continue to do so. He also said  India's position on nonproliferation is very clear and based on  sound and fundamental principles.</p>

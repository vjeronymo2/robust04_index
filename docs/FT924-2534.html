			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Delors calls for unity; keeps quiet on union DELIVERING a traditional pre-summit appeal for European unity, Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, yesterday made an important tactical decision. He did not mention the word 'Maastricht'. Mr Delors, who was awarded an honorary degree yesterday by Edinburgh University, used his acceptance address to call for an 'organised and caring' Community which would be more than merely a free trade area. Dressed in a red gown and looking less like a would-be Emperor of Europe than a slightly abashed Meistersinger, Mr Delors admitted the EC was going through a period of doom and gloom. He urged the Community to look beyond its ups and downs and create unity in diversity. Although he praised the single European market taking effect next year, he avoided referring to the Maastricht treaty. Mr Delors may have reflected that the treaty is hardly more popular in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. An opinion poll in The Scotsman yesterday showed 33 per cent of Scottish voters against, 29 per cent in favour, and the rest undecided. The degree ceremony, in the splendour of the university's McEwan Hall, was twice interrupted by young protesters in the gallery shouting - with distinctly Sassanach voices - 'It's your slump - We won't pay.' They were hustled out by stewards as guests tried to drown the shouts with applause. Mr Delors said part of the programme for the single market launched in 1985 had already become reality. 'The brushes could do with a little bit of spit and polish, but the single market will be open for business on New Year's Day,' he said. At a reception afterwards, Mr Delors said the summit would probably not reach agreement on where to site the proposed EC central bank - part of a complex bargaining process also involving decisions on sites for other Community institutions. Britain's bid to bring the central bank to London was unrealistic, he said. He pointed out that London was already the venue for the European bank for Reconstruction and Development, and that the UK was not currently in the exchange rate mechanism.</p>

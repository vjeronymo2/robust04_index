			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Many types of behaviors (e.g., reproductive behaviors, sexually dimorphic behaviors)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are dependent on the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary system, which could represent an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important site for neurotoxic action. Pituitary secretions arise from a number of different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cell types in this gland and neurotoxicants could affect these cells either directly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirectly. Morphological changes in follicular cells, chromophobe cells, somatotropic cells,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prolactin cells, gonadotropic cells, follicle-stimulating hormone secreting cells, luteinizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hormone-containing cells, thyrotropic cells, and cortico cells might be associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse effects on the pituitary, which could ultimately affect behavior and the functioning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nervous system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biochemical changes in the hypothalamus also may be used as indices of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in neuroendocrine function. However, the neuroendocrine significance of changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hypothalamic neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is usually only inferential and data must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most anterior pituitary hormones are subject to negative feedback control by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peripheral endocrine glands and, if neurotoxicants modify peripheral secretions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuroendocrine changes can result from this altered feedback. Modifications in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functioning of these endocrine secretions could occur after toxic exposure; a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents have been shown to alter blood levels of glucocorticoids, thyroxine, estrogen,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corticosterone, and testosterone. Although such changes are not necessarily due to direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuroendocrine effects, target organ changes often can be a first indication of neuroendocrine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4.3.8. Other Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.3.8.1. Structure-activity relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Because of a general lack of epidemiologic or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicologic data on most chemical substances, attempts have been made in toxicology to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predict activities based on chemical structure. The basis for inference from structure-activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationships (SARs) can be either comparison with structures known to have biologic activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or knowledge of structural requirements of a receptor or macromolecular site of action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, given the complexity of the nervous system and the lack of information on biologic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms of neurotoxic action, there are relatively few well-characterized SARs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicology. Since SARs cannot be used to rule out all neurotoxic activity, it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable to use them as a basis for excluding potential neurotoxicity. Caution is warranted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in interpreting SARs in anything other than the most preliminary analyses. Use of SARs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires detailed knowledge not only of structure, but also of each critical step in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogenetic mechanism of neurotoxic injury. Such knowledge is still generally unavailable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SAR approaches are more successful when the range of possible sites of action or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms of action is narrow. Thus, SARs have had more use in relation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carcinogenicity and mutagenicity than in other kinds of toxicity. The SAR approaches used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the development of novel neuropharmacologic structures deserve consideration in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicology, but their utility depends on a better understanding of neurotoxic mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4.3.8.2. In vitro methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In vitro procedures for testing have practical advantages, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies must be done to correlate the results with responses in whole animals. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantage of validated in vitro tests is that they minimize the use of live animals. Some of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the more developed in vitro tests might be simple and might not have to be conducted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highly trained personnel, but, as with many in vivo tests, the analysis and interpretation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results are likely to require expertise. Experience with the Ames test for mutagenesis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirms the advantages of in vitro procedures, but also illustrates the problems that arise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when an assay is used to predict an endpoint that is not exactly what it measures (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carcinogenicity rather than specific aspects of genotoxicity). In vitro changes can be markers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for toxicity, even when the structural or functional consequences are not known or predicted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in vitro methods can examine the more evolutionarily conserved elements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nervous system and improve neurotoxicity detection and could also provide suitable systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for studying developmental neurotoxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A broad range of tissue-culture systems are available for assessing the neurologic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of environmental agents, including cell lines, dissociated cell cultures, reaggregate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cultures, explant cultures, and organ cultures (Veronesi, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neuronal and glial cell lines are used extensively in neurobiology and have potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for neurotoxicological studies. They consist of populations of continuously dividing cells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, when treated appropriately, stop dividing and exhibit differentiated neuronal or glial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties. Neuronal lines can develop electric excitability, chemosensitivity, axon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formation, neurotransmitter synthesis and secretion, and synapse formation. Large quantities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of cells can be generated routinely to develop extensive dose-response or other quantitative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

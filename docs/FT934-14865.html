			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Arcadian in talks to expand hotel side ARCADIAN International, the leisure-based developer and operator, is in negotiations with separate vendors that may lead to the purchase of eight hotels in the south of England and Jersey, writes John Murrell. The company intends to fund the acquisitions in part via a rights issue to raise some Pounds 11.5m net. With negotiations still under way terms of the cash call were not available. Consideration would be met by a combination of cash, new ordinary shares and warrants. The acquisitions would comprise a hotel company, together with the hotel business and assets of two subsidiaries of Hidden Hotels. In addition, Arcadian will assume debt in the hotel company which is not expected to exceed Pounds 12.8m. Both acquisitions would be subject to shareholders' approval. Of the money being raised, some Pounds 5.5m would fund the cash consideration of the Hidden Hotels. The balance would be used to reduce the enlarged group's debt, meet remaining investment requirements and provide extra working capital. Mr Robert Breare, chief executive, said Arcadian had been looking for quality hotels in the UK to balance its portfolio of hotel, golf and country club developments located mainly in continental Europe. He added that the hotels under discussion met 'all our criteria'.</p>

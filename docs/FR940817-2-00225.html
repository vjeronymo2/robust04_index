Transport Processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All types of cells must transport proteins and other molecular components from their site of production near the nucleus to the other sites in the cell (Hammerschlag and Brady, 1989). Neurons are unique in that the neuronal cell body must maintain not only the functions normally associated with its own support, but it must also provide support to its various processes. This support may require transport of material over relatively vast distances. Delivery of necessary substances by intracellular transport down the axon (axonal transport) represents a supply line that is highly vulnerable to interruption by toxic chemicals. In addition, the integrity of the function of the neuronal cell body is often dependent on a supply of trophic factors from the cells that it innervates. These factors are continually supplied to the neural cells by the process of retrograde axonal transport, often as a process of normal exchange between two or more cells. They play a significant factor in the normal growth and maintenance of the neural cells, and a continual supply of certain trophic factors is necessary for cell functioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of axonal transport occurs along longitudinally arranged fiber tracks called neurofilaments. This movement along neurofilaments requires energy in the form of oxidative metabolism. Toxicants that interfere with this metabolism or that disrupt the spatial arrangement or production of neurofilaments may block axonal transport and can produce neuropathy (Lowndes and Baker, 1980). This can be seen following exposure to many substances, such as n-hexane and methyl n-butyl ketone as well as the drugs vincristine, vinblastine, and taxol. Acrylamide produces a dying-back axonopathy but by an alternative mechanism involving altered axonal transport.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.3.3. Ionic Balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The axonal membrane is semipermeable to positively and negatively charged ions (mostly potassium, sodium, and chloride) within and outside of the axon. There are several enzyme systems that maintain an ionic balance that changes following depolarization of the membrane (Davies, 1968). This is maintained only by the continual active transport of ions across the membrane, which requires an expenditure of energy. The nerve impulse is a traveling wave of depolarization normally originating from the cell body; however, in sensory neurons it originates at the terminal receptive end of specialized axons (Davies, 1968). The wave is continued by openings in the membrane that allow ions to rush into the axon. This sudden change in the charge across the axon's membrane is the nerve impulse. It is an amplified depolarization that reaches the threshold value and spreads down the axon from one length to another until the next length of membrane reaches the threshold value. It continues in this fashion until it reaches the synaptic terminal regions. There are a number of varieties of membrane channels (e.g., calcium) that rapidly open and close during impulse generation; the common ones are the sodium and potassium channels. They are very small and allow only ions of a certain size to pass. Several classes of drugs (e.g., local anesthetics) and natural toxins (e.g., tetrodotoxin) inhibit nerve impulse conduction by blocking these channels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.3.4. Neurotransmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The terminal branches of the axon end in small enlargements called synaptic ``boutons.'' It is from these boutons that chemical messengers will be released in order to communicate with the target cell at the point of interaction, the synapse (Hammerschlag and Brady, 1989). When the nerve impulse reaches the terminal branches of the axon, it depolarizes the synaptic boutons. This depolarization causes the release of the chemical messengers (neurotransmitters and neuromodulators) stored in vesicles in the axon terminal (Willis and Grossman, 1973). Classical neurotransmitters include serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine and are typically secreted by one neuron into the synaptic cleft where they are on the postsynaptic membrane. Neuropeptides, however, may travel long distances through the bloodstream to receptors on distant nerve cells or in other tissues. Following depolarization, the amount of secretion is dependent on the number of nerve impulses that reach the synaptic bouton, i.e., the degree of depolarization. The chemical messengers diffuse across the synaptic cleft or into the intraneuronal space and bind to receptors on adjacent nerve cells or effector organs, thus triggering biochemical events that lead to electrical excitation or inhibition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When information is transmitted from nerves to muscle fibers, the point of interaction is called the neuromuscular junction and the interaction leads to contraction or relaxation of the muscle. When the target is a gland cell, the interaction leads to secretion. Synaptic transmission between neurons is slightly more complicated, but still dependent on the opening and closing of ion channels in the membrane. The binding of the messenger to the receptor of the receiving cell can lead to either the excitation or inhibition of the target cell. At an excitatory synapse, the neurotransmitter-receptor interaction leads to an opening in certain ion-specific channels. The charged ions that move through these opened chambers carry a current that serves to depolarize the cell membranes. At inhibitory synapses, the interaction leads to an opening in a different type of ion-specific channel that produces an increase in the level of polarization (hyperpolarization). The sum of all the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents determines the transmembrane potential and when a threshold level of depolarization is reached at the axon's initial segment, a nerve impulse is generated and begins to travel down the axon.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

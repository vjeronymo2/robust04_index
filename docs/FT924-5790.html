			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Nuclear Electric offers coal plan NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned utility, yesterday suggested postponing liberalisation of the electricity market as part of a proposal it said might increase British Coal's sales in England and Wales by up to 14m tonnes a year in the next five years. Independent assessments said the plan - with the government setting aside its aim of increasing in 1994 the number of industrial consumers able to shop around for electricity - might save more than 10 of the 31 threatened pits. The franchise, or non-competitive market, would continue to supply about 70 per cent of electricity in England and Wales. Minimum market shares would be established for power from coal, gas, nuclear and renewables sectors. Coal could have two thirds of the franchise market initially, going down to about half in five years. That would enable it to make sales to the generators of 54m tonnes annually initially, falling to 44m in year five. Under the 'balanced fuel supply pattern', nuclear power would have about 22 per cent, roughly its current market share, at both the start and end of the five-year period. Gas would increase its share from 8 to 20 per cent. The proposal, outlined to MPs at the Commons trade and industry committee yesterday, is bound to be seen as self-serving from a company fighting suggestions that coal's market share could be improved by closing nuclear reactors. It is likely to have significant appeal to the government because it would upset few vested interests. By lowering the limit from 1994 of the competitive market to customers above 100kw, rather than the current 1MW, as currently envisaged, only about 40,000 extra customers, on top of the current 5,000, would be free to choose their electricity supplier.</p>

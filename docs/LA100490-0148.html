			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN WANTS FAIR ON BULLET-TRAIN FAST TRACK  </P> <P> Having refurbished its monorail this year, the Los Angeles County Fair is being  asked to consider a new high-tech transportation venture: a bullet train.  </P> <P> The Pomona City Council this week approved Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer's  suggestion that it ask the L.A. County Fair Assn. board to explore the idea of  using the fairgrounds as a station for a proposed high-speed train route  between Las Vegas and Anaheim.  </P> <P> Nymeyer said Pomona would be a better location than a proposed stop at Ontario  International Airport.  </P> <P> Sid Robinson, spokesman for the fair, said the idea is so new that fair  officials haven't had time to consider it.

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Bentsen speaks out in favour of a stronger dollar Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, last night signalled a potentially important shift in the Clinton administration's currency policy by declaring publicly that he wanted a stronger dollar and that the exchange rate would not be used as a tool of trade policy. However in Tokyo early today the dollar showed continued weakness, touching a post-war low of Y99.4 before the Bank of Japan intervened. Earlier the US currency had hovered around the Y100 mark in late trading in New York where it started the day at Y100.6. Speaking in New York last night, Mr Bentsen said: 'We believe a stronger dollar is better for our economy and better for the world's economy.' He added: 'The dollar is not a tool of our trade policy.' This appeared an attempt to convince financial markets that the administration did not regard yen appreciation against the dollar as an appropriate way of putting pressure on Japan to open its markets to imports. The strongest position previously taken by Mr Bentsen was in early May, when he said the US saw 'no advantage in an undervalued currency'. Mr Bentsen's strongly worded statement followed similar remarks by a 'senior Treasury official' on Friday after the apparent failure of intervention to support the dollar. Last week, however, Mr Bentsen's public statements were bland. The decision to speak out reflects the administration's continuing concern about dollar weakness, which it regards as bad for growth in Europe and Japan as well as in the US, where the threat to growth arises mainly from falling bond and share prices. Mr Bentsen, however, gave no indication of the tactics he favoured for propping up the dollar. Many economists expect another round of concerted central bank intervention but views are mixed on whether the Federal Reserve will lift short-term interest rates at its policy meeting on July 5 and 6. Michael Lindemann adds from Bonn: Earlier, a former senior German official urged the US government to stop making contradictory comments about the role of the dollar as these were causing instability in financial markets. Mr Horst Kohler, a former finance ministry official who now heads the powerful Association of German Savings Banks, said that recent comments by Mr Bentsen, favouring a strong dollar had been at odds with statements by Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, who preferred a weak dollar to correct the trade deficit with Japan.

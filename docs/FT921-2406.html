			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / De Klerk heralds new S Africa: World leaders welcome 70% vote to end apartheid in whites-only referendum PRESIDENT FW de Klerk yesterday promised to change the face of South Africa as he celebrated the white electorate's overwhelming endorsement of his reform policies. Nearly 70 per cent of the voters in Tuesday's whites-only referendum backed an end to minority rule in what is one of the most momentous decisions in their 400-year history. It brought a unanimous welcome from the international community and raised hopes for a new era of peace in southern Africa. Mr de Klerk captured the spirit of a remarkable day for South Africa when he told the country: 'It doesn't often happen that in one generation a nation gets the opportunity to rise above itself. The white electorate has risen above itself in this referendum.' He added: 'Today we closed the book on apartheid.' The mandate, a triumph for Mr de Klerk who staked his political future on the outcome, could lead to an interim multiracial government within months. Mr de Klerk said: 'Today is the real birthday of the real, new South African nation . . . let us use this magnificent result as a great impetus for what we have to do. We have changed, and we will change, the face of South Africa.' He called the poll after the government's defeat in last month's Potchestroom by-election and promised to resign and hold a general election if he failed to win support for his reforms. The 3.3m white electorate was clearly galvanised into an 86 per cent turnout by the prospect of a rightwing government trying to reintroduce apartheid and reviving international hostility The future of the rightwing Conservative party is now uncertain. Some members may continue to pursue their claim for a white homeland at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for constitutional talks. Others may echo the defiance of the CP leader, Dr Andries Treurnicht. 'I will never enter talks where I have to beg for my freedom from Nelson Mandela,' he said yesterday: 'The struggle for freedom and survival is now continuing with even greater earnestness.' Mr Mandela, president of the African National Congress, described the outcome as 'a source of encouragement to all in South Africa'  - but continued to insist that sanctions should remain until an interim government was in place. International leaders welcomed the outcome. Mr John Major said 'the result would never have been achieved without the courage and leadership shown by President de Klerk. I congratulate the white electorate for choosing the path of reform'. US president George Bush welcomed Mr de Klerk's endorsement and said he believed all races should join in building a new democracy. President Francois Mitterrand said France rejoiced at the massive yes vote while Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, responded warmly to the referendum result. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary-general, said the result was 'a vote of confidence in a non-racial future'. The ruling National party and 18 other political organisations, including the ANC, have agreed on a framework for a transitional administration. The agreement at Codesa provides for a multiracial power-sharing administration which would draw up a post-apartheid constitution. But ANC officials, concerned by the continuing violence in black townships, struck a cautious note, seeing the 30 per cent whites who voted for the rightwing Conservative party and its extremist allies as a potentially destabilising factor.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Apple to Produce Cheaper Macintosh: Apple Computer will work toward cultivating  a low-end, less-pricey Macintosh personal computer for the office environment,  the company's chief executive told a user conference. John Sculley said  managers and office workers can use the versatile Macintosh for functions as  diverse as designing graphics or linking all company employees on an electronic  mail network. Sculley said creating inexpensive and smaller Macintosh models  will be a top priority for the $4-billion company in the 1990s. He speculated  that the inexpensive machines of the 1990s, as powerful as today's high-end  models, will be priced between $1,500 and $2,000. Versions of the powerful  Macintosh IIx now cost more than $7,500 each.  </P></p>

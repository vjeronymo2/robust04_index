			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramos has ordered that the recording  business not be classified as part of mass media in order to  open the industry to foreign investors.    "In furtherance of the policy to promote foreign investments  pursuant to the 1991 Foreign Investments Act, this Office  [Office of the President] hereby adopts the policy that the  recording business shall not be considered as part of `mass  media' within the purview of the 1987 Constitution and, as such,  shall not be included in the Foreign Investment Negative List A  pursuant to the 1991 Foreign Investments Act," a memorandum  issued by the president said.    The president also directed National Economic and  Development  Authority Director General Cielito Habito, [Department of] Trade  and Industry [DTI] Secretary Rizalino Navarro, Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Rosario Lopez, and Board of  Investments Managing Head and Undersecretary Tomas Alcantara to  ensure the effective implementation of the policy.    President Ramos issued the policy upon the recommendation of  Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing after  studying a position paper submitted by Warner Music Philippines.    The position paper was opposing the opinion of the SEC that  records and movie films are considered mass media and therefore,  any entity engaged in the production or distribution thereof, is  subject to the constitutional requirement that the ownership and  management shall be limited to Filipinos.    In his meeting with representatives of the SEC, DTI and the  Office of the President's legal office (OP-LO) last April 15,  Quisumbing said the SEC representatives maintained their stand  that the recording business forms part of "mass media."    The DTI and OPLO representatives, however, contended that  the  recording business should not be considered as part of "mass  media" which traditionally refer to radio, television and print.    Quisumbing said all participants, noting President Ramos'  call on the need for policies within the national programs to  "open up" the economy and achieve the country's competitiveness,  agreed that while the SEC actions can only be appealed to the  Supreme Court, the president has authority to issue policies  binding on the SEC, an agency under the administrative  supervision of the Office of the President.</p>

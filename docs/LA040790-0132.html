			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BELEAGURED CCT OKS UNION WITH SUNWARD TECHNOLOGIES  </P> <P> Throwing in the towel as an independent company after a disastrous five-year  string of bad luck and losses, Computer &amp; Communications Technology Corp.  of San Diego said Friday that it has agreed to merge the publicly held company  with Sunward Technologies, a closely held concern also based in San Diego.  </P> <P> CCT also announced that it expects to report losses totaling $17.3 million for  the 1989 fiscal year on sharply reduced revenue of $61.5 million. That compares  with 1988's loss of $15.9 million on $107.8 million in revenue. For the fourth  quarter alone, the company said, its net loss will come in at $12.4 million on  sales of $17.6 million.  </P> <P> Both Sunward Technologies, which reported revenue last year of about $42.1  million, and CCT manufacture recording heads used in computer disk drives, a  kind of data storage device.  </P> <P> CCT has been awash in red ink for five years. Since the beginning of fiscal  1985, losses totaling $62 million have left it severely weakened. As a result,  CCT is now in technical default of its bank loans. Although the banks have not  waived the defaults, CCT said in a statement Friday that it expects them to  approve the merger.  </P> <P> "The merger will result in increased sales volume and a broader customer base .  . . and with the addition of Sunward's $6.5 million in cash, a significant  strengthening of the combined company's balance sheet," CCT Chairman E. T.  Bahre said in the statement.  </P> <P> The deal calls for Sunward Technologies to assume control of the merged entity,  with its shareholders receiving about 13.5 million in newly issued CCT shares.  That would give them a 55% majority of the 25 million CCT shares that would  then be outstanding, Bahre said.  </P> <P> If shareholders of both companies approve the deal as required, the merger  would be completed by June. Sunward Technologies Chairman Greg Reyes would  assume operational control of the new company, to be called Sunward  Technologies and to remain a publicly held company, Bahre said.  </P> <P> Layoffs of CCT personnel are expected as a result of the merger but Bahre would  not say how many. Once the merger is complete, Bahre will relinquish his  operational role at the company but retain a board seat. In a statement,  Sunward Technologies' Reyes said the merger will allow the company to reduce  costs through consolidation of "administrative functions in one location in San  Diego."  </P> <P> The losses are only part of the CCT hard-luck story. In late 1989, two of its  largest customers, disc drive makers Miniscribe and Priam, declared bankruptcy.  The customers' problems were a prime factor in the drop-off of CCT's revenue  last year. Also, CCT was forced to write down the value of inventory destined  for shipment to the two companies, a contributing factor in the fourth quarter  1989 loss.  </P> <P> Early last year, CCT laid off more than 100 workers at its San Diego facility  and shut down its Tijuana manufacturing plant altogether, laying off 1,600  there.  </P> <P> CCT has also suffered in recent years from severe manufacturing and labor  problems at its South Korea manufacturing plant, said Dennis Waid, president of  Peripheral Research, a Santa Barbara-based market research company. As a  result, CCT has lost customers and seen its share of the $885-million  recording-head market slip drastically, he said.  </P> <P> In 1986, CCT was forced to call off an all-cash sale of its Zeta Laboratories  subsidiary to Whittaker Corp. after Zeta was accused of overcharging the  government on defense contracts.  </P></p>

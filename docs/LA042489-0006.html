			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Marin County's image may be that of steaming hot tubs and youthful hedonists  gamboling in paradise, but over the next decade residents may be thinking more  about Medicare than child care. After the year 2000, the county will have the  oldest population in the state. The graying of Marin will be the focus of  research about the aging process and a Ponce de Leon-like attempt to "arrest  the downside of getting old." According to a report by the county's Agency on  Aging, Marin's population of those 60 and older will increase about 48% by the  turn of the century.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 May (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the  Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli talks aimed at  reaching agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, has said  the two delegations have almost completed drafting the major  part of the agreement. He added that the Israeli withdrawal  from self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho will actually begin the  day of the signing, Wednesday [4 May].    In press statements today, he said the remaining issues  concern some security arrangements in Gaza, the maritime borders  of the self-rule authority in Gaza, and the map of Gaza. He  noted that discussion of these issues will be completed this  evening and that the discussion on legal jurisdiction is almost  over.    Sha'th said the foreign ministers of Egypt, the United  States, and Russia will sign the final agreement in addition to  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin.    He affirmed that the agreement stipulates that the Israeli  withdrawal will be completed within three weeks following the  signing and he noted that the Israeli side has pledged to  complete the withdrawal in two weeks.    He said some Israeli camps will be evacuated Thursday  evening  or Friday morning after the signing and that the withdrawal will  begin the day of the signing.    He said a unit made up of 1,000 Palestinian policemen will  enter Gaza and Jericho Thursday morning and that the remainder  of the force will arrive within three weeks.    This force is comprised of 9,000 personnel, 7,000 of whom  come from outside the occupied territories and 2,000 from inside.    Sha'th said that a Palestinian security delegation led by  Ziyad al-Atrash will arrive in Cairo today. He noted that the  Palestinian police are ready to enter Gaza and Jericho  immediately after the Israeli withdrawal and denied Israeli  claims to the contrary.    As for the Palestinian detainees, the Palestinian official  said that all points concerning the timetable of their release  have been agreed upon. He said that every Palestinian, whether  an individual or member of a Palestinian organization, should be  bound by the agreements and pledges to which the PLO has  committed itself.    Commenting on the meeting of the committee in charge of  detainees, Sha'th said that a meeting was held yesterday evening  with Israeli General Yantof Sameh to draw up the timetable for  the detainees' release.    In another development, sources close to negotiations have  told MENA that the points still under discussion are related to  territorial waters. The Palestinians demand 12 nautical miles,  while the Israelis insist on giving them only three nautical  miles.    As for mapping lands around roads, the Israelis want to set  aside 55 meters on either side of each road that is not to be  disposed of or built on. The Palestinians want this area to be  35 meters on each side.    In another development, it has been learned that some  40-to-50 Palestinian deportees will return to Gaza and Jericho  the day after tomorrow, Wednesday, and that 1,000 detainees will  be released on Thursday, the day after the autonomy agreement is  signed.    It has also been learned that Israel has agreed to give the  Palestinians 20 nautical miles for fishing purposes. The issue  of joint patrols along parallel roads has not been settled yet.</p>

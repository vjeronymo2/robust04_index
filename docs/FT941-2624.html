			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bond weakness sparks equity sell-off - Market Report A trading session fraught with tension and surrounded by speculation of an imminent further tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve saw London's equity market, under the lead of a struggling gilt-edged market, fall sharply before staging a good rally towards the close of trading. The situation was further confused by stories of a potential military confrontation in Korea. Adding to the general unease surrounding the UK market was the 'double witching hour' or expiry of index option futures and the FT-SE index future in mid-morning, traditionally an event which triggers exaggerated movements in underlying stock prices. When the dust settled, however, and helped by a resilient showing by US bonds and equities, the FT-SE 100 index had recovered to close a net 37.6 lower on the session at 3,218.1. The Mid 250 index fell 21.0 to 3,865.6. And, as senior traders were quick to point out, the 100 index finished a volatile week a remarkable 26.2 higher, thanks mainly to the 75 points jump in the index on Monday and Tuesday when bond markets were indulging in a strong recovery process and the UK market was being driven higher by a flurry of excellent corporate results. The early scene in equities was one of unmitigated gloom, with gilts sharply lower, ahead of expected news of another gilts auction. Long gilts fell further as the morning wore on, dragging equities down with them, as the market picked up the stories of potential trouble in Korea and began to react to a series of rumours about Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve. The most extreme of these was that Mr Greenspan was about to resign and another was that he had cancelled a trip to Dallas, Texas, where he was about to address a conference, and had been called to the White House to brief President Clinton on another increase in the Federal Discount Rate next week. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Council Meeting, to discuss monetary policy, is scheduled for Tuesday. These rumours, which drove long gilts down by 1 3/4 at worst, and were accompanied by the expiry of the March index options and the FT-SE future, sent the equity market into a tailspin, which saw the 100 index dip below 3,200 and reach a session low of 3,197.7. Thereafter markets embarked on a good recovery, as the Korean stories foundered and US bonds and German bunds began to stabilise. News of the innovative auction of a floating rate gilt, with details on price and size expected next week, took the edge off losses in UK gilts. Senior marketmakers said the equity market had taken fright at the prospect of another rise in US interest rates but that there had been little in the way of heavy selling pressure as the stories circulated in the market. 'It has to be said that there was little in the way of genuine customer business either way today,' said one trader. Turnover yesterday reached 609.4m shares, below levels seen earlier this week and well down on the 1bn-plus levels seen previously this year. Next week brings more crucial economic numbers from both sides of the Atlantic. UK economists will focus on Wednesday's retail price index details for February, while in the US the FOMC meeting and auctions of two-year and five-year bonds will capture the headlines.</p>

The denial notice was signed on February 24, 1994, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11326).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The union states that the workers should be certified since Olympic had reduced business from kitchen appliance manufacturing customers who took their production overseas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigation findings show that Olympic Plating is an independent contractor which performs plating services on components (stove tops, etc.) for kitchen appliance manufacturing customers. The findings show that Olympic Plating did not own the components to be plated but only performed plating services on them. Olympic Plating was independent of its customers and there was no corporate relationship between Olympic Plating and its customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's denial was based on the fact that the workers do not produce an article within the meaning of the Trade Act, as amended. The Department has consistently determined that the performance of services does not constitute the production of an article and this determination has been upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the plating services performed by Olympic Plating cannot be considered the production of an article.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The worker adjustment assistance program was not intended to provide TAA to workers who are in some way related to import competition but only for those workers who produce an article and are adversely affected by increased imports of like or directly competitive articles which contributed importantly to sales or production and employment declines at the workers' firm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, DC., this 23rd day of March, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen A.

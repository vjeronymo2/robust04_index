			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(C) requires that for each crocodilian skin the importer or exporter shall provide a copy of each CITES permit or certificate or identify the CITES permit/certificate number from the country of origin and each country of re-export on the permit or on a separate sheet. The transaction history will assist in verifying that the skins have moved through countries meeting the criteria of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii). Such information is now available only through the time-consuming process of querying each country in turn to trace its document files to determine the underlying importation record for any CITES document it has issued. Since commercial traders of skins and products record and reflect the country of origin for all shipments at present and will have to keep track of skin tag numbers under the CITES resolution, this provision simply requires that the sellers track the CITES certificate numbers or transmit copies of these documents from their buyers. This provision is in keeping with the Animals Committee resolutions calling on re-exporting countries to implement an administrative system for the effective matching of imports and re-exports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(D) requires that the country of origin and the countries of re-export be in compliance with the criteria of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A)&hyph;(iii)(F) and provides that countries meeting these criteria will be named in a Notice of Information published by the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii) sets forth the conditions for import, export, and re-export of crocodilian products. While it has frequently been suggested that the only absolutely reliable method for ``cradle to grave'' or ``harvest to consumer'' control is individual product tagging, the Service is not proposing such measures at this time. If the skin tagging inspection programs and criteria for evaluating whether party countries are implementing CITES responsibly are followed, and inventory controls are conscientiously implemented by the re-exporting country government and/or private sector, the Service hopes that more stringent measures for manufactured products will not be necessary to control commingling of illegal crocodilians.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii)(A) requires that for each crocodilian product the importer or exporter shall provide a copy of each CITES permit or certificate or identify the CITES permit/certificate number from the country of origin and each country of re-export of the skins included in the product, except that such importation history does not need to be provided for any portions of a product which is 9 square inches or smaller. This provision is similar to the provision for skins in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C), except that this provision exempts small pieces of skin from the importation history requirement. The exception for pieces 9 square inches or smaller will permit items generally made from scraps, such as watch bands, pieced belts, or trim, to be exempt from the importation history requirement. It must be emphasized, however, that manufacturers still must accurately identify all species of wildlife contained in any importation. Since many violations have been detected with the misuse of crocodilian skins on the gussets of handbags or trim on shoes, manufacturers are still urged to maintain vigilance over their inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii)(B) requires that the country of origin and the countries of re-export be in compliance with the criteria in subparagraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A)&hyph;(F) and provides that countries meeting these criteria will be named in a Notice of Information published by the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service believes that to achieve a reliable system for the manufacture of crocodilian products from lawful skins and to be able to accurately identify what crocodilian the product was produced from, there must be effective CITES implementation by the party countries, including rigorous inspection of the tagged skins at each international transaction and removal from commerce of any skins not bearing an intact tag from the country of origin, and requirements for manufacturers who receive the tagged skins (regardless of the number of intermediaries the skins have passed through) to maintain sufficient internal production controls over their inventory so they can account for the quantity of items they produce from each tagged skin. Paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(F)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )&hyph;(F)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) set forth such criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

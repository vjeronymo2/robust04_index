			<p>BFN     [Text] The Press Bureau of the Romanian Army has faxed us  a communique in which the Army comments on certain information  that appeared in the press regarding allegations that trains  with military signs carrying Russian tanks and troops have  transited Romania. The Press Office of the Armed Forces  mentions that the information issued by the A.M. Press, quoting  National Railway Company information, does not correspond to  reality. Romania was not asked and consequently did not agree  to the transit of military trains belonging to the Russian  Federation across its territory, the Press Bureau of the Army  states.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Gross domestic product figures for western Germany (due tomorrow) are unlikely to cheer the bund market. The consensus is that GDP will grow by 0.5 per cent on the fourth quarter of last year, suggesting the economy is well and truly on the recovery track. The year-on-year growth would be 1.5 per cent. The stronger the economy, the greater the fear that the Bundesbank will respond to the inflationary threat with a tightening of monetary policy. This scenario may seem unlikely to domestic observers who believe short-term interest rates will fall further. But foreign investors, who have been disconcerted by Germany's ballooning money supply and whose selling has inspired the sharp rise in bund yields in recent months, may seize upon the GDP figures as another excuse for selling. April's retail figures, on the other hand, may encourage the market: they are expected to be sharply down from March. This may be due to seasonal factors but will underscore that the German recovery is export-led and not driven by domestic growth. The Bundesbank policy-making council meets on Thursday. No rate cut is expected but the market will study statements by council members before or after the meeting for evidence of disagreements on how to deal with money supply growth.</p>

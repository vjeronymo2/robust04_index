			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] We continue to receive reports of death and injury  in Tajikistan, as well as attempts by armed guerrillas to force  their way into the Republic from Afghanistan. Our correspondent  will tell you in more detail about the situation there:    [Reporter Mikhail Nikulin in Tajikistan -- identified by  caption] It was right here, on the so-called Pyanj sector, that  a massive offensive by armed detachments of the Tajik opposition  was supposed to take place on the eve of the inter-Tajik talks  in Tehran. According to reports from military intelligence,  such a decision was taken at a meeting of field commanders of  several formations based in northern Afghanistan. Russian  border guards, together with the command of the collective  peacekeeping forces, have taken additional measures to  strengthen this section of the border.    [V. Novikov, chief of staff of Russian border guards in  Tajikistan -- identified by caption] We can now say that those  strategic schemes, which the enemy and the opposition were  hatching, have effectively been thwarted. We can see that the  situation here is stabilizing. But, on literally every  centimeter of the border, you can still sense that it is  explosive, ready to explode at any moment.    [Nikulin] But this temporary lull prevails only on this  section of the 1,200 km border. Elsewhere [pauses]    [Novikov, interrupting] Shelling is continuing, attacks are  continuing, provocations of various kinds are continuing.    [Nikulin] During the first 20 days of June alone there have  already been over 10 armed provocations on the border, as a  result of which the opposition lost over 15 militants.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Minsk is not ready for a monetary union with Russia  because of uncertainties in government policies following the  country's presidential elections, a senior official of the  National Bank of Belarus (NBB) told INTERFAX on condition of  anonymity.    He said none of the government agencies including the  government, Finance Ministry, or NBB were making preparations  for the union. Even the draft of an appropriate banking  agreement is still pending discussion by experts, he said.    The official went on to say that for the time being, talks  were under way between officials of the NBB and Central Bank of  Russia to discuss the creation of a payment union on the basis  of the two countries' currencies. (The appropriate draft was  sent to Belarus last month).    The official said NBB President Stanislau Bagdankevich was  still opposed to the endorsement of the agreement's Chapter 5,  which provides for the abolition of the NBB. Nor does  Bagdankevich accept the idea of a single budget or financing the  country's deficit at the cost of credits from Russia's Finance  Ministry.    Head of the Belarussian finance ministry's budget department  Ivan Zayash in an interview with INTERFAX ruled out any monetary  union as it was originally conceived by the April agreement by 1  July on the grounds that some of its provisions had not been met  yet. The two countries are still to decide how to unify their  cash and non-cash resources and at what rate as well as how  their budgets would function following the unification. More  importantly, Moscow has so far granted only 10 billion rubles  out of its promised 500 billion rubles credit to Belarus. It  has now reaffirmed sending a further 50 billion rubles.</p>

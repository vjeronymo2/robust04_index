As seen by EPICentre's analysts, Russia's reforms have  passed  through three stages:    Stage I: January-May 1992, "Advance"    Stage II: June-December 1992, "Retreat"    Stage III: 1993, "Redeployment and New Advance"    Changes in the economic policy commenced at the close of  1992  and took final shape by the spring of 1993. December 1992  witnessed the formation of a government headed by Viktor  Chernomyrdin. It was not so closeknit as the government of the  second stage, but proved more capable of pursuing a purposeful  economic policy.    In January it was announced that struggle against inflation  was the key priority of the government's policy, its purpose  being to lower the rate of inflation to 5 percent a month by the  end of the year. For a number of reasons it became impossible to  reach this aim despite a slowdown in the rate of inflation by  the close of 1993.    From the beginning of the year payments from the budget were  carried out with delays, which in the conditions of high  inflation was tantamount to their reduction in real terms. In  the third quarter, as declared by (Minister of Finance) Boris  Fedorov, the deficit of the budget stood at 8.6 trillion rubles.  For the results of the first nine months the total deficit of  the budget almost reached a size approved by the president for  the year.    In this situation a budgetary war broke out between the  Ministry of Finance and the parliament which passed a law  establishing the deficit at the level of 22.4 trillion rubles  (15 percent of the GNP). The president returned it to parliament  with a proposal to cut it to 13.5 trillion (9 percent of the  GNP).    The parliament accepted those amendments which did not lead  to a sharp reduction of expenditures, so the president said that  he would not sign this kind of budget. The situation kept  "hanging" in this state until September 21.    Official data on the Central Bank's credits to commercial  banks vary, yet the tendency is clear: in the course of nine  months the government and the Central Bank of Russia managed to  secure a persistent and appreciable (on an average monthly  basis) deceleration in the growth rates of centralized credit  emission.    Moreover, noninflationary sources for financing the deficit  of the budget, above all foreign credits, were found and put to  successful use. There were two reasons explaining why in the  pursuit of this policy it became impossible to check the growth  of the money mass: the reduction of the surplus cash reserves of  the economic subjects and the acceleration of money circulation.    The credit emission of commercial banks, which compensated  the reduction of centralized credits, markedly intensified in  1993. Moreover, in the structure of the money mass in 1992-1993  there was a sharp growth in its most liquid part -- the funds on  the bank accounts of enterprises and ready money (which, among  other things, bears witness to a strengthening in the positions  of the economy's shadow sector evading taxes and not mirrored in  statistics).    Serious changes have occurred in Russia's foreign trade. In  1993 the volume of export nearly doubled that of import.  However, a positive balance was reached on account of the fact  that there was a considerable reduction of import attended by a  slight growth of export. Moreover, the increase in the physical  volumes of export takes place in the conditions of a fall in the  production of export goods inside the country.    During the first seven months of 1993 the funds of  enterprises on foreign currency accounts in Russia increased by  a mere 0.8 billion dollars (to reach 7.5 billion dollars by the  end of August) whereas the funds legally lodged on short-term  deposits in commercial banks abroad increased by ten billion  dollars and by the end of the year (as estimated) had to reach  the sum of about 20 billion.    During two years -- from October 29, 1991, to October 29,  1993 -- the real rate of the dollar in Russia (related to the  index of consumer prices) fell 16.4-fold. "Dollar inflation"  became strongly pronounced especially beginning with July 1993  in connection with the artificial stabilization of the nominal  rate of the dollar to the ruble.    As a result many Russian sectors have proved to be  noncompetitive on the domestic market (motor-car construction,  radioelectronics), and the government has recourse of protection  measures relative to the tariff regulation of the import of  similar goods. On the other hand, the importers' earnings are  being depreciated. Russia has got caught in serious dependence  on credits from international financial organizations on whose  account this rate is being maintained.    Russia is a country of unfinished system reforms. In  industry  there has been a virtual collectivization of property at  enterprises in the past two years whereas in agriculture the  movement of private peasant farmers has not yet risen to its  feet.    In these two past years industrial output has fallen by a  third, yet the slump was not structural but general in  character. The toughening of the monetary policy has taken place  on account of depressing the demand for investments.    Labor productivity keeps sharply falling in connection with  the impossibility of dismissing workers (a consequence of  collective ownership). This generated additional pressure from  the inflation of costs and amounts to a corollary of the  government's formal approach towards reforms.</p>

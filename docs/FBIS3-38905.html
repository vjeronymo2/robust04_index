He added that when he refers to Varosha he means the  entire fenced-off area, which will be opened up in two phases:  The first phase will begin two months after the package is  approved and the second at a date to be agreed upon later.    Speaking at the Larnaca Rotary Club last night, Feissel said  the financing of Varosha's reconstruction and the travel  documents that Turkish Cypriots will use are two issues that are  still pending and the two leaders will need to decide on this.    [Nicosia CYPRUS NEWS AGENCY in English at 0916 on 9 February  carries a Larnaca-datelined report on Gustave Feissel's 8  February speech to the Larnaca Rotary Club, which adds the  following: "After outlining the CBM's, Feissel explained that  the advantage with the reopening of Varosha is that its  inhabitants and property owners will be able to return. It will  also increase tourism capacity on the Greek Cypriot side by  about 15 per cent of what it is now and will provide a  `significant stimulus' through what is envisaged would be at  least one billion dollars worth of investment in order to bring  back the area into a reconstructive form.    ["For the Turkish Cypriots, he said, the benefits will be  jobs and the opportunities for services during the  reconstruction phase during both the opening of Varosha and the  NIA, Nicosia International Airport. `It is estimated that this  process could generate as much as 9,000 jobs, of which both  sides would benefit,' Feissel said.    ["He also said the tourism industry in the Turkish occupied  areas, which is less than one tenth of that of the Greek Cypriot  side, will open up as there will be direct airlinks to all  destinations."    [CNA adds: "Responding to questions, the U.N. envoy said the  reports of the U.N. teams of experts on the package serve only  to `shed light.'"    [CNA continues: "Asked with what papers the Turkish Cypriots  will travel abroad, Feissel said the Turkish Cypriots already  travel to the United Kingdom and the United States 'by using a  piece of paper which is given to them by the British and  American embassies' and which substitutes for passports. There  are ways of doing things without creating difficulties for  either side," Feissel said.]    The international community believes that implementation of  the CBM's will open the road for talks on an overall Cyprus  solution. This is the conclusion we draw from statements by the  ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members in  Nicosia on the "Enlargements" program. U.S. Ambassador Richard  Boucher reiterated that the measures are a unique opportunity  for the two communities to cooperate in a way that has been  impossible for the past 20 years. He said that people who focus  more on benefits for the other side than on the prospects that  are being created are the ones impeding the CBM's.    Russian Ambassador Boris Zenkov described the current phase  of the Cyprus issue as very critical. He said the CBM's will  help keep the Cyprus issue alive, adding that the entire issue  will be lost if they are rejected.    British High Commissioner David Dain said he considers the  measures as a way to overcome the current status quo and create  a new atmosphere of cooperation toward an overall Cyprus  solution.    French Ambassador Gerard Pavret de la Rochefordiere said  Cyprus' current division is unacceptable and should end as soon  as possible. He added that the CBM's are a catalyst that will  facilitate discussion on the substance of the set of ideas that  will follow.    Chinese Ambassador Chen Zhenyou said he was satisfied  because  both sides accepted the CBM's in principle and expressed  readiness to examine ways for its implementation.    Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said the CBM's  philosophy is to create some activity and utilize it to discuss  the substance of the Cyprus issue. He added that the measures  are neither an overall Cyprus solution nor a partial one, but  they offer possibilities to Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots  to meet and communicate, thus proving unfounded Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas' argument that there is lack of confidence.  Mikhailidhis said that talks on the substance of the Cyprus  issue will begin as soon as an agreement on the CBM's is reached  and they begin to be implemented.    Speaking at the same program, Mikhailidhis said that if an  agreement is reached on the CBM's, the road to the European  Union will open up because it will be persuaded to set a date  for the beginning of accession negotiations. He said: If  efforts fail due to Turkish rejection, the UN Security Council  will be asked to find alternative procedures. Therefore, during  the entire course of the talks the Greek Cypriot side must be  consistent and persuasive.    Asked whether he is optimistic about the outcome of the  talks, Mikhailidhis said that unfortunately there is no  indication that the Turkish side has changed its stance.</p>

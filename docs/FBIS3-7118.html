Kim and the South Korean first lady, who wore  a pastel-yellow chima chogori traditional Korean dress, shook  hands and exchanged courtesies with the Emperor Akihito and  Empress Michiko in the hall of the Akasaka Palace.    Students waiting in front of the Akasaka Palace waved small  South Korean and Japanese flags when Kim and his wife Son  Myong-sun emerged together with the imperial couple. Kim, who  was given a full-fledged military welcome attended by most  cabinet members and heads of both houses of the Diet, looked  tense during the ceremony despite an occasional smile.    After being saluted by honor guards and listening to the  South Korean and Japanese anthems, Kim and his wife were greeted  by Crown Prince Naruhito, Crown Princess Masako, Princess Nori  and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Following Kim's pacing off the honor guards under a partly  cloudy sky and a short encounter with attending politicians, the  presidential couple left for an audience with the emperor and  empress at the Imperial Palace.    Ways to avert an open confrontation over North Korea's  alleged nuclear program are the main focus of Kim's talks in  Japan and with Chinese leaders later.    He told Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who welcomed the  president at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, that "Russia's cooperation  is necessary" to solve the dispute stemming from North Korea's  refusal of full inspections of its nuclear facilities.    In response Hata, who returned from talks in Russia on  Monday, told Kim that Moscow seems to be dissatisfied with  Pyongyang's reactions, Japanese officials said.    North Korea says its nuclear program is strictly  nonmilitary.    On Wednesday, Kim put South Korea's 650,000-strong army  under  special alert after North Korea warned that Washington's  decision to dispatch six Patriot antimissile batteries to the  south will push the Korean peninsula "to the brink of war."    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, originally scheduled to  accompany Kim, withdrew from the traveling party on short notice  Wednesday probably due to the increasingly tense situation on  the Korean peninsula.    Kim's Japan visit will be directly followed by a five-day  state visit to China, starting Saturday afternoon.    In a departure ceremony at Seoul airport Thursday, Kim said  he will try to obtain support from Japan and China to resolve  the nuclear issue and bring North Korea around to reform and  openness.    "I will explain to the two leaders of Japan and China that  preserving reconciliation and peace on the Korean peninsula is  important to ensuring stability and prosperity in the  Asia-Pacific region as well as in Northeast Asia," Kim said.    He said North Korea had created confrontation on the Korean  peninsula by failing to allow unhindered inspections of its  nuclear facilities and make progress in inter-Korean dialogue.  "While keeping the channel of dialogue open, South Korea, with  the firm security commitment of the United States, is also fully  determined to fight against any possible provocation by North  Korea," he said.</p>

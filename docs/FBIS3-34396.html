			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhal Sela'] </F>   [Excerpts] The list of groups acting against the  Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement -- mainly out in the streets  and against any peace agreement between Israel and its neighbors  -- is bound to be very long. A notice announcing the  establishment of a new, a hitherto unheard of group is daily  placed in our mailboxes. Whatever their number, they represent  an achievement scored by the settler lobby unified under the  roof of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria,  and Gaza, or in short -- the YESHA' [acronym for Judaea,  Samaria, Gaza] Council. [passage omitted]    The emergence of the various protest groups can be credited  to a few enthusiasts from settlements, from Jerusalem, and from  other locations throughout the country. The YESHA' Council is  ostensibly uninvolved in their establishment, which is presented  as a personal initiative motivated by anxiety for democracy and  the Israeli nation's well-being. In practice, most groups are  in one way or another linked to the YESHA' Council, which  assists them in every way, including lobbying, telephone and fax  facilities, and even through the services of their spokesmen.  [passage omitted]    One of the most veteran organizations is the Action  Committee  for the Annulment of the Autonomy Plan, which is inspired by  Elyaqim Ha'etzni. Ha'etzni explains that the somewhat obsolete  name is due to the fact that the body was established back in  the days when autonomy, and not self-rule, was on the agenda.  "Later we were visited by this catastrophe, the new government,  and today our main job is to try and save Eretz Yisra'el."    In brochures and flyers, Ha'etzni calls for civil mutiny.  "Do not play according to the rules!" says his introduction to  a leaflet, which is rife with quotations from Moshe Hanegbi,  'Amos 'Oz, and Thomas Jefferson in support of illegal action for  the sake of liberty. In Ha'etzni's understanding, the  implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Judaea and Samaria is  a violation of that liberty. "Signing such an agreement and  sacrificing us all on the false altar of peace is an illegal  act."    His leaflet speaks of "the insane government" "which  endangers the life of every Jew from Holon to Hebron," whose  leaders are as good as prostitutes.    Ha'etzni encloses a questionnaire to the leaflet asking the  reader to fill it out and send back to the action committee.  This is what the form says: "I, the undersigned, will not  carry out a plainly illegal order. I will not uproot  settlements." Ha'etzni does what Yesh Gvul [organization  supporting soldiers' refusal to serve in territories] never  dared: He openly calls on citizens to violate laws and disobey  orders.    In the propaganda material he disseminates Ha'etzni explains  how important it is to be arrested. "The stick of detention  should not scare anyone," Ha'etzni told DAVAR. "We ought to  take the Palestinians' place in prisons. When thousands of Jews  are in jail, the government will fall."    Another body in the midst of hectic activity is This Is Our  Land [Zo Artzeynu], the group which initiated the Hamakhpil  [doubling] operation that aims to establish new  quasi-settlements in the vicinity of existing ones independently  and demonstratively, in full knowledge that the operation is  illegal. The operation organizers have two addresses: Ginot  Shomron and the state of New York, the United States. [passage  omitted]    At first the YESHA' Council subscribed to the concept that  new settlements should be established and the existing ones  expanded without consulting the authorities. At some point,  however, heads of the YESHA' local and regional councils  concluded that the idea may elicit negative public reactions,  and they decided to pull out. Today the YESHA' Council's  official stand on this matter is that they are not partners in  the endeavor, but will not take action against it. When  necessary, they provide assistance, providing telephone services  and any other required logistic facilities.    In the wake of this week's arrests, the YESHA' Council  issued  a public statement protesting the police commissioner's  announcement about the plan to set up detention camps for  settlers and criticizing the government "which releases  Palestinian terrorists at the same time detaining good Jews."  One of the publications of This Is Our Land notes that the  organization supports the women's group headed by Rut Matar.    Women for the Sake of Tomorrow [Nashim Lema'an Hamahar],  Matar's organization, also opposes the peace process and does  not mince words describing its objection to the government's  peace plan. "Peres and 'Arafat have reached an agreement in  Switzerland, in other words: The terrorist Palestinian state is  in the making," their press communique says, urging reporters to  come and cover their rally near the Jerusalem-Jericho road in  Ma'ale Adumim last Tuesday. "This road will be the main road  from Jerusalem to the terrorist state. Any Jew daring to take  this road will be jeopardizing his life," the statement adds.  [passage omitted]    This week we received propaganda material from the Public  Committee for the Protection of Ma'ale Adumim. This week, a  hostile rally welcomed Police Minister Moshe Shahal as he  arrived to inaugurate the first Civil Guard station in the  territories. "In Jericho the government plans to arm 3,000  terrorists, and in Ma'ale Adumim it establishes a Civil Guard  station with 30 soldiers," their leaflet states. There are no  soldiers in the Civil Guard, only civilians. "The Ma'ale Adumim  kindergartens are against the Gaza and Jericho agreement," says  another leaflet. One activist with the group believes the  possibility of handing Judaea and Samaria over to Palestinian  rule undemocratic. "A free regime has no right to uproot a  settlement and assail citizens rights, even if they are an  unpopular minority."    The group works in coordination with, and is sometimes  financed by the YESHA' Council, and is closely associated with  This Is Our Land.    Newspapers occasionally carry advertisements placed by  various groups denouncing the government's peace plan, and each  of these groups is confident that its way is the right one:  Professors for Political and Economic Strength; Army officers  join forces in the Awakening and National Strength Forum. The  executive committee of the Knesset opposition came out with the  slogan -- the Eretz Yisra'el Front, while the Endeavor  [Ma'amatz] Action Committee, headed by Ya'aqov Novik and Ya'aqov  Sternberg invests daily efforts and complicated logistics in  organizing rallies, transportation, and other necessary steps.  Their activities are centered mainly in Jerusalem.    Bney 'Aqiva [youth movement affiliated with the National  Religious Party], and the 'Ezra and Habad movements are willing  to supply anyone with masses of youths for rallies, sometimes  for the purpose of collecting donations.    The activity is initiated by West Bank settlers and  Jerusalem-based activists ideologically related to the tenets of  Gush Emunim. Their primary goal is to foil the peace agreement  with the Palestinians. The protest activities against  withdrawal from the Golan Heights have become a part of the  greater drive, and today it is sometimes difficult to tell the  issues apart. This did not happen by accident. The first  stimulus for demonstrating against withdrawal from the Golan  Heights came from West Bank settlers, who organized and prodded  the Golan activists to rally against the peace agreement. In  these groups, activists speak in the same breath of the West  Bank and the Golan Heights, brewing a sentimental concoction of  arguments about the nature of Israel's ties and problems with  the Palestinians on the one hand and with Syria on the other.    Others view the Golan Heights as a separate issue while  emphasizing that they do not oppose the government policy, that  they are only against giving up the Golan.    The slogan "People With the Golan" pasted on thousands of  verandas was the work of the Golan Action Committees [Matot  Hagolan]. A prominent activist based in Jerusalem, a sort of an  aficionado, says that since the movement is scattered throughout  the country, all the work in done by volunteers and with modest  donations, "because the problem is not just of the Golan  settlers. The entire nation should decide this vital issue of  the Golan. There is no right or left in this matter."    Setting up signing-up stands throughout the country,  activists expand their enterprise by enlisting new activists.  They claim to be unrelated to the YESHA' Council or the Golan  Settlement Committee headed by Eli Malka.    In all these fields, the YESHA' Council operates behind the  scenes. On the one hand, its activists are pleased with the  voluntary operations conducted in various locations. Their work  is done by others. On the other hand, it does not want to lose  control. For that reason, it has established a superstructure  named the Joint Action Committee [Hamate Hameshutaf]. A Tel  Aviv office organizing rallies throughout the country is  financed by YESHA', according to the secretary who took our  phone call. Meetings at which short- and long-term activities  are coordinated are held periodically at the council offices.  All the groups receive assistance from the YESHA' Council:  telephone and fax facilities, spokesman's services, and  probably funds too.    As if the number of organizations and names was  insufficient,  they established One Israel [Yisra'el Ahat], a body defined as  the operational headquarters of the Joint Action Committee. It  is headed by Moshe Merhavya, a resident of 'Eli who had worked  for Minister Ari'el Sharon at the Construction and Housing  Ministry and is credited with having obtained the authorities'  approval for so many new houses in the settlement of 'Eli in  recent years.    Yesterday's demonstration in the ancient synagogue of  Jericho, for instance, had been planned in Knesset Member [MK]  Hanan Porat's office at the Knesset last week. The meeting was  attended by Uri Ari'el, chairman of the YESHA' Council, by Moshe  Merhavya, and a representative of the Endeavor Action Committee.  People want to stand by MK Porat's side and show the Jericho  synagogue students that they are not being abandoned, YESHA'  Council members said and proceeded to help print notices about  transportation to the rally.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Era's end in Beijing How Messers Boris Yeltsin and Victor Chernomyrdin must envy the Chinese their annual rate of inflation of 27 per cent. Nevertheless, this rise in Chinese prices is important, not just for its direct effects, but also for what it reveals about the fissures within Chinese politics. With people positioning themselves for life after Deng Xiaoping, these are unlikely to be closed. This is the disturbing message from this year's FT survey of China, published today. Mr Deng's stroke of genius was to approach the collapsing state-socialist economy just as invaders used to treat China's Great Wall. He went round it. The results may not be quite as stellar as official figures suggest, but the country has made more economic progress in a decade and a half than in centuries. The government, albeit corrupt and dictatorial, has provided reasonable political stability, while encouraging economic initiative. The consequences have been astounding. Big problems remain, however, partly because reform has been so carefully circumscribed. As competition has become stronger, swathes of the old economy are failing to compete. More than 40 per cent of the older state enterprises, which still generate close to half of industrial output, are making losses this year. Yet 1994 is far from a year of recession, notwithstanding hitherto unsuccessful efforts to curb inflation. On the contrary, the economy is expected to grow by 11 per cent. Relations between Beijing and local government is the other big challenge to reformers. As the economy has expanded, particularly along the coast, Beijing has found it increasingly difficult either to obtain the revenue it needs or to control spending, particularly on investment. Its solution has been the printing press. Direct and indirect borrowing from the central bank has been equal to about a third of total budgetary revenues in recent years. In consequence, the ratio of broad money to national income has climbed to over 100 per cent. This monetary time-bomb threatens grave economic and political damage. China cannot afford a flight from money. What is needed is a push for effective reform of the fiscal system, social welfare (still largely provided by state enterprises), finance and the central bank itself. Reformers know very well what is needed. But recently progress has become decidedly slow. So great is the release of energy in China that continued rapid economic progress remains the most likely outcome. In the absence of Deng's authority, however, bitter struggles for power are likely to emerge within Beijing, between it and the provinces, and between competitive and less competitive parts of the economy. Outsiders are largely spectators. But they can encourage China to play a responsible part in international arrangements. The country should, for example, be helped into the new World Trade Organisation, in return for a commitment to further liberalisation. In the longer term, only the emergence of a prosperous middle-class in an open economy is likely to produce a China with which the world can be comfortable.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers held a regular meeting  today under Acting Prime Minister brother Dr. Muhammad Sa'id  al-'Attar. The Council listened to a report by Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah on the latest political developments in  Yemen and the preparations under way for receiving brother  Lakhdar Ibrahimi, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  envoy.    The Council also listened to a report presented by Interior  Minister brother Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil on the  stable security situation throughout the governorates of the  republic, especially in the southern and eastern governorates.    The Council was briefed by brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman  'Abd-al-Qadir Bafadal, minister of supply and trade, on the  stable supply situation throughout the governorates of the  republic.    The Council noted with great appreciation and pride the  stands of our people in all governorates, especially in the  southern and eastern governorates, and their support for the  forces of the constitutional legitimacy and their unparalleled  cooperation to defeat the secessionist scheme, which sought to  fragment the country and harm a great historic achievement that  the Yemeni masses looked forward to throughout the ages,  represented by the reunification of the homeland on 22 May 1990.    The Council was briefed by the Defense Ministry on the  military situation. In this regard, the Council praised the  great efforts being exerted by the Armed Forces and security  personnel to maintain our people's gains and national unity,  consolidate security and stability, and thwart the intentions of  those dreaming of harming Yemen's most sacred gain.    Meanwhile, the Council noted its extreme regret for certain  states' statements, which reflect unprincipled stands on what is  going on in our country. The Council hoped that these states  will reconsider their stands in a manner that proves that they  are really interested in preserving Yemeni blood and  discouraging the secessionist rebels in order to safeguard  Yemen's national, legitimate right to reinforce its unity and  ensure its and its neighbors' security and stability. The  Council reiterated that Yemeni unity is not only a national  Yemeni gain, but also an Arab gain which had been wholeheartedly  aspired to by all Arab masses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 16 May (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic today received Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian  president's special envoy, who arrived in Belgrade late last  night. Churkin informed Milosevic about the results of the  recent ministerial talks in Geneva on the resolution of the  conflict in the Balkans.    After the talks with Milosevic, which lasted for 90 minutes,  Churkin said in a statement to reporters that he has come to  Belgrade after a very important ministerial meeting in Geneva,  "where we set the framework for what is -- I hope -- the  completion of the process to resolve the conflict in Bosnia."    Churkin said that the participants of the Geneva talks are  in  contact "with all sides" to explain the possible effects and the  essence of the decisions taken in Geneva. In that context he  recalled that he has already held talks with Bosnian Muslim  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, but did not specify what  response he received from him. He did, however, stress that  "President Milosevic and Belgrade fully support the Geneva  decisions on the ending of hostilities in Bosnia."    What after Geneva? The Russian envoy said that he will  recommend to Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special  envoy for Yugoslavia, that talks be arranged between the parties  to the Bosnian conflict as soon as possible to try to achieve at  least one target of the Geneva agreement-- an end to hostilities.</p>

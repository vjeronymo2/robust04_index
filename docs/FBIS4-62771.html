			<p>BFN     [Text] The launch of the spacecraft Soyuz TM-19 scheduled  for June 20 1994 is likely to be postponed, the press service of  the Flight Control Center in Kaliningrad, Moscow region, told  Interfax. Soyuz was to deliver a new crew, Yuriy Malenchenko and  Talgat Musabayev, to the orbit station Mir.    Commenting on the statement, the head of the manned flights  and carriers department of the Russian Space Agency, Mikhail  Sinelschikov, told Interfax that "an official decision had not  yet been made, but the postponement may be caused by production  problems concerning the manufacturing of a shield for Soyuz  TM-19."    According to unofficial sources, the launch will take place  no earlier than July 20 1994.    Malenchenko and Musabayev will work on the manned orbit  complex Mir for 135 days as the main crew of the 16th  expedition. Astronauts Valeriy Polyakov, Viktor Afanasyev, and  Yuriy Usachev have been on the orbit since January 10. On the  whole, they will stay there for 179 days, while Polyakov will  stay even longer -- 429 days.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Rabin Bent on Escalation"] </F>   [Text] Some Israeli circles insist on fabricating a crisis  over the Palestinian president's statements despite the calm  positive clarification he made.    As the saying goes, "anyone who thinks that a leopard can  change his spots is mistaken." Anyone who imagines that Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin would willingly agree to a  comprehensive peace without receiving the price in the form of  applause by the Israeli political hawks, is mistaken.    Rabin yesterday again sought escalation despite Yasir  'Arafat's clarification of what he meant by the call for jihad  for Jerusalem. Rabin refused to tone down the false fury,  perhaps because he wanted to make the maximum gain of cheap  popularity in the hawks camp which is basically opposed to any  just peace.    There is no need to recall that Rabin's past positions on  such issues as security and the intifadah were closer to the  Likud's position than they were to several of his colleagues in  the cabinet he now heads, but it is necessary and proper to say  a few frank words on the matter.    The Palestinian president may have underestimated the  dimensions of the deliberate "political interpretation" of the  word jihad in the Western media but he has on all occasions  demonstrated full practical commitment to the agreements he  signed.    Furthermore, the place where the statement causing the  crisis  was made was not a place in an area of charged religious  sentiments, to warrant its interpretation as an instigative  statement.    The parties really interested in defending the peace  process,  be they Arab, American, or Israeli, have refused to dwell on  that fabricated issue, preferring instead to enhance the process  by reaffirming the principle of withdrawal, guarantee of  security, and clear understanding on future steps toward a just  and comprehensive peace.    These parties with positive intentions are aware of the  danger of playing with fire for "local consumption" particularly  at a time of major blessed Islamic occasions. It would be  better for those trying to eschew the phased withdrawal process  and the move toward full withdrawal to abandon their dangerous  adventure because the alternative would be a return to the  bloody option which would spare nobody.</p>

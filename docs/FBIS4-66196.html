			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Wen (0491 2429) and Zhang Xuhong (1728 2485 </F> 1347) of the Market and Price Control Department under the State  Planning Commission: "Review and Forecast of Market Price  Regulation for 1993-1994"]    [Text] In 1993, the people throughout the country had  earnestly implemented the guideline laid down by the 14th  National CPC Congress and Comrade Xiaoping's instruction of  "seizing the opportunity to accelerate the development"; and  quickened their tempo in promoting economic development. The  national economy continued to grow on the basis of its 1992  development. At the same time, the various problems which had  cropped up when the old system was being replaced by the new and  the economy was rapidly developing also became more outstanding.  People began to feel the potential pressure from inflation. From  the second half of 1993, the party central committee and the  State Council started to rectify the financial order and  strengthen the macro-control. After several months, the national  economy has begun to stabilize, and the prices on the market  have returned to normality to a certain extent. It is expected  that in 1994, the economic growth rate will drop slightly, but  it will still register a fairly high rate of growth. There will  be slightly less investments. However, an adequate amount of  investments are needed in order to strengthen structural  readjustment. The scale of price increases will become smaller,  but the pressure from inflation and commodity prices will remain  relatively high. Price reform will be carried out within the  endurance of the different sectors of society. Rational reform  measures will be announced continuously and at the right time.  <H5>  I. Situation and Characteristics of China's Market Prices in </H5> 1993    From January to September 1993, the total volume of retail  sales rose 22.4 percent over the same period in 1992. The  general level of retail prices in the whole country was  increased by 12.1 percent and residents' living expenses was up  1.37 percent over the corresponding period in 1992, of which the  living expenses in 35 large and medium-sized cities rose 18.9  percent. Examining the situation of market prices in 1993, we  notice the following characteristics:    1. The market of consumer goods was lively and flourishing.  From January to September, the total volume of retail sales rose  22.4 percent with an actual growth rate of 9.3 percent if price  increases were factored in. China's market of consumer goods  could clearly be divided into two stages: (1) During the first  half of 1993, China's market of consumer goods registered a  continuous growth with the rate of growth increasing every  month. (2) During the second half of 1993, the market slowed  down, but still witnessed a moderate, steady growth. The signs  were: (A) Market sales began to decline. The growth rate of the  volume of retail sales in July was 1.9 percent lower than that  in June, and that of August was 4.6 percent lower than that of  June. (B) The phenomenon of shopping spree to preserve the value  of money once noticed in the first half of the year basically  disappeared, and the sales of imported and famous brand home  appliances and jewelry had notably declined. (C) The trend of  group purchases of consumer goods was curbed. The rate of growth  in this type of purchase dropped from the average rate of over  30 percent in the first half of 1993 to approximately 22 percent  between August and September, which was lower than that of  average residents.    2. The market of producer goods had changed from a  continuous  strong market in the first half of the year to a relatively weak  one. Sharply rising prices had slowly declined. The main signs  were: (1) The market sales were notably declining. The rate of  growth of the sales volume dropped from 49.5 percent in the  first half of 1993 to 27.3 percent in the third quarter. The  sellers' market was gradually changed to a buyers' market. In  addition to the influence of the macro-economic control, there  were two more factors which brought about the market changes in  terms of supply and demand. (A) A strong macro-control had  basically eliminated the demand of a speculative nature. (B) A  large amount of imported producer goods have arrived, and the  total volume of supplies has increased. (2) The inventory had  greatly increased, making the continuously dwindling stock level  to sharply rise. (3) The price of producer goods dropped. The  growth rate of the general price index for producer goods  dropped from 52.9 percent in June to 43.2 percent in August.    3. The scale of retail price increases had notably expanded  since the beginning of 1993. People had begun to feel the  potential pressure of inflation. After the macro-control was  tightened, the price increases had slowed down. Between January  and September, the general level of retail prices was 12.1  percent higher than that in the same period in 1992. Although  prices continued to rise during the second half of 1993, the  price increases had slowed down. The reasons for the price  increases to decline were as follows: (A) Except for the price  increases in railway freight charges and electric power, there  were no new projects for price reform during the second half of  1993. (B) The effects of the several price reform projects on  grain, coal and freight transportation, which took effect in the  second half of 1992 gradually disappeared in the second half of  1993. (C) The fall of the prices for producer goods brought down  the production costs.    If we examined the price increases on various kinds of  commodities and services, the retail price of consumer goods  rose 11.8 percent between January and September. From the  regional point of view, retail prices in urban areas were up  12.6 percent, while that in rural areas rose 11.8 percent. The  prices of service items in urban areas rose 31.6 percent and  those in rural areas were up 25.6 percent.    In October 1993, we had predicted the trend of market prices  in China for the fourth quarter on the basis of the inflationary  trend and the market prices at that time. We forecast that the  general price level would continue to climb up, but the upward  trend of prices would level off. The general level of retail  prices for 1993 would be approximately 13 percent.    4. According to the requirements in developing the socialist  market economy, progress of a breakthrough nature was made in  changing the mechanism of price formulation. Following the  promulgation and revision of the list of price control items and  the decision to decontrol government-fixed prices on a large  scale in 1992, we had adopted a series of measures to change the  mechanism of price formulation and made progress of a  breakthrough nature. The measures were as follows: (1) Except  for some individual provinces and autonomous regions, we had  basically decontrol the price for purchasing grain and cooking  oil on the basis of the principle of "unifying the policies,  decentralizing policy-making power, giving the proper guidance  and implementing the measures gradually." (2) State control was  lifted on the distribution and the price of coal. (3) Price  control on most of the iron and steel products was lifted. (4)  The prices of some cement products, telecommunications  switchboard equipment, heavy-duty trucks for civilian use, fire  trucks and fire-fighting equipment were decontrolled. (5) Prices  for products used by railway industry were decontrolled on a  large scale. (6) Prices were properly appraised for the grain,  chemical fertilizer, cotton, wood pulp and raw materials for  detergents which were imported with foreign exchange of the  central government. (G) Authority for collecting 22 types of  administrative fees such as the charge for issuing visas to  foreigners was delegated to the lower level. The administrative  department in charge of fee collection may determine themselves  the amount to be collected.    At the end of 1992, the share of state-controlled prices was  only 5.9 percent of the total volume of retail sales,  approximately 12.5 percent of the total amount of funds used in  purchasing farm and sideline products and 18.7 percent of the  total amount of revenues from the sales of producer goods. The  share of state-set prices was even smaller in 1993, following  the development of the market economy. In general, market has  played a main leading role in price formation for both consumer  and producer goods.    5. Emphasis was made in solving the problem of excessive low  prices for basic industrial products, and great strides were  made in readjusting the price structure. After the state had  adjusted the prices of grain, coal, petroleum and transportation  fees and raised the prices of iron and steel, chemical  fertilizer, postal and telecommunications services and waterway  freight charges in 1992, it once again made relatively large  strides in readjusting the price structure in 1993. (1) In order  to stimulate the production of petroleum, expand the capacity in  producing crude oil, economize on the use of petroleum and  change the situation in China where oil price was relative low,  30 million tons of "average grade petroleum were processed to  become high-grade petroleum," and the price of processed oil was  duly raised in 1993. (2) In order to further raise funds for  construction and accelerate the development of railway  transportation, the railway freight charges for one ton of cargo  was increased by 1.5 fen per km from 3.85 to 5.35 fen in 1993.  (3) The price of electricity was raised in order to rectify the  price structure for electricity and do away with the  unreasonable utility price. (4) The state-controlled price of  lumber from state-owned forest districts in Northeast China,  Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Yunnan was increased. (5) The  ex-factory prices for copper and zinc products produced within  the state plan were raised. According to a preliminary estimate,  The measures adopted by the state in readjusting the prices in  1993 had directly pushed the general level of commodity prices  approximately 2.5 percent upward. The successful adoption of  these aforementioned measures had played a significant role in  improving China's irrational price structure and developing its  basic industries.    6. The system of exercising the macro-control over market  price was further improved. Since 1993, our national economy  registered rapid growth on the basis of the progress made in the  previous year in the fields of production, construction,  commodity circulation and consumption. At the same time, some  new problems and contradictions have also become more  outstanding. Particularly the excessive issuance of currency on  the market, the chaotic financial order, the rapidly increasing  demand for investments and consumption and the "bottleneck"  effects of infrastructural facilities and basic industries had  caused the market price to increase on a large scale, and  further aggravated the inflationary trend. Under this situation,  the party central committee and the State Council took command  of the entire economic situation, and followed the guiding  thought that, "in doing economic work, it is necessary to seize  the opportunity, accelerate the development and pay attention to  adopting reliable measures while avoiding losses, particularly  great losses." They decided to adopt a series of measures to  improve and strengthen the macro-control by deepening reform and  perfecting the market system. They used economic, legal and  necessary administrative means to effectively control the  economy. After a certain period of time, they had attained  preliminary results in exercising the macro-control. The main  signs were as follows: (A) The practice of illegal interbank  short-term loans was curbed. (B) Various kinds of illegal  fund-raising activities were preliminarily controlled. Saving  deposits increased on a large scale, and the excessive issuance  of currency was checked. (C) The exchange rate of the RENMINBI  had become reasonable. (D) The price of producer goods declined  to a certain extent, while the price of real estate dropped by a  large margin. (E) The residents were less worried about the  inflationary trend.  <H5>  II. Forecast of Trend of Market Price Regulation in 1994 </H5>   After going through the two years of high-speed growth,  China's economy had undergone tremendous changes in its  macro-economic environment. The role of its market mechanism is  gradually being bolstered. The overall national strength has  been notably enhanced. Initial results have been attained in  exercising macro-economic control, and problems in the economic  life have been solved to a certain extent. The national economy  is developing healthily, and favorable conditions are being  created for the development of the reform and opening program in  an overall manner. The 1990s are the crucial stage for  developing China's socialist modernization. China is faced with  an opportunity rarely seen in history. In face of the new  situation and task, we must not hesitate to promote the reform  and opening program. We must quicken our tempo in building the  socialist market economic system and develop our economy  continuously, rapidly and healthily in 1994. For this, we must  still maintain a relatively high growth rate in developing our  national economy in 1994. According to a forecast made by a  relevant expert, the growth rate of GNP will be over 10 percent,  that of investments in fixed assets and that of retail sales  will exceed 20 percent. Reform will be actively carried out in  the fields of fiscal levy, finance, pricing, investment, foreign  trade and enterprise system in 1994. All these will have a great  impact on the market price in 1994. Meantime, we should not  ignore the effect of the excessive currency issued in 1993 and  forget the inertia of the sharp price increases in 1993. If we  carefully examine the current environment which will affect the  1994 market price, we will come to realize that there are  factors which are conducive to stabilizing the market price,  while there are also factors which will push the market price  upward.    Factors that are conducive to stabilizing the price are as  follows:    1. The financial order had improved, and the financial  situation became stabilized. (A) Indiscriminate short-term  interbank loans, arbitrary fund-raising activities and the  random establishment of financial institutions were basically  stopped. (B) Residents' savings deposits rose every month. As of  the end of September in 1993, the amount of savings deposits had  reached 1.3867 trillion yuan, an increase of 232.2 billion yuan  as compared with that at the end of 1992. (C) The trend of  excessive bank financing was curbed, and the supply of currency  notably slowed down. (D) The specialized banks' capability to  make payments was improved. As of the end of September, the rate  of reserve for the deposits of the specialized banks had reached  the normal rate of 7.2 percent.    2. The order in fiscal levy improved, and initial results  were attained in further increasing revenue and reducing  expenditures. The order in fiscal levy had notably improved, and  the situation whereby the economy during the first half of the  year was rapidly growing while the state revenue declined was  initially solved by stopping irrational tax remission and  reduction practices and dealing severe blows at various  activities of tax evasion. At the same time, the rapid rise in  state expenditure was controlled to a certain extent.    3. The order in the producer goods market, the stock market,  the futures market, the foreign exchange market, the real estate  market and the development zones also improved. The announcement  of measures to exercise macro-economic control such as  regulating the money market and cleaning up the real estate  market and the development zones had notably curbed the  activities of a speculative nature and the effects of the  "bubble economy." The signs were: (1) the speculative activities  on the producer goods market had notably weakened, the supply of  producer goods became more abundant and their prices dropped.  (2) Some of the development zones which failed to meet the  specified requirements were abolished, and measures to  continuously clean them up were being carried out. (3) There  were less investments in developing commercial housing projects.  The prices of real estate in the coastal areas dropped by  approximately 20 percent. (4) The stock market and the futures  market gradually became stabilized. (5) The exchange rate of  U.S. dollars to the RENMINBI on the foreign currency swap market  was stabilized around US$1 to 8.8 yuan.    4. Some factors which affected the market price were  changing.(A) The prices of grain, fuel for civilian use and  building materials which greatly affected the general level of  retail prices were basically decontrolled in recent years. Their  effect will become less outstanding on the market price in 1994.  (B) The prices of many types of producer goods were close to or  exceeded the average prices on the international market. Their  prices are expected to stabilize and remain at a higher level.  (C) The residents' psychology on spending became more matured.  There were more rational purchasing than panic buying. Consumer  goods were often purchased in a planned manner. (D) Notable  changes took place in income distribution. More money was set  aside for savings, housing and purchasing stocks and bonds,  while spending on consumer goods was often postponed.    5. The rapid growth in national economy increased the  effective supply of the market, and provided a solid material  foundation for the society to maintain a basic balance between  supply and demand.    6. All kinds of reform programs were being developed to  gradually and basically solve problems left over by the old  system, and ease off the potential inflationary pressure.    The factors which caused the prices to rise were as follows:    1. The total demand in society remained strong. From the  point of view of investment demand, the growth of investment in  fixed assets was somewhat weakened during the second half of  1993, but it was far from being ideal. It was still notably  higher than the normal amount. This was harmful to maintaining  stable and healthy development of the economy and stabilizing  the market. From the point of view of consumer demand, the  incomes of urban and rural residents continued to increase on a  large scale. Between January and September, the incomes of urban  residents used as living expenses grew 29 percent. The actual  rate of growth was 12 percent if price increases were factored  in. The cash net incomes of rural residents rose 17 percent. The  actual rate of growth was about 5 percent, if price increases  were factored in. The consumer demand during the fourth quarter  remained relatively high. All these would create a fairly strong  pulling effect on the market price in 1994.    2. As seen from the financial and monetary situation, the  new  loans extended by the banks and the net money supply in 1993  greatly exceeded the targets of the state plan formulated at the  beginning of the year. There was just too much currency on the  market, which might bring out inflation at any time. Our past  experience proved that excessive money supply in a certain year  will affect not only the inflation rate of the same year, but  also that in the next year. In forecasting the 1994 inflation,  we must not only examine the plan for the supply of money in  1994, but also how much extra currency was put on the market  beyond the state plan in 1993.    3. The financial situation brooks no optimism. Although the  present financial situation has improved somewhat, state revenue  is still relatively difficult.    4. The sharp price increases for energy and raw materials  and  the high costs of capital, foreign exchange and labor in the  past two years have pushed up production costs, which in turn  pushed up prices. Enterprises paid more than 30 percent for  energy and raw materials they used in 1993 as compared with  1992. The cost of money rose 10 percent, while that of foreign  exchange by over 20 percent. All these factors will inevitably  push up production costs, and jack up the price. Due to the fact  that the pressure of cost-push price rises is of a rigid nature,  this pressure will not become lower in 1994. Nor will it  decrease because of the macro-economic control.    5. While the economic growth was holding up, the market  prices remained high because of the after-effect of the  excessive currency on the market.    6. The situation in agriculture also brooks no optimism.  Although the party central committee and the State Council  attached great importance to agriculture, adopted many specific  measures and policies to protect agricultural production, and  attained some remarkable results in 1993, some factors which  made agricultural production unstable still existed. These  factors were as follows: (A) The acreage of farmland planted  with grain, cotton and sugar-bearing crops declined. According  to statistics, the total area planted with all kinds of crops in  the whole country during 1993 was 1.28 million hectares or 0.9  percent less than that in 1992. (B) Investment in agriculture  was awfully insufficient. (C) The growth rate of peasants'  income remained low, and the gap between incomes of urban  residents and those of peasants continued to widen. Whether  agricultural production is stable or not and whether the supply  of farm products is abundant or not would affect the market  price. The situation in agriculture during 1993 will definitely  affect the prices on the market in 1994.    From an overall point of view, both positive and negative  factors which will affect this year's market prices objectively  exist. Will this year's market remain healthy? The key lies in  whether we can exercise our macro-control appropriately. So long  as we unify our thinking, face squarely at the existing problems  at present, carry out our work in all fields ahead of schedule,  we will be able to run our market healthily and head off serious  inflation.  <H5>  III. Choices of Macro-Economic Control Policies for 1994 </H5> Market Price Regulation    From the point of view of macro-economic policies, there are  mainly three choices for 1994 market price regulation as follows:    The first one is to adopt a overall deflationary  macro-economic policy similar to the ones in 1988 and 1989. The  advantage of this kind of policy is that it would quickly lower  the excessively high commodity prices, but the disadvantage is  that it would seriously hamper the normal economic growth.  Meantime, it would make the market weak for a considerably  longer period.    The second one is to purely seek a high economic growth rate  for a short period, and adopt a laissez-faire attitude to market  price. At the end, it may bring about serious inflation. Finally  measures must be taken to lower the rate of economic growth.  This kind of economic fluctuations with drastic ups and downs  will not only undermine the national economy, but also affect  social stability.    The third one is to adopt the "soft landing" macro-economic  policy. That is to continuously strengthen and improve the  macro-control over the national economy, and gradually lower the  excessively high prices while maintaining a sustained, rapid and  healthy economic development.    We believe that the third choice is desirable, because the  1990s are the crucial years for the development of China's  modernization program, and it is necessary to maintain a  relatively high growth rate in developing the national economy.    From the macro-economic policy point of view, we should pay  attention to the following tasks in order to make sure that we  have a healthy market in 1994:    1. Correctly handle the relation between the economic  development, the reform program and price stabilization. It is  necessary to exercise the macro-control appropriately and head  off serious inflation, while maintaining a sustained and rapid  development of the national economy. We should strive to control  the rate of economic growth and the general index of price  increases to approximately 10 percent, and pay attention to the  following two cordons. The first one is that the growth rate of  urban and rural residents' regular incomes should not be lower  than the rate of price increases. The second one is to help  residents prevent their savings from losing their value. The  interest rate of their deposits must be higher than the rate of  inflation. At the same time, it is essential to implement the  price reform policy of combining relaxed control with  readjustment and making steady advance; and do away with the  practice of eagerly seeking quick results and scoring  achievements with a single stroke.    2. The key to strengthening and improving macro-control lies  in deepening reform. In the course of deepening reform,  particular attention must be paid to making comprehensive use of  finance, credit, interest rate, commodity price, taxation, wage  and exchange rate as economic levers and to linking short-term  readjustments with long-range reform measures. Meanwhile,  efforts must be made to bring into full play the role of the  State Planning Commission in working out overall plans.    3. Adopt positive measures, strengthen macro-control over  investment in fixed assets and enthusiastically optimize the  investment structure. (1) It is necessary to resolutely stop  those projects which do not conform with the state industrial  policy or those with unreliable or improper source of funds,  those with neither prerequisites for construction nor definite  future market in order to release some funds for the support of  major construction projects. (2) It is essential to place the  newly started projects under strict control. (3) Efforts must be  made to resolutely strengthen the macro-control over the real  estate business and the development zones. (4) It is necessary  to further standardize the source of funds which are used in  self-provided investments, and strengthen supervision and  control over the use of foreign loans. (5) It is imperative to  quicken the tempo in reforming the investment system,    4. Strengthen the control over the basic money supply from  the central bank.    5. Lose no opportunity in promoting price reform, and  maintain a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the  national economy. The guiding ideology for carrying out the  price reform in 1994 is to carry out the reform program in an  appropriate manner, and actively and reliably promote the price  reform while making sure that the general level of market prices  in 1994 is lower than that in the previous year. The following  measures should be carried out: (1) Further establish and  improve the price mechanism with which the price should be  regulated by the market.(2) Further improve the price system,  raise the prices of basic industrial products and solve the  problem of excessively low prices for basic industrial products  in accordance with the requirements for the development of  socialist market economy. It is necessary to appropriately and  timely raise the price of farm products, rationally adjust the  state-controlled prices of some of the farm products in order to  create conditions to gradually decontrol the prices of such  products. In the course of carrying out price reform on farm  products, particular attention must be paid to protecting the  interests of the peasants.    6. Improve the government system of exercising indirect  macro-control over the market price. (1) It is necessary to  gradually establish and improve the price control system at the  central level and at the provincial, autonomous regional and  municipal level. (2) It is essential to make comprehensive use  of the economic, administrative and legal means to strengthen  the administrative work in decontrolling the price. (3) Efforts  must be made to establish the system of price regulation funds  and the system for the storage of important commodities at the  central and the local levels; and enhance the capability of the  state in exercising macro-control over the market price. (4) It  is necessary to further improve the inspection and alert system  for market price regulation, and provide reliable information  and data for making policy decisions on price formation and  regulation. (5) It is essential to improve and work out laws and  regulations for market price control.    7. Earnestly implement the policy and measures formulated by  the central government on promoting agriculture and strive to  stabilize agricultural production. As seen from the current  situation, we should carry out the following tasks well: (1) We  must firmly implement the various measures to stabilize and  strengthen agricultural production after the meeting held by the  party central committee on rural work. (2) We must continue to  deepen reform in the countryside, regard market development as  the main task and further improve the market system. We must  strengthen our guidance in an overall manner, regard the  protection of agriculture as our central task, and quicken our  tempo in establishing a mechanism and an administrative system  for the development of rural economy according to the  requirements in building socialist market economy. (3) We must  ensure that the governments at all levels spend more money in  support of agricultural production. They must meet the urgent  needs for the development of agriculture even if they have to  temporarily postpone some of their industrial projects. We must  appropriately raise the price of farm products in order to  arouse the enthusiasm of the peasants in developing agricultural  production.</p>

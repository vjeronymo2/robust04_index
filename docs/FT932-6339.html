			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley unveils sharp rise for quarter SHARES in Morgan Stanley rose yesterday after the big Wall Street securities house reported a sharp improvement in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 195.8m. At the same stage last year, the company earned Dollars 139.1m. The impressive performance was driven by strong contributions from all of Morgan Stanley's main operations, which have thrived during the two-year boom in Wall Street's securities underwriting, broking and trading businesses. Investment banking revenues were particularly buoyant, rising 40 per cent in the quarter, to Dollars 378.8m, after strong growth in high-yield and structured-debt underwriting volume and the equity new issues calendar. In the past year, Morgan Stanley ranked as Wall Street's third-biggest underwriter of stock and fourth-biggest underwriter of bonds. Propriety trading revenues rose 27 per cent to Dollars 369.8m. The company said big increases in fixed-income and currency trading offset a decline in revenues from trading Japanese equity derivatives. Elsewhere, commission revenues rose 20 per cent to Dollars 91.5m, and asset management revenues climbed 11 per cent to Dollars 52.8m. Morgan Stanley's costs rose sharply in the quarter, primarily because of higher performance-related compensation payments. Total non-interest expenses rose 26 per cent to Dollars 732.5m. Its earnings would have looked even better but for a Dollars 29m pre-tax charge to cover the pending sale of Sweetheart Holdings, the disposable food service products manufacturer which Morgan Stanley's leveraged equity fund acquired in 1990. The strong earnings, and news of the Sweetheart disposal, lifted Morgan Stanley's shares Dollars 2 3/4 higher to Dollars 66 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

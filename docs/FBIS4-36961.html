			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part Two" in a series of unattributed articles: "Getting </F> Control -- The Muslim Brotherhood's Plans to Seize Power"]    [Text] The document entitled "Getting Control" [al-tamkin]  is probably one of the gravest Muslim Brotherhood [MB] documents  seized in the "al-Salsabil" case. As its title points out, it  deals with the MB's plans to seize power; the title means, as  the document literally says, "to prepare for shouldering the  duties of the future and acquiring the ability to manage state  affairs, and this cannot be achieved without a comprehensive  plan that takes into its calculations the need for the MB to  penetrate the vital classes in society and its influential  establishments while remaining committed to a specific strategy  against the other forces of society and in dealing with the  outside world's forces."    The document, which consists of 13 sheets of foolscap paper,  makes the task of penetrating the student, worker, professional,  and business sectors and the less capable popular groups the  cornerstone of the plan to take control because, as the document  says, the MB's spread in these sectors will make the confronting  the MB more difficult, will impose on the state more complicated  considerations, and will also increase the MB's opportunities  and ability to alter the situation and work to "get control."    But the document refers very clearly to the importance of  the  MB's penetration of the influential establishments in society.  Herein lies the danger, because in the MB's view, the  influential establishments are not just the professional  associations, the media and judiciary establishments, and the  People's Assembly, but also "other establishments" which are  influential, have the ability to bring about change, and which  the state might use in confronting and curtailing the MB.    The "Getting Control" document does not openly name the  other  establishments, and this is intentional. But the description  very clearly refers to the army and police. Those who know the  history of the MB are not surprised by this because the MB is  the only political movement whose first option for reaching  power always included penetration of the army and the police  with the aim of seizing power. This was exactly what happened  in Sudan recently.    The document also expounds a complete concept of how to deal  with the unions, the pressure groups in society, and the  political parties through a long-term policy, starting with  "coordination," moving to "neutralization," then "containment,"  and then to taking the situation in hand and seizing control  through controlling the decision-making centers. It also  expounds on how to deal with Egypt's Copts, advocating a  two-pronged policy: first, neutralize them by letting them feel  that the MB does not pose a danger to them, and then second,  limit the effectiveness of the Copts' role in public life and  reduce their economic power in society.    Yet the most dangerous point in the document is the MB's  concept of dealing with the outside world, especially the West  and the United States. This reveals the MB's real face, because  the document asserts the importance of making the West,  especially the United States, feel that the MB does not pose a  danger to their interests and that it is in the West's interest  to deal with the MB after they succeed in "getting control"  because the MB represents stability and discipline.    This is the content of the document, which we now publish in  full together with an example of its application to all the  governorates. We have not changed anything. As we said in the  first part, these are the MB's own documents and papers,  testifying to their plots to overthrow the regime and seize  power.    It is composed of thirteen large foolscap pages with the  title "Getting Control," written in the form of a report that  stresses that the new stage in the MB's existence requires  confrontation and will not tolerate the generality of the former  objectives of penetration and spreading. The document warns  against making conflicting decisions on the situations facing  the MB, the foreign challenges and threats, and the overt  confrontation between the existing regimes and the political  Islam movements operating in the political arena.    The document begins with two questions that constitute the  core of the plan for "getting control." The first question:  What do they seek to achieve? And second: What should be the  short-term situation in regard to the accomplishment of the  mission, continuity, preparedness for future tasks, and  promoting competence?    The mission as the MB understands it and according to the  text of the document is aimed at preparing its members to  shoulder the tasks of the future and be capable of running the  state, and at preparing the internal structure for the tasks of  the stage of "competence." By competence, the document means  drawing up a policy to confront external dangers, namely  attempts to frustrate the MB's schemes to take power and  penetrate the society through:     -  spreading to the vital class of society and knowing how to  incite them.    -  spreading to the effective establishments, namely the army  and  police.    -  dealing with other forces and; lastly    -  making use of the external dimension.        The document underlines that spreading throughout the vital  classes of the people and having the ability to incite them  would yield several benefits for the Muslim Brotherhood. Most  importantly, this permeation would lessen threats and make  confrontation with the MB more difficult. The ability to incite  these classes would enhance the opportunities for effecting a  change and enhance the chances of achieving the mission, that  is, the ability to run state affairs and take power.    According to the text of the document, the sectors of the  people marked for penetration and permeation in order to control  them were chosen on the following bases:     -  ease of penetration    -  ability to influence and incite them    -  the ease with which they could be manipulated    -  continuity of influence over them.        According to these four conditions, the MB chose students,  workers, artisans, businessmen, and popular classes as the  segments to accomplish the two parts of the plan for getting  power.    Regarding the students, it is easy for the MB to penetrate  them, spread among them, incite them, and continue to influence  them.    Regarding the workers, it is easy to spread among them and  incite them. As for the artisans, it is easy to penetrate and  influence them and somewhat easy to incite them. The  businessmen are an easy sector to influence and to sustain the  influence. The popular classes are easy to penetrate and incite.  <H5>  The Army And The Police </H5>   Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this document is the  part dealing with implementing the plan for "getting control" in  vital establishments. The document describes these  establishments as those representing:    1. A tool to undermine and confront the Islamic movement.    2. A real addition to the movement's power and  effectiveness in making changes.    Although these two conditions fit only the army and the  police, as we pointed out in the preamble, the document's  description of these establishments confirms our theory that  they do mean the army and the police. The document says that  choosing the vital establishments depends on the following  criteria:    1. Their effectiveness in confronting and undermining the  Islamic movement.    2. Their ability to make changes.    3. The comprehensiveness and broadness of their influence.    4. Long-term confrontation.    The document indicates the army and the police are two of  its  most important targets, along with the influential  establishments, foremost among which is the media establishment.  The latter, according to the document, has comprehensive,  wide-ranging, and long-term influence, has the ability to make  changes, and can prove effective in the confrontation.    Regarding the religious establishment, al-Azhar, the  document  says that it has the same characteristics as the media  establishment, but in its own way.    As for the judiciary, the document notes that it is known  for  its effectiveness in causing change, particularly in the  legislature-- that is, the People's Assembly.  <H5>  Dealing With Others </H5>   The document discusses in detail what is known as dealing  carefully with others as part of the plan for "getting control"  and the "know your enemy" method. It says: We are not  operating alone, for there are other forces in the arena that  negatively or positively affect our ability to perform our  mission. Therefore, the continuity of the efforts for "getting  control" requires careful action with a view to containing the  others, coexisting, neutralizing, and minimizing the  effectiveness of the opposing quarters, while coordinating with  neutral quarters that have not defined their positions or that  support our mission--the brothers in full or in part. The  document adds: We have to take into consideration that we must  be able to deal with different types of cases simultaneously.    There are options before the MB with regard to the  authorities:    1. Containment by exploiting the authorities' establishments  to fulfill the MB's mission through the decision-making process  or by changing their systems.    2. Coexistence--in other words, working to create a form of  coexistence with the regime by influencing situations and thus  making the regime eager to keep our effective presence.    3. Neutralization by letting them -- that is the authorities  -- feel that we do not pose a danger to them.    4. Reducing the authorities' effectiveness in the  confrontation so as to continue the efforts to get control.    On the issue of dealing with the Copts, the document says:  One of three ways of dealing with the Coptic community must be  chosen:    1. Coexistence by convincing them that they have an interest  in realizing Islamic rule and the justice it brings, which the  present regime cannot provide.    2. Neutralization by making the Copts feel that we -- the MB  -- are not hostile to them and do not pose any danger to them.  The document calls this "securing" [al-ta'min], that is,  winning over the Copts.    3. Reducing the scope of their threat and their economic  influence and material force. The document defines this as  "fragmentation"--that is, fragmenting the Coptic ranks facing  the MB.    The document does not fail to define the stand vis-a-vis the  Jews; it is limited to one line, namely: "The effectiveness of  their threat in all fields must be minimized."  <H5>  And the Groups </H5>   For the MB, the other groups include the pressure groups and  the parties in addition to the authority, Copts, and Jews. It  is not strange for the document to add the clubs, the suspicious  societies "according to the document," the Islamic groups, and  Islamist thinkers to the above groups.    Regarding the clubs and suspicious societies, the document  says -- without naming these clubs or their types -- that their  danger lies in their influence on the decision-making centers  through executive figures and in their influence on public  opinion through the leaders in the media and the arts. This  leads to the adoption of decisions and laws that serve their  interests to a great degree. Penetrating them is difficult due  to the information that they receive from certain levels. The  inability to prove their dangerousness in a practical way is  clearly a weak point and we -- the MB -- must realize this in  order to rectify it. We must cope with this sector by  minimizing the effectiveness of their threat.    In the section dealing with parties and pressure groups,  the document says: This section includes professional  associations, family and tribal groupings, international "human  rights" organizations, economic forums like "the businessmen's  society..." [ellipsis as published], and the existing parties.  The document explains that dealings will take place at several  levels:    1. Steering. Joining and controlling the decision-making  centers so that we have a majority.    2. Coordination. If we do not have a majority, we must  coordinate with them in areas where we have common grounds and  even find joint interests with them.    3. At this level, the document combines the methods of  containment, neutralization, and minimizing of the effectiveness  of others should the steering or the coordination efforts fail.  The document notes that dealing with parties and associations  may take various forms because of their nature and the  divergence of their views.    The gravest part of this document is the one dealing with  the  Islamic groups and Islamic thinkers. In this section, the MB  openly reveals its position regarding these groups for the first  time. According to the text of the document, this section  includes:     -  Independent Islamic groups and thinkers who are in  agreement with us, even partly, regarding the mission but who  differ over the details. This requires coordination,  cooperation, integration, and alliances. If the alliance and  coordination efforts fail, containment, neutralization, and  coexistence tactics should be pursued.    -  Nonindependent Islamic groups and thinkers affiliated with  specific quarters that are used to strike at and obstruct our  efforts at "getting control." Attempts should be made to steer,  contain, or neutralize them so as to minimize their  effectiveness.    <H5>    America and the West </H5>   In another paragraph headed "Hostile External  Forces--America  and the West," the document says verbatim that dealing with them  begins with the stage of coexistence. This can be achieved by  persuading them that it is in their interest to deal with the  existing forces in the region, and that as a force the MB is  characterized by stability and discipline. However, dealing  with the West will pass through a stage of neutralization. This  can be done by letting the West feel that it is in its interest  not to harm us, because we pose no threat to them so long as  they do not obstruct the efforts for "getting control." In the  meantime, we, the MB, could affect their interests should they  stand against these efforts.    The last stage of dealing with the West and the United  States  is the one of minimizing their effectiveness, which can be  achieved by means of minimizing their threat. This can be done  by directly affecting their interests and weakening the ability  of their institutions to influence the decision-making process  for their interests. Whenever possible, however, we must  benefit from the external domain.  <H5>  Managing the State </H5>   The most dangerous point in this document is probably the  plan for the coup that the MB is preparing in order to seize  power and reach the stage of managing the state's affairs or  what is termed in this document as the preparation for future  tasks.    The document says: Creating a social situation that would  allow us to "get control" requires that we be able to manage the  state's affairs and that we realize it is possible that we might  be compelled to manage the state's affairs by ourselves. At the  same time, "getting control" will lead to the rallying of  hostile foreign forces. Hence, preparations must be made to  confront the internal and external challenges; this means that  we -- the MB -- must have a plan for confronting these  challenges by getting the necessary resources to do so and the  ability to use them. This requires the preparation of the  internal structure in line with the changing requirements and  making the optimum use of the resources, which the document  labels "competence" [al-kafa'ah]. The document adds that this  is the practical challenge in achieving the various objectives  of the plan. This requires the development of the particulars  of the internal structure so as to be in line with the nature of  the coming stage -- both from the conceptual angle and the  preparation of individuals and the internal structure -- in the  following way:    Regarding the concept--which is one of the most important  sides in the triangle of competence--this requires the  concentration of the membership's efforts on construction and  change. Therefore it is important for the ranks, "the MB  elements," to understand fully the issue of change and to have a  very clear idea of its directions so that the plan will not meet  with passive resistance from within. It is necessary to start  submitting the issue of change to dialogues at all levels in  order to let everyone interact and participate, thus initiating  ideas and initiatives and giving substance to the issue.    Regarding indoctrinating individuals, the document says that  the existing indoctrination program should include the effects  of the plan on various particulars.    Permeating the classes of society, which is the core of the  "getting control" plan, requires raising the individuals'  ability to influence a large sector of society and thus improve  the level of dialogue, the ability to convince and train through  the following:     -  Creating a balance between the propagation carried out by  individuals so as to unite the ranks and make the propagation  widespread.    -  Developing the leadership circles and the ability to activate  the groups.        As for permeating influential establishments, this requires  the following:     -  Raising the individuals' ability to penetrate the  establishments without losing their identities.    -  Raising the individuals' ability to handle information.     As for dealings with the other forces, individuals must be  groomed to establish intellectual or practical bridges with  them. As for the mission of running the state and future  missions, this requires the following:    1. Attention must be given to a select group, which will  develop the ability to run public establishments.    2. The ability to absorb and benefit from distinguished  figures in various sectors.    Regarding structural building, the practical method of  management requires:     -  The availability of the necessary information to perform  various missions.    -  The establishment of the principle of authorization and  decentralization in action whenever possible.    -  The establishment of the principle of nonengagement of  individuals, so they will be free to occupy important positions.    -  The flexibility of the structure to allow for adding new  entities in accordance with the plan "information apparatus-  political relations."    -  Completing the structure on the basis of the importance and  priority of the action in the plan.   <H5>  The Importance </H5>   After finishing with indoctrination and the structural  formation of individuals and the structures of groups, the  document moves to the most dangerous part. It outlines the  priorities of actions in all sectors and the relative importance  of each sector, and defines the degree of penetration achieved  and those who will be targeted, using figures and  percentages--which proves the scientific and methodological  nature of the plan.    In this regard, the document says:    1. As far as ensuring the success of the efforts for  "getting  control," the social classes that must be penetrated are:  Students, laborers, professionals, businessmen, and low-income  people, in that order.    As far as the vital establishments are concerned, the  following influential establishments could be named: The media,  the religious establishment, the judiciary, the parliament. The  document adds that the goal of dealing with others concerns the  need to deal with the authorities first, then with the Copts,  the Jews, the West, the suspicious clubs, pressure groups,  parties, and Islamic groups.    2. Preparedness for future missions in "running of the  state." The document names first the universities,  professionals, public institutions, institutions that have a  specific mission, and finally the economic institutions for  "financing."    3. Betterment of society. The document here selects for  penetration and infiltration the educational institutions, the  media, the religious and cultural establishment, economic  institutions, and technological institutions.    4. As far as internal preparations are concerned, the goal  is  to deepen the vision and complete the structural formation and  reforms.    As far as the four goals are concerned, the document  allocates 40 percent of efforts to continuing the "getting  control" plan, 30 percent to internal structuring, 20 percent to  the betterment of society, and the remaining 10 percent to  preparations for the future missions when "running the state."    Having precisely determined the importance of each of the  four objectives of the plan, the document assigns weight to  every track of action according to its importance and its  contribution to the achievement of the set objective.    To the tracks within the first objective--"getting  control"--the following weights are given: 50 percent to the  penetration of society's vital sectors, 40 percent to the  penetration of influential institutions, and 10 percent to  dealings with others. Within these, there are subtracks, and  each has its weight: In the penetration of the vital sectors,  students are given 30 percent, workers 30 percent, professionals  and businessmen 10 percent, and low-class people 20 percent.    In the track of influential institutions, the plan gives  powerful establishments, "the Army and the police," 40 percent,  and this goes up to 50 percent for the judiciary, 50 percent for  the parliament, 30 percent for media, and 20 percent as a  comparative weight for the religious establishment [figures as  published]. In accordance with these weights, the plan sets the  priorities of action in 1994 and determines rates to be achieved  during the remaining seven months of this year.    Although the investigations have not yet determined the  significance of these rates and standards, the MB says in this  serious document that it made good progress in the stage of  formation (2,100 points) compared to 1,425 points in the field  of education, 900 points in economics, 780 points in the media,  only 120 points in the area of parties and pressure groups, and  400 points in the shantytowns. This shows that the internal  organization made fine strides and that there were various  degrees and stages of penetration of society, as the document  shows on its last page.  <H5>  The Plan's Guide </H5>   In its final shape, the plan in itself constitutes the MB's  manifesto of its future attempt to take over power and stage an  internal coup against the existing regime.    The plan contains a guide specifying in detail and in  accordance with a fixed and precise timetable the steps for  staging the coup. The guide consists of five foolscap pages and  six annexes, each representing a questionnaire for studying the  real situation in every governorate, from the street committees,  to families, to the guidance offices in the governorates.    According to the document, the following steps must be  implemented in chronological order.    The first step:    The Administrative Bureau would choose a three-member  committee called "the committee of planning and follow-up" or  some such name expressing this type of function. One of its  members, the moderator at least, would be a member of the  Administrative Bureau. The bureau would choose at least one  person to act as planning and follow-up delegate in the  governorate.    The committee's primary function would be to direct and  follow up planning operations, including proper implementation  of any future steps, examining the performance of all involved  functionaries, and developing plans and major ideas prior to  submitting them to the Administrative Bureau.    According to the document, it is advisable for the above  committee to include a representative of the chief  administrative or geographical division--that is, the main town  or district center-- and a representative for the various  specialized divisions of the groups in the area.    The committee would meet and draw up a plan and a timetable  to implement further steps.    The second step:    This consists of examining the Brotherhood's policies and  deciding which policies must be maintained.    The Administrative Bureau in each governorate would carry  out  a detailed discussion of the Brotherhood's policies and arrive  at two results. First, the policies would be translated into  major guidelines governing the Brotherhood's activities in the  governorate for the duration of the plan.    Secondly, members' comments and suggestions that the Bureau  sees fit to submit to senior administrators and to the central  planning unit would be recorded. These comments and suggestions  are designed to improve policies and close any existing gaps.    The third step:    The local bureau in the governorate would examine the  Brotherhood's course of action in the governorate during the  previous plan. It would assess the following:    1. The details, clarity, and comprehensibility of the  working  plans.    2. The extent to which the objectives have been attained.    3. The lessons to be drawn from previous activities  regarding the quality of planning and the competence of the  planners, the practicality of the previous plan, and the  problems that surfaced during the implementation of the plan.    The fourth step:    Gathering information on internal and external conditions.  This was perhaps the most dangerous step of the "Salsabil"  office's tasks. The office's activities were confined to  gathering, classifying, and analyzing the information on the  internal and external conditions as follows:    1. The information on internal conditions will also include  details about the Brotherhood's members. The field leader will  ask every member to fill out an information paper about himself.    The information on internal conditions also includes details  about the organizational and administrative status in the  governorate. These details will be collected by the field  leader and will be finally reviewed and classified by the  governorate's planning and follow-up committee.    2. The information on external conditions will also include:    A. Details about the status of the state and society in  general. The central planning unit will supply this information.    B. Details about the governorate's society and  departments. The representative of the planning and follow-up  committee in the governorate will provide this information.    C. Details about the institutions, companies, and  departments with which our personnel have a connection. The  field official or the officials in charge of branches and  divisions will gather such details.    D. Details about the most influential figures in the  governorate with whom we cooperate and who have direct influence  on us.    The fifth step:    After gathering the information, the representative of the  planning and follow-up committee will prepare a three-part  report as follows:    First part: It contains a list showing the points of  internal weakness and strength. This list is prepared from the  information gathered by the internal unit. The representative  is anxious to classify these points according to their  importance and effect.    Second part: It contains a list detailing the job  opportunities on the one hand and the challenges and problems  facing our members on the other. The representative will  classify this information and its effects on our activities and  the dangers and threats this information represents in the  future.    Third part: The representative will compare the  opportunities and challenges with the points of weakness and  strength. He will define the opportunities which include points  of strength that will enable us to exploit them. The  representative will also define the points that we could not  exploit easily due to the presence of specific weak points. He  will define the threats that could increase due to the presence  of weak points and that could be confronted by points of  strength.    The sixth step:    Analyzing the previous objectives so that they can be used  in  the next stage. Also, assessing the success in implementing the  objectives and comparing this with previous successes as  mentioned in the first document.    The seventh step:    Here, methods of implementation are selected. The planning  and follow-up committee would choose a set of appropriate  methods to realize every objective. The committee would hold  intensive consultations with the main formations in the  governorates (geographical and technical).    The eighth step:    Drafting programs to put those methods chronologically,  financially, and organizationally into practice. The planning  and follow-up committee would translate the methods into plans  of action with specified timetables. It would also specify  approximate budgets for those methods and determine the  organizational responsibilities for implementing every major  activity.    The ninth step:    Sending the proposed plan to the formations in the  governorates for evaluation and presentation to the base. The  Administrative Bureau would supervise the forwarding of the  proposed plan to the geographic formations and the technical  divisions and its presentation to the executive bases in the  governorates.    The various units would present their proposals to develop  the plan to the Administrative Bureau. The bureau would refer  them to the planning and follow-up committee, which, in turn,  would examine them and try to use them to modify the proposed  plan and send it back to the Administrative Bureau.    In this last stage, the Administrative Bureau would discuss  the plan, decide on its final shape, adopt it as a basis for  action, and send it to all formations so that they will be  committed to it. The bureau would watch the progress of its  various units in achieving the tasks assigned to them by the  plan.    Here, the document known as the guide to the plan ends. It  is the first practical model for implementing the "getting  control" plan at the level of the governorate, beginning with  the street committee and ending with the governorate's shura  [consultative] council. The seriousness of the document lies in  the fact that it uses scientific and technological methods in  gathering information and data from the field or the locality,  and this is one of the known security methods. The information  and the date are then analyzed to determine the points of  strength and weakness to help implement the "getting control"  plan--seizing power and staging a well-devised coup program  which the Brotherhood adopts in its secret organization.    Again, these are their own papers and documents, signed by  their leaders. There is no way to deny that the Brotherhood is  a coupist organization that believes only in secret activity, no  matter what public facade it uses.</p>

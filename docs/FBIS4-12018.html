			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 3 Apr (INA)--AL-THAWRAH has stressed that  the policy of the Al Sa'ud family has always been characterized  by subordination and submissiveness to foreigners, and that  their stands have always been hostile to all nationalist and  pan-Arab regimes in the Arab homeland.    The paper, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th party,  says in an article today that the Al Sa'ud family has spent  billions of dollars to conspire against nationalist and pan-Arab  revolutions in more than one Arab country, following  instructions from and through direct coordination with their  American masters and allies.    The paper adds: In view of their upbringing and the role of  imperialism in the establishment of their state and constant  support for it, the Al Sa'ud rulers find nothing abnormal in  their submissiveness to the West and the United States.    Referring to yesterday's address by Sa'ud al-Faysal, the Al  Sa'ud family's foreign minister, at the meeting of the foreign  ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], the paper says  that this agent, expressing his family's black hatred against  Iraq, has deemed it too much for some Gulf states to adopt a  stand that is in line with pan-Arab sentiments or to call for  lifting the unjust blockade imposed on the people of Iraq.    The paper adds: In his address, agent Sa'ud al-Faysal  denounces with extreme stupidity Iraq's efforts and contacts  aimed at developing a world public opinion in support of its  fair cause.    The paper explains that this agent minister was so shameless  as to accuse Iraq of working to split the unity of the Gulf  states against Iraq, which stood like a lofty mountain and whose  children offered rivers of blood to defend the Gulf itself.    The paper stresses that what Sa'ud al-Faysal said was  directly ordered by his American masters. Thus, he is only  playing the role of a minor agent echoing the voice of his  masters and acting like a lowly follower. The paper says that  this stand is a continuation of the Al Sa'ud family's treasonous  role which they started in Hafar al-Batin when they made  available all requirements of the 30-state aggression against  Iraq.    The paper stresses that the progress in the stands of some  sisterly Arab Gulf states was not a coincidence, but was the  outcome of a total conviction of the importance of Iraq and its  role in maintaining the Gulf unity and security, and because  they have come to realize that the blockade imposed on Iraq has  gone beyond all international and legitimate justifications.    Concluding its article, AL-THAWRAH says that the aim of the  Al Sa'ud family's allegations is to keep the Arab Gulf states  under the threat of the imperialist hammer, represented by this  family, and to urge the continuation of the blockade, which will  inevitably come to an end because of the rising number of good  people in the world and the unrelenting steadfastness of the  people of Iraq.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> About 100 people gathered outside St. Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic  Church in Bridgeport, Conn., kneeling, singing and praying before the locked  doors of the building that protesters had occupied for nearly a week. Diocese  leaders closed the predominantly Polish church until further notice Saturday  after police removed dissident parishioners who had occupied the church to  protest the transfers of a popular pastor and an assistant priest and to demand  that the current pastor leave. "The doors are locked, but we want to show the  world we won't quit," said Halina Chmiel of Milford, one of the leaders of the  protest.  </P></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: AIB agrees settlement on insurance liabilities ALLIED IRISH Banks, Ireland's largest clearing bank, has reached a settlement with the government on liabilities arising from its foray into the general insurance business in the early 1980s. Under the agreement AIB will contribute IPounds 8.8m (Pounds 9.4m) a year from 1993 for 20 years, which will be matched on a 50:50 basis by the government, to settle outstanding debts of the former Insurance Corporation of Ireland which went into receivership in 1985. AIB said the contribution will be equivalent to 0.8p per share 'and can be borne over the period without reducing the capital strength of AIB'. AIB had bought the Insurance Corporation in 1983 for IPounds 45m, as part of a strategy to diversify into the general insurance industry. It then found that the insurance company had 'significant underprovisioning', mainly in its reinsurance business written through London.</p>

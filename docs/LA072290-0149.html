			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODWILL GAMES;  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MORA IS UNWANTED, BUT WINS MARATHON  </P> <P> Dave Mora wasn't considered good enough to wear the uniform of the United  States team in the Goodwill Games marathon.  </P> <P> But when the race was run Saturday in Seattle, there was nobody better than  Mora.  </P> <P> Mora, an added entry, burst into the lead with about four miles to go and won  in 2 hours 14 minutes 49 seconds.  </P> <P> A 26-year-old from Bloomington, Ind., who did not wear a U.S. uniform because  he was the fourth U.S. selection, passed tiring leader Thomas Robert Naali of  Tanzania and defeated Soviet Nikolai Tabak by almost two minutes in his  best-ever time.  </P> <P> "I saw (Naali) slowing down for a long time and I thought that if I would pace  it, he would come to me," Mora said. "That's the way it worked.  </P> <P> "And when I caught him, I threw a little surge -- and that was it."  </P> <P> Tabak clocked 2:16:27 for second place and Canadian Peter Maher finished third  in 2:17:15.  </P> <P> Naali, a 21-year-old prison guard running his first marathon, led the entire  race until Mora passed him on a flat portion of the often-hilly course through  the streets along Lake Washington, Lake Union and Elliott Bay. Naali finished  ninth.  </P> <P> "I'm not too big a mileage runner," said Mora, who trained primarily for the  10,000 meters before this.  </P> <P> Mora originally was left off because of a misunderstanding, then allowed to  compete as an "invited guest" by The Athletics Congress.  </P> <P> "I knew I would beat all the other Americans on the team," Mora said. "I had  that feeling because I had been running very well. . . . I would have liked to  have worn the U.S. uniform, but I'm still an American."  </P> <P> Soviet gymnasts Vitali Scherbo and Valeri Belenki took the gold and silver  medals in the men's all-around competition at Tacoma, while American Lance  Ringnald won the bronze.  </P> <P> The Soviets dominated the competition, scoring highest in five of six events  and tying in the remaining event, the high bar.  </P> <P> Scherbo won the gold with a score of 59.20 points, and Belenki scored 58.65.  </P> <P> Ringnald had 58.20 to take the bronze ahead of teammate Chris Waller, who had  57.80, in the best U.S. finish in the all-around event in major international  competition since Peter Vidmar's silver medal at the 1984 Olympics.  </P> <P> The 18-year-old Scherbo, who placed fifth in the 1990 European championships in  the all-around event, scored a competition high 9.95 on the vault. His lowest  score was a 9.75 on the parallel bars.  </P> <P> While the Soviets easily won the gold and silver, it was a three-way battle for  the bronze among Ringnald, Waller and Sylvio Kroll of East Germany, who ended  up tied for sixth with China's Guo Linyao at 57.50.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union won four gold medals and East Germany took two in the first  day of rowing.  </P> <P> The top Americans were Kris Karlson of Keene, Conn.; Alison Townley of  Minneapolis, who finished second in the women's open double sculls; Rob  Shepherd of Lafayette, Calif.; Christian Sahs of Southborough, Mass.; Jeff  McLaughlin, Warwick, R.I., and Patrick Manning of Hyde Park, N.Y., who were  fourth in the men's fours with coxswain.  </P> <P> Soviet winners were Girt Vilks and Valeri Dosenko in the men's open double  sculls, Vladimir Romanishin, Igor Bortnitski, Sigitas Kuchinskis and Petr  Petrinich in the open fours with coxswain, Tatyana Borisova and Liliya  Aleshkina in the women's lightweight pairs without coxswain, and Sariya  Zakirova and Svetlana Mazi in the open double sculls.  </P> <P> East Germany's Uwe Kellner, Thomas Jung, Frank Pawloski, Andreas Hache took the  open fours without coxswain, and the East German women's eight of Birhte Siech,  Heike Winkler, Annegret Strauch, Janette Barth, Antje Frank, Una Justh, Kathrin  Haacker, Judith Zeidler and Daniela Neunast also won.  </P> <P> Other winners were Vaclav Chalupa of Czechoslovakia in the men's open single  sculls and Mette Block Jensen of Denmark in the women's lightweight single  sculls.  </P></p>

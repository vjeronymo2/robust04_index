			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Ford joins race for television exposure: Why carmakers are putting their 'ordinary' models into motor sport JUST 24 hours after releasing the Mondeo, the family-sized 'world' car on which Ford's financial future heavily depends, the company's UK subsidiary this week announced that Mondeos are destined for the race track as well as the showroom. Ford of Britain announced that it will introduce two of the new cars in the 14-round British Touring Car Championship. Although motor racing budgets are never formally disclosed, Ford of Britain does not dispute that the cost by the end of the season could be much more than Pounds 1m. To some the exercise may seem an inexcusable frivolity for a company that made record losses last year. But Ford of Britain believes that to establish the Mondeo in a marketplace crowded with more rivals than when its Sierra predecessor was launched 11 years ago, the racing budget is relatively small compared with the global total of Pounds 4bn invested in the model. The exercise could prove to be highly cost-effective. Ford is not alone in this view. To the surprise of the RAC Motor Sports Association - the governing body of UK motor sport - the racing action and the strong resemblance of the race cars to showroom models has attracted the interest of of television. Such interest is highly valued by carmakers and commercial sponsors. With every round of the championship being televised by BBC's high-profile Grandstand programme and race highlights regularly carried on ITV, coverage of the championship could rank second only to that of grand prix racing. 'It's giving us the kind of exposure that you simply cannot buy,' said Mr Brian Llewelyn, public affairs director for Peugeot Talbot, whose two-car Peugeot 405 team is being led by former touring car champion Rob Gravett. With BBC TV contracted to televise both the 1993 and 1994 seasons - and taking an option on 1995-96 - manufacturers are flocking to the championship. Mercedes Benz is expected to announce that it too is joining the touring car championship fray. Meanwhile, Renault is launching a two-car team this year. Japan's Mazda is entering its new executive car, the Xedos 6. Apparently Mazda believes that should the Xedos be seen fighting against BMW in the championship it could win the type of respect given by European buyers to the blue-and-white badged cars from Munich. This week a delegation from Audi was at Donington Park, the Midlands racing circuit, to assess whether it, too, should develop appropriate cars. The newcomers will join a starting grid that even last season - the second in the championship's 2-litre form - was starting to resemble a roll call of the world's volume car industry, including Toyota, Nissan, Peugeot and General Motors' Vauxhall. 'The question now is not so much who is coming in, but whether any of the big manufacturers can afford to stay out,' says Mr Jonathan Ashman, marketing director of the RAC Motor Sports Association and the chief architect of the championship. The motor industry and companies in the tobacco, clothing and drinks sectors that use motor sport to promote their products acknowledge there is no mathematical formula linking pounds expended to extra sales achieved. However, press column inches and air time can be measured. Mr Llewelyn of Peugeot Talbot says: 'We measured the time we got on-screen just in the reshowings of the 1992 championship's highlights on TV over Christmas - and buying it would have cost us nearly Pounds 3m.' The contrast with grand prix motor racing costs is stark. Williams-Renault admits to a Pounds 20m budget, excluding its Renault-supplied engines. McLaren's is considerably more. Most costs are borne by large sponsors such as the tobacco group Philip Morris and the Benetton clothing empire. On that basis the Pounds 1m or so that BMW and Vauxhall - which took the driver's and manufacturer's touring car titles respectively last year - and most other manufacturers will spend on this year's championship is very small indeed. Some of that money will be recouped from Securicor, electronics group Philips, Listerine mouthwash, Canadian brewer Labatt and other non-industry sponsors. In comparison with the 100m global audiences for each grand prix, media coverage has also been much smaller. The dramatic development is that most of the world, excluding North America, is adopting the British 2-litre rules, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Australia, the entire Asia Pacific region and South Africa. At the end of this year there will be a European Cup, with each nation sending a team of drivers to compete. Within the next couple of years it is almost certain a new world championship will exist for cars similar to those 'ordinary' motorists drive, rather than grand prix exotica.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Computer People rises to Pounds 1.1m Computer People, the London-based computer recruitment service and consultancy, last year saw a return to growth in revenues and pre-tax profits as the recession eased in the US and UK, writes Alan Cane. Helped by strong control of overheads, pre-tax profits were greatly improved at Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 145,000) with earnings per share at 4.37p against losses of 0.97p. Revenues were up 10 per cent to Pounds 68.75m (Pounds 62.74m) A single, final dividend of 1.5p net is being paid. Last year there was only an interim of 0.65p. Net borrowings are now down at Pounds 4.1m and the gearing has been reduced from 92 per cent to 75 per cent. Computer People operates placement and consultancy services in the UK and consultancy services in the US. Turnover for the UK business grew 13 per cent to Pounds 44.4m, while in the US dollar revenues fell 12 per cent, but operating profits rose 12 per cent to Dollars 899,000 as a result of improvement in margins and control of overheads. Mr Anthony Lambie, joint chief executive, said the group's strategy was to extend the range of services it provided to customers in the US and UK through organic growth and selective, strategic acquisitions. There are two new non-executive directors; Mr Roger Graham, formerly chairman of the BIS Group before its acquisition by ACT and Mr Anthony Reeves who was chairman of Lifetime Corporation before it merged with the Olsten Corporation. Mr Lambie said he believed the group was now better prepared to handle downturns in its chosen markets.</p>

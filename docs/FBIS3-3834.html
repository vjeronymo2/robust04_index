			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China Does Not Favor Applying Pressure on </F> Korea"]    [Text] In the past few days, the situation on the Korean  peninsula has once again become the focus of attention in the  world. Because the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  considers that the North Korean side has failed to give full  cooperation and assistance to its delegation in completing the  nuclear inspection work in North Korea, countries such as the  United States and Japan have adopted measures and resorted to  threats, one after another, trying to use blackmail and pressure  to force North Korea to change its position. The latest threat  by the United States is to send 850 U.S. troops and to ship 200  Patriot missiles to South Korea "as a deterrent force against a  missile attach by North Korea." According to reports, Japan  also is "drafting punitive measures against North Korea in the  economic area," including ending remittances from Japan to North  Korea by Koreans, stopping bilateral trade, cutting off  communications links, and halting sea and air transportation  between the two countries. The South Korean Defense Ministry  announced that since Wednesday, its Navy, Army, and Air Force  have begun to enter a "nine-day special full alert." It is not  difficult to see that all these are to deliberately create a  tense situation.    On the previous day, Chinese Premier Li Peng has explained  clearly China's position on the Korean peninsula issue which is  that China is in favor of solving the problem of nuclear  inspections on the Korean peninsula through negotiations, and is  not in favor of exerting pressure, as this will not help solve  the problem. The Chinese representative to the United Nations  has thoroughly expounded China's viewpoint at the Security  Council, hoping that other Security Council members can accept  China's idea. Using negotiations to settle international  disputes is China's consistent position. At this moment, when  swords are drawn and bows bent on both sides, greater efforts  must be made to urge both sides to sit down at the negotiating  table.    In fact, regarding this international incident, which has  been caused by the problem of IAEA nuclear inspections, the two  sides have completely different viewpoints. The IAEA, which  sent personnel to North Korea to carry out nuclear inspections,  claimed that North Korea "refused inspection of a radioactive  chemical laboratory at Yongbyon," therefore "up to now it still  is not certain whether North Korea has used nuclear materials  for military purposes." The North Korean side, however, held  that it had "enthusiastically assisted the inspection delegation  in its work," and that "the inspection delegation accomplished  successfully all the activities stipulated by the 15 February  Vienna Agreement." Under these circumstances, the sensible  method is first to clarify the truth, and not to hastily carry  out blackmail and threats.    If the IAEA wants to send someone to North Korea to carry  out  inspections once again, then it is completely possible to sit  down to discuss and study the issue. On the last occasion, it  was negotiation that worked in talking North Korea, which had  not agreed to an inspection, into accepting an inspection. Why  can the issue not be settled through negotiations this time?  Some people in the international community hope that China,  which maintains friendly relations with North Korea, will exert  pressure on North Korea. In fact, China's position is very  clear. China is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty, and China's consistent position is that it neither  encourages nor supports nuclear proliferation. Regarding the  current dispute, it should be settled through negotiations.  China and North Korea are two completely independent countries,  so the problem of exerting pressure does not exist.    The United States is now drumming up support; it says it  will  impose so-called "sanctions" on North Korea, adding that among  the permanent members of the UN Security Council, only China is  against "sanctions," but this is not correct. The news  yesterday reported that Russia, another permanent member of the  UN Security Council, also said that it "hoped to solve the  international dispute over inspection of nuclear facilities in  North Korea through talks," and they thought that "it is too  early to talk about sanctions." Naturally, inspection of nuclear  facilities in North Korea is an issue meriting people's  attention, but it is an issue that has existed for months, or  even years. Why must the Americans so hastily resort to  blackmail and threats at this moment in time, and send troops  and missiles? People know that President Clinton has met with  many difficulties abroad, and also has been battered by the  "Whitewater" incident at home. Are the Americans trying to  divert people's attention with this issue so as to cast off  their dilemma? Regarding this, we must watch very carefully.</p>

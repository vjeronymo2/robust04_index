			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Chevenement plans political come-back THE enfant terrible of the French Socialist Party, Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who resigned earlier this year as defence minister in protest against the Gulf war, is planning a come-back to national politics and shows every sign of intending to live up to his reputation. Yesterday he announced that he would be standing for parliament again, in a by-election in his old Belfort constituency, which is being voluntarily vacated by one of his loyal followers, Mrs Gilberte Marin-Moskovitz. Under the French system, a politician who becomes a minister automatically surrenders his parliamentary seat, and it is then filled by the next person on his electoral list. Only the generosity of his successor, as in this case, allows him a chance of recapturing it. Despite Mr Chevenement's resistance to official policy during the Gulf crisis, the Socialist party spokesman yesterday said that it would support his campaign.</p>

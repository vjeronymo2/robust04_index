			<p>BFN     [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa has stated  that Chile seeks to strengthen its bilateral ties with the  United States; and, within this framework, negotiating a free  trade agreement is a priority issue for the Chilean Government.  He added that an inter-ministerial team will be established to  negotiate a bilateral treaty or Chile's inclusion in NAFTA. Here  is a report by Carmen Castro:    [Begin Castro recording] Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa  said the Chilean Government seeks to consolidate its ties with  the United States at all levels. Figueroa said the Chilean  Government's overall foreign policy guidelines grant particular  importance to the strengthening of its ties with neighboring  countries, the United States, and Asia.    Within this framework and on the basis of the new  international order, Carlos Figueroa stated that Chilean policy  toward Latin America should be fully compatible with a greater  insertion in North American markets.    According to Carlos Figueroa, the Chilean Government grants  great importance to negotiating a free trade agreement with the  United States at either the bilateral level or within the  framework of NAFTA, an alternative which is being deeply studied  at the Foreign Ministry. He said there is an imperative need to  establish a solid interministerial negotiating team that will  act in a coordinated and coherent manner to this effect.    Carlos Figueroa also stated Chile faces the challenge of  consolidating its bilateral ties with the Untied States at all  levels. Figueroa said the strengthening of Chilean-U.S. ties is  not restricted to negotiating a free trade agreement but  includes other important issues like the defense of democracy,  the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the  struggle against trafficking, the insertion of Chile among the  Pacific rim countries, and other multilateral issues. Figueroa  stated that, beside constituting relevant issues by themselves,  the latter may have a considerable influence on Chile's ability  to negotiate the free trade agreement.    Figueroa said Europe continues to be a relevant area for  Chilean foreign policy but he placed a special emphasis on Asia.  Figueroa said an opening within the Asian-Pacific region  constitutes one of the main focal point of Chilean foreign  policy. He added that the Pacific Basin is undoubtedly one of  the most important international scenarios of the future. This  region encompasses over 40 interrelated countries, with a  population surpassing 2.5 billion and an economic power  concentrating over half of the World's production. Figueroa  stated that the Asian-Pacific region has experienced the  greatest economic growth and has achieved the greatest economic  dynamism over the past few decades. The economies of  Pacific-rim countries, he stressed, have played a key role in  inserting Chile in the new international scenario. [end  recording]</p>

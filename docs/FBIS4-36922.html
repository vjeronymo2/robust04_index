			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 14, IRNA -- The Islamic Republic of  Iran has pardoned German spy Helmut Szimkus, who had been  arrested here in 1989.    Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati in his meeting with  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn informed him of the pardon.    Szimkus had been condemned to death by a court after his  trial.    German Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had  previously appealed for the Szimkus' release.    A diplomatic source said after the appeal, related  authorities reviewed the case in light of the principled and  realistic stances of the Bonn government vis-a-vis Iran, and  Szimkus was eventually pardoned.    His pardon is expected to open a new chapter in Tehran-Bonn  relations despite the impediments made by the U.S. and Britain.</p>

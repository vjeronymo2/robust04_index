			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (3): The bird that would not fly  -Bronwen Maddox describes the fate of a bold Whitehall initiative Energy efficiency can be a remarkably slippery policy to promote. That is the experience of the UK government which has seen the Energy Saving Trust, an election manifesto pledge and one of the fondest creations of its environmental policy, fail to get off the ground. According to Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, the trust's progress is 'a severe disappointment - it originally represents one of the soundest programmes in the UK for delivering higher levels of energy efficiency'. The trust is intended to help the gas and electricity utilities identify projects which will help their customers use less energy. Ministers planned that the money to fund the projects would be passed on to all customers of the utilities through their bills. In January, Mr John Major, the prime minister, made clear in a high profile speech to spell out the UK's environmental strategy that he was giving the trust a central role in the UK's plans for meeting the Rio targets on global warming. Those targets specify that the UK must draw up plans to bring emissions of carbon dioxide, which is implicated in global warming, back to 1990 levels in the year 2000. According to estimates compiled by the Department of Trade and Industry, that means that the UK needs to cut around 10mtC (million tonnes of carbon) from the projected 170mtC in the year 2000. The government hopes that most of those savings will be generated by measures - themselves controversial - to raise the price of heating fuel and petrol. However, ministers have put a quarter of the burden - 2.5mtC, the biggest single element - of the required cuts on the trust's shoulders. They have also estimated that the trust will need to identify about Pounds 400m of projects a year by the end of the decade in order to reach that target. It needs to raise nearly Pounds 2bn by the end of the decade to meet government targets, according to its business plan, published in April. However, so far the trust is not on course to reach anywhere approaching that figure. According to its chief executive, Mr Eoin Lees, it has looked at 55 projects, which would cost Pounds 14m to implement. Of these, 25 have been approved by Offer, the electricity regulator. Last year, it spent Pounds 4m on pilot projects. Mr Lees says: 'I think we are on course to spend between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m in the year to March 1995.' The projects cover more efficient light bulbs, and all night lighting for security purposes in communal housing, which has proved popular with local authorities and housing associations. However, although he points out that this spending figure is in line with the spending the trust had planned to make this year, the obstacles in the way of further progress, up towards the Pounds 400m level, are considerable. According to Mr Warren, the projects approved so far 'are tiddlers. This is no more than money which was agreed 18 months ago'. Those hurdles lie in the position of the gas and electricity regulators. They are uncomfortable about allowing the costs of such projects to be passed on to all customers, even those who have not benefited from the schemes. On the electricity side, Offer has capped the amount which the utilities can spend on such projects to Pounds 22m a year until March 1998, when the industry pricing will be reviewed. The position of Ofgas, the gas regulator, is even more trenchant. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, made clear her uneasiness to such 'cost-pass-through' at repeated hearings before parliamentary select committees. She argued that regulators should not be used to impose charges which were essentially taxes. Moreover, she made clear, such a tax would be regressive, hitting the poorer families hardest. Ministers have also shown uneasiness in private about these implications. The government's separate proposal to levy value added tax on heating fuel started a still-simmering political row. Ministers are concerned that an additional hike in fuel bills would stir the controversy again. One casualty of the conflict with Ms Spottiswoode is the progress of Homes 2000, a proposed scheme to subsidise home improvements such as insulation for lofts and external walls, and energy-efficient lights and boilers. The project, which would pay up to half of the costs of these projects, would need Pounds 8m next year and Pounds 120m by 2000, the trust has indicated. There have been other concerns with the trust. It directs almost all its schemes at owner-occupiers, but, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has pointed out, owners of accommodation for private rental make the least investment in energy efficiency, and their tenants could greatly benefit from such schemes. For the moment, there is an uneasy peace. Parliamentary committees and Ofgas have concluded that in deciding whether to approve such projects, Ms Spottiswoode must balance the regulator's responsibilities to protect the customer from rising prices with those to promote energy efficiency. The trust argues that the extra sums on fuel bills need not prove controversial. Although estimates suggest that households which do not benefit from the schemes could see annual fuel bills rise by nearly 2 per cent on top of inflation by 1998, the trust says that most projects will pay for themselves through energy savings within five years. But while in theory this allows some projects to progress, the energy industry and some within the trust feel that in practice few significant ones are likely to progress. According to Mr Lees, 'the only way forward now is through new legislation. The government has to decide how it wants energy efficiency to be taken forward in the competitive market.' For that reason, he takes considerable comfort from the fact that gas regulation was included in the Queen's Speech at the opening of parliament this month. This offers the chance that regulators could be directed explicitly to allow such cost-pass through. Until then, however, the trust is effectively stalled, and its executives must devote much of their time to pleading behind the scenes with politicians to clearing a way forward. According to Mr Warren, 'of course the trust can be saved if there is political will'. It is far from clear, however, that the political will exists.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / US in bid to calm Angola after poll: Attempts to keep a defeated Unita involved in the peace process THE US South Africa and other western observers to Angola's peace process were trying to defuse tension in the rebel Unita movement yesterday as it became clear that President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the ruling MPLA party had won the war-shattered country's first democratic elections. A diplomatic offensive was under way to keep Unita locked into the process, following an inflammatory weekend broadcast by Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, which claimed the elections had been rigged, dismissed the verdict of the international community and made a veiled threat of a return to violence. Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary for African affairs, and South African President FW de Klerk both sent messages to Unita, once backed by Washington and Pretoria, urging restraint and respect for established procedures for resolving disputes. 'Savimbi is having trouble facing up the reality that Unita has been a victim of its own propaganda for the past 17 years and it does not have the support in the country it thought it had,' said a senior western diplomat yesterday. 'It a very painful process for Savimbi personally, and he is obviously confused, emotional and frustrated. But we are telling him in no uncertain terms that he must stay with the process.' Official results from 70 per cent of the country's 5,616 polling stations showed yesterday that President dos Santos was leading Mr Savimbi in the presidential race by 53.6 to 37 per cent. In the legislative elections the MPLA was ahead by 57.3 per cent to Unita's 31.5 per cent. More than 3m votes had been counted last night out of a total registered electorate of 4.86m, suggesting a turnout of 85-90 per cent. Although hundreds of results were still awaited from the Unita rural strongholds of Huambo, Cuando Cubango and Bie provinces, where Mr Savimbi was leading Mr dos Santos by at least 3 to 1, it was clear last night that Mr Dos Santos's lead could not be eroded - although a second round between the two arch-rivals was still a possibility if neither received more than 50 per cent. As Unita's defeat became certain, Mr Savimbi said the country was facing 'a grave hour' and he alleged the MPLA was cheating, stealing ballot boxes, deviating votes and inflating numbers. He warned: 'If the MPLA wants to opt for war, it knows that such a war will never be won.' He also said that if the National Electoral Commission did not address his allegations it would 'lead Unita to take a position which will deeply disturb the situation in this country'. He added: 'There are men and women in this country who are ready to give up their lives so that the country can redeem itself.' Yesterday morning Unita presented a dossier of what they termed 'fraudulent incidents' to the NEC, the most serious of which concerned the removal of 20 ballot boxes from polling stations in Malange province during the first night of the two-day election. Western diplomats said irregularities in the elections were always considered inevitable in a country with no tradition of democracy and an infrastructure lying in ruins. But they stressed that isolated incidents of irregularities would not be sufficient to cast doubt over the entire electoral process, and that the overwhelming verdict of international observers had been that the voting and counting was generally free and fair. Mr Onofre dos Santos, NEC director general, said yesterday he was taking the Unita allegations very seriously and had begun investigations.</p>

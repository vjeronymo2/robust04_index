			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Golf: The making of Fred Moneybags NINE YEARS ago, on one of his earliest forays on the US tour, Nick Faldo found himself paired in the Greater Greensboro Open in North Carolina with a young man named Fred Couples. Couples was 23 and in his third season as a pro. Faldo was outdriven and outputted but, since it was one of his first tournaments of the year, he was not unduly worried. 'What is this Fred Couples like?' Faldo was asked after be had completed his round. 'He is the strong silent type,' Faldo replied. 'He does not say much and he hits the ball miles.' As an afterthought, Faldo added: 'Oh yes, and he looks just like Elliott in the film ET.' Couples, the new US Masters champion, has not changed much since then. His backswing remains long although his hair is a little shorter; he looks like Elliott 10 years on. He is uncomfortable at being the centre of attention and hates telephones. 'I will not answer the 'phone,' he says. 'There may be someone on the other end.' And he does not read much. 'I don't know how,' he says, only half joking. Couples could probably afford to pay someone to read to him. He has won more money in a shorter time than anyone else in golf - more than Pounds 560,000 since January 1. In spite of this, he is one of the least affected of men, quietly-spoken, undemonstrative, self-effacing. He is the sort of fellow who loses his car keys, forgets to enter tournaments, turns up on the wrong day, leaves his passport at home. In 1980 Couples, then an amateur, entered a tournament in California. When he was told that the tournament was limited to pros, he turned pro on the spot. Someone once said that behind every successful man is a woman. Behind Fred Couples is Debbie, an accomplished polo player who owns and trains ponies, collects antiques, owns and runs an antique business and, in addition, provides the impetus to keep her husband on his toes. 'She is Fred's spark plug,' says Couples' former caddie. 'He was sitting around on a couch watching soaps on TV,' Debbie said once, explaining her role in her husband's success. 'I told him he had to get motivated. I decided he was the horse to put our money on.' You listen to what Debbie says, just as you cannot ignore her. She is a striking blonde who wears big hats and short skirts and is prone to giving wolf whistles when Fred birdies a hole. Even in a country where making a lot of noise is normal and acceptable, her whistles and cheers are exceptional. The staid world of golf was shaken by the way she celebrated her husband's first tournament victory. After he had holed the winning putt, she raced on to the green and jumped up, her arms around his neck, her legs around his waist. Officials at the Masters were terrified at what she might do if Fred won last Sunday. Their tournament is a model of decorum, or so they like to think. The Masters is where guards stop you running and a television commentator was banned - not by his network but by club officials after he had referred to a section of the spectators as a mob. Men in green jackets took Debbie to one side and warned her against any out-of-the-ordinary behaviour. Golf's appeal to the marketing fraternity is demonstrated by a deal struck between Couples and a golf manufacturer named Lynx. Couples, the player of the moment after outstanding performances in last year's Ryder Cup and winning the world championship in Jamaica last December, was signed by Lynx earlier this year. He would receive Pounds 580,000 annually for four years from the club manufacturer in return for using its clubs. Nice money for Couples. Last month, Couples found a rich vein of form, finishing first in two tournaments and second in two others. In those four televised tournaments he wore a visor, golf bag, glove and umbrella all bearing the name Lynx, as well as using Lynx clubs. The amount of exposure on TV he and his Lynx products received was nearly six minutes. Had Lynx been forced to buy a similar amount of advertising time, it would have cost an estimated Pounds 272,941. Couples can do no wrong at present. Another one of his endorsements is with Ashworth, a clothes manufacturer. In 1987, when Couples was a par five away from success, Ashworth's sales were barely Pounds 600,000 annually. Now, with Couples riding high, they total Pounds 10m. Couples has become the sweetheart of US golf. He has come through the torment of hitting a nine iron 20 yards wide of the 18th green in the 1989 Ryder Cup and thus losing to Christy O'Connor Jnr. The signs are that he could become the best American since Tom Watson at his peak 10 years ago. If he does, Debbie Couples will be behind him, whistling and cheering every step of the way.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: John Surman's Brass Project - Jazz Saxophonist John Surman tells a story about touring in Norway. Arriving at a club in a town near the arctic circle he found his audience amounted to one solitary figure, sitting at a table in the corner. 'Look,' said Surman, 'There is really no point in me playing. Why don't we just have drink together and a chat?'. 'Suits me,' said the Norwegian, 'I was meant to be your pianist tonight.' The story, typical of Surman's self-deprecating humour, belies the huge following the multi-instrumentalist has across Europe. At 50, Somerset born Surman finds himself one of a few great saxophonists who can run nimbly with a baritone. A protean improvisor, he also moves gracefully between soprano sax and bass clarinet within a single composition and works as much magic in an arranged orchestral setting as he does unaccompanied. Described in the 1960s as one of the common market jazz musicians, Surman's playing and writing owes as much to European choral music and Scottish jigs as it does Chicago blues. The young Surman reached his late teens without ever hearing a note of jazz and instead sung soprano in the choir for fun. It was not until his voice broke that he picked up a clarinet and subsequently tuned into syncopation. Later he listened to folk music and made a conscious decision to be absorbed in what he describes as 'a different kind of blues'. The result is a distinctively Euro-centric composer and improvisor whose playing has as much resonance for fans of Vaughan Williams as devotees of 'Trane. This 50th birthday concert tour captures Surman solo, in sublimely pastoral duet with pianist John Taylor and also in quartet with the addition of old friends Chris Laurence (bass) and John Marshall (drums). But the real draw on this tour is Surman's ten piece labour of love, The Brass Project. The conspicuously piano-less brass choir is robustly arranged (and directed) by John Warren. Opening at the Norwich Arts Centre of Friday the ensemble surrounded Warren with a great, rich panorama of sound. Surging trombones gave deep colour background to sheets of sound from Surman's bass clarinet; vivid trumpets pierced their chattering choruses. The momentum from Laurence's bass was dizzying. Surman is an inveterate tourer but without funding it is hard to put a big band like this on the road often. Hear it while you can.

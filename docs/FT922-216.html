			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / EC ministers agree capital requirements EC FINANCE ministers yesterday set minimum capital requirements for banks and firms dealing in securities, but had still not resolved the terms on which shares could be traded across the Community. The last piece of a ministerial accord on the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) fell into place when ministers agreed levels of start-up capital for new dealers in securities. These were set at Ecu50,000 (Pounds 35,100) for firms acting as middlemen, but not allowed to hold clients money or securities themselves; Ecu125,000 for firms dealing on investors' orders or managing portfolios; and Ecu730,000 for large firms allowed to take market positions on their own account. The UK expressed itself satisfied these had been brought down from levels earlier demanded by Spain and some other countries. Earlier this month ministers agreed other aspects of the CAD, which is to provide the prudential underpinning for investment firms - banks as well as stockbrokers  -to get a 'single passport' to trade EC-wide. On the highly political issue of aligning indirect tax rates attempts were made to get Britain to drop its objection to the Community legislating on value added tax (VAT) rates.</p>

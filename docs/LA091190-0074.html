			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC;  </P> <P> SOVIERO'S REPLACEMENT IS A BONUS FOR S.D. OPERA FANS  </P> <P> With the desertion of soprano Diana Soviero from San Diego Opera's upcoming "La  Traviata" production, local audiences will have the opportunity to hear soprano  Christine Weidinger. The opera's general director, Ian Campbell, engaged  Weidinger to replace Soviero, the headstrong diva who broke her local contract  for a chance to sing at the Paris Opera.  </P> <P> If this news upset some San Diego Opera subscribers, the choice of Weidinger  should ease their distress.  </P> <P> A regular singer with the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, Weidinger made a  stunning impression in the company's 1989 production of Rossini's "Tancredi."  Although the production was tailor-made for mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who  sang the title role, and featured the budding coloratura tenor Chris Merritt,  Weidinger's brilliant singing outshone that of the vaunted superstars. Later  this month, Weidinger returns to the Music Center Opera stage to sing Elettra  in Mozart's "Idomeneo."  </P> <P> A native of Phoenix, Weidinger won the Metropolitan Opera auditions in 1972 and  made her Met debut the following season as Musetta in Puccini's "La Boheme."  The able soprano did graduate work at California State University at  Northridge, but like many American singers, Weidinger nurtured her career  abroad. She has sung in most of the German-speaking opera houses from the  Deutsche Oper Berlin to Hamburg Opera, Frankfurt Opera and the Vienna State  Opera. In Italy she has sung bel canto roles and has performed a fair sampling  of Verdi roles on the French opera stage.  </P> <P> Vocally, Soviero has always been a welcome addition to the San Diego Opera  stage, although her mercurial temperament offstage has been no secret. Her  current cavalier behavior seems doubly culpable, however. If diva Soviero  thought she was doing San Diego a favor by agreeing to sing the title role in  this season's "La Traviata" production, she asked the local company for a favor  in return. Soviero's management specifically requested that Bernard Uzan,  Soviero's husband, be contracted as stage director for the production. Campbell  granted this request, and Uzan is still slated to make his directorial debut  here next year in "La Traviata."  </P> <P> As opera buffs know, the meaning of traviata is "wayward woman." Perhaps  Soviero has taken the character of one of her signature roles a bit too  seriously.  </P> <P> Going it alone. Though many performing musicians eagerly seek the shelter and  security of a university teaching position, pianist Nicolas Reveles is bucking  the trend. After spending more than a decade on the faculty of the University  of San Diego, Reveles has resigned his post -- tenure and all -- to assume the  unfettered role of a free-lance musician. Sunday at 7 p.m. in San Diego's First  United Methodist Church, Reveles will play a solo recital of Beethoven,  Schubert and Ravel. Performance is a musical activity he intends to increase in  his post-pedagogical phase.  </P> <P> In parallel fashion, Reveles has taken a general leave of absence from his  responsibilities as a priest in the San Diego diocese. The 42-year-old musician  stated that throughout his career he has enjoyed a creative tension between his  musical calling and his priestly vocation.  </P> <P> "But for last few years it has been a negative one, and these two aspects of my  life have been at loggerheads. Although my priestly obligations on the  university campus have been minimal, on weekends I was always on call to say  Mass wherever I was needed throughout the diocese."  </P> <P> Part of Reveles' mid-life gear-shifting was motivated by the need to devote  himself to the regimen of keyboard practice required by a serious performer and  to complete composition projects that remained in limbo for lack of time. In  addition to his teaching load at USD and his administrative duties for the  music department, he ran the school's liturgical music program as an  educational arm of the San Diego diocese.  </P> <P> Beneath the surface of these pragmatic concerns, however, Reveles admitted his  disenchantment with the Catholic church's overall lack of appreciation for  whole artistic endeavor.  </P> <P> "In the 20th Century, I think the church has really blown it in terms of the  arts. For many centuries the church was at the forefront of promoting the arts.  I think the understanding that the church has of the arts is very limited."  </P> <P> In addition to musical performance, Reveles will continue scoring and composing  for the stage. For the Old Globe's production last season of C.P. Taylor's "And  a Nightingale Sang," Reveles did the musical arrangements and recorded the  piano music "played" by one of the actors. Since the Old Globe and USD have  cooperated for the last three years in the university's M.F.A. drama  curriculum, Reveles has worked on a number of scores for these student  productions, has taught scoring to the student composers and has coached the  actors in singing. Even though he has resigned from USD, he will continue to  work with the drama program as an adjunct professor, the academic  responsibility that brought him the most satisfaction when he taught for the  music department.  </P> <P> Reveles' recitals after Sunday's Linder Hall performance at First United  Methodist include a program of Christmas music for piano at St. Brigid's Church  in Pacific Beach in December and an all-Mozart recital in February at San Diego  Public Library.  </P> <P> pichar  </P> <P> Culture in East County. The 12-piece ensemble Symphony Brass will inaugurate  the fall classical concert series Monday with an 8:30 p.m. concert at El  Cajon's East County Performing Arts Center. Conductor Ethan Dulsky will lead  his brass buddies in a basically Baroque program that ranges from Benedetto  Marcello to J. S. Bach. The concert series promises to bring a range of world  music from Kawambe African Drum and Dance Ensemble, Oct. 1, to South Indian  violinist Vjayam Ramaswanny, Oct. 15. The series is one of the most economical  in the area -- nine concerts for a mere $60 -- and is also offered in  conjunction with music appreciation courses at San Diego State University and  Grossmont College.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Madras, Jan. 12--The Narcotics Control Bureau (South  zone) has started an all-out war on drug trafficking in Tamil  Nadu, with Tuticorin emerging as a gateway for smuggling of  heroin, opium and ganja into Sri Lanka.    During last year, the bureau busted nine drug rings having  international links and arrested 27 traffickers, most of them  Sri Lankan Tamils. The syndicates involved local financiers,  middlemen, couriers and their counterparts across the sea. The  seizures included heroin worth Rs.14.85 crores and opium valued  at Rs.2.5 crores (international prices), besides destruction of  26 tonnes of ganja on the Western Ghats.    Consequent to the beefing up of security along the West  Coast  following the serial bomb blasts in Bombay in March last, the  drug traffickers have moved towards the East coast, especially  south India.    Investigation showed that much of the drug trafficking  originated in Delhi, Bombay and Madhya Pradesh from where  couriers arrived by air in Madras and other cities and moved the  contraband, with the help of local contactmen, by bus or other  vehicles to selected coastal points for being smuggled into Sri  Lanka by boat. A well-knit group of smugglers helped in the job.    In the end of 1992 and early part of last year, the  Directorate of Revenue Intelligence effected some sensational  seizures. In October 1992, as much as 252.440 kg of opium, was  seized at Tuticorin and Madras and two persons were arrested.  The drugs were meant to be shipped to Sri Lanka.    In February last year, seven kg of brown sugar and 31 kg of  opium were seized near Tuticorin and four persons nabbed. Again  in May, 66.100 kg of heroin was seized near Salem and in  follow-up searches, 361.00 kg of opium recovered in Pudukottai  and Dindigul-Anna district, leading to the arrest of nine  persons. The drugs in these cases originated from Madhya Pradesh  and were to be sent by sea to Colombo from Tuticorin.    The following table shows the seizures made in 1992-93,  thanks to the implementation of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic  Substances Act by all enforcement agencies in the four southern  States.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Name of the drug  |Number of cases   |Number of persons |Quantity in kg    |  |                  |                  |arrested          |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Heroin            |83                |111               |40.596            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ganja             |3,777             |3,849             |11581.054         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Opium             |12                |13                |326.920           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Despite constraints in terms of manpower and machinery, the  bureau has achieved remarkable success in controlling the drug  trafficking, depending exclusively on its intelligence and  surveillance. But unfortunately, in most of the cases, the Sri  Lankan Tamils managed to secure bail, jump it and reach home  stealthily with the cooperation of local fishermen, says Mr.  P.V.K. Reddy, Deputy Director, NCB (South Zone), Madras.    Since 1992, the bureau has neutralised six drug trafficking  rings with the arrest of 20 persons, of whom four were detained  under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and  Psychotropic Substances, Act, 1988.    Extradition: During his recent two-day visit to  Colombo to attend the SAARC (South Asian Association for  Regional Cooperation) technical committee meeting on ways to  combat drug trafficking, Mr. Reddy held wide ranging discussions  with Sri Lankan Police and Narcotic Bureau officials including  on the need for extraditing Sri Lankan Tamils who escaped into  the island after being let on bail in Tamil Nadu. He said the  1988 United Nations Convention on drugs empowered countries to  extradite drug offenders. It appeared the Sri Lankan authorities  were unaware of the fact that narcotic drugs were periodically  smuggled to European countries from Colombo.    According to one source, drugs are smuggled in crates  transporting the island's traditional exports like tea, rubber  and coconut husk. Another modus operandi was to  transport narcotic drugs in fishing boats and then load them  mid-sea in ships bound for European destinations.    The origin of the drug trafficking could be traced to the  massive influx of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees into Tamil Nadu  following the ethnic turmoil that erupted in the early 80s. Some  of them, having found their economic roots totally cut off, saw  an easy means of sustaining themselves by drug trafficking with  the help of many relatives who had found refuge in West European  countries.</p>

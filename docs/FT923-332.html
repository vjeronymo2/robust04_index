			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How vocational training can pay - In A Nutshell Many people engaged in vocational training are not making use of tax breaks which are available, according to the Inland Revenue. UK residents who do not receive any other government assistance awards can claim a discount on training towards National Vocational Qualifications and their Scottish equivalent. Trainees complete a form provided by the training organisation and deduct 25 per cent (the basic rate of tax) from their study, examination and assessment fees. Even non-taxpayers can get this discount while higher rate taxpayers can get relief at the higher rate through their tax office.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will introduce  foreign funds to speed up the construction of top-priority  infrastructure projects, according to Mayor Li Qiyan.    These projects include a subway, a number of expressways,  waste water treatment systems and the pulldown of dilapidated  houses to build new residential areas, he said after visiting  four cities -- Vienna, Paris, Berlin and Cologne earlier this  month.    "Only by drawing on all outstanding achievements in human  civilization will it be possible for Beijing to grow faster," he  said.    He also pledged to draw on successful experience in urban  construction of the four cities in order to turn Beijing into a  "modern international metropolis" as soon as possible.    He recalled that during his meetings with German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl and Austrian Chancellor Franz Vrantzky, the two  chancellors expressed full support for the expansion of  cooperation between the Chinese capital and the capitals of  Germany and Austria.    Meanwhile, mayors of the four cities also pledged to expand  cooperation with Beijing in science, technology, economy and  culture, he said.    Beijing signed nine cooperation agreements with companies in  France and Germany during the mayor's visit, involving a total  investment of nearly 300 million U.S. dollars, he said.    Under these agreements, companies in Beijing and their  counterparts in France and Germany will co-produce cans, machine  tools, electrical appliances, pharmaceuticals and adhesives.    Government statistics show that Germany, France and Austria  have invested 270 million U.S. dollars in 138 joint ventures in  Beijing.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Observer: Undercover Delors England must feel increasingly like enemy territory to the president of the European Commission. On a brief visit to Oxford on Saturday Jacques Delors had to be smuggled in and out of the university to avoid demonstrators from the 'Campaign for an Independent Britain'. Admittedly there were only a dozen agitators, but that was a dozen more than there were EC star-spangled blue banner wavers. The purpose of Delors's secret mission was to attend a small seminar on 'relations between science, ethics and society' - one of a series of EC-inspired powwows in ancient university towns. Others have included 'law and democracy' in Poznan and 'the EC and the South' in Salamanca. Delors likes to look in on these seminars, and plans to round them off with a grand conference early next year.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brackenbridge to expand as new chairman is appointed Shares of Brackenbridge, the bridalwear retailer formerly known as Cupid, firmed 2p to 13 1/2p yesterday on the appointment of Mr George Wardale as executive chairman. Mr Wardale has overseen a smart recovery at French Connection, the USM-traded fashion clothing group, since taking the chair in February 1992. Mr Hugh Osmond, one of a team of investors which effectively rescued Cupid after it breached banking covenants, confirmed that the group would be seeking acquisitions. 'We haven't brought George on board just to run the existing business,' he said, adding that any purchase would be 'bigger rather than smaller'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 May Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano granted  MAINICHI SHIMBUN an interview. Touching on the Nanjing massacre  in China caused by the former Japanese Army during the Pacific  War, the minister said: "I think that certain reports, such as  the one about the Nanjing massacre, are fabricated." That an  incumbent cabinet member has openly denied the existence of the  Nanjing massacre will not only arouse repulsion from the Chinese  Government and others, but will become a controversial issue in  Japan.    With regard to the Pacific War, Justice Minister Nagano  stated: "It is wrong to call it a war of aggression. If you say  that the war was launched for the purpose of aggression, that is  incorrect. It was started while serious consideration was given  to the idea of liberating colonies or liberating the  co-prosperity sphere (in greater East Asia). Then, touching on  the Nanjing massacre, he added: "I think it was fabricated."  In explaining his reasoning why he said this, Minister Nagano  stated: "Because I went to Nanjing immediately after the  incident."    With regard to the Pacific War, (then) Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa clearly stated last August at the first news  conference held after his inauguration: "It is my understanding  that it was a war of aggression, and an unjust war."    The Nanjing massacre occurred in December 1937 when the  former Japanese Army attacked and captured Nanjing, China's  capital at that time, massacring a large number of Nanjing  residents and prisoners of war. According to a Chinese  announcement, "over 300,000 people" were killed. However, some  have argued against this organized massacre.    Justice Minister Nagano was a graduate of the Military  Academy of the former Japanese Army. During the Pacific War, he  was sent to combat in China. After the war, he joined the  Self-Defense Forces and once acted as Chief of Staff of the  Ground Self-Defense Force. As a Diet member from the Liberal  Democratic Party, he once remarked at a session of the party's  Research Commission on the Constitution: "Some harbor an  incorrect view about the history of the Greater East Asia War  [Dai-toa senso]. Therefore, we should not adopt a one-sided  position in discussing the war."</p>

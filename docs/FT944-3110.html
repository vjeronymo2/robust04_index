			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Elections catch up with India's slow reforms: Liberalisation moves are seen as an irrelevance by most disaffected rural voters Three days after his party suffered a serious defeat in state elections, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, has yet to utter a word in public. In his usual quiet way, the 73-year-old veteran is taking stock of the mood of the party and the country before making a move. Mr Rao has at least one crumb of comfort: bad as the results were for the ruling Congress (I) party, the prime minister's own job does not seem at risk. Even though the party's worst performance was in Mr Rao's home state Andhra Pradesh, a brief flurry of suggestions that he should quit has blown away. But Mr Rao's critics in the party want changes - and want them soon, in time to influence another round of elections in five more states in February, as well as the next general election which is due by mid-1996. As Mr Narain Dutt Tiwari, Congress party chief in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, says: 'We simply cannot win any elections with our present image.' While Mr Tiwari is a known opponent of Mr Rao, many Congress members echo privately what Mr Tiwari has said in public. Mr Rao's supporters counter that the state elections were fought mainly over local issues and warn against over-reacting in Delhi. But even they concede that adjustments may be necessary, particularly in the presentation of the government's economic programme. The prime minister's opponents believe that the pro-market reforms Mr Rao has pursued for the past three years have insufficient appeal to the great mass of rural Indians, who constitute 75 per cent of the total electorate. As far as these farmers and labourers are concerned, liberalisation of foreign trade and investment is an irrelevance. The biggest economic change they have witnessed since reform started in 1991 has been a 90 per cent increase in the prices of food and fuel, which have been pushed up by government subsidy cuts. Mr Rao's critics say the reforms are therefore seen as 'anti-poor' and must be given 'a human face'. A few are even demanding the resignation of Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister. The mere suggestion that Mr Singh might be forced to resign or to launch a drastic overhaul of economic policy has sent the stock market tumbling. The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading shares closed up 31.42 points yesterday at 3,861.47 after five consecutive falls. It is still down 5.5 per cent on a week ago. This may be an over-reaction. A few grumbles about Mr Singh do not constitute an attempt to dislodge him. Mr Rao has stood by him in difficult times - notably last December when he declined Mr Singh's resignation after parliamentary criticism of the way the finance minister handled the 1992 Bombay securities market scandal. Moreover, even if Mr Singh were to go, there is broad cross-party consensus about the need for economic liberalisation. So although there may be arguments over presentation, the direction of pro-market reforms is not at risk. But what could be threatened is the fiscal discipline which has underpinned liberalisation. In his first two years, Mr Singh squeezed public spending, cutting the fiscal deficit from 8.4 per cent of gross domestic product to 5.7 per cent in 1992-93. But in the year to March 1994 it returned to 7.3 per cent as spending cuts slowed. This year's generous target of 6 per cent seems attainable because of a recovery in tax payments. The danger is next year when the political pressures to spend in advance of the general election may be irresistible. The 1995-96 budget, due in February at the time of the next round of state elections, will be crucial. Apart from the economy, the Congress party is considering three issues which may have lost votes this week - corruption, caste and the handling of the 1992 destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. Opinion polls showed that many voters were angry at corruption in government. Mostly they were concerned about corruption at the local level, such as bribes paid to petty officials and commissions collected by district politicians. But Mr Rao is under attack in Delhi over corruption in the central government. Opposition parties have repeatedly urged him to dismiss two ministers who were named in the parliamentary report into the Bombay securities scandal - Mr B. Shankaranand, the health minister, and Mr Rameshwar Thakur, the junior finance minister. Also, the prime minister is under pressure in parliament to explain how the government mishandled a sugar shortage earlier this year. Government imports of sugar were delayed for weeks while prices rose to the benefit of private producers and importers. Mr A K Antony, minister for civil supplies, resigned yesterday, saying he bore moral responsibility for the sugar scandal. An official report named him and other senior officials in imports deals. However, there are fears within Congress that even if the party acts on its economic record and corruption, it will still fail to rebuild support it has lost among India's lower castes and Moslems. Once the bedrock of Congress party support, these communities have been fickle in recent years and deserted Congress in droves in the two biggest of the four states in which elections have just been held - Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Moslems have been alienated by Mr Rao's failure to rebuild the Ayodhya mosque after it was pulled down by militant Hindus. It is hard to see how Mr Rao can win back their support without angering the much larger Hindu community. With caste-based communities he faces a similar problem of matching competing demands. Once Congress won favour with the poor with modest hand-outs of subsidies and public works projects. But as the lower castes have become more politically active so their demands have grown. The result is that politicians become embroiled in increasingly bitter arguments about sharing out the pie of patronage. As Mr Singh has said, only increased economic growth can provide the means to satisfy these competing demands. Until now he has persuaded the Congress party to wait patiently for his policies to deliver growth. He says India will see the benefits in the late 1990s. After these elections it is not clear that his party colleagues are prepared to wait that long.</p>

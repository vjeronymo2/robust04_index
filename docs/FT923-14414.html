			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Letter: Disclosing who they are and what they earn Sir, Lex ('Leave it to the board', July 6) says that if shareholders do not trust the directors they should not buy their shares. Very true. In the case of the latest flotations the names of the directors are not disclosed in their invitation to subscribe. One cannot trust someone whose name, let alone whose antecedents, one does not know. Ernest G Gobert, 3 Beechwood Drive, Marlow, Bucks SL7 2DH</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UP TO SPEED;  </P> <P> USE OF DRUGS INCREASING AT DESERT MARINE CORPS BASE, OFFICIALS SAY  </P> <P> Methamphetamine use, a growing practice recently among Marines stationed here,  is now the base's most widespread illegal drug problem, military officials say.  </P> <P> The Air Ground Combat Center, a training base for about 9,000 Marines, is in  the high desert about 100 miles east of San Bernardino, an area authorities say  is a center for illegal methamphetamine labs because of its isolation and  sparse population.  </P> <P> "There's so much of the drug in the area you have to figure it's going to  eventually impact the base," said 1st Lt. James Western, who heads the base's  drug and alcohol counseling center. "On East Coast bases, crack is the big  problem, but out here the problem is 'meth.' "  </P> <P> Last month, 10 Marines tested positive for methamphetamine use on random  urinalysis tests, base officials said. And, according to the Naval  Investigative Service, about 20 Marines at Twentynine Palms have been arrested  in the last two years for distributing the drug.  </P> <P> But Marines on base say those caught represent only a fraction of users.  </P> <P> "You see guys dragging in on Monday, wasted, saying they haven't slept or ate  the whole weekend," said one Marine, who requested anonymity. "It makes you  real nervous when you're out on a night fire with guys like that and they're  shooting off missiles."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deputies Break Up Ring  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies broke up a  methamphetamine ring near Twentynine Palms and arrested 35 people who had been  selling the drug. Although no one from the base was arrested, a number of  Marines had made purchases from the dealers.  </P> <P> "We found out that some of the dealers were selling regularly to Marines," said  Larry Bowman, a senior deputy in the sheriff's narcotics unit.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps will not release statistics on the number of Marines who have  been discharged because of drug use. But base officials have recognized that  methamphetamine, or speed, use is a major problem and they have "told our  department to address it," Western said.  </P> <P> Random urinalysis testing is more frequent now, he said, including occasional  "unit sweeps," where entire battalions are tested. Drug awareness classes are  mandatory for both officers and noncommissioned officers. And, Western said,  base leaders have allocated more resources for drug treatment and enforcement.  </P> <P> The base offers counseling and an outpatient treatment program. Marines with  more serious drug problems are sent to the drug-treatment center at the Miramar  Naval Air Station in San Diego.  </P> <P> Those who voluntarily seek treatment generally are not prosecuted, Western  said. But Marines found using drugs "often are discharged or court-martialed,"  he said. "They have to have extraordinary potential . . . to be allowed to stay  in."  </P></p>

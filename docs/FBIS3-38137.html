			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by E.D. "Male, Atheist, Fortyish"] </F>   [Text] The following poll was conducted by the IFOP [French  Public Opinion Institute] polling organization on 16 January  among 2,382 participants in the demonstration.    The typical demonstrator on 16 January [protesting  government  aid to private schools] was a man (60 percent), 35 to 49 (45  percent), working in the public sector (58 percent) and, more  specifically, was an educator (42 percent). In addition, he had  a college education (63 percent) and children in public school  (59 percent). One is struck, however, by the low proportion of  young people and modest wage earners. Sunday's demonstration was  socially elitist: Only 14 percent of the demonstrators were  laborers and employees, compared with 26 percent who were middle  or senior managers. The demonstration was also dominated by the  world of education: 53 percent of the participants, when  students and teachers are pooled together.    The political profile of the demonstrators is just as  precise. Three- fourths of them were leftist sympathizers. IFOP  pollsters only found 2 percent among them who were rightist  sympathizers. Thus it would not be surprising to note that  nearly half of the demonstrators voted for the Socialist Party  [PS] in the last legislative elections.    In the same vein, 88 percent of the people queried placed  themselves "on the left" in the classic left-right axis. Some 61  percent stated they practice "no religion," against only 8  percent of practicing Catholics and 24 percent of nonpracticing  Catholics. Indeed, the demonstration had an element of  irreligiosity.    Only 14 percent of the participants said this was their  first  demonstration. Some 30 percent said they "rarely" participate in  demonstrations and 55 percent that they demonstrate "regularly."  They did not hesitate long before participating: 81 percent made  the decision "as soon as the announcement was made," 11 percent  "in the last couple of weeks" and only 7 percent "in recent  days."    Nearly half the demonstrators were affiliated with a trade  union, one- fourth with a parents-of-students organization, and  roughly one-fifth with a political party. The 16 January  demonstration did not attract disorganized and inexperienced  people at the last minute.    Its goal was very precise: the overwhelming majority of the  participants (88 percent) were present "to defend public  schools," a percentage that climbs to 95 percent among educators  and to 92 percent among the parents of students. The will to  oppose the government comes far behind, even among thse most to  the left. The extremely low level of the political motivation of  those wishing to help the left recoup its losses should also be  noted. The demonstration was not political.</p>

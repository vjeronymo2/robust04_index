			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (5): Planners hope for EC assistance - The government sees Thessaloniki as a transit centre for the Balkans TAKE ONE look at a map of the Balkans, and the potential role of Thessaloniki as a hub for trade and communications becomes clear. The city is an obvious outlet to the Mediterranean for the former Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria. It also sits astride what could become the main land transport route from Italy to Turkey. The break-up of Yugoslavia has had mixed consequences for Thessaloniki. On one hand, a lively exchange of goods and services was slowed by the outbreak of war and, since July, virtually halted as a result of the UN embargo against Serbia - an important trading partner for Greece. On the other, Serbia's loss of access to the Adriatic ports of Koper and Rijeka, now in the independent republics of Slovenia and Croatia respectively, should mean that under normal conditions Thessaloniki could expect to handle much of Serbia's international trade. That, at any rate, is the view of the Greek government, now revising its infrastructure development policy for northern Greece. The premise is that Thessaloniki can become a transit centre for the Balkans, resuming a role it played most successfully in the Byzantine period. There is a sense of urgency in the air, because much of the funding must be approved by Greece's European Community partners this year. Greece hopes to get up to Dollars 14bn in EC assistance from 1993 to 1998 under the second Delors package for improving infrastructure in poorer EC member countries. Thessaloniki Port Authority, one of Greece's profitable state-controlled enterprises, with earnings of over Dr1bn (Pounds 3m) annually, has already launched its own Dr30bn development plan. Its later stages are to be included in the new EC funding. 'Our contribution to the development plan amounts to self-financing, because we don't have to ask for allocations from the public investment budget,' says Mr John Marinides, director of the port's free zone. Last year, dry cargo traffic through Thessaloniki totalled 6.5m tonnes. The projection for 1992 is 7.2m tonnes. Despite the loss of Serbian shipments, dry cargo traffic through Thessaloniki port was up by 15 per cent in the first seven months of this year. Oil shipments, which totalled 7.5m tonnes in 1991, rose by 11 per cent in the same period, Mr Marinides said. The port's chronic labour problems have eased somewhat in the past year. Although the 1,000 stevedores still work only one daily shift, with overtime considered a built-in part of the wage scale, the container terminal now operates around the clock. Container traffic soared in the first eight months of 1992. Cargoes from Romania and Bulgaria have increased, as Thessaloniki becomes a transshipment centre for both countries. Their exporters are no longer required to use the facilities of state-owned enterprises, whether railways, transport agencies or ports, or to follow designated itineraries imposed by the government. The development plan for Thessaloniki port aims at doubling capacity for receiving overland cargoes, adding new warehouses to store bulky and heavy cargoes and building a new Dr600m railway terminal for handling freight close to the quayside. The main pier for handling container shipments is to be extended. Dredging operations will deepen the harbour to 14 metres so that larger vessels can be handled. A Dr5.2bn earthfill operation will create additional space for warehouses. Nine new gantry and mobile cranes will be installed. 'By the end of the decade we should be able to cater for up to 4,000 ships and handle 9m tonnes of dry cargo a year,' said Mr Marinides. The EC is also expected to continue funding a highway-building programme launched in the 1980s. Thessaloniki is the only city in Greece to boast a dual-carriageway ring road, opened last year, together with a highway to Halkidiki, the main northern Greek resort area, 100km from the city. 'There's an orgy of road-building going on. There are so many years of neglect to be made up for,' says Mr George Misaelides, secretary general for infrastructure projects in central Macedonia. The challenge for the government is to secure EC approval for completion of the Egnatia highway, named after the imperial Roman road that crossed the Balkans from Durres in Albania to Thessaloniki and Istanbul. The revised route would start at Igoumenitsa, a small western Greek port due to be upgraded as a ferry terminal for truck traffic. Scattered sections of the highway already exist, constructed in the haphazard way of past governments anxious to secure votes through funding small-scale public works in carefully selected districts. Thessaloniki airport, used by more than 1.5m passengers a year but still lacking a runway that can handle wide-body jets, is also in need of attention. There are daily flights to a dozen western European cities, but only rudimentary aircraft-parking and maintenance facilities. However, the most far-reaching plan for exploiting Thessaloniki's position will involve much more than physical infrastructure. An EC-financed study is under way, to examine the possibility of basing a Balkan trade centre and mercantile exchange in the city. Trade originating in the Balkan countries amounted to Dollars 82.3bn in 1989. But only Dollars 16.9bn of that amount passed through Greece, while Greece's own trade with the Balkan countries totalled just Dollars 1.6bn. 'The Balkan countries are going to be producing substantial amounts of low-value added goods for some time to come. Finding markets for them would be much easier through an exchange forum in the region,' says Mr Costas Mitropoulos, of Kantor Management Consultants, who are preparing the study. While financial services in Thessaloniki are improving fast, with almost 30 Greek and foreign banks in the city, it would take a sizeable effort of political will to establish a regulatory framework and a system for handling transactions generated by an international exchange centre. Much will depend on how quickly political stability and economic reforms take root in the region, allowing the Balkan countries to join the international trading system without the hindrances of bilateral agreements and foreign exchange shortages. Greece, for its part, can set an example by eliminating the politically-inspired bureaucracy that, in the communist era, significantly hampered the growth of trade with its Balkan neighbours.</p>

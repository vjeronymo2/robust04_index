			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Tokyo - Other Markets Subscribers who have been reallocated Japan Tobacco shares for the second round of sales have until Thursday to purchase the stock. The ministry of finance announced last week that 66.2 per cent of the Japan Tobacco shares offered had been unsold. Mr Jason James at James Capel expects, however, that investors will remain unenthusiastic, and that Y300bn of the issue will remain unsold. While Japan Tobacco's saga has had little impact on the broader stock market, the ministry has yet to decide whether to release the unsold shares on to the secondary market following the listing of JT on October 27. Any such move this week could dent investor confidence. Meanwhile, earnings revisions will continue to exert an influence on share prices this week, as will the yen's movements.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Investors poised to flood into Russia if rules are tightened Foreign investment capital is forecast to 'flood' into the Russian market if the government can reform regulations which cast doubt on the legality of share and property purchases by foreigners. Prospective investors and analysts have poured into Moscow in the past two months to examine the Russian market. But they are hampered by rules that often fail to conform to foreign, especially US, legislation governing the activities of pension and other investment funds. One senior manager of a large US investment house predicted over the weekend that if appropriate legislation were put in place, Dollars 20bn to Dollars 25bn (Pounds 12.6bn to Pounds 15.8bn) could flood into Russian 'within six months'. He and some other fund managers played down the political risk, arguing that the process of market change was too far advanced to be radically altered by almost any occupant of the Kremlin. CS First Boston, the international investment bank, estimates foreign portfolio investment this year may exceed Dollars 3bn. However, Mr Martin Andersson, chief executive of Brunswick, a Swedish-owned, Moscow-based stockbroker, warned: 'In many respects, Russia is a pre-emerging market and lacks many of the most basic playing rules. We will see a number of problems and scandals in the market. That is only to be expected.' Under US legislation, particularly the 1940 Investment Act, mutual and other fund managers cannot invest in foreign stocks unless there is easy access to share ownership records, assets can be freely traded and the rights of property are clearly defined. None of this is exists in Russia - and in some cases, the only register of the purchase of a share is in one ledger in an office thousands of miles from Moscow, which could be susceptible to either fraud or accidental loss or destruction. Asset prices in Russia have shot up without any effective settlement system in place. A World Bank study this month noted that privatisation had put 14,000 companies employing more than 14m workers into the private sector - 'achievements made in the absence of consensus on the desirability, scope and pace of liberalising reform in general and privatisation in particular, and without what would normally be considered the requisite administrative and financial resources to implement, monitor and enforce a privatisation programme of this magnitude'. Ms Danielle Downing, director of Russian investments at CA, a Russian stockbroker, said share registration was the big hurdle for mainstream western investors: 'But there should be infrastructure in place within the next six months, and we think that most of the emerging market funds would put 5-10 per cent of their weightings in the Russian market once that happened'. A number of Russian government ministers, including Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy premier for privatisation and Mr Sergei Vassiliev, deputy economics minister, are working on legislation for a Securities Exchange Commission which would answer the needs of foreign investors.

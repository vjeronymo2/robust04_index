			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Race relations - Radio The World Service is presenting a series, Free at Last, on the current state there of colour-consciousness. It has a certain sentimental aura that is not always helpful; but with racial prejudice breaking out here it must be good to hear how it has been dealt with in its more extreme shape. The first programme, last night, began with gospel singing and the voice of Martin Luther King, but mostly took a historical tone. Emancipation in 1861 did not mean instant equality between citizens and former slaves. Colour segregation persisted even beyond the second world war. A black girl in the wrong bus seat might provoke an anti-black demonstration. All segregation was outlawed in 1963 under Kennedy's Civil Rights Bill, and voting was taken in hand the following year. But this was also the year of the Watts riots in Los Angeles, and riots have continued sporadically to the present time. The second programme (Friday) looks at the city of Philadelphia, an example of peaceful segregation. The city is divided by the rail track; on one side live the whites in relative prosperity, on the other, the blacks in comparative poverty. Yet there are black and white children side by side at school, and sports teams may be divided half-and-half with no trouble. A local paper, with a black editor, is notably fair. The next programme shows how the situation can deteriorate in adverse circumstances. Radio 4 is running a serial on Wednesday afternoons, The Crack, four Liverpudlian writers to four instalments. Lightweight tales, the interest lies in the characters. In the first (Friday) barmy old Albert finds a corpse lying on a gravestone, but After tea at a nunnery with Edith from the old people's home, he cares more that Dawn, a tart, should be baptised; he cares so much for baptism that he jumps into the river to simulate the ceremony for himself, but Edith drags him out. People, more than plot, connect instalments. Next week (Saturday,) Carol, a hairdresser in her late thirties, wonders why Joe, a former priest, should have been de-frocked. She also wants to tell her boyfriend she is pregnant, but his phone is always on the answering-machine. She is specially anxious because he has been seen with another girl. There is talk with Dawn about the gravestone body. Mustn't tell you the end, though. I have heard the next two, with modest excitement. Director Kate Rowland tells of 'the anarchy of the ordinary', and that is what The Crack offers. Not so ordinary was the Monday Play, Sweet William by Peter Thomson, about discovering Shakespeare's original scripts; but the story was so anarchic that the excitements lacked edge. William (Kim Wall), bastard son of Samuel Ireland, a credulous Shakespeare-fan seeking new items for his collection, is in his father's mould, but more inventive. On a Stratford visit, Samuel buys some curious items very cheaply (the date is 1796) but is not offered the papers from New Place, now at Compton House. William, however, secures some from his friend Mr H, who also claims to have more, including a play, King Arthur, in manuscript. William has been reading about Chatterton, the boy poet-suicide, and when the missing papers are publicised, he claims to have written them himself. Others are involved in the detections and deceptions, but they are barely characters at all. Nigel Bryant directed.</p>

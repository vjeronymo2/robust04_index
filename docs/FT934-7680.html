			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (7): A decade of radical changes - Fiscal policy/Tax reform DECENTRALISING economic decision-making to dynamic provincial governments has been at the heart of the central government's economic reform strategy, but this devolution of power has also caused severe problems for Beijing's reformers. Fiscal policy is one area where decentralisation now risks impeding further reform. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are keen that some re-centralisation of budgetary policy be at the heart of the next round of reforms. According to the Bank, 'reforms to equip government with the appropriate tools for fiscal policy are a matter of urgency.' China's budget data, although often opaque and irrationally constructed, provide a good indication of the radical changes which have occurred in the fiscal relations between the centre and the provinces over the last decade. Total tax revenue has dropped sharply over the past decade, from 26.7 per cent of gross national product in 1979 to 15.8 per cent in 1991. Within this declining total, the share of revenue which the central government retains has fallen from nearly 60 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s to 45 per cent by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the share of revenue collected by locally levied, as opposed to nationally set, taxes has also fallen. THIS decline in total tax revenues was, in part, deliberate - the result of freeing the state enterprise sector from direct government control. This change is reflected in the growth of what the government calls 'extra-budgetary funds' amounting to 15 per cent of GNP, largely surpluses of state enterprises. But revenue collection from enterprises has fallen faster than expected as individual enterprises have negotiated favourable tax arrangements. Meanwhile, the state enterprises continue to provide substantial welfare functions while loss-making state enterprises still receive cheap credit from the central bank, implying larger effective budget deficits than the modest budget gaps that the official figures reveal. The fall in central tax revenues was also an intended consequence of the decision to give more autonomy shift to regional governments. In the late 1980s, the government introduced a new system whereby each province negotiated a three to four year tax-sharing contract with the central government. State government have been given greater responsibilities in providing housing and welfare services to their populations, requiring more locally retained tax revenues. They have also been encouraged to offer tax incentives to foreign investors. But these new arrangements remain a significant source of tension between the centre and the provinces. Some local official have been unhappy at the tax deals struck by fast growing provinces, while the centre has been unable to enforce the contracts. In 1990, according to the IMF, only six provinces recorded a surplus even though 16 were contractually obliged to do so. But it was in the first half of this year that the revenue shortfall became particularly acute, resulting in the central government's decision to send teams of ministers to tour the provinces in the middle of this year to find out what was happening. 'Local governments have been abusing their power,' says Mr Liu Zhongli, finance minister. 'They reduced taxes to certain enterprises which meant less revenue for my ministry. But I inspected their books and put a stop to these practices, and now our revenues have increased.' The result of the fall in central tax revenue has been to the undermine fiscal policy as a macroeconomic policy weapon, while imparting an inflationary bias into the economy. Local governments have found it easy to over-run their budgets, while tax revenues have consistently lagged behind economic growth and budget spending. Moreover, the government in Beijing has found it increasingly hard to use fiscal policy to offset the large growth in inter-regional inequality. Currently there are wide cross-regional differences in expenditures on education and health: spending per head in Shanghai is four times that in Sichuan province - while there is little relationship between a province's average income per head and the net transfer it receives or sends from or to the centre. The Ministry of Finance is planning to address some of these deficiencies over the coming year. It plans to levy a uniform 33 per cent tax rate on all enterprises; to broaden and simplify the currently very limited value-added tax by extending it across the country and reducing the number of rates from fourteen to two; and to introduce legislation next year for a new tax-sharing scheme which will increase Beijing's revenue share. The details of the new scheme are not yet known, but are likely to be an extension of a pilot 'tax-sharing' scheme introduced in nine localities last year which clearly separated central, local and shared taxes. But the World bank has misgivings about the tax-sharing scheme, arguing that it does not move far enough away from the contracting system whereby the central government continues to rely on the remittance of locally collected tax, the fact which lies at the heart of the current difficulties. It prefers te idea of an inter-provincial equalisation fund to redistribute locally collected revenues. But any system which succeeds in raising the taxes paid by the richer regions is bound to be unpopular.</p>

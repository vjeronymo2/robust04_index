			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'CORONADO COMPANY' FIGURE ARRESTED IN NEW DRUG CASE  </P> <P> Another member of a former drug-smuggling ring known as the "Coronado Company"  has been arrested on new drug charges, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> John Edward Wade, 47, of Del Mar was arrested Monday in the Northern California  town of Leggett, the San Diego County Integrated Narcotic Task Force announced.

			<p>BFN     [Text] US Ambassador David Lambertson told Thai Commerce  Minister Uthai Phimchaichon yesterday that Washington fears  proposed amendments to the Alien Business Law will harm  operations of US businessmen already in Thailand. The 1966  Treaty of Amity between the US and Thailand allows Americans the  same rights as Thais to engage in many occupations normally  prohibited to foreigners.    The law is being amended because the new General Agreement  on  Trade in Services, due to come into force next year, will  prohibit signatories from discriminating among foreigners of  different nationalities in professional and other services.    The European Community, Japan, Australia and a number of  other developed countries have repeatedly complained that their  nationals are deprived of the rights granted in Thailand to  Americans.    The United States is worried that by rewriting the law and  ending discrimination, Thailand will withdraw rights now held by  Americans rather than extending them to other nationals.    Mr Uthai said Mr Lambertson feared the amendments would  retard investment by Americans in Thailand.    "I informed to him that the law just approved the  recommendations of the committee set up to amend the law, but it  still needs future review and submission to the Cabinet again  before being read in the Parliament," Mr Uthai said. "So it is  still not certain that the amended law will be passed as  proposed."    A source said the proposed amendments did not specify that  business operations that have already been established or may be  established in the future under the Treaty of Amity would be  exempted. The old Alien Business Law made this distinction.    Mr Uthai said Mr Lambertson also insisted that Universal  Insurance Co, a Thai firm 99.84 percent owned by American  shareholders, should receive the same right as Thai firms in  setting up its 11 branches under the Treaty of Amity.    But he told the US envoy that the ministry is seeking a  legal  interpretation from the Juridical Committee on whether Universal  Insurance will be treated as a Thai or an American firm. The  Cabinet will have the final say in the matter, Mr Uthai said.    Mr Lambertson characterized his one-hour talk with Mr Uthai  as a good discussion and expressed hope that a satisfactory  solution could be reached in the Universal case.    Mr Uthai also said that Mr Lambertson confirmed that  Thailand  would remain on Washington's so-called Priority Watch List,  under which the US will monitor the protection of the  intellectual property rights. At the same time, Washington  recognized the progress Thailand was making in enforcing patents  and copyrights, he said.</p>

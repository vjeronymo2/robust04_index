			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COSTAS GETS THIS VOTE FOR NEXT COMMISSIONER  </P> <P> Reading time, two minutes:  </P> <P> Given a vote, my pick for the next baseball commissioner would be broadcaster  Bob Costas. Intelligent, fair and with integrity, Costas is attuned to all  facets of the business and sport.  </P> <P> Go figure: While a vast majority of football coaches are reticent to let their  quarterbacks call the plays, the coach at Portland State, Pokey Allen, went so  far as to let the fans call them. The committee dictated a touchdown during  Portland's 35-21 victory over Cameron.  </P> <P> Considering Pete Rose's recent activities in the marketplace, how long can it  be before he dismantles his house and starts auctioning off the bricks one by  one?  </P> <P> Mike Tyson was walking along a New York street the other day when he thought to  himself, what the heck, why not ride? Especially with a snappy red Ferrari 328  staring out at him from a showroom. The heavyweight champ wrote a check for  $150,000 and was on his way.  </P> <P> Speaking of Tyson, imagine a Canadian promoter coming up with $2.5 million site  money for his yawner against inexperienced Razor Ruddock in November. To make  ends meet, he's hoping to drag $1,500 out of the good people in Edmonton for a  ringside seat.  </P> <P> When the Washington Capitals took off for a nearly three-week swing through  Sweden and the Soviet Union as part of training camp Tuesday, they were hauling  along 522 sticks, or 18 per player. They couldn't pick up sticks over there?  </P> <P> A letter to a Gotham sports page states, "While looking at the list of players  drafted by the over-35 league in Florida, it occurs to me that two teams (Port  St. Lucie and Winter Haven) could probably run away with this year's American  League East." Darned if the guy probably isn't right.  </P> <P> It turns out that after all the commotion surrounding ex-Navy star Napoleon  McCallum and his desire for football career, the guy's an also-ran when it  comes to hacking it as a back in the National Football League.  </P> <P> Money is obviously no object at the Mazda Champions golf tourney in Puerto Rico  in December. The winning Professional Golfers' Association senior and Ladies  Professional Golfers' Association player duo will split $500,000.  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner says, "Fans love winning. If we were winning, we could get  away with playing Adolph Hitler in right field." With no Fuhrer to play right  field, obviously Georgie figures he'll play the part.  </P> <P> It's easy to see why some athletes don't bother scrutinizing the papers while  in the midst of a competition. While wading through David Pate, Derrick  Rostagno, Miloslav Mecir and Mikael Pernfors so far, Boris Becker keeps being  reminded by the scribes that he has been just mildly successful at the U.S.  Open and that he's not overpowering anyone, a la Wimbledon.  </P> <P> Beleaguered Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson says: "Since I've been here,  Kirk Gibson was the only quality player that came through our minor-league  system."  </P> <P> The false claim -- what about Howard Johnson, Sparky? -- reminds of Mayo  Smith's complaint when Detroit fell on tough times after fielding a good team  in the late '60s and early '70s: "The only guy who has made it onto the club  from the system the last four years is Ike "Bleeping" Brown.  </P> <P> Victor Remington-Kiam, owner of the New England Patriots, wants the NFL to get  into the restaurant business, opening league-underwritten bistros in a bunch of  cities.  </P> <P> While on the marketing kick, the National Basketball Association has finally  figured the head start baseball has in the trading card business is big enough,  so it will be coming out with a 300-card set come November. Remember, it's the  rookie cards that shoot up in value rapidly.  </P></p>

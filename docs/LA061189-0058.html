			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTFUL LESSONS FOR CAMBODIAN KINDERGARTNERS  </P> <P> Francie Hansen's philosophy of education is summed up in an ancient Chinese  proverb printed in an old newspaper article that she keeps pasted in a  notebook.  </P> <P> "Tell me, I forget," the proverb goes. "Show me, I remember. Involve me, I  understand."  </P> <P> It's a philosophy she implements by using art to teach English to her Cambodian  kindergartners.  </P> <P> Bright-eyed and scrubbed, they begin arriving for school well before the 8 a.m.  starting time. Chatting loudly in their native language, they spread out across  the floor, bending over papers and paintbrushes to complete the task at hand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Involvement in Project  </P> <P> The teacher's method is simple. Using largely discarded materials, she involves  the children in an art project, which forms the basis for a discussion in  English.  </P> <P> "Art is the perfect vehicle," Hansen said. "It's the universal language."  </P> <P> So far the approach seems to be working. The test scores of her students at  Robert E. Lee Elementary School have improved, she said. The approach has  attracted the attention of community members and colleagues. And it has  resulted in several public displays of the students' artwork, including a  monthlong exhibition at a city park.  </P> <P> "She's doing well," said Lee Principal Bob Robertson. "We are very proud of  her."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Encourages Participation  </P> <P> Dick Van der Laan, a spokesman for the Long Beach Unified School District,  said: "Art is communication. It makes the children participants rather than  passive spectators."  </P> <P> They weren't always participating. Last July, when Hansen began teaching the 29  5-year-olds, most of whom are the children of Cambodian refugees, very few  could speak any English. Located in the city's large Cambodian neighborhood,  Lee Elementary -- which is on a year-round schedule -- has a 41% Cambodian  enrollment. "The room was silent," Hansen recalled. "They weren't ready to  talk."  </P> <P> It was only with the help of a Cambodian-speaking aide, the teacher said, that  communication occurred at all.  </P> <P> Hansen decided to try a different approach. A teacher with 18 years of  experience and an artist, she began focusing more on art. First she led the  children in directed drawings, exercises in which the class drew what the  teacher described with the help of her bilingual aide. Then she gradually began  shifting to projects requiring more individual initiative. By relying on what  she perceived as the children's natural love of art to produce an atmosphere in  which inhibitions were low and involvement high, she said, she created an  environment highly conducive to learning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Each Answers Questions  </P> <P> The scene on a recent day was typical. By 8 a.m. the children were sprawled on  the floor, enthusiastically painting the indentations of cardboard fruit  cartons in yellow, pink, white and blue. As they finished, they formed a line  before Hansen, who asked a series of questions of each student. "How many  blues?" she asked, referring to the number of indentations the child had  painted blue. There followed interrogatories on each of the other colors, after  which the teacher recorded the results on a toll sheet. The effect was a lesson  in English colors and numbers.  </P> <P> Later they tried another exercise. Using empty cylindrical tennis ball cartons,  construction paper, scissors and glue, the children were instructed to create  fanciful animals of their own choosing. Lining up again, they were each asked  to describe something special about their animal; the teacher then inscribed  the answers on on the animals' sides.  </P> <P> "It's a girl bunny sticking her tongue out," said Mary Nasovann, 6, smiling  shyly but clearly proud of her creation.  </P> <P> "The lion wants to jump through a hoop of fire," said Sangkham Nou, 5, a  sturdy, sober-looking boy with wide shoulders and piercing black eyes.  </P> <P> Hansen believes that such exercises help the children expand their English  vocabularies. To enhance the process and add to their general educations, she  also employs such traditional kindergarten techniques as reading stories to the  children and involving them in elementary scientific experiments. But the art  exercises have had a particularly dramatic effect, Hansen said, resulting in  some obvious changes in the students' demeanor which she hopes will help them  throughout their schooling.  </P> <P> "They're so much more outgoing," she said. "They speak and they understand and  I can really give them direction. They're interested in learning."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shops Display Work  </P> <P> The changes have not gone unnoticed. During walking field trips to nearby  business establishments, Hansen said, the children have charmed proprietors  into displaying class artwork in such facilities as a yogurt shop, taco stand  and flower shop.  </P> <P> A recent monthlong exhibit at the El Dorado Nature Center, its organizer said,  was seen by more than 12,000 people. "Besides being full of joy and  creativity," said Mary Blackburn, the center's program director, "the work was  pretty sophisticated for 5-year-olds."  </P> <P> Consisting of about 100 pieces, she said, the show included collages, drawings  and three-dimensional paper sculptures of animals such as monsters, lions and  snakes. "It was so full of color and animation that people thought it was just  wonderful," Blackburn said. "It says that (the children) feel good about  themselves and their place in the world. It says they feel confident."  </P></p>

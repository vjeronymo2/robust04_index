			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Need for revolution in attitudes towards teaching and research Sir, In your editorial 'Mass higher education' (January 13) you forecast that when the divide between polytechnics and universities has ended it will be replaced by a new divide, one between institutions engaged in teaching and research and those funded only for teaching. Of course, those that receive no government funding for research will still be able to seek such funding from other sources, just as all institutions do at present; and this new divide may in any case not be as clear-cut as you suggest, since there are likely to be divisions of this kind within institutions themselves. Nevertheless, if the revolution in higher education is to succeed there needs to be a corresponding revolution in attitudes towards teaching and research. The Association of University Teachers has consistently pressed for greater recognition of teaching quality in universities; yet the Universities Funding Council continues the practice of its predecessor, the University Grants Committee, and bases its allocation of funds to universities primarily on its assessment of their excellence in research. It is not surprising, therefore, that promotion in universities, too, depends heavily on research performance with teaching in most cases coming a very poor second. Replacing one divide by another, with a few 'ivy league' universities and a rump which is regarded as second-rate, is no way to build a genuine mass system. It is to be hoped the new funding councils, and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, will accept the interdependence of research and teaching.

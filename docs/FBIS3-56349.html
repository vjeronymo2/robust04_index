			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Karl Wendl: "Zhirinovskiy's Network"] </F>   [Text] The room is on the seventh floor of a hotel in the  center of Vienna. It is a standard one. Aleksey Vedenkin set  up his headquarters here at the beginning of the year. Vedenkin  is the "number two" man behind Zhirinovskiy, the  ultranationalist victor in the Russian elections, who has been  frightening the world with threats to use nuclear weapons for  weeks and has been making constant headlines. The room is full  of files. There are thousand of photographs and some  videocassettes on the window sill. There is a pile of business  cards on his desk. The telephone keeps ringing. "They are  businessmen," said Vedenkin, "who want to have contacts with us.  They are literally falling over each other to get through the  door."    Vedenkin took a sip of soda and with an air of superiority  said: "They know who they have to bank on. Volfovich  [Zhirinovskiy] will be the new Russian president and I will be  his foreign minister. At the moment, I am the Liberal  Democratic Party's [LDP] financial adviser and its spokesman on  Europe." Zhirinovskiy's LDP, with 25.3 percent of the vote, was  the clear winner in the Russian elections. In the new Duma  (parliament), it has 66 seats. Right after the first parliament  meeting Zhirinovskiy presented himself as the "new strong man"  and announced the formation of a coalition with the communists.    Vedenkin said: "Thus, we finally have a say. In addition,  we are Russia's richest party. I could rent entire floors of  hotels, but that is something that we do not do."    Vedenkin's contact man in Austria is 60-year-old Svetoslav  Stoilov, a Bulgarian by birth who has lived in Austria for about  30 years. Stoilov has placed his automobile, office, and  business contacts in Austria at the disposal of his Russian  friends. He also organized Zhirinovskiy's trip to Bulgaria,  which provoked a great furor. While Zhirinovskiy then flew  directly back to Moscow from Bulgaria, Vedenkin, his companion,  the 23-year-old Dimitriy Klinkov, and a bodyguard flew back to  Vienna. Dimitriy Klinkov has lived in Austria for two years and  is employed as a commercial director at the IBC trading company  in Carinthia. He acts as an interpreter and money courier for  the Zhirinovskiy team.  <H5>  Apparatchiks and Ex-Nazis </H5>   Working over a period of a few months, Vedenkin and his  colleagues have succeeded in establishing a network of companies  all over Europe. Zhirinovskiy's "Liberal Democratic Party"  already has subsidiaries in Austria, Germany, Italy, France,  Holland, and Switzerland. The "Russian Hitler's" team has been  successful at skillfully operating on two levels: On one level,  with his constant provocations, Zhirinovskiy keeps making  headlines. Recently, he condemned President Clinton: "If he  does not want to shake hands with me, then he should stay at  home and play the saxophone." Thus, all public interest has  focused on the figurehead, Zhirinovskiy.  <H5>  Is the Mastermind a German? </H5>   Vedenkin, on the other hand, stays in the background and  directs things: He links up old Nazis such as the notorious  German Gerhard Frey (the publisher of NATIONAL-ZEITUNG) or Edwin  Neuwirth, the Carinthia-based timber trader, with the  nomenklatura in Russia and the former east bloc.    Werner Girke from Berlin is supposed to be one of the  masterminds. In the GDR, Girke was the financial director of  the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany]. He had the  authority to manage SED bank accounts in the FRG, Switzerland,  and Luxembourg. Following the collapse of the GDR, he  transferred millions for the SED successor party, the PDS [Party  of Democratic Socialism]. He transferred about 100 million  Austrian schillings to a Luxembourg bank account. He received  the 100 million in cash and without signing a receipt. However,  last summer, he returned the money to the Berlin Trust Agency.  It is, however, suspected that Girke transferred millions for  the KGB as well as the PDS.    Werner Girke was "on vacation" with Zhirinovskiy in  Carinthia. He was accompanied by a smartly dressed man with gray  hair who spoke with a Saxony area accent. Vedenkin said  evasively: "All I can say about the second man is that in the  past he had quite a say in the GDR's financial sector."  Vedenkin went on to say: "Girke is one of our best friends. I  spent six weeks with him in the fall and worked in his office in  Berlin. He advised us and gave me a lot of good tips. The  German authorities have know that for a long time. During my  stay, the fiscal authorities even conducted an audit at Girke's  office. No irregularities were found."  <H5>  Zhirinovskiy on the NEWS Telephone </H5>   Talking about the special relationship between Girke and his  leader, Vedenkin said: "Girke visited also visited us in  Carinthia during our vacation. However, he certainly did not  move any millions around for us."    The short, thick-set 30-year-old paused and said:  "Zhirinovskiy will confirm that, let's phone Volfovich."  Vedenkin dialed a Moscow number. At the first attempt, a male  voice replied at the other end of the line. Shortly afterward,  Zhirinovskiy himself was on the line. He does not talk, but  shouts: "Yes, I know Girke well. He is a respected businessman  and a good friend of mine. However, his T.V.O neither financed  me or my election campaign. The searches at his home are simply  an act of revenge, because Girke invited me to Germany.  Unfortunately, he sent the invitation to the German Embassy in  Sofia, and that is how the authorities established that I am in  contact with Girke."    Zhirinovskiy's voice became hoarse as he shouted down the  phone. Then, he went on the offensive: "The KGB no longer  exists, just as the CPSU no longer exists. In the past, the  state controlled their accounts, and today, those accounts are  controlled by former party members, who have transferred  billions to the West following the putsch. Why is no one angry  about that? There are also hundreds of former Communist Party  companies in Austria, which are now doing marvelous business.  These people are suddenly highly respected in the West.  However, the game is over now."    Toward the end of the conversation, he announced that we  wants to visit France and Spain in the next few weeks and also  expects Germany to grant him an entry visa once again: "If I  insulted the German people, then I want to apologize for that in  every possible way. I am very sorry, it was not my intention to  do so. Please pass that on to my German friends."    Then Zhirinovskiy put the phone down, but not before he had  praised "Austria, that wonderful land of culture." We have  reported on how much "culture" Zhirinovskiy experienced in  Austria. However, the fact is that he returned to Vienna after  his sojourn in Carinthia. He rented a penthouse apartment on  the tenth floor of Vienna's Plaza Hotel before leaving for  Bulgaria on Christmas Day. Actually, Zhirinovskiy also wanted  to visit Slovenia and Croatia. Belgrade was also on his  itinerary. The 57-year-old Montenegrin Petar Ivanovic wanted to  organize a trip to Belgrade for Zhirinovskiy. Ivanovic operates  the "Oweka Trading" company, the headquarters of which are on  Vienna's Neuer Markt. "Oweka" is involved in trade between the  former East Bloc and the West: "We buy and sell oil, copper,  steel, everything," argued Petar Ivanovic and pointed out that  his "Oweka" had sales of almost 700 million in 1990. In  addition, Ivanovic is also an executive director for numerous  other companies. "At the moment," conceded Ivanovic, "some of  our companies are experiencing problems. The UN embargo against  Serbia and Montenegro has particularly affected our companies."  Is that why he is trying to get close to Zhirinovskiy (Ivanovic  hired a special stretched Mercedes limousine for his trip to  Carinthia)? Ivanovic: "Of course, Zhirinovskiy is the new man  in Russia. Everyone who wants to do business with Moscow must  come into contact with him."  <H5>  Sinister Billionaire </H5>   While Ivanovic was only one of the businessmen who just  wanted "to establish contact" with Zhirinovskiy, Zhirinovskiy's  true financial backer is supposed to be a woman. Aleksey  Vedenkin said: "She is French and is called Miriam Selen." [name  as published] She is supposed to be close to Jean Marie LePen.  Vedenkin boasted: "She has contacts at all the highest levels  and is considered one of the richest women in Europe." However,  neither the editors of LE FIGARO's commercial section nor DER  SPIEGEL's Paris bureau had heard of a "super-rich woman" of that  name.  <H5>  Broom Handles Made of Titanium </H5>   However, having lit his tenth Marlboro within half an hour,  Vedenkin insisted that "the world will be astonished when it  sees what doors this businesswoman will open for us." He drew  on his cigarette with obvious pleasure, then blurted out: "Both  Zhirinovskiy and myself know exactly which members of the  Communist Party have transferred billions to the West and are  still doing so." He then cited an example: "Recently, a  high-ranking CPSU functionary sent three train loads of brooms  to Europe. Everyone was wondering why one would send brooms  from Russia to Europe. The broom handles were not made of  aluminum, but of titanium."    Business transactions worth billions are supposed to have  been carried out in this way through Western front companies.  "They trade weapons and drugs, and launder money. We will  bring these people back to Moscow and make them appear in court.  The contents of their bank accounts will be seized, and we will  use the money to fly in food from Austria."    However, before then, Aleksey Vedenkin has got another  problem: His Austrian visa is about to expire.</p>

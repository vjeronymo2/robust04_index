			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Stevan Cordas] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (TANJUG) - NATO's message, after  the downing of four aircraft over Bosnia, should have been that  someone was taught a lesson for violating the U.N. Security  Council resolution on a no-fly zone, but the world media persist  in accusing the Bosnian Serbs that the planes belonged to them  although it is unclear exactly who was taught a lesson.    Twenty-four hours after two U.S. F-16s shot down four  fighters over Bosnia early on Monday [28 February] morning,  there are still no answers to pertinent questions such as: whose  were the aircraft, from where did they take off and where did  the two surviving aircraft land.    Despite this, the world media continues accusing the Bosnian  Serbs by citing unnamed sources and presenting types of the  downed planes allegedly in the possession of the Bosnian Serb  Air Force only.    Compared to Monday's unison chorus, the world media are on  Tuesday taking a somewhat more cautious view of the NATO action,  maybe because NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said he is  not certain that the downed aircraft belonged to the Bosnian  Serbs.    U.S. Vice-President Al Gore said something along the same  lines, thus indirectly denying a statement by President Bill  Clinton who first said that in question are Serb planes, but  later omitted the word "Serb."    NATO, who has monitored the no-fly zone over Bosnia since  its  imposition on October 1, 1993, has data showing a total of  1,400 violations.    U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) information clearly shows  that the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for the least number of  violations and that no aircraft have taken off from the sole  Bosnian Serb airport, Banja Luka, since last October.    A number of mysteries have yet to be solved.    Firstly, how is it possible that NATO does not know from  where the aircraft took off because it is hard to believe that  its AWACS planes failed to record this.    If this is not the case, it is surprising that NATO has not  announced what was filmed.    Despite this, a number of world agencies "uncovered" that  the  downed planes belonged to the Bosnian Serbs. They support these  claims by unconfirmed reports that these aircraft attacked  Travnik, although even neutral observers say that the Serbs have  no reason to bomb this city in central Bosnia.    All these unresolved questions create the impression that  NATO itself does not want to attach special meaning to the  action over Bosnia.</p>

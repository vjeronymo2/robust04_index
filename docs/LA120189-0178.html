			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> AILING GIRL'S PALS, TOWN PITCH IN  </P> <P> Noemi Serrano laughs and smiles, exuberant in her youth, optimistic even in the  face of illness.  </P> <P> It is almost Christmas, she says, a time to be thankful for the family and the  gift of life. But doctors say the 18-year-old Buena Park resident is in  desperate need of a heart and lung transplant, and her friends have rallied  around her in a drive to raise enough money to make sure that finances do not  stand in her way.  </P> <P> Diagnosed as having pulmonary hypertension, Noemi first noticed the symptoms in  1987 while visiting relatives in Mexico City.  </P> <P> "I just couldn't walk around and do things like everyone else. At first I  thought that I was just lazy, and then I remembered that a few months before  that I was getting really tired in physical education and when I walked to  school," she said.  </P> <P> Taken to a cardiologist in Mexico by her grandfather, she learned that there  was a problem with her heart. Her family immediately returned to California and  took her to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where doctors confirmed that her  blood pressure was dangerously high and that she needed a heart and lung  transplant.  </P> <P> Stanford University and UCLA will place Serrano on the waiting list for a  suitable transplant if she can raise $25,000 toward the estimated $100,000 cost  of the surgery. The remainder will be paid off in installments.  </P> <P> The Buena Park Firemen's Assn. has started a trust fund in the amount of $5,000  and is urging residents to contribute.  </P> <P> Living in a modest home with her mother and father, the oldest of four brothers  and two sisters, Serrano says her days consist of doing her home studies and  watching television. Because of all the time she missed in school because of  her illness, Serrano was unable to graduate with her class at Buena Park High  School in June but hopes to finish in mid-December.  </P> <P> Noemi's mother, Soledad, speaks no English but said through an interpreter that  "the hardest part of the situation is when Noemi has to be hospitalized." The  latest hospitalization came earlier this week when her blood pressure dropped  far below normal.  </P> <P> Friends drop by once in a while to visit, but Noemi notes that it is hard for  them to see her ill.  </P> <P> "It seems so difficult that this should be happening to someone they know," she  said.  </P> <P> The first thing Noemi plans to do when she gets healthy again -- and she has no  doubt that she will -- is to "go back to Mexico and finish that vacation."  </P> <P> Donations can be made by sending checks payable to the Noemi Serrano  Trust/BPFA, Buena Park Credit Union, 6650 Beach Blvd., Buena Park, Calif.,  90620. -- DEBORAH CARPENTIER  </P></p>

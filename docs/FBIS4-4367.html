			<p>CSO     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 8 Feb--The Minister of Defense will  revise the periods of service of those who hold the post of  Armed Forces commander to enable them to serve longer despite  reaching retirement age.    Minister of Defense Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said that  under  this revision, a person serving as Armed Forces commander may  hold the position for at least three years. Because of  compulsory retirement, the periods currently served sometimes do  not reach a year.    "Although the present period of service is fair for  everyone,  it will be improved in two years, when the Armed Forces  commander will be given at least three years to direct the  Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM)," he said. He said this as a  special guest on the Forum program aired by TV 1 tonight.    As an example, the new Armed Forces commander, General Tan  Sri Borhan Ahmad, will have the opportunity to lead the Armed  Forces for only 11 months, because he is scheduled for  retirement at the end of this year. Similarly, the previous  commander, General Tan Sri Abdul Rahman Abdul Hamid, had the  opportunity to lead the Armed Forces for only a year because of  retirement.    In this connection, Najib said that although the present  term  of service of the Armed Forces commander is short, it will not  hurt ATM planning.    "This is because those who are to be promoted to replace the  Armed Forces commander when he retires were also involved in  earlier planning. This means that whenever we make a decision  at the Ministry of Defense, it is not the decision of one  commander alone but is a collective decision," he said.    In the interview, Najib did not reject the possibility that  in the future the post of Armed Forces commander will not be  limited to candidates from the Army only.    He said that in order for an Air Force commander or Navy  commander to become Armed Forces commander in the future, both  positions will be raised to the rank of general to be on a par  with the Army commander.    "At present, the Air Force commander is a lieutenant general  with three stars, and the Navy commander is a vice admiral with  three stars, whereas the Army commander is a general with four  stars," he said.    When asked when the Air Force commander or Navy commander  will hold the post of Armed Forces commander, he said that it  depends on time and conditions.    "We need time to apply new doctrines, and this will be  implemented when the doctrines have become established," he said.    He said that appointments to Armed Forces commander have  focused on candidates from the Army because in the past Malaysia  concentrated its attention on eliminating communist terrorists.    "In the future, however, attention will be more on  conventional warfare, involving combinations of the three ATM  services. Therefore, the future designation of Armed Forces  commander will be based on the personal qualifications and  capabilities of the candidates," he said.    The forum was chaired by BERITA HARIAN reporter Mohamed Shah  Abdullah, while panel members were UTUSAN MALAYSIA reporter  Zulkiflee Bakar and BERNAMA reporter Mohamed Fuad.</p>

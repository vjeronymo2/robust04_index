			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / US home sales down US new home sales fell 14.1 per cent in June as the Federal Reserve's four rises in short-term interest rates this year slowed the industry, Reuter reports from Washington. New home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted 591,000 annual units in June, much lower than the 706,000 expected. 'It was a very weak report and indicates strongly that the higher interest rates are taking their toll on the housing industry,' said Ms Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities. The US commerce department said the 591,000 level in June home sales was the lowest since the 584,000 units of June 1992. It also said the levels in the south and the north-east were the lowest since August 1992, and in the west sales were at their lowest level in a year. Sales of new single-family homes were revised lower in May to show 688,000 seasonally adjusted annual units, down from a previously reported 738,000.</p>

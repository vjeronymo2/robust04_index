			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Montedison chief upbeat on recovery prospects Montedison, the Italian agro-industrial, chemicals and energy group, has begun to overcome the heavy legacy of debt and alleged mismanagement which brought it to its knees last year, according to its board. That was the cautious message given to shareholders yesterday by Mr Guido Rossi, the group's chairman, and Mr Enrico Bondi, managing director. It was at last year's shareholder meeting that Montedison revealed mysterious losses at offshore subsidiaries, and told shareholders that group losses were 35 per cent higher than originally announced. The L435bn 'hole' in Montedison's 1992 accounts increased the 1992 group loss to L1,679bn and triggered a series of judicial and financial investigations which are still continuing. For 1993, Montedison announced a net loss of L1,366bn (Dollars 873m) after extraordinary charges of L1,004bn, including L327bn of writedowns on overvalued real estate. Mr Bondi said yesterday that the group's net operating profit had increased by 33 per cent in the first five months of 1994, compared with the same period last year, making it possible that Montedison will break even this year. He and Mr Rossi, who took over as managing director and chairman immediately after last year's meeting, also said divestments and restructuring would cut the group's net financial debt to just under L9,500bn by the end of the year, compared with L15,841bn at December 31 1993. Mr Rossi thanked the banks which agreed a rescue plan for Montedison and its parent, Ferruzzi-Finanziaria (Ferfin), with a L5,400bn refinancing package. Mr Rossi described the plan, in his letter to shareholders, as 'the largest out-of-court financial restructuring in history, in terms of the scale of the indebtedness rescheduled, its geographic dimensions and the number of parties involved'. 'Without the participation of the banking system, this group would have gone bankrupt,' Mr Rossi told shareholders yesterday.</p>

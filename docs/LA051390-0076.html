			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTEBELLO OKS PUBLIC REVIEW FOR MOST DEVELOPMENT PLANS  </P> <P> The City Council, which is trying to control development, has created another  hurdle for developers who want to build in the city.  </P> <P> The council last week unanimously passed a zoning amendment requiring that the  city Planning Commission hold formal hearings on most development proposals to  allow neighbors to air concerns.  </P> <P> The review process will give the Planning Commission a chance to check the  compatibility of the project with neighboring areas and require that plans be  changed if necessary.  </P> <P> "Everything is getting so crowded," Mayor Ed Pizzorno said. "Just about  everything built infringes on neighboring property."  </P> <P> Planning Director Paul Deibel said the amendment requires hearings for  residential projects with three units or more. Also, commercial or industrial  projects of more than 5,000 square feet are required to undergo a public site  review.  </P> <P> The projects must also undergo an environmental review that, until now, was  conducted only for larger projects, he said.  </P> <P> In the past, development plans that met code requirements needed approval only  by the Planning Commission, and residents were allowed to comment only if the  developer was asking for a conditional-use permit, Deibel said. That practice  has angered more than a few residents, who complained that they were surprised  to find that the empty field or single-family home next door was being replaced  with an apartment building.  </P> <P> Last week's action was one of several steps taken recently by the council to  control growth, including a yearlong moratorium on duplexes and apartments in  some residential areas.  </P> <P> During the last two years, developers have flocked to Montebello, which has  become increasingly attractive, especially to young families from East Los  Angeles. Montebello has surpassed its 1988 level of building applications and  has nearly reached 1989 levels.  </P> <P> City leaders have expressed concern that uncontrolled development will overtax  water and sewer systems, increase traffic, and destroy the character of the  city.  </P> <P> Pizzorno said the council has also asked city staff members to set up an  architectural review board to monitor the quality of developments.  </P></p>

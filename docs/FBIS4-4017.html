			<p>BFN     [Text] Alma-ata [Almaty], April 27 (XINHUA) -- Visiting  Chinese Premier Li Peng said today that there will be high-level  exchange of visits between Chinese and Russian leaders this year.    The Chinese premier made the announcement at a press  conference here this afternoon, a day before ending his tour of  Central Asia.    Asked about Sino-Russian relations, Li called the growth of  such ties normal in the past few years.    President Boris Yeltsin paid a fruitful visit to China and  bilateral trade has surpassed the level of that with the former  Soviet Union, Li said.    Touching on the so-called China's intention to "fill in the  vacuum" left by the disintegration of the former Soviet Union,  Li restated that China seeks no spheres of influence, neither  political or economic, in Central Asia.    "We have a lot of matters to take care of at home and have  no  interest or intention to fill in the so-called vacuum," Li said.    His visit is meant to develop friendship with the Central  Asian nations and not directed against any other countries, Li  said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Seyfali Akhundov under the rubric "Ins and Outs: </F> "Karabakh Conflict Becomes International"]    [Text] The Russian mass media have already reported on  plans of the British military to send a group of mercenaries to  Azerbaijan. They have been limited here, however, to a reprint  of Tim Kelsey's article "British Mercenaries in the Azerbaijan  War" in the newspaper THE INDEPENDENT. Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  correspondent became aware of additional facts.    In conversation with the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent,  Thomas Yang, Great Britain's ambassador to Baku, denied any  military contacts whatsoever between the United Kingdom and  Azerbaijan. It is known, however, that Thomas Yang was present  at talks between British officials and the Azerbaijan military.  Major Steven Harrison, military attache of Great Britain in  Russia and simultaneously the acting chief military  representative in embassies of the United Kingdom in several  republics of the former USSR, met several times in December 1993  with Azerbaijan's Minister of Defense Mammedrafi Mamedov.  Harrison confirmed to OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's correspondent the  existence of plans for participation by the British military in  the Karabakh conflict, but refused to provide any more detailed  commentary.    British official circles are closing their eyes to attempts  of businessmen behind the scenes to arrange arms shipments to  Azerbaijan and provide highly qualified military specialists to  the national army. The British Foreign Office admits to the  existence of plans to send mercenaries to Azerbaijan from Foggy  Albion but vehemently denies participation in any dealing. As  Mrs. MacFail, press secretary of the British mission in Moscow,  stated to the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, the British  Government may not hinder mercenaries from traveling to  Azerbaijan insofar as freedom of movement is a high-priority  right of British citizens.    Acting as intermediaries between the Azerbaijan military  department and British "wild geese"--who are supposed to be in  Azerbaijan in the near future and participate in the  Armenia-Azerbaijan war on the side of Baku--are British and  Turkish businessmen. A key role is being played by 68-year-old  Lord Erskine of Rarrick, who resides in the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus. Lord Erskine is entered on diplomatic listings  of the British Foreign Office as a first secretary. For his  intermediary services Erskine receives many millions in  honoraria from the Cyprus firm, Summit Ltd., registered in Great  Britain. This consortium has already facilitated the acquisition  of British and American arms by the Azerbaijan defense  department in circumvention of the existing UN embargo on arms  shipments into the zone of the Karabakh conflict. A certain  Mustafa Mutlu is working together with Erskine, supporting  contacts in Baku on the governmental level.    Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from  trustworthy sources in Azerbaijan that that country's leadership  is also supporting close contacts with American military  circles. According to unconfirmed sources, the first party of  American advisers is already on location in Azerbaijan.    The activity of Western businessmen striving to influence  the  outcome of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan can be  explained by the fact that large-scale oil deposits have been  discovered on the Caspian shelf along the coast of Azerbaijan.  This is also attracting giants of the oil business to the  region--British Petroleum, Amoco, Pennzoil, and others. The  consortium which has been formed will soon begin the development  of off-shore oil fields. Neither Azerbaijan nor its neighbor  Russia has the appropriate technologies which would enable  independent extraction of this oil, and the problem of  transportation of crude oil has still not been resolved. One  plan calls for the passage of a pipeline across Turkish  territory to the Mediterranean coast. A new oil refinery is  already being built in Izmir. Thus Azerbaijan could soon enter  the world market with respect to the black gold. However, during  the visit of Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to Moscow in  November 1993, the Russian side proposed its own version--laying  the pipeline across Russian territory to the shores of the Black  Sea. In rendering assistance to Azerbaijan, the West is making  the outcome of the war independent of Russian military  assistance to the sides in conflict. It is easy to predict what  will follow: Baku will be inclined to make a decision that  removes Russia from participation in the oil project of the  century.</p>

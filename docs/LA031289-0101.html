			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NORTH CAROLINA HAS ENOUGH TO DEFEAT MARYLAND, 88-58  </P> <P> Neither ninth-ranked North Carolina nor upstart Maryland showed much style in  their Atlantic Coast Conference tournament semifinal Saturday at Atlanta, but  the Tar Heels had enough substance to gain another trip to the championship  game.  </P> <P> J.R. Reid scored 17 points, and the Tar Heels took advantage of Maryland's icy  shooting for an 88-58 victory over the Terrapins, who played without  hospitalized Coach Bob Wade.  </P> <P> "Maryland was not as sharp as they were yesterday," North Carolina Coach Dean  Smith said, "but neither were we."  </P> <P> The Tar Heels (26-7) reached the final for the 17th time in the 36 years of the  tournament.  </P> <P> Wade missed the game when he collapsed moments after Friday's victory over  top-seeded North Carolina State. He remained in an Atlanta hospital Saturday,  and school officials said he was resting.  </P> <P> Tests taken on Wade Saturday morning showed no sign of heart disease, the ACC  said.  </P> <P> Maryland, led by assistant coaches Jeff Adkins and Ron Bradley, finished 9-20  (1-13 against ACC competition) and suffered the worst loss ever in an ACC  tournament semifinal. Until Saturday morning, the two assistants thought Wade  would be on the bench beside them.  </P> <P> "We didn't find out that Coach Wade would not be joining us until 10:15 today,"  Bradley said. "I then spoke with him at 11:45 just before our bus left for the  (arena). He said to go with the basic game plan that we had used yesterday."  </P> <P> Earlier, Dr. Sanford Lavine, Maryland's team physician, had said Wade could  coach against the ninth-ranked Tar Heels "if all is normal." But the effects of  Saturday morning's tests apparently precluded that.  </P> <P> Duke 69, Virginia 58 -- After being shut out for the first 16 1/2 minutes of  the other ACC semifinal, Danny Ferry scored 23 points to lead the  seventh-ranked Blue Devils, who will play for their third title in four years  today.  </P> <P> Duke (24-6) has beaten Virginia (19-10) 15 times in a succession, dating back  to the 1983 tournament.  </P> <P> Ferry, who missed his first six shots and was scoreless until making a layup  with 3:30 left in the half, scored the Blue Devils' final six points before  halftime for a 32-16 lead.  </P> <P> OTHER TOURNAMENTS  </P> <P> Big East  </P> <P> Syracuse 81, Seton Hall 78 -- Fifth-ranked Syracuse made 12 of its last 14 free  throws to advance to the championship game of the tournament, as Sherman  Douglas scored 27 points to help knock off the 11th-ranked Pirates at New York.  </P> <P> The victory was the 17th in a row by the Orangemen (27-6) over Seton Hall  (26-6). Syracuse is 19-1 against Seton Hall since the Big East started 10 years  ago.  </P> <P> Georgetown 85, Pittsburgh 62 -- Charles Smith scored 26 points, and No. 3  Georgetown blitzed the Panthers with a 20-0 run in the first half that carried  the Hoyas to the easy victory in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> Georgetown, the regular-season conference champion, is 25-4. Pitt is 17-12 and  hoping for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament on the basis of four wins  over top 10 teams.  </P> <P> There were eight lead changes and five ties in the first nine minutes before  Georgetown took control with the 20-point surge, which included a pair of  three-point baskets and two three-point plays in quick succession.  </P> <P> Big Eight  </P> <P> Oklahoma 76, Iowa State 74 -- Tyrone Jones' three-point shot with one second  left, Oklahoma's only three-pointer of the day, gave the second-ranked Sooners  the semifinal victory at Kansas City, Mo.  </P> <P> Victor Alexander, who scored 26 points, gave Iowa State a 74-73 lead with 35  seconds left on a shot from inside. Oklahoma then missed three shots, and  Alexander was fouled on the rebound with eight seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Alexander missed the front end of the one-and-one, Oklahoma rebounded and  Mookie Blaylock found Jones on the left wing. Jones spun and, while tightly  covered, made the game-winner.  </P> <P> Oklahoma is 28-4, Iowa State 17-11.  </P> <P> Missouri 88, Kansas State 83 -- Anthony Peeler and Doug Smith keyed an 11-3 run  to begin the second half, and No. 10 Missouri used its height advantage to win  the other semifinal.  </P> <P> The Tigers are 26-7, including 6-4 under interim coach Rich Daly. With Daly  subbing for Norm Stewart, who underwent cancer surgery in February, Missouri  finished second to Oklahoma in the regular season.  </P> <P> Missouri's height allowed it to dominate most of the inside play. Kansas  State's tallest starter was McCoy at 6-7, whereas the Tigers had Mike Sandbothe  at 6-8, Smith at 6-10, Greg Church at 6-8 and Gary Leonard at 7-1.  </P> <P> Big Sky  </P> <P> Idaho 59, Boise State 52 -- The Vandals, who had their six-point lead cut to  one with under a minute remaining, held on to win the championship at Boise,  Idaho.  </P> <P> Larenzo Nash and James Fitch combined for six straight free throws in the final  31 seconds to clinch the victory for Idaho (25-5). Boise State hopes to get an  at-large bid into the NCAA tournament with a 23-6 record.  </P> <P> ECAC North Atlantic  </P> <P> Siena 68, Boston U. 67 -- Steve McCoy plucked Tom Huerter's desperation shot  out of the air and scored with one second left to give the Saints the  championship at Hartford, Conn., and their first NCAA berth.  </P> <P> It was the ninth consecutive game played by Siena (24-4) under a spectator  quarantine because of an outbreak of measles at its Upstate New York campus.  The quarantine, which kept spectators out of the 15,414-seat Hartford Civic  Center, ends today and will not affect the Saints' first-round matchup.  </P> <P> Boston U. is 21-9.  </P> <P> Metro  </P> <P> Louisville 71, Memphis State 70 -- No. 16 Louisville, trailing by nine points  with 3:32 left, scored the final 10 points of the semifinal game at Columbia,  S.C.  </P> <P> Freshman Everick Sullivan made the first of a one-and-one for the Cardinals,  the defending tournament champions who advanced to the final for the fourth  consecutive season.  </P> <P> Florida State 80, South Carolina 63 -- Derrick Mitchell scored 20 points and  Tony Dawson added 17 to lead the 14th-ranked Seminoles into today's final.  </P> <P> Florida State, which won the regular-season conference title, is 22-6. South  Carolina is 19-10, including three losses to the Seminoles.  </P> <P> South Carolina trailed at halftime, 40-31, but closed to 44-41 with 15:19 left  on John Hudson's jumper. But the Gamecocks went scoreless for the next 4 1/2  minutes while Florida State scored 11 points to take a 55-41 lead with 10:51  left.  </P> <P> Mid-American  </P> <P> Ball State 77, Eastern Michigan 76 -- No. 19 Ball State, profiting from a  mistake by Eastern Michigan's Kory Hallas, won the semifinal game at Toledo,  Ohio, on Paris McCurdy's two free throws with four seconds left.  </P> <P> Hallas, apparently thinking his team trailed by two points instead of three,  drove in for a layup as the game ended rather than trying a three-point shot  that would have forced overtime. Hallas had hit a three-pointer with 1:36 left  to pull Eastern Michigan to within 74-73.  </P> <P> Keith Stalling's free throw with 16 seconds to go gave Ball State a 75-73 lead.  Eastern Michigan's Isaac Henderson, fouled with five seconds left, made the  first free throw but missed the second. McCurdy grabbed the rebound, was  fouled, and converted both shots.  </P> <P> Hallas followed with his layup that left Eastern Michigan (16-13) a point  short.  </P> <P> Ball State (27-2) advanced to the final to play Kent State, an 88-43 winner  over Toledo in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> Midwestern Collegiate  </P> <P> Xavier 85, Evansville 78 -- Tyrone Hill scored 24 points at Dayton, Ohio, as  Xavier beat the regular-season champion to win its fourth consecutive  tournament title.  </P> <P> Evansville (24-5) couldn't contain the double threat of Hill and Michael  Davenport, a sophomore who scored 18 of his 22 points in the first half. Hill  scored 14 of his points from the foul line for Xavier (21-11).  </P> <P> Xavier broke the game open with its foul shooting in the final six minutes,  padding a two-point lead to 11. Xavier sank 15 of 19 free throws, with Jamal  Walker hitting eight of nine in that span.  </P> <P> Southeastern  </P> <P> Florida 76, Tennessee 71 -- Livingston Chatman scored 25 points to lead the  Gators in the semifinal game at Knoxville, Tenn.  </P> <P> Florida's final eight points came at the free-throw line. There were 12 ties  and 14 lead changes before the Gators, the SEC regular-season champions, took  the lead for good.  </P> <P> Alabama 83, Vanderbilt 79 -- Alvin Lee scored 24 points, including three  straight three-point baskets during one stretch, as the Crimson Tide reached  the title game with their fourth straight win.  </P> <P> It was the fourth victory in a row for the Crimson Tide (22-7). Vanderbilt  (19-13) hit 11 of 19 from three-point range, including a tournament-record six  by Barry Booker, who finished with 24 points.  </P> <P> Alabama made seven of 10 three-pointers, but a 34-25 rebounding edge and 55%  shooting from the field gave the Crimson Tide the victory.  </P> <P> Southwest  </P> <P> Texas 93, Texas Christian 89 -- Lance Blanks scored five of his 25 points in  overtime to lift Texas to the semifinal win at Dallas.  </P> <P> The Longhorns (24-7) led only twice in regulation, both one-point leads early  in the second half. But Blanks scored the first five points of overtime and the  TCU (18-13) caught up.  </P> <P> Texas made 10 of 13 free throws in the overtime period, including four in the  final 18 seconds. Five Horned Frogs fouled out, including Craig Sibley, who had  25 points and 15 rebounds before leaving with 5:57 left in regulation.  </P> <P> It was Texas' second consecutive overtime game, the Longhorns having defeated  Southern Methodist, 93-91, in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Arkansas 94, Texas A&amp;M 84 -- Lenzie Howell had a career-high 31 points, and  Keith Wilson, who scored 26 points in the quarterfinals, got 19 of his 25 in  the semifinals in the second half to lead the Razorbacks into today's  championship game.  </P> <P> Western Athletic  </P> <P> Texas El Paso 73, Colorado State 60 -- The Miners won their third conference  tournament in six years and earned their sixth straight NCAA appearance as Tim  Hardaway scored 25 points at Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Colorado State, the top-seeded team, led, 28-25, when Andy Anderson scored with  3:23 left in the first half, but the Miners (25-6) took over from there.  </P> <P> Prince Stewart, who finished with 22 points, sparked an 11-0 run with a  three-point basket, a field goal and two free throws to give El Paso a 36-28  lead before Trent Shippen sank a three-pointer for Colorado State (22-9) at the  halftime buzzer.  </P> <P> The Miners continued their assault at the start of the second half when Greg  Foster and Hardaway, the tournament's most valuable player, each hit jumpers.  </P> <P> NON-TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Iowa 87, Indiana 70 -- Roy Marble scored 19 points and Ed Horton and B.J.  Armstrong had 18 each at Iowa City, Iowa, as the 15th-ranked Hawkeyes beat the  sixth-ranked Hoosiers, who kept four starters on the bench after clinching the  Big Ten title.  </P> <P> Iowa snapped a four-game losing streak to finish the regular season at 22-9  overall, 10-8 in the Big Ten. Indiana is 25-7, 15-3.  </P> <P> The Hoosiers played the game without leading scorer and conference player of  the year Jay Edwards and starting center Todd Jadlow. Edwards, a sophomore  guard averaging 20.4 points, hurt his back in a 75-64 victory Thursday night  over Wisconsin, while Jadlow, averaging nearly 11 points, injured his right  ankle and suffered a deep bruise on his left thigh against the Badgers.  </P> <P> Except for Lyndon Jones, who scored nine points, the Hoosiers played the entire  game with reserves. Still, Indiana trailed, 32-26, at halftime before Iowa  pulled away.  </P> <P> Illinois 89, Michigan 73 -- Kenny Battle scored 22 points and Kendall Gill  added 19 as the fourth-ranked Illini clinched second place in the Big Ten with  the victory over the eighth-ranked Wolverines at Ann Arbor, Mich.  </P> <P> "This was the best game I've played because I put everything together," Battle  said. "I rebounded, played defense and scored. I'd say this was my first total  game."  </P> <P> Rumeal Robinson scored 22 points and Loy Vaught added 15 for the Wolverines  (24-7, 12-6). Glen Rice, the Big Ten's leading scorer, was held to 14 points.  </P> <P> "They did a great job on Glen," Michigan Coach Bill Frieder said of Rice, who  entered the game averaging 25.5 points. "They weren't going to let him get his  shots. He worked hard, but they stopped him."  </P> <P> Illinois (27-4, 14-4) set a school record for victories in a season.  </P> <P> "Maybe with the exception of the Indiana team of the mid-70s, it is the best  basketball team I've seen in my 16 years here," Frieder said. "They are so  quick and so good at every position."  </P> <P> DePaul 73, Notre Dame 70 -- Stanley Brundy hit all 10 of his shots and Terence  Greene scored 12 of his 21 points in the second half at Rosemont, Ill., to lead  the Blue Demons past the Fighting Irish and, most likely, into an NCAA berth.  </P> <P> DePaul is 20-11. Notre Dame, which slipped to 20-8 and split the season series  between the independent powers, also is expected to make the 64-team NCAA  field.  </P> <P> Minnesota 78, Ohio State 70 -- The Golden Gophers finished with their best  regular-season record in six seasons thanks to the Big Ten victory at Columbus,  Ohio.  </P> <P> Melvin Newbern and Willie Burton scored 17 points each for Minnesota, which won  its third straight to improve to 17-11 and 9-9.  </P> <P> Ohio State dropped its eighth straight and fell to 17-14 and 6-12.  </P></p>

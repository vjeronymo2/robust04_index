			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY SOCCER TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY GRABS GIFTS AND RUNS, 3-2  </P> <P> The Bakersfield West High soccer team was not exactly in the Christmas spirit  during a championship semifinal match against Simi Valley on Friday night, but  that didn't stop the Blades from giving the Pioneers a couple of presents  anyway.  </P> <P> And Simi Valley, in Scrooge-like fashion, did not respond in kind while taking  a 3-2 victory at Simi Valley High.  </P> <P> At the five-minute mark in the first half, Simi Valley forward Kenny Greninger  booted a shot in front of the West goal that struck Viking defender Eric  Fambrough in the chest before dropping across the goal line.  </P> <P> Four minutes later, West defender Tom Latham nailed a keeper pass back to  goalkeeper Steve Vesper which rolled between Vesper's legs and into the net for  a 2-0 Simi Valley lead.  </P> <P> Pioneer forward Spencer Belideau was credited with the second goal.  </P> <P> The Pioneers (8-0) took a 3-0 advantage six minutes into the second half when  midfielder Craig Hampton, on a corner kick from Brian Weaver, directed a head  shot into the upper-middle portion of the net.  </P> <P> West made it close on goals by Juan Cruz, on a head shot, and Francis Gangle.  </P> <P> In another tournament match:  </P> <P> Royal 2, Simi Valley JV 1 -- Striker Matt Brinkman scored on a bonus penalty  kick at the 16-minute mark in the second half to put the Highlanders (6-0-1)  into the tournament championship match against Marmonte League rival Simi  Valley.  </P> <P> Brinkman's initial attempt was blocked but the senior was awarded another kick  because Pioneer goalkeeper Mike Jones moved before Brinkman kicked the ball.  </P> <P> Simi Valley tied the score, 1-1, five minutes into the second half on a head  shot from a yard out by freshman forward Kevin Mykolyk.  </P> <P> Royal led, 1-0, at halftime after striker Mario Andrews scored on Daniel  Morris' rebound shot at the 10-minute mark.

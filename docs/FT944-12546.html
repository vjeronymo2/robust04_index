			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Three Baby Bell companies form US cable TV venture The convergence of telecommunications and cable TV took a further step in the US yesterday with the formation of a joint venture between three regional Baby Bell telephone companies and a leading programming agency. Bell Atlantic, Nynex and Pacific Telesis said they were each investing Dollars 100m (Pounds 63m) over the next three years in a venture including Mr Michael Ovitz's Creative Artists Agency. The partners, who claim to reach 30m homes in the US, said they would establish two new companies, one handling programming and the other technology. The first, provisionally known as the media company, will begin by buying programmes to feed through the partners' cable network, then develop its own programmes. It will also produce video on demand, and finally interactive programmes such as home shopping and games. The technology company will develop systems and standards for the new venture. It will receive existing technical assets from the three partners, such as Bell Atlantic's digital imaging laboratory in Reston, Virginia. Such assets will form part of the Dollars 100m contribution from each Baby Bell partner. Under US legislation, there are restrictions on local telephone companies entering the cable market and vice versa. However, several states have recently relaxed these regulations. The partners denied yesterday that the venture faced any regulatory problems. Bell Atlantic and Nynex cover the north eastern seaboard of the US, while Pacific Telesis is based in California. The media company will be based in Los Angeles and New York, while the technology company will operate from San Francisco and Reston, Virginia. The partners denied that there was any intention to move towards a full merger. However, Bell Atlantic and Nynex already have close ties in mobile telephony, and 10 days ago formed a partnership to bid for new personal communication service (PCS) licences along with two other regional companies. The partners said commercial trials for video on demand would begin in 1995. Eventually, the venture would offer advanced interactive services such as on-line games for numerous players, personal news services and interactive advertising.</p>

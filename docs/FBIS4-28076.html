			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says  the federal government will emphasize training in any package of  military assistance given to Cambodia.    Australia is still deciding whether to provide the war  ravaged Asian nation with arms. Senator Evans said Australia  was still discussing Cambodia's request for military assistance  with other potential donors -- the United States, France,  Malaysia, and Indonesia.    He said there was a general view among the donors that  Cambodia's primary need was for a training of an effective  military force. The foreign minister said a competent  noncorrupt government in Cambodia would be able to deal with the  Khmer Rouge insurgency.</p>

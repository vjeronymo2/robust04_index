			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Brussels warns of growing jobs toll MR Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, yesterday backed calls for a Community-led growth package, warning that unemployment next year was likely to rise to 11 per cent amid sluggish growth of between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent. Mr Christophersen said he hoped the EC summit in Edinburgh next month would send a strong signal of support for co-ordinated action based on a multi-billion dollar public works programme and joint efforts with Japan and the US to put 'more steam' into the world economy. In a speech in Brussels, Mr Christophersen implied that the package could entail dilution of the conditions for the EC's planned shift to a common currency, particularly over budget deficits. The Danish commissioner said: 'What we are seeing is more a lack of revenue (rather) than expenditures getting out of control. Under these circumstances, it would be understandable if some member states do not compensate fully on the revenue side.' Any suggestion of backsliding on the 'convergence criteria' set out in the Maastricht treaty will alarm Germany. The Bonn government and the Bundesbank agreed to sacrifice the D-Mark for a common European currency only on condition that member states met strict criteria on inflation and budget discipline. This week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, criticised the convergence criteria as inadequate and warned against 'lazy compromises' in selecting countries for monetary union. Mr Christophersen's view that budget deficit criteria may have to be eased in the short-term is shared by Mr Jacques Delors, European president.</p>

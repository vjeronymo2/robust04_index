			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Weighed down by high-flying image: With production of executive jets set to end in the UK, Paul Betts examines the industry's problems Exactly 30 years ago, the Hawker Siddeley company delivered its new HS 125 aircraft to its first customer. A small executive jet, designed, the company said, 'to meet the demands of business houses for the highest standards of speed and comfort', it became the biggest selling turbine-powered civil aircraft ever built in the UK. This month the new American owner of the Hawker family of executive jets, Raytheon, announced it was moving production of the aircraft from the UK to Wichita, Kansas. For Britain, once a leader in the corporate jet field, Raytheon's move marks the end of a chapter in its aircraft industry, leaving it without a small jet manufacturing facility. 'The UK's biggest postwar civil aircraft success story has just become one of the country's biggest-ever aeronautical embarrassments,' said Flight International, the specialist aviation magazine, last week. However, the corporate jet industry is in trouble everywhere, not just in the UK. Against the backdrop of a recession and heavy industrial restructuring, it has an image problem: businessmen, and shareholders, see executive jets as a toy, rather than a tool. 'The business jet has gone from being a symbol of the dynamic, fast-moving, entrepreneurial corporation to one of corporate privilege and excess,' said Mr Brian Barents, president of Learjet, the US manufacturer, which is now part of the Canadian Bombardier industrial group. This image of self-indulgence has not only deterred company boards from placing orders for new aircraft, but also prompted governments to target business jets as a source of additional tax revenues. In some countries, such as Italy and Venezuela, companies have been discouraged by high taxation from maintaining their own flight departments. In the UK, executive jet users have found it increasingly difficult to persuade tax inspectors that owning, leasing or flying a business aircraft is a legitimate business expense. In Japan, tight restrictions on private jet ownership have kept the lid on the market. There are only about 90 privately owned business jets in the country, compared with a current fleet of 260 in the UK, 364 in Germany, 492 in France and more than 4,000 in the US. Another factor that has reduced demand for corporate jets is mergers between big customers. 'When two big companies get together, they also merge their separate flying departments into one,' explained a manufacturer. In addition, companies with large corporate flight departments tend to take longer to replace their aircraft, or switch to chartering as a more cost-effective form of business travel. Mr Gary Hay, head of marketing of Cessna Aircraft, said he found it sobering to think that 95 per cent of all executive jet sales in the US involved existing operators. This has created a fiercely competitive market for the remaining 5 per cent of new business. In these circumstances, the industry has been forced to step up the pace of a rationalisation. In the past 18 months, Textron of the US has absorbed Cessna Aircraft, and Bombardier has taken over Learjet. This consolidation of the business aircraft industry has mirrored the broad restructuring in the world aerospace industry. The high cost of developing new products and the increasingly long lead time for new programmes to break even in a weak market have driven aircraft manufacturers to forge broad alliances, and partnerships to spread their risks and expand their international reach. It has also forced them to choose between the aerospace activities they could afford to maintain as competitive businesses and those they had to shed or find joint venture partners to run. In the UK, the future of the jet manufacturing business has been in doubt since Raytheon acquired British Aerospace's Chester and Hatfield-based operations - where the venerable line of 125 business jets was developed and built. BAe could no longer rely on stretching the already long life of the 125. Rather than invest Dollars 1bn in developing a new business jet with more range and cabin comfort, BAe decided to sell the business. At the time of the BAe sale, there appeared to be some signs of improvement in the market. But these were short lived. 'Beginning in March, all manufacturers started to see a reduction in sales again,' said Mr Roy Norris, president of Raytheon Corporate Jets. 'There is simply not enough viable business for seven or eight competing manufacturers,' said one corporate jet marketing executive. 'There is bound to be more consolidation, since there is probably room for only three or four manufacturers.' This is not a universally held view in the industry. Others believe that better marketing, rather than consolidation, is the way forward for the industry. 'It is time to reinvent the whole idea of business aviation,' Mr Barents said. 'That process starts with ascertaining the needs of current business aircraft users and delivering quality products that provide exceptional value to the customer.' In other words, producing better aircraft at lower operating and acquisition costs. 'Selling cost-effective transportation, as opposed to luxury, is the key to growth for this industry,' explained another manufacturer, adding that many companies found it increasingly difficult to justify to their shareholders the expense of owning an executive jet. One reason for scepticism over cost-effectiveness may be that executive jets tend to spend little time flying - unlike large aircraft in commercial airline use. In Europe, the average is about 15 to 20 minutes a day, or 300 hours a year, according to Mr Michael Riegel, managing director of a new UK-based venture called JetCo. The company is introducing in Europe a timeshare concept for corporate aviation, successfully developed in the US by New York-based Executive Jet Aviation. Known as fractional ownership, the attraction for companies is it enables them to invest in a share of an executive jet and enjoy the benefits of corporate aviation at a fraction of the aircraft's price (anything from Dollars 1m to Dollars 30m) and at more predictable operating costs. 'A corporate aircraft is an extremely expensive asset with annual operating costs of Dollars 800,000 to Dollars 1m if you include fixed and variable costs as well as depreciation,' explained Mr Riegel. 'We think fractional ownership schemes should help stimulate again demand for business aviation.' All the main business aircraft manufacturers believe these new timeshare schemes will help boost future sales. But they do not expect them to provide the solution to the industry's overall malaise. The US National Business Aircraft Association is now planning to intensify a public awareness campaign it launched last year with the slogan 'No plane, no gain', in an effort to improve the general image of executive jets. But no recovery is likely before 1996, manufacturers predict, and when it does occur it will be slow, especially in the US. 'This has traditionally been a highly cyclical business, but the peaks have steadily become smaller and the troughs deeper,' said Mr Riegel.</p>

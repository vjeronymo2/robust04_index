			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina trusts in the  success of the April conference, which will bring together  representatives of the Cuban Government and a portion of the  Cuban community abroad. Robaina announced that so far, the  majority of invitations for The Nation and the Emigre Community  Conference have been accepted. Robaina reiterated that  extremists (la histeria) are not invited to this meeting.  Robaina added that the meetings will focus on immigration, the  parliamentary system, family reunification, and travel  procedures, but that the Cuban organizers are open to including  other subjects.    [Radio Rebelde adds later in the cast that at Robaina's  invitation and in his company, members of the diplomatic corps  are visiting the Isle of Youth Municipality]</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / New boy upsets flexible friends: A look at the increase in competition among UK credit cards More than ever before, UK credit card issuers are having to prove just how flexible and friendly they can be towards their 20m or so customers. Existing credit card operators, dominated by the high street banks, had long expected new players in the market. This week's launch of a credit card from Vauxhall Motors is the clearest sign yet that competition is not only increasing but that new players are bringing substantial financial and marketing clout. Before Vauxhall followed in the tyretracks of General Motors, its US parent group, by offering a credit card that can earn customers a discount on a new vehicle, the leading card issuers were unconcerned about new competitors who had declared themselves. Save &amp; Prosper, the investment group, last month launched a Visa card with an annualised percentage rate of interest (APR) 7 percentage points below the market norm. But it had said it was not interested in building a mass market and has deliberately restricted eligibility, seeking to attract mainly those looking to borrow on a credit card. The aim is to double its existing base of 100,000 customers. In contrast, Barclaycard has almost 9m customers; NatWest has 4m. Similarly, the announcement by BMNA America Bank, one of the largest US credit card lenders, that it is to set up a European headquarters in Chester and plans to issue UK credit cards, did not cause alarm. In the US it has focused on groups such as teachers. But Vauxhall's entry is different. Some competitors even admit the package being offered is 'good'. The APR of 19.9 per cent is 3 percentage points below most others and there is no annual fee. 'Rebate points' acquired each time the card is used could save up to Pounds 2,500 on the cost of a new car, but only if purchases total Pounds 50,000 over five years. Also likely to worry the established UK players is the impressive success in the US of credit cards launched by manufacturers. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Universal credit card, unveiled in March 1990, is now the second largest in the US bank credit card industry by numbers of cards. The GM card, launched in September last year, has 8m customers in the US. General Electric and Ford motors have started their own schemes. Vauxhall is not expected by others in the credit card business to be the last non-bank to enter the UK market. British Telecom is considering creating a combined credit and telephone card in co-operation with one of the existing issuers. It would be rash, however, to assume that a repeat of the US successes can be guaranteed. The high street banks say that their relations with customers are stronger than in the US so account holders are less likely to go elsewhere for a credit card. 'There's much less loyalty in the States,' says Mr Bob Potts, managing director of Barclaycard. But even if the take-up of non-bank credit cards, such as Vauxhall's, does not match that in the US, the result could still be to shake up the market. 'In a year, I expect the new entrants on a combined basis to have achieved a significant but still small share of the market - large enough for people to say 'They're serious and they're here,'' Mr Potts says. His prediction, shared by others among the main players, is that the casualties in any credit card war would be smaller existing issuers, such as some building societies, which cannot exploit economies of scale and do not offer a sophisticated package of discounts. But the smaller operators see the contest differently. Mr Mark Christopher, marketing director for banking services at S &amp; P, says small issuers that focus on a niche market will not be in direct competition with the Vauxhall card. Instead the brunt of the competition will fall on the market leaders. 'It gives the major cards a problem,' he says. Although it is unclear who would win from a credit card war, the grounds on which any battle would be fought are more obvious: fees and interest charges, customer service, and the extras on offer. Of these, the focus looks set to be on the additional benefits. Vauxhall's discount scheme is the latest. Alongside insurance on purchases, many issuers now offer 'loyalty schemes' that encourage frequent use of the card. Barclaycard Profiles, for instance, offers points towards a selection of gifts, while NatWest offers 'air miles' that give discounts on travel. Such schemes have proved successful in making customers use their cards more often. But, from the customers' point of view, they require high or persistent spending. To qualify for a toaster from Barclaycard requires spending Pounds 4,900. A return trip to Paris from a NatWest card needs Pounds 9,000 of expenditure. The Consumers' Association warned this week that nobody should apply for a card because of a 'gimmick' but should look instead at the annual charges imposed on most cards and the interest rates. It is on these more central features of a credit card that the prospects for new and existing entrants will almost certainly depend. Vauxhall seems to have recognised this by combining its discount scheme with a competitive interest rate and no charge. Some rivals are sceptical about whether the initial offer can, or will, be maintained, in spite of an assurance from Mr Charles Golden, chairman and managing director of Vauxhall, that 'it wouldn't be in our interest to play games with the fee or the APR'. There are also those who argue that the annual fee and APR are not necessarily decisive factors in choosing a card. Ms Elizabeth Phillips, director of the Credit Card Research Group, which carries out research for the industry, says the original imposition of annual fees was an emotive issue but now that they extend to more than three-quarters of cards, such charges are no longer as contentious. She is also unconvinced that the APR is critically important because about three-quarters of credit cards are paid off in full most months. But given that CCRG estimates that the average spending on a credit card is only about Pounds 1,500 a year - not even enough for a toaster from Barclaycard - undercutting on annual fees and interest rates is probably the quickest way for new entrants to grab a market presence. The evidence is that most card holders do not take advantage of the advertised benefits. Mr Bruce Reid, marketing director for AT&amp;T's Universal card, pins the growth of his product on basic pricing: 'The word 'free' was instrumental in our popularity . . . You won't find our card packed with a lot of bells and whistles.' If Vauxhall's tactics are sustained then the market leaders will have to respond. A first step may be to improve the additional benefits they offer. But given that the main use of a credit card is not to win a free electric kettle but to facilitate spending, the long-term response may be a competitive struggle to offer lower charges.</p>

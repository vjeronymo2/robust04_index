			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: HARD-EARNED AWARD IN NAME OF STUPIDITY  </P> <P> The club for the Incredibly Stupid and Dumb Beyond Belief (ISDBB) was not  founded by me. It was begun by a friend of mine in the East who thought there  should be a tangible award for turning a simple situation into a disaster. You  can't give a Heisman Trophy for something like that.  </P> <P> So, a confession to such a deed is rewarded with a statue of a creature with a  potbelly and a club in its hand. Someone had bought it at a garage sale. Like a  torch, it is passed from one incompetent to another.  </P> <P> My friend got it for sitting up all night in a living room chair waiting for  her teen-age son to come home, only to learn after a restless night and a sore  back that he had come in through the kitchen door around 11.  </P> <P> She, in turn, passed it on to a friend who thought he left the lens cap to his  new camera in a shop in Mexico.  </P> <P> After hours of retracing his steps to all the stores he had visited, he  discovered the lens was retractable and opened and closed with a flip of the  finger.  </P> <P> The ugly ISDBB statue found its way west when my husband told them the story of  how he left his passport on top of a hotel TV set in London and had to pay an  empty cab $40 to pick it up and rush it to the airport.  </P> <P> I can't remember the reason he sent it back East, but the statue broke in  transit and he got it right back for being dumb enough to send it in a shoe box  wrapped only in tissue in the first place.  </P> <P> We have kept it ever since because we realized we had enough ISDBB candidates  within our family to keep it moving briskly for the rest of our lives.  </P> <P> My mother paid $3,000 to buy a battery-driven chair for my father to tool  around the house, only to discover it wouldn't fit through the door frames. We  didn't give her the ISDBB trophy until she sold the car for $1,000.  </P> <P> Pouring boiling water from a spaghetti pot down my stomach didn't make me  stupid enough for the award. Telling my mother about it did.  </P> <P> My daughter got it when she was sucking so hard on a Tootsie Roll with her  tongue that it caused a blood blister to pop under her tongue.  </P> <P> A couple of days ago I was running barefoot through the house. I have made a  million speeches to people who visit us in the desert about running around in  bare feet.  </P> <P> It is one of my more inspiring speeches. We have a lot of animals here who take  a dim view of being stepped on. I stepped on a scorpion.  </P> <P> In bed, with my foot on fire, I waited for the ugly statue with the potbelly  and the club in its hand to appear.  </P> <P> Finally, the family gathered around and said I would have permanent possession  of the award. I had just been named to the Stupid Hall of Fame. They all  applauded.  </P> <P> You'll excuse me if I don't get up.  </P></p>

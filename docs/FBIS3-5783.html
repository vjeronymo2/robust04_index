			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to Seoul Radio, on 9 March the South  Korean puppet vice foreign minister made the absurd remark  [tangchi anun chapsorirul chechyossumnida] that it is unclear if  the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks will be held, mentioning the  nuclear inspection and North-South dialogue.    As has already been reported, an International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] inspection team started inspections of us on 1  March, according to an agreement reached in DPRK-U.S. contacts  in New York, and our country's organizations concerned are  cooperating in the inspection team's activities.    Our position is to sincerely implement agreements regarding  the IAEA inspections to guarantee the continuity of nuclear  safeguards. Despite this fact, the puppet vice foreign minister  said that the agency's inspections of us are unsatisfactory.  His remarks are indeed extremely absurd and preposterous.    The puppet vice foreign minister also said that the  South-North dialogue is not going smoothly. If we have to say  something about this, we can say that the South is entirely  responsible for this.    In the fifth working-level contact for an exchange of  special  envoys of the North and South, the South side, instead of  expressing a clear attitude toward our side's principled demand  before discussing practical problems, made preposterous  sophistries that our demand creates obstacles and that it is  unnecessary, thus creating obstacles to the discussions of  problems.    The South side even deliberately raised an issue that has no  relation to the discussions of the practical procedure and  blemished the atmosphere of the talks, assuming an extremely  provocative attitude.    The puppets are now saying that the North-South dialogue is  not going smoothly, after they themselves created deliberate  obstacles to working-level contacts. This is no more than  avoiding their responsibility.    Never should it go unnoticed that the puppets keep insisting  that progress in North-South dialogue is a precondition for the  third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    As we have already elucidated, in the agreement reached at  the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, it only mentions the  resumption of working-level contact for the exchange of special  envoys of the North and South as one of the steps of  simultaneous action [tongsi haengdong chochi]. There is no  indication about the realization of the exchange of special  envoys.    The two sides of the DPRK and U.S. did not agree to the  steps  of simultaneous action with something as a precondition. The  reason that the puppets are continuously babbling about some a  precondition is ultimately to create an artificial barrier to  put the brakes on the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. This is  nothing but a nasty scheme.    This is being vividly proven by the fact that the so-called  puppet vice foreign minister confessed that consultations are  being continuously carried out with allies, including the United  States, on the issue of referring the North Korean nuclear issue  to the UN Security Council.    Under the pretext of dialogue, the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique  is pursuing behind the scenes the anti-Republic maneuver of  isolation and suffocation under the international cooperative  system [kukche kongjo cheje]. This will ultimately only lead to  the road of pressing for destruction.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Italy delays pension fraud move Italian cabinet ministers met yesterday to discuss cutting pension spending but delayed any decision on an amnesty for disability fraud. Implementing savings on pensions is a key part of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's plan to cut the budget deficit. The government suspects that as many as 3m people in a country of 57m receive some monthly payments for disabilities they do not have. Cabinet secretary Gianni Letta said the ministers agreed to overhaul the entire disability system. But he told reporters that an amnesty for disability fraudsters, which had been proposed by some coalition partners, had not yet been taken up for discussion.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unlocking a house's value My wife and I own our house. Since we have no children, it (or the proceeds thereof) will go to relatives when we die. Since most of our income has gone into the house, we are looking for a way to get its value (Pounds 60,000) for ourselves, but without having to resort to any debt. Is it possible for us to sell the house to, say, a finance or insurance company but continue to live there until we die? Or is there any other type of scheme that we could opt for? You should approach the idea of selling your house to a finance or other company with extreme caution. There are, however, arrangements which may well be mutually profitable in your situation and, therefore, we suggest you contact Age Concern at Astral House, 1268 London Road, London SW16 4ER (tel: 081-679 8000). Ask for a copy of its book, Using Your Home as Capital (price Pounds 4.50) and its free fact sheet number 12. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

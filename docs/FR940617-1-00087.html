			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> 6. The agency has reviewed the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Allowable Statements  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in &sect;333.85 for health-care personnel handwash, in &sect;333.87 for patient preoperative skin preparation, and in &sect;333.97 for surgical hand scrub and determined that statements such as ``contains antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial ingredient(s),'' and ``non-irritating,'' are not related in a significant way to the safe and effective use of these products and are not necessary on products intended primarily for health-care professionals. Therefore, the agency is not including these statements in this amended tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph. The statement ``recommended for repeated use,'' proposed for a health-care personnel handwash, has been included as an ``other allowable indication'' in proposed &sect;333.455. The terms ``broad spectrum'' and ``fast acting'' are included in the definitions of all three product classes and the agency does not see the need to include this information in the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling. (See section I.D., comment 7.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The agency is proposing revised indications for patient preoperative skin preparations in order to more precisely describe the intended uses of these products. The previous indications ``kills micro-organisms,'' ``antibacterial,'' and ``antimicrobial'' are not being included. Likewise, the indications ``kills micro-organisms,'' ``bacteriostatic,'' and ``bactericidal'' previously proposed for surgical hand scrubs are not being included in this amended tentative final monograph. The agency believes that these terms are product attributes and not indications for use and should not be included as indications in the labeling of these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Based on the recommendations of the Miscellaneous External Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol drug products (47 FR 22324 at 22332), the agency is proposing ``for preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' as an indication for OTC alcohol and isopropyl alcohol drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The agency is proposing in &sect;333.450(c) of this amended tentative final monograph the following general warning statements for all health-care antiseptic drug products:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) ``For external use only.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) ``Do not use in the eyes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) ``Discontinue use if irritation and redness develops. If condition persists for more than 72 hours consult a doctor.'' The agency is further proposing that the second sentence of the proposed warning in (3) above may be deleted for products labeled ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' (See section I.D., comment 8.) In addition to the general warnings proposed for OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care antiseptic drug products, the agency is proposing the following warning for patient preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl alcohol identified in &sect;333.412(d): ``Do not use this product with electrocautery procedures.'' The proposed warning is based on reports of burns associated with the use of isopropyl alcohol containing patient preoperative skin preparations with electrocautery procedures. (See section II.A., paragraph 1_Summary of Ingredient Categories.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Based on its review of the published literature (Refs. 1, 2, and 3), the agency has determined that the way in which health-care antiseptic drug products are used,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  method of application, duration of scrub or wash, or use in conjunction with a device (such as a scrub brush), contributes to the effectiveness of these drug products. Therefore, instead of proposing directions for use of these products that include fixed scrub or wash durations or methods of application, the agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;333.455(c), 333.460(d), and 333.465(c) directions for use that reflect the conditions used when the antiseptic product was tested according to &sect;333.470(b). In addition, based on data indicating that the largest bioburden of the hands lies in the subungual region (Ref. 4), the agency is proposing that the directions for use of surgical hand scrub drug products include the following instructions for the trimming and cleansing of the nails: ``Clean under nails with a nail pick. Nails should be maintained with a 1 millimeter free edge.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Ayliffe, G.A.J., ``Surgical Scrub and Skin Disinfection,'' Infection Control, 5:23&hyph;27, 1984.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

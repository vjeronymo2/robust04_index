			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S RIGHTS LAW AND THE ATTEMPT TO AMEND IT  </P> <P> After reading "A Matter of Values, Political Semantics" (May 4) I wonder: What  other "behaviors" disturb Scott Peotter's "traditional values" system? And I  have pondered what group, included in the Irvine human rights ordinance, will  be the next target of his coalition on account of their "behavior."  </P> <P> Peotter tells us that his set of values came from the "Founding Fathers";  however, he fails to realize they were a great group of activists -- perhaps  even radicals -- who, in their own time, overthrew a government! And while I  don't know if any were gay, some were quite noteworthy for their womanizing and  boozing.  </P> <P> Throughout history, a few so-called traditionists have excluded many with their  one-dimensional view of what society should be. Now that the initiative to  discriminate against sexual orientation will appear on the November ballot, I  feel certain that a majority of the people of Irvine will use three-dimensional  vision and vote it down.  </P> <P> MARTHA BELL  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

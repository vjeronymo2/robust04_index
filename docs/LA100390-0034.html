			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BRETT SITS, DARES HENDERSON TO CATCH HIM  </P> <P> Kansas City's George Brett, leading the American League with a .328 average,  kept himself out of the lineup in Tuesday night's game against the Cleveland  Indians, saying he wanted to force Oakland's Rickey Henderson to catch him.  Henderson had a .326 average going into Tuesday night's game against the  Angels.  </P> <P> "I want to see what he does tonight," Brett said. "From the people I talked to,  the consensus was, make him come to you."  </P> <P> With Brett on the bench, the Indians scored nine runs in the first inning and  won, 13-3, at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Henderson went one for four in Oakland's 6-4 win over the Angels and slipped to  .325.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 9, New York 4 -- The Pirates spoiled Dwight Gooden's bid for his  20th victory and ended his eight-game winning streak at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Sid Bream hit a two-run homer as Gooden (19-7) lost for the first time since  Aug. 4. Working on three days rest instead of four, Gooden allowed nine hits  and eight runs, six earned, in 4 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Bobby Bonilla drove in two runs to raise his RBI total to 120, two behind NL  leader Matt Williams of San Francisco.  </P> <P> New York's Dave Magadan was one for five and dropped to .329, six points behind  NL batting leader Willie McGee, traded from St. Louis to Oakland last month.  Magadan would have to go five for five today to pass McGee.  </P> <P> Chicago 3, Philadelphia 1 -- Andre Dawson reached the 100-RBI mark for the  third time in his career as the Cubs defeated the Phillies at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Dawson, who left the game after driving in a run in the top of the first,  improved his batting average to .310, the highest of his career.  </P> <P> Braves 16, Giants 7 -- Tommy Gregg's three-run, pinch-hit homer keyed a  seven-run sixth inning for Atlanta at San Francisco.  </P> <P> Gregg's fourth pinch-hit homer of the year put the Braves ahead, 7-6. Atlanta  finished with 18 hits, including nine for extra bases.  </P> <P> Montreal 2, St. Louis 1 -- Kevin Gross earned his first victory in more than  three months and Otis Nixon set a base-stealing record as the Expos won at  Montreal.  </P> <P> Nixon set a record for most stolen bases in the fewest at-bats in one season  when he stole second base in the first inning. The steal was Nixon's 50th in  228 at-bats.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 3, Houston 2 -- None of the Reds' pitchers threw more than two  innings in the victory over the Astros at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Four Red pitchers, including starter Jack Armstrong, retired the first 16  batters in order before Luis Gonzalez doubled off Rick Mahler with one out in  the sixth.  </P> <P> Seattle 3, Minnesota 0 -- Erik Hanson pitched a seven-hitter for his first  major league shutout and became the second pitcher in Seattle history to get 18  victories in a season as the Mariners beat the Twins at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> The victory was the seventh straight for Hanson (18-9), who ended up one win  shy of Mark Langston's club record.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 1, Texas 0 -- The Brewers' Kevin Brown gave up one hit over seven  innings for his first major league victory as the Rangers lost at Milwaukee.  </P></p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (4): Two economies that overlap - Guangdong eyes Hong Kong WHEN Mr Ye Xuanping vacates his post as the liberal governor of the southern province of Guangdong to take up a less powerful post in Peking during the next few months, an almost revolutionary dream which he is believed to have wanted to write into the eighth five-year plan may go with him, or at least be diluted. It is to merge the economies of Guangdong and Hong Kong. There is, however, strong opposition from hardliners in Peking who disapprove of Guangdong's independently free-wheeling market-oriented ways. Hong Kong also has serious reservations, partly because it does not want to endanger its current autonomy, nor make it easy for China to renege on its promise of a 'high degree of autonomy' after 1997. 'There are, of course, problems of our different economic and social systems and I would not talk about merging the economies, but we would like to have some sort of planned development,' says Mr Yi Zhenqiu, director of the Guangdong Office of Economic Systems Reform. He envisages the creation of a Hong Kong-Guangdong economic and trade promotion committee to act as an industrial investment 'match-maker'. In the past decade, Guangdong, which has a population of 64m, has become China's most open and prosperous province, thriving on close economic links between its Pearl River Delta area with Hong Kong. About 1.5m-2m workers in the province are employed in factories processing partially-manufactured foreign goods (mostly from Hong Kong) for re-export, and another 1m are in associated activities. As many as 50,000 technical and managerial staff from Hong Kong work regularly in China, a lot of them in Guangdong, and 15,000 vehicles cross the land border every day, four times as many as six years ago. Economists estimate that 20 per cent or more of Hong Kong's currency is openly circulating in Guangdong tourist and business outlets. This co-operation has been good for both areas. Hong Kong companies have gained access to cheap labour and factory premises. Guangdong has benefited because of the consequential wealth and economic expansion. Foreign investment totalled some Dollars 7bn during the 1980s, 90 per cent via Hong Kong. It went into more than 10,000 joint ventures and other enterprises, mostly involving labour intensive light industry, plus thousands of the processing factories. The productive end of this investment has suddenly come on stream during the past two years, so that between 25 and 30 per cent of both Guangdong's yuan 189bn industrial output and its yuan 43.29bn industrial exports last year were generated by factories with foreign involvement. But there has been a price to pay in social terms because hundreds of thousands of people regularly pour into the province looking for work. Some make up a floating labour population of more than 1m in the processing factories; others cannot find work and fuel a crime wave of armed robberies and prostitution. Guangdong is also frustrated that most Hong Kong businessmen only cash in on the cheap unskilled processing factory labour. They rarely lay down significant long-term industrial investment and look to other countries for high technology. Some labour processing factories do develop into joint ventures and so become more permanent investments. But relatively little progress has been made on the creation of a technological and industrial base in relation to overall economic growth, which last year amounted to 16 per cent. The new five year plan includes projects which should help by improving both electricity power supplies and road and rail transport and by creating three petro-chemical plants. The capital of Guangzhou also wants to boost its service sector by admitting two new foreign banks and by setting up a stock exchange. Problems such as these prompted the idea of somehow merging the economies so that Guangdong would benefit more, and Mr Ye also talked about relaxing restrictions on the entry of goods from the colony into Guangdong's most successful special economic zone of Shenzhen. 'We have not yet put forward any firm policies to Peking, but we would like to consider using Hong Kong money to help finance raw materials plants. We also have scientific ability which could be used to help Hong Kong industries develop high technological products,' says Mr Yi, floating an idea which has yet to catch on in Hong Kong.</p>

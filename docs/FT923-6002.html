			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Accountancy Column: Seeing may not be believing on pension costs - Norma Cohen explains why there is unease about the treatment of fund surpluses under current rules THE Great Illusion is the title given to the chapter on pension fund accounting in Accounting for Growth, the controversial book by Terry Smith, the suspended head of research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. While more publicity-shy members of both the accountancy and pensions professions would choose a more moderate description of current rules, the balance of their convictions lie with Mr Smith's conclusion. The current rule on accounting for pension costs, known as SSAP 24, has been singled out for a review by the Accounting Standards Board. And while the ASB says no revision is likely within the next year, key aspects of SSAP are troubling. The Pensions Research Accountants Group (PRAG), an ad hoc committee of leading actuaries and accountants, in a report submitted to the ASB last week concluded that in key respects, the standard is unsatisfactory. It says: 'The standard in its current form allows employers a great deal of flexibility to adjust results on a short-term basis, substantially impairs an informed reader's ability to make judgments about annual pension costs and in practice prevents any general attempt to compare one employer's pension cost figures with another's by adjusting one or both to a common calculation basis.' Similarly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in a paper it prepared for the ASB, concluded that to compensate for the flexibility it offers to preparers of accounts, a much greater degree of disclosure is required. 'The time for a period of experimentation with SSAP 24 is now over and revision is necessary,' the ICAEW said. 'It is a better method than what was in use before but it is still unsatisfactory,' said Mr Thomas Crowter of KPMG Actuarial Services, noting that prior to 1988 when the rule took effect, no standard existed. 'Most analysts are pretty financially sophisticated people and even they often can't understand pension fund expense.' Among the complaints about SSAP 24 is the scope it gives companies to calculate the value of pension fund surpluses or deficits. Some 92 per cent of respondents to a recent survey from the Society of Pension Consultants said they were in that category. Indeed, Mr Crowter argues, there is reason to question whether companies should be entitled to show pension fund surpluses on their balance sheets as assets at all. 'Do the assets really belong to the employer and are they at his disposal?' he asked. This question lies at the heart at the current debate over pension fund law. Currently, the government has commissioned an independent panel to study pension reform in the aftermath of the Maxwell pension scandal and the ownership and control of assets is at the top of the agenda. While the UK courts have implied in recent decisions that scheme members should have a say in the disposal of scheme surpluses, that right has yet to be enshrined in law. But aside from this question, which must await legislation for a suitable answer, other pressing issues remain. In the calculation of pension expense, there are several standards currently in use, the choice of any one of which can change the picture significantly. But because most companies do not include enough information in their accounts about their methods of calculation, the actual figure shown in the profit and loss account means little. Part of the difficulty in assessing pension expense, even without the existence of either a surplus or a deficit, is that it depends on a variety of assumptions used by actuaries. The key variables are assumptions about general increases in employee average earnings, dividend growth on investment portfolio and the assumed growth rate of the retail price index. Also, discretionary increases in pension benefits, frequently awarded annually at the judgment of trustees, will have an effect on cost assumptions. By altering any of these key variables, an actuary may increase or decrease the amount of contribution needed from the employer or, indeed, make a surplus arise or disappear. The SPC survey, for instance, found that only 50 per cent of respondents allowed for discretionary increases in their SSAP 24 calculation of cost. 'If the remaining 50 per cent of respondents are required by the Social Security Act of 1990 to convert these discretionary practices into guarantees, then large increases in pension cost may result,' the survey concluded. Thus, some pensions experts argue, SSAP 24 should first require disclosure of the underlying actuarial assumptions along with the impact of discretionary increases. 'This is being done but in a haphazard way by auditors,' said Mr Andrew Wilson, partner in charge of research at actuarial consultants R Watson. However, some experts in pensions accountancy believe that improving disclosure will not solve the shortcomings of SSAP 24. Mr Ken Wild, partner at Touche Ross and chairman of the ICAEW committee which prepared the review of the standard, warned that so much information would have to be provided to make the information meaningful that 'you will end up with information overload'. Instead, he suggested, the ASB may wish to concentrate on limiting flexibility in the rule and insist expenses be calculated in specific ways. The greatest debate lies over the method used to recognise the benefits of pension surpluses. The SPC survey found that when SSAP 24 came into effect in 1988, 20 per cent of respondents immediately put the surplus on the balance sheet as a prepayment. However, the remainder amortised the benefits over time as a variation to the ongoing cost. And therein lies the rub. The most popular method has been known as the straight line method, which allocates spreading the surplus over, say, 15 years and increasing the amount amortised in each successive year by a percentage equal to the average salary increase. Such a method will give accounts the greatest nominal benefits in the out-years. More controversial is the use of the so-called straight line method, preferred by 27 per cent of respondents to the SPC survey. This recognises presumed investment income from the surplus over its life, in addition to amortising the surplus itself, and will give the company very large up-front benefits which reduce as time goes on. Last, there is the level monetary amount, a hybrid of both approaches. Meanwhile, there is a debate about how to spread pension expense over the average working life of employees. One method, that favoured by PRAG, is known as the projected unit method. This requires the company to set a contribution rate which includes assumptions of salary increases over the average working life - typically 15 years. Mr Wilson argues that this method can produce the most accurate picture of cost unless there are significant changes in the demographic make-up of the workforce. The alternative method is known as attained age and calculates the like cost of providing benefits to employees once they have reached the age at which they become eligible. However, Mr Wilson notes, such a method is inappropriate for a scheme which has been wound up or which is still accepting new members.</p>

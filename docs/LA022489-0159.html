			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews.  </P> <P> Crocodile Cafe in the Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea. (714) 529-CAFE.  Open 7 days 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., till 12 on weekends.  </P> <P> Greg Smith is doing more than just promoting the new American cuisine; he's  making it into a populist movement at this small, laughably inexpensive cafe.  Enjoy wonderful hamburgers grilled over smoking embers of oak, wood-fired  pizzas with designer toppings, and trendy homemade pastas like fettucine with  roasted Pasilla chili and ancho-cream. Sit under the thirty foot vinyl  crocodile sipping boutique wines. You can bet your Beamer that this restaurant  is a good value.  </P> <P> Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714)  859-9393. Open Tuesdays through Sundays 6 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic  dining areas anywhere: clustered tent canopies among a maze of mirrors with an  almost mystical dimension. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no  utensils, and are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings: b'stilla (a  sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a savory  vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire. The Arabic music  accompanying her is deafening.  </P> <P> Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open weekdays 10 a.m.  to 10:30 p.m., weekends till 3 a.m.  </P> <P> Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a  crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture: The crowd is as diverse as the  menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic centered beef) are  two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50  noodle dishes. While away the day listening to Asian pop music, gawking at the  new wavers and sipping filter coffee and tropical freezes made from durian and  jackfruit.  </P> <P> Felix Continental Cafe, 36 Plaza Square, Orange. (714) 633-5842. Open 7 days  from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> You can smell the garlic for blocks around this European-looking, Cuban-style  cafe in the old downtown of Orange. The menu abounds with exotica. Papa  rellena, a potato and egg croquette rolled in bread crumbs, is about the best  appetizer. Roast chicken Cubano, a crispy half chicken with bitter orange peel  added for extra dimension, is definitely the best entree. Save room for dessert  -- it is the best course here. Pineapple-raisin bread pudding, a soft, buttery  suspension of rum, eggs, flour and fruit, is good enough to make Betty Crocker  blush.  </P> <P> Caffe Piemonte, 1835 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 532-3296. Open Tuesdays  through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Sundays 5 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Two brothers from Piemonte, one of Italy's most scenic provinces, have opened  this handsome, spotless little trattoria in the city of Orange, and already it  has become a county hotspot. Start any meal here with the wonderful, sumptuous  antipasto and then move on to one of chef Luigi Ravetto's hand extruded  homemade pastas (such as chewy ruotelle, little, six-spoked wheels perfect for  soaking up sauce). Ravetto's cooking is somewhat generic, but he has included  polenta, the cornmeal staple of his province, and you really should try it. His  polenta Piemontese, with a light, grainy cheese sauce, is most appealing.  </P> <P> California Pizza Kitchen, Fashion Island, 1151 Newport Center Drive, Newport  Beach. (714) 759-5543. Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.,  Fridays and Saturdays to 11, Sundays to 9.  </P> <P>  With the eighties has come the designer pizza, and it looks as if the phenom  is here to stay. That's what the California Pizza Kitchen is banking on,  anyway. This slicked down operation, designed for flash and staffed with young,  beautiful people, serves an eclectic, almost futuristic array of pizzas topped  with everything from goat cheese to peanut sauce. Service is somewhat  indifferent at present; high energy owners Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfeld should  fix that problem soon. Best to stick with the pizzas that don't fall too far  from the tree; five-cheese, homemade sausage, and a delicious bar-b-cued  chicken.  </P> <P> 1520 AD, 821 S. Beach Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 995-5464. Seatings are Fridays at  7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 6:30 and 9:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  The food at 1520 AD may not be authentic Tudor, but who cares? When you eat  with your fingers, everything tastes better. The opening course at this  re-creation of a Merrie Olde England roadhouse is a hearty lentil barley soup,  drunk from large draughts and eaten with hunks of brown bread. There is a  choice of four entrees: slow cooked chicken, lamb shank in a white sauce, steak  kabob, and a most modern filet of halibut with a heathen Spanish sauce on top.  The abundant platters of rice and vegetables, the fine, lemony pound cake, and  the bottomless mugs of ice cold beer make for a dinner that King Henry himself  would have enjoyed.  </P> <P> Granville's, in the Disneyland Hotel, 1150 W. Cerritos Ave., Anaheim. (714)  778-6600. Open Tuesdays through Saturdays 6 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> The Disneyland Hotel might not immediately spring to mind when the subject of  restaurants comes up, but it ought to: Granville's, its flagship restaurant, is  one of the best around. The room is designed for elegance, with mahogany  sideboards, Regency-style chairs and overwhelming shades of burgundy. Chef Tim  Owen trained with Boston cooking teacher Madeleine Kamman, and his cuisine is  original and delicate. Such appetizers as Little Neck clams steamed in Pernod  with spinach are wonderful, as are such entrees as loin of lamb in an anise  crust, oven roasted with thyme and rosemary. There is an extensive wine list  (featuring American wines only), and the service is impeccable.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DICKERSON GETS OK TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE TRADE  </P> <P> Colts owner Robert Irsay has given his star running back, Eric Dickerson,  permission to approach two teams to put together a possible trade.  </P> <P> Dickerson has said he would like to be traded to either Washington or the New  York Giants if he were to leave the Colts.  </P> <P> "I haven't offered Eric to either of those teams," Irsay said Wednesday in  Orlando, Fla., where the NFL meetings are being held this week.  </P> <P> "All I've done is give Eric permission to talk with the teams and see what they  would be willing to offer."  </P> <P> Washington Coach Joe Gibbs said he doesn't believe that the Redskins would be  able to obtain Dickerson.  </P> <P> "Everybody in this league would have an interest in Eric Dickerson if things  could be worked out," Gibbs said. "We do have some darned good runners. What  did they trade to get him . . . the stadium, three owners and half the team?"  </P> <P> Giants General Manager George Young said negotiating a Dickerson trade "is not  one of my priorities."  </P> <P> "I think he is a wonderful player," Young said. "I'm not going to say I would  say no to him."  </P> <P> Young added, however, "When a player shows an interest to be traded, it's  normally a ploy in an attempt to get more money."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Irsay said Wednesday that he knew nothing about a rumor that the  Colts were one of four teams Miami quarterback Dan Marino wanted to consider in  a possible trade deal.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy with Mr. (Chris) Chandler and Mr. (Jack) Trudeau as my  quarterbacks," Irsay said, but added, "We would always talk with Miami if they  called."  </P></p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Arts: Forward planning or wishful thinking? - Antony Thorncroft talks to director of the Tate Gallery Nicholas Serota about his dreams for Bankside Nicholas Serota has been making a list . . . and indulging in a pleasing fantasy: detailing the works of art that he would like to acquire for the Tate Gallery. Suddenly, his wish list is not just idle fancy. A new 'Tate Gallery of Modern Art' already seems a likely candidate for a National Lottery-funded millennium grant. The building - the abandoned power station on Bankside - is in place; the short-list of architects to design the transformation is selected; the Tate is confident that it can raise Pounds 40m, half the cost, from its own resources. It is almost time to fix the opening day in 2000 and draw up the guest list. In the meantime Serota is planning how to stock his creation. The old Tate will remain the home of British art; the new Tate, which will be roughly the same size as the old building at Millbank, will continue the international history of art where the National Gallery leaves off, somewhere around 1905. As a new century and a new millennium starts, there might be some gentle horse-trading between our two leading art museums, which these days enjoy a good relationship. Neil MacGregor at the National Gallery might pass over a Picasso or a Braque to the Tate in return for a Whistler or a Sargent, in a little chronological tidying up. It will, however, be minor stuff. The bulk of the display at the Bankside Tate, which will total around 1,000 paintings and sculptures, will come from the Tate's current collection: half from key works already frequently on view, the other half promoted from the vaults which, through pressure of space, always contain most of the Tate's holdings. But approaching a third of the hang at Bankside, around 300 works, will, with luck, be acquired in the next five years. These will be modern masterpieces that will plug gaps in the Tate's collection. And gaps there certainly are. Serota checks off his want list. 'We've not much German or northern art; we want more Picasso and Matisse; we're not strong on the Russian constructivists; we've no Latin American art; we've not got the depth of the MOMA (New York) in pre-war art, or the Pompidou (Paris) in post-war.' Now the names come rushing out. 'I'd love a late Bonnard, Matisse, Dix and Beckmann, Corinth, Giacometti, Brancusi, late Braque; we are not good on the Cubists'. There is also the need to keep acquiring the contemporary - two of the five chronological divisions envisaged in the Bankside Tate will be devoted to post-1960 art. Serota is proposing a three pronged attack. Some of the works on his list will come from loans, some from gifts and some from purchases. It is the thought of entering the market with a cheque book that gives Serota most pleasure. For over a decade the Tate's annual grant for new purchases has been frozen, a decade in which prices have soared. In the 1960s and early 1970s the Tate could still buy wisely and cheaply - a Brancusi 'Bird' for Pounds 23,000; a Giacometti for Pounds 25,000. By the late 1980s the best works of contemporary artists like Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and de Kooning, to say nothing of established masters like Picasso, Matisse and Braque, were fetching over Pounds 10m in the saleroom. The Tate was forced to the sidelines. With help from the Friends of the Tate there have been some purchases - a Richard Hamilton was acquired only last week - but Serota says wistfully 'I can almost always find something in a Sotheby's or a Christie's catalogue that I would like.' Wishes could become horses, thanks, once again, to the lottery. The Heritage Lottery Fund is prepared to be convinced that major works of art, suddenly on the market, might make an essential contribution to the British heritage  -even if created by a Frenchman or an American. Serota hopes that if something marvellous comes up the Tate stands a chance of securing it, even if it carries a Pounds 5m price tag. This should embrace most of the masterpieces of the past generation, the area where Serota thinks the Tate can still build up a collection the equal of anything in Paris and New York. After purchases come loans. This is the trickiest area. There are many dealers who would love to loan works by their artists in the certain knowledge that a spell on the walls of the Tate enhances their reputation and value. The Tate is circumspect here. Loans from serious collectors, and especially from artists, are acceptable, especially as a loan can, over time, merge into a gift. The Tate has a good relationship with artists and will be looking for immediate gifts from them. This, too, can be a delicate matter: artists like to see their donations move swiftly from the vaults to the walls. In recent years the Tate has gratefully accepted a Francis Bacon triptych; a portrait head from Lucian Freud; a whole room full of works by Mark Rothko. When the Tate bought a Jasper Johns the artist threw in some sculptures and prints on loan; Giacometti sold a sculpture for a nominal price. Most artists will be attracted by the idea of ensuring immortality by contributing a work to Bankside - or so Serota hopes. The Tate has been so successful in recent years that it is hard to imagine that this, Serota's greatest project, will fall apart. Let's leave him planning the future, acquiring two master works a year - 'a great Beckmann and a late Bonnard; then a Picasso sculpture and an Otto Dix; a Giacometti to make a display never seen in the UK before, and another Brancusi . . .'</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow gains as investors digest economic data Wall Street US share prices ended a volatile day in mostly positive territory, thanks to news of some strong quarterly earnings and late options expiration-related buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.69 at 3,478.61, the high for the day and a new record. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.54 higher at 448.94, while the Amex composite ended up 0.50 at 419.92 and the Nasdaq composite down 3.54 lower at 666.78. Trading volume on the New York SE was 300m shares. The market opened in a positive mood, in spite of declining bond prices and mixed economic reports. The trade deficit widened in February to Dollars 7.2bn as exports, after months of solid growth, fell because of weakness in overseas economies. March industrial production, meanwhile, was flat. Although the severe winter storms of last month were partly to blame for the lack of output growth, the data suggests nonetheless that the economy is not exactly firing on all cylinders. Investors, however, chose to ignore the economic news. Attention was primarily fixed instead on quarterly earnings, and on the afternoon expiration of options contracts. The expiration led to a backup of buy orders in many large stocks, temporarily halting some trading. By the close, the expiration-related business had added about 15 points to the Dow. Affected by earnings news, Storage Technology jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 25 5/8 after the company reported first quarter operating profits of 14 cents a share, down from a year ago but better than expectations. One of the day's biggest losers was Gillette, which plunged Dollars 5 to Dollars 49 after brokerage house Bear Stearns downgraded the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold'. On Thursday, Gillette announced higher profits, but static sales. Wal-Mart, which earlier in the week told analysts that sales growth at its stores this year would not make it into double-figures, continued to suffer at the hands of sellers. The retailer's stock fell another Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 5/8 in volume of 6m shares. The stock is within Dollars 1 of its 52-week low. Manufacturers of brand-name consumer products remained out of favour. Pepsico fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37, Coca-Cola dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 and Procter &amp; Gamble fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 5/8 . Canada TORONTO stock prices closed at a high for the day, as the exchange set a new volume record. The composite index rose 17.63 points, closing at 3651.86. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 377 to 305.</p>

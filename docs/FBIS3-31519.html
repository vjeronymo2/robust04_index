			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A declaration of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs describes the process of withdrawing heavy armaments  from Sarajevo as a sign of hope in connection with halting the  military operations and in connection with solving the problems  at the negotiating table.    The document expresses high appreciation for the efforts of  the United Nations, NATO, the United States, and Russia, which  although somewhat belated have demonstrated that acceptable  solutions to alleviate the conflict can be achieved on the basis  of coordinated efforts.    As a country closely situated near the area of the conflict  and bearing a heavy share of the burden imposed by the  international sanctions, the Republic of Bulgaria has a vital  interest in promptly finding a just and lasting solution of the  conflict, the declaration further reads.    The declaration points out that in confirming its resolve of  not interfering in the armed conflict, the Republic of Bulgaria  once again expresses its readiness to support all international  efforts aimed at a peaceful and just solution of the conflict on  the territory of former Yugoslavia.</p>

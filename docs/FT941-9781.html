			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Japanese funds ask questions after January rally - The latest economic stimulus package excludes stock market support measures The record Y15,250bn economic stimulus package announced by the government earlier this week excluded stock market support measures, featured in the previous three pump-priming packages presented over the past two years. With the Nikkei average of 225 leading stocks safely over 19,000, government officials are no longer losing sleep over the Tokyo stock market, which has given the country's financial community a few nightmares since its plunge in 1990. The leading force in the recent rise of Japanese share prices, however, has been buying by foreigners. The Nikkei rose 16.1 per cent during January, as overseas investors poured funds into Tokyo. US and European asset allocators increased their weightings in Japan after sharp rises in south-east Asian markets last year increased their downside risk. A record Dollars 12bn in overseas funds was pumped into the Tokyo stock market during January, and foreign fund managers piled into sectors such as automobiles, electronics and steels. The big question now is whether the Japanese institutional investors will follow suit or the rally just be a 'foreigner' phenomenon. The argument for domestic investors to join the buying is supported by low interest rates, the bottoming out of the economy and corporate profits, and currency risk acting as a deterrent to overseas investment. Some economists are hopeful that corporate profits will improve this year due to the sharp fall in depreciation. The predicted weakening of the yen is also expected to support sales at leading exporters. However, the Nikkei 225 is now on a prospective p/e of 100, seriously worrying the fundamentalists. Baring Securities advises an exposure of 42 per cent to the Japanese market for a world fund. It is telling investors not to be frightened by the high price/earnings ratios, saying that cheap stocks do not always rise and stocks considered expensive do not necessarily fall. Foreign analysts hope that the Y43,000bn held by Japanese investors in liquid deposits will start flowing into the equity market, pushing up shares even further. However, most Japanese investors remain cautious, arguing that underlying economic fundamentals have not changed drastically, and that it is foreign liquidity which has pushed share prices up. 'It's not as if corporate earnings will recover immediately and buying by foreigners won't last forever,' says a fund manager at Nippon Life, the country's largest life assurer. Domestic investors also faceno risk from lack of exposure to Japanese stocks, since most of their holdings are in the Tokyo market. Behind these big institutional concerns lies persistent gloom over the country's economy. Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities, sees the real gross domestic product for the year ending March 1995 contracting by 0.4 per cent after shrinking 0.6 per cent in the current year. The effects of the economic stimulus package, including the income tax cut on the corporate economy are expected to be minimal since, of the Y7,200bn slated for public investment, almost 40 per cent is accounted for by prior land acquisition for public work projects; and consumers, many of whom face an increasing possibility of losing their jobs, are unlikely to spend the extra income from their tax cuts. Morgan Stanley in Tokyo points out that the impact of Y5,850bn in tax cuts may be delayed significantly, for technical reasons. 'The delay in announcing the stimulus package and the following political fiasco have undermined the necessary consumer and business confidence that the package was supposed to achieve,' says Ms Mineko Sasaki Smith, a Morgan Stanley economist. Meanwhile, corporate profits are expected to remain sluggish for the next few years, due to the slow reduction in fixed labour costs. NRI forecasts a 22.4 per cent fall in its earnings of leading 400 companies for the current year to March followed by a mere 2.9 per cent rebound in the next fiscal year. Another lingering concern for the investment community ahead of the March year-end is the oversupply stemming from profit-taking, by corporations improving their poor earnings through sales of their long term stock portfolios. 'Corporate investors withheld their selling when the market was going up, but will start unloading their shares when the momentum dies down,' says one Japanese fund manager. Growing arbitrage positions are also adding to Japanese institutional worries. Long positions held against futures contracts totalled Y1,201bn after the first week of February, the highest level since Y1,380bn in October last year. The funds are afraid that a fall in futures prices could trigger an unwinding. For now, Japanese brokers are keeping their fingers crossed that foreign buying support will last long enough to take the Nikkei safely through the March book closing period. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities is betting on the index closing the fiscal year at around 20,500.</p>

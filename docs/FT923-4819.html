			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Personal View: Public services and public perceptions Since 1979 British public services have been the participants - often unwilling - in a series of reforms which have brought parental choice in schools, an internal market in the National Health Service, the compulsory contracting-out of some local authority services and the introduction of the Citizen's Charter. Much of this activity has generated a sense of unease among the consumers of these services, many of whom seem to believe that the essential virtues of public service are being sacrificed and that the government's true motives are to achieve further privatisation and to cut spending. After five years at the head of the Audit Commission, trying to promote value for money in the public sector, I am convinced that most of these reform initiatives make sense, and over time will improve both the efficiency and quality of service. But if the government is to convince the public that the changes are positive, it will need a more consistent and systematic justification for its reform programme. In fact, the Thatcher government did not take office with a fully fledged programme for the overhaul of public services ready in its handbag. What we have seen over the last 13 years is a series of experiments, which have taken different forms in different places. Nowhere have the underlying principles of the government's approach to reform been brought together in a coherent way. In a pamphlet published this week by the Social Market Foundation*, I attempt to fill that gap. With its experiments, the government has been playing with the construction of social markets - systems which duplicate in the public sector, as far as possible, those pressures for efficiency and quality of service which exist in the private sector. It has done this, for example, by introducing compulsory competitive tendering in local-authority refuse collection and by establishing an internal market in the NHS. In the course of doing so the government has thrown up a number of valuable ideas. What it must now do is write the rules of the game, and ensure that everyone plays by them. The last decade has shown that competition between public services does provide a powerful stimulus for their improvement. It may, in the short term, lead to what opponents describe as 'two-tier' levels of service. But that is how markets operate, and how they generate improvements across the board. So some element of competition must exist in the social market. The competition reforms in local government and the NHS have also shown the value of instituting a clear split between purchaser and provider within public services, with one set of organisations responsible for specifying the level of service and policing its delivery, while another focuses on the provision of services on a daily basis. The work of the professional inspectorates, which has belatedly been brought into the public domain, and of the Audit Commission, has shown the importance of independent public inspection and audit. And the Citizen's Charter is beginning to show that when public services are obliged to describe the standards of service they are seeking to meet, they generate powerful consumer pressure from below. All these pressures must be present throughout the public sector. They help ensure that social values are maintained within a market system. But while all these innovations have selectively shown their worth, only in the NHS have they been brought together into a coherent whole. Much of local government remains protected from competition. In the school system it is still unclear who is meant to be purchasing education on behalf of the parent. And independent audit, which was introduced into the NHS in 1989, is being removed from the school system in 1992. Looking to the police, one can see that almost none of the reform ideas that have proved themselves elsewhere have been thought to have any relevance. There is no clarity about what the police are required to do, what the criteria for success or failure are, who the purchaser of police services is and who the provider is. And the inspection of police services remains exclusively the province of former chief constables. Of course, there will always be those who argue, specifically, that it is dangerous to embark on the reform of the law enforcement forces and, generally, that the government should consolidate its existing reforms before embarking on more. However, if the principles of the social market approach are valid, as I believe they are, then there is no reason to deny the police their benefits. If the government was prepared to set out the principles on which its programme is based, then it would allay public concern about the direction of its reforms, rather than creating more anxiety. That not only means explaining how market disciplines are to be introduced, but also explaining how social values are to be maintained. * Fighting Leviathan: Building Social Markets that Work.

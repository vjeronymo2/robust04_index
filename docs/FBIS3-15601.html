In an interview with ITAR-TASS at Vladikavkaz's airport upon  his return from Moscow on Monday, Galazov said that he supported  the idea of strengthening Russian statehood announced by  President Boris Yeltsin. This provides the basis for continuing  reform, overcoming the crisis, carrying out structural reform  and creating conditions for economic, political and social  stabilisation, Galazov said. He welcomed the president's  state-of-the-nation address as a starting point for developing  and carrying out social and economic policy in regions.    Speaking about the prospects for implementing economic  reforms in North Ossetia, its leader said that the republic is  an integral part of Russia. Its multi-national population  cannot perceive its development in isolation from other  republics and regions of the North Caucasus and the rest of  Russia.    Galazov described the situation in the republic as stable.  However, there are certain forces in the region which are  seeking to push the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to  confrontation, he said. Galazov confirmed his initiative to  hold, without mediators, a meeting between the presidents of  North Ossetia and Ingushetia to discuss ways to restore peace  and streamline bilateral relations.</p>

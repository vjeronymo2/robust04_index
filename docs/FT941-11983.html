			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: S African life assurer sells subsidiary to black grouping Southern Life, one of South Africa's biggest life assurers, has sold a controlling stake in subsidiary African Life to a consortium of prominent black businessmen for R160m (Dollars 47m) in a significant move towards black economic empowerment. Control in African Life, which has assets of R313m, will pass to a new company - it now has a working name of Newco - to be owned by the consortium and a number of black organisations ranging from trade union federation Cosatu to church groups, the National Association of Stokvels - community-based savings organisations - and provident and pension funds. This aspect of the deal sets it apart from earlier moves towardsblack economic empowerment. Newly-formed black-owned companies, without such diverse community shareholders, gained an important stake in Metropolitan Life, a middle-ranking life assurer, and took control of the Sowetan, the leading black newspaper, in the past year. Mr Don Ncube, leader of the consortium and an alternate director of Anglo American, which controls Southern Life, said African Life would be 'a mirror of South African society' with Newco well-placed tobecome a vehicle for foreign investment. Newco would acquire 51 per centof African Life from Southern Life but the company's management would remain inplace. The consortium had 120 days in which to raise the money to conclude the deal but had commitments in principle from the community and other groups to buyshares in Newco. Mr Ncube said the acquisition was settled only after exhaustive talks with community groups and Southern Life, and a due diligence study of African Life by accountants Arthur Andersen, paid for by the Black Integrated Commercial Support Network.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEEP BIASES, SHORT MEMORIES  </P> <P> The condemnation of an apparently deranged former Israeli soldier for the  unprovoked, cold-blooded killing of seven Arab workers in the Gaza Strip was  unanimous. Top Israeli officials representing all parts of the political  spectrum, as well as Israel's press, unequivocally denounced the act.  </P> <P> But this tragedy will be compounded if those with political axes to grind use  the incident to advance their causes. It did not take long after the shooting  before both the Israeli Labor Party and the U.S. State Department, which  increasingly appears to be Labor's spokesman in Washington, sought to link the  irrational act of one man with the slow-moving "peace process."  </P> <P> Contrast the immediate condemnation of the killer in this incident by the  Israeli government and press, and the fixing of blame on the Israeli military  and government by Israel's critics, with an incident nearly five years ago in  the Sinai.  </P> <P> On Oct. 5, 1985, Sulayman Khatir, who was described by Egyptian sources as  "mentally disturbed," and who was a member of the paramilitary Central Security  Force, machine-gunned a group of Israeli campers as they slid down a sand dune.  As in the most recent shooting, seven people were killed -- four children and  three adults.  </P> <P> Unlike the response of the Israeli government and press to the incident in  Rishon LeZion, the deranged Egyptian was hailed as a folk hero. There were mass  demonstrations in his "honor." Iran issued a postage stamp with his picture on  it to commemorate the event.  </P> <P> As Bernard Lewis writes in his book, "Semites and Anti-Semitism: An Enquiry  Into Conflict and Prejudice," "All kinds of mutually contradictory fantasies  were developed -- that the victims were spies caught photographing secret  installations (in a demilitarized zone), that they had spat upon and torn up an  Egyptian flag, that half-naked Israeli women had offended Sulayman Khatir's  Muslim conscience, and even that they had attacked him, forcing him to fire in  self-defense. These stories remain uncontradicted in the pro-government media,  which for many weeks withheld the facts."  </P> <P> An Egyptian court sentenced Khatir to 25 years in prison, where he died,  apparently by hanging himself, but the propaganda damage had already been done.  </P> <P> Those who want to blame Israel first in this incident betray their own biases  as well as their short memories. What other country has been told to "make  peace" with those whose declared intentions are its eradication?  </P> <P> The PLO regularly bumps off moderate Arabs who want to talk to Israel, but  rarely do these incidents provoke international furor. But Israel is condemned  regularly in the international community for not entering into negotiations  over its own demise. Would Israel prefer to be shot at dawn or burned at the  stake? Shall it be dispatched with a lethal injection, or is it time to bring  back the gas chambers? These are the choices much of the world seems to want  Israel to make. It cannot and should not be expected to make them.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 463] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, March 23, ELTA -- The account of Ignalina  nuclear power station has been frozen for a month. The wages  for employees have been paid from the loans received and other  sources. This happened because of the Lithuanian tax laws  according to which income taxes were imposed on the production  which was not sold.    "The nuclear power station sells the energy to the state  energetics system which only now pays for the energy produced  last year", Director General Viktor Shevaldin said. He also  noted that the nuclear power station was the object of higher  risk, thus, it was very irresponsible to do such things.  However, "strikes and rallies are not our methods", Shevaldin  said.</p>

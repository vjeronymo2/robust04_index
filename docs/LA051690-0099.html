			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL FOR A RESTRICTION-FREE NEA IS INTRODUCED;  </P> <P> CONGRESS: DEMOCRAT'S MEASURE, BACKED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, WOULD EXTEND THE LIFE  OF THE AGENCY FOR FIVE YEARS WITHOUT ANY CONTROLS OVER THE CONTENT OF ART.  </P> <P> A key Democratic congressman on Tuesday introduced White House-backed  legislation to extend the National Endowment for the Arts' life without  restrictions on the content of art it supports.  </P> <P> The decision by Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.) to introduce the bill supported by  President Bush -- but without any GOP co-sponsors -- was described by  congressional observers as a rare tactic intended to outflank Republicans who  are threatening to break with the President and propose a radical restructuring  of the NEA.  </P> <P> The bill calls for extending the NEA's life for five years without language  that impedes the endowment's freedom to make artistic judgments.  </P> <P> "I really do think it is 'High Noon' for the arts endowment," Williams said in  a telephone interview. Williams chairs a House subcommittee that is responsible  for initiating legislation to extend the legislative authorization of the NEA,  which expires in September.  </P> <P> Late Tuesday, however, three House Republicans announced an agreement among GOP  congressmen for substitute legislation that would impose at least some controls  over the content of NEA-funded art. An aide to Rep. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.) said  the content-control language would stress "accountability and community  standards" for such problem areas as obscene, indecent or sacreligious  artworks.  </P> <P> The Republican substitute was to be announced in detail this morning at a  Washington press conference. It is the product of negotiations involving  Coleman, Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) and Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio). Coleman  is the ranking minority member of the Williams subcommittee and Regula is the  top GOP member of a subcommitee considering NEA appropriations.  </P> <P> Sources in Coleman's office said the Republican's alternative NEA plan would  also redistribute some portion of the endowment's budget, sending money to  state arts councils and local arts agencies -- presumably in the form of block  grants.  </P> <P> President Bush announced several weeks ago that he opposes content restrictions  on the NEA and formally sent legislation to the Williams subcommittee two weeks  ago renewing the NEA with only minor technical changes.  </P> <P> But Republicans on Williams' subcommittee, led by Gunderson, have indicated  that they may attempt to change the structure of the NEA completely, reshaping  it in the form of a controversial proposal made over the weekend by the  National Assembly of State Arts Agencies. The plan calls for 60% of the NEA's  money to go to state arts councils -- three times the proportion now allotted  -- and strip away most of the money now channeled to individual artists and  small arts organizations.  </P> <P> There were indications that opposition within the arts establishment to the  restructuring proposal was beginning to solidify. The director of the  California Arts Council publicly opposed the plan, saying he believed other  state art agencies would join him.  </P> <P> In Sacramento, Robert Reid, director of the council, contended that the  proposal was counterproductive. "I think it's too early to abandon the NEA," he  said. "If you send this (issue) out to the states, instead of the focus being  on one institution, it's going to be focused all over the country."  </P> <P> It also was learned that NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer would attend a  Thursday Washington summit of a half dozen major arts organizations at which  arts advocates hoped for a showdown. Some congressional observers said that  they believed the Gunderson faction on the NEA subcommittee would retreat from  the restructuring if arts groups resolve their differences and present a united  front opposing it.  </P> <P> Williams said the NEA's political situation has so damaged the NEA that it may  not be possible to complete a five-year legislative renewal without  restrictions being imposed on the content of government-funded art.  </P> <P> "I think two things have occurred now that bring the reauthorization to  critical mass and both are troubling for the endowment," Williams said. "The  first is that Republicans have decided that, despite the President's best  efforts, this issue shall be partisan.  </P> <P> "The second (is that) the communities within the art world have begun to  scramble after the pieces. I have worried about a type of cannibalism occurring  within the art community and I worry that that is now becoming reality."  </P> <P> Williams also indicated that he was studying the revival of a strategic option  considered late last year, but abandoned at the time, whose implementation may  be made necessary if the NEA situation worsens. Under that option, Williams  said, he may seek a one-year, status-quo extension of the NEA, seeking to buy  time for the agency by putting over substantive deliberations until 1991 and  removing it from the heat of a congressional election year.  </P></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Lord Forte hands over to his son but keeps board role LORD FORTE, the Italian immigrant and former milk bar proprietor who established Britain's leading hotel company, announced his retirement as chairman of Forte yesterday. He will be succeeded by Mr Rocco Forte, his 47-year-old son, who will add the title of chairman to the role of chief executive he has held since 1983. As one of the most notable figures in Britain's post-war business history, Lord Forte will not easily be forgotten - partly because he is not quite going. Lord Forte, 84 next month, will become president and continue to serve on the board. Mr Forte said he would continue to ask his father for advice when necessary. The company has appointed two new non-executive directors. Sir Anthony Tennant, who retires as chairman of Guinness at the end of this year, becomes deputy chairman. The other new director is Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of Glaxo Holdings. The City welcomed the appointment of two respected, independent figures to the board. There was widespread disappointment, however, that the company did not bring in an outsider as either chairman or chief executive, allowing Mr Forte to take the remaining role. Mr Paul Slattery, an analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Benson, said the group needed to move away from the culture created by Lord Forte. Among the changes needed, he said, were greater decentralisation and the granting of more autonomy to hotel managers. Mr Rocco Forte defended his assumption of the positions of both chairman and chief executive. Forte is trying to sell its Gardner Merchant contract catering subsidiary, which would leave it with two large businesses - hotels and restaurants. Mr Forte said both would be headed by strong managing directors, so there was no need to have a separate group chief executive. He said, however, that impending retirements would enable him to make further board changes. He denied that, with his father remaining as president, he would not be in control. 'Being chairman, you have a certain responsibility to the shareholders. The buck stops with me now, doesn't it?' Observer, Page 19 Lex, Page 20 Loath to check out, Page 24</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Buoyant BPI reports strong growth for year BANCO Portugues de Investimento (BPI), Portugal's leading private investment bank, yesterday reported strong growth for 1991. The bank's consolidated group results, which include for the first time those of Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay (BFB), the former state-owned commercial bank it bought last summer, show a 470 per cent rise in assets from Es171bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in 1990 to Es975.1bn last year. Without BFB, group assets rose 78 per cent to Es305bn. Net profits rose 8 per cent from Es8.6bn in 1990 to Es9.3bn last year, but results for 1990 were boosted by extraordinary income of Es3.8bn from BPI's sale of an 11 per cent stake in Banco de Comercio e Industria. BPI paid Es36bn for 80 per cent of BFB, though Es28bn remained within BFB to strengthen its capital and build up its reserves and pension fund. It will underwrite the sale this year of the state's remaining 20 per cent stake in BFB. It recently sold 10 per cent of BFB to Banco Itau of Brazil.</p>

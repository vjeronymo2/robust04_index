			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / MacGregor firm on airline talks AIRLINE deregulation negotiations with the US should remain the province of individual European governments and not be taken over by the European Commission, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said yesterday. Mr MacGregor rejected the suggestion by a US airline commission that the EC should take over the negotiations of multilateral airline agreements with the US. However, for liberalisation to be effective, UK and other foreign airlines must have greater access to traffic originating from smaller US airports, he said.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> MALICIOUS FOLLY  </P> <P> The reaction of the California Assembly is heartening. The sad thing is that  (Ferguson) is the one who most needs to be educated.  </P> <P> We were at war with Germany and Italy also, (but) we didn't have a wholesale  roundup of Germans and Italians. It wasn't military at all, it was racist.  </P> <P> (Ferguson's resolution) is worrisome. There are always ignorant people. What  worries me most is that people like him can get to a position that they can  affect so many lives. Our system does allow for even foolish or stupid or  malicious people to be represented.  </P> <P> I do think that all of us, including the Japanese-Americans, have learned from  the incarceration experience. I think we learned that citizenship is a  responsibility. Unless one participates, people like Ferguson will prevail. The  Japanese community, I think, has learned from this.  </P></p>

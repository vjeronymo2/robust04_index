			<p>BFN     [Text] The Commander of the Georgian Navy Admiral Aleksandr  Dzhavakhishvili stated that "there can be no transfer of part of  the naval base in Poti to commercial structures."    In an interview with Interfax he said that such an idea was  proposed by some Georgian businenessmen with the purpsoe of  expanding the commercial port. The commander said that these  businessmen are supported "by certain circles in the republic's  leadership."    Dzhavakhishvili said that the naval base in Poti is the  second largest in the Black Sea after Sevastopol. It has a  training center, a modern military port, a ship-building and  ship-repairing plants, many warehouses in which emergency  reserves for all of the Black Sea Fleet were stored, oilbases,  etc. "They want to give all this to commercial structures," he  said.    The commander said that "if the discussion of such projects  does not stop, the Georgian Defense Ministry will have to resort  to tough measures."    He said that during the recent meeting between the commander  of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy an agreement was  reached on periodical entries of Russian and Ukrainian military  ships in the Poti base. "Other joint arrangements were also  scheduled," the commander said.</p>

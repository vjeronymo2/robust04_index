			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Cabinet insists pit closures plan must go ahead THE CABINET, which had not discussed the drastic programme of pit closures before it was announced on Tuesday, insisted yesterday the plan had to go ahead. It said ministers should make fresh efforts to argue the economic case for the closures in the face of a rising tide of protest which threatens the most significant Tory revolt since Mr John Major became prime minister. Meeting in Sheffield, the National Union of Mineworkers did not call a strike ballot in the hope of triggering a poll-tax style public revolt on the issue. Opposition to the plan is putting at risk the government's majority at Westminster. The fact it was agreed by a small group of ministers rather than the full cabinet has increased concern that the full implications were not addressed. Senior ministers said the argument for closing 31 of British Coal's 50 pits with the loss of 30,000 jobs had not been explained sufficiently to get public support, as the prospect loomed of a significant Tory revolt in next week's Commons debate on the coal industry. Downing Street said Mr Major had been 'fully engaged' in the decision, which had been taken after discussion with the ministers most closely involved. These included Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary; Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister; Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary; and Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary. There was surprise at Westminster, however, that some ministers had been unaware of the closures before Tuesday's announcement, and that Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, had not been told that Point of Ayr colliery in Wales would be among the casualties. The closures appeared to dominate the domestic agenda at yesterday's cabinet meeting, which lasted two hours instead of the planned 30 minutes. Adding to the confusion at Westmister, senior Whitehall officials said early today that the government had brought forward the announcement of the pit closures in response to a request from British Coal. The officials said that Mr Major's original intention had been for the closure programme to be discussed and agreed by the full Cabinet yesterday and announced in the House of Commons early next week. But the management of British Coal had asked for authority to make the announcement early this week following a spate of leaks. Mr Heseltine is to make a statement on the closures to the Commons when parliament resumes on Monday, but the critical moment for the government will come on Wednesday when its 21-strong majority is at risk in the debate called by Labour. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, has made it clear he is interested in defeating the closure plans, and is drafting a simple motion intended to give Tory MPs the least possible excuse for not supporting it. He said it was 'astonishing and appalling' that the decision had not been taken by cabinet. But Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, defended the handling of the decision, saying the issues had been 'very thoroughly discussed and fully assessed by the ministers concerned', who had had the opportunity to talk to their colleagues. The need for the government to offer a better explanation for the closures was underlined by Mr Tom King, a former Tory cabinet minister. He said it was vital to assure people that 'the implications of this have really been thought through'. A briefing from Conservative central office has been sent to every Tory MP, but numerous backbenchers have already made public their opposition. Protests have come also from Tories outside parliament. Mr David Nicholson, Tory MP for Taunton, attacked the decision as 'economic madness'. The NUM delegate conference in Sheffield decided to try to maximise public support for a campaign against the closures rather than press for an immediate strike ballot which many delegates said would be lost. At the same time the NUM and Nacods, the pit supervisors union, were applying for an injunction against the closures - the first six of which are due to take place today - arguing that British Coal failed to consult the workforce as it is bound to do under the colliery review procedure and both British and EC employment law. A High Court judge will today decide whether to grant the injunction, but most analysts believe there is little chance of the unions succeeding. The judge said British Coal should take no steps to dismiss miners at the six pits until he has ruled.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Abidjan, 30 May (AIP/PANA) -- The general secretary  of the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI) has confirmed  that foreigners will be allowed to vote in the country's 1995  presidential elections. The PDCI will not withdraw the right to  vote of "people who, since 1945, have been voting in Cote  d'Ivoire", said Laurent Dona Fologo at a rally in support of  President Henri Konan Bedie, who came to power after the death  of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny on 7 December in  Yamoussoukro, central Cote d'Ivoire.    The rally was organized at the weekend in Bassam (43 km east  of Abidjan). "There is no question about that. It must be clear  to everybody," added Fologo, minister of state in charge of  national integration in the first post-Houphouet government.  "[Word indistinct] and clear that those who are qualified to  vote must vote," the PDCI general secretary concluded.    The PDCI has the majority in the Ivorian parliament.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Kohl hits snag on property claims draft law DIVISIONS in Germany's ruling coalition yesterday forced Chancellor Helmut Kohl to withdraw temporarily a draft law on financial compensation for former property owners in east Germany. Its withdrawal follows continuing differences in the coalition about who should be allowed to claim back property in eastern Germany, and ways to finance a compensation fund. There are 1.5m-2m outstanding property rights claims in east Germany. The Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the Chancellor's Christian Democratic Union, wants those whose land was expropriated by the Soviet forces in eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949 to be given the right to seek restitution. But a 1990 agreement between the two Germanys and four allied powers said these claimants - many of whom lost large landholdings - should have the right only to limited compensation. The bill seeks to raise a maximum of DM12bn (Dollars 7.2bn) to finance compensation claims for property confiscated by the Nazis between 1935 and 1945 and by the former East German state between 1949 and 1990. Individual claims could not exceed DM950,000, a significant increase from the DM300,000 proposed last December. The draft law proposes that compensation pay-outs be based on 1935 land valuations, rather than current property prices. Claimants, however, say this is unjust. The sense of injustice has been fuelled by the way in which the Finance Ministry hopes to raise the DM12bn compensation fund. For instance, an individual who successfully claimed back a factory confiscated by either the Nazis or the communists must pay a property tax. This will be based on the 1935 land valuation, which is then multiplied by 10. After five years the claimant must pay a third of that sum to the Finance Ministry. If the claimant cannot pay, the property would be sold. A Finance Ministry official said yesterday: 'I really do believe that the lawyers will say the bill is unfair, if not immoral, because claimants have to pay for something which was stolen from them in the first place. But I don't know if they will be able to prove it is unconstitutional.' Ministry officials expect the bill will stay more or less intact despite opposition from the CSU and east German politicians. It is due to go back to the cabinet in two weeks, but officials acknowledge that it may be referred to the constitutional court, a move which could delay approval.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SEEK 2 MEN IN FATAL SHOOTING OF GUARD  </P> <P> Los Angeles police were looking Monday for two men in connection with the fatal  shooting of a North Hollywood security guard and an earlier armed robbery of  four people outside a West Hollywood nightclub.  </P> <P> Charles R. Doll, 51, of Van Nuys was found with multiple gunshot wounds at  11:45 p.m. Sunday on the top level of the three-story, open-air parking  structure behind the Century 7 Theatres in the 12800 block of Victory  Boulevard, Lt. Ron LaRue said. Doll died at the scene shortly after he had been  found by theater patrons who heard the shots.  </P> <P> LaRue said two men were seen running from the top level, but it wasn't clear  what led to the shooting. Police said they had not determined whether Doll had  unholstered his gun.  </P> <P> A 1984 silver Honda Prelude found near the victim's body had been stolen about  90 minutes earlier by two men during an armed robbery in West Hollywood, LaRue  said. Investigators believe the men who stole the car drove it to the theater  complex and then shot Doll during a confrontation.  </P> <P> "We have no idea what the reason was for the shooting," Detective Mike Coffey  said. "We assume the victim was doing his job, and something drew him to these  two men. They pulled a gun and shot him."  </P> <P> In the West Hollywood robbery at 10:15 p.m., a man and three women parked the  Honda in a lot in the 7900 block of Santa Monica Boulevard and were about to  enter a nearby nightclub when they were confronted by two armed men.  </P> <P> The victims, whose names were not released, were robbed of their money and the  car but were left uninjured, LaRue said. Police were unable to identify the  robbers, he said.  </P> <P> Doll was employed by Virgill Security Services of Van Nuys, which provides  security at the movie theater complex.  </P></p>

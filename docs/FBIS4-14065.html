			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sayyed Ahmad Gailani, leader of the National </F> Islamic Front, by Salih Qallab in Islamabad; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Qallab] You say that the  current struggle between Rabbani and Hekmatyar is attributable  to the fact that each party is seeking to monopolize power. Is  that the reason, and are there no ideological and political  dimensions to this conflict?    [Gailani] Actually the main reason for this war is the power  struggle. The Hezb-e Eslami led by Hekmatyar says that it wants  a democratic government based on direct free elections, and that  it is opposed to the regime of President Borhanoddin Rabbani,  because the latter is seeking to monopolize power for himself,  his party, and allies by military force.    For our part, we wanted a democratic system based on free  elections and the establishment of a democratic parliament whose  task is to elect the head of state. But regrettably, the idea  of referring to influential people, announced by Rabbani  initially, began to be stripped of its content, hence illegal,  and undemocratic practices began to take place. This is why we  refused to recognize this reality or to participate in the shura  council which was formed by unsound means.    What we are seeking is to hold elections under the  supervision of the United Nations and the Islamic Conference  Organization, in order to elect a legal council that really  represents the Afghan people. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] Rabbani says he is prepared to hold a dialogue with  Hekmatyar or any other faction but cannot hold a dialogue with  Abdol Rashid Dostam and Babrak Karmal, who is now in Mazar-e  Sharif, because they represent a communist front. What is your  opinion?    [Gailani] We are against communism, and we have fought it.  But there is a unanimous decision to accept General Abdol Rashid  Dostam among mojahedin ranks and to consider him a mojahed, as  he rebelled against the communist regime. It is wrong now to  say that he is a communist and thus no dialogue cannot be held  with him.    [Qallab] But Dostam is allied with Babrak Karmal and the  other leaders of the communist regime.    [Gailani] That is what Rabbani says, but it is absolutely  untrue. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] If Rabbani's term ends without achieving a solution  acceptable to most parties, a vacuum will occur and the country  will be plunged into chaos and destruction. Do you have any  alternatives?    [Gailani] We want to hold general elections on the basis of  which to form a new legislative council and new government  before the end of Rabbani's term.    [Qallab] These are your aspirations, but the reality on the  ground is different. There are numerous armies and states.    [Gailani] All these armies could be merged into one national  army.    [Qallab] Do you not believe that a disagreement would emerge  over the allocation of posts?    [Gailani] No, they would not disagree at all, especially if  a neutral government is elected. I point out here that Rabbani  has expressed willingness to comply if a neutral government is  elected. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] Do you agree with the view that some Islamic and  Arab states do not want an Islamic state in Afghanistan for fear  that such a state could become a seat of world tension in the  future?    [Gailani] No, I do not agree with that view. I say that we  want a moderate government, willing to coexist with neighboring  states and all world states.    [Qallab] But Rabbani, to whom you are opposed now, is the  most moderate person, compared with Hekmatyar.    [Gailani] The two are from the same school; there is no  difference between them at all.    [Qallab] The Arab region, especially Egypt and Algeria, has  suffered from the "Afghan Arabs" phenomenon. Which factions  support them?    [Gailani] There are "Afghan Arabs" and there are  organizations offering them camps and support. There are also  Arab states guiding them against other Arab states. But we as  Afghans reject that and want a moderate government that  cooperates with all.    [Qallab] We heard some people say that the solution in  Afghanistan lies in the return of the monarchy and King Zahir  Shah. What is your opinion?    [Gailani] I respect King Zahir Shah. But I want any  decision to be made by the Afghan people, whether with regard to  the return of the monarchy or anything else. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Devenish makes hostile attack on Boddington J A DEVENISH, the brewery and public house group, has launched a vigorous assault on Boddington as part of its defence to the Pounds 122.3m hostile offer from the public house, hotels and healthcare group. The Devenish document criticises Boddington for its 'misconceived strategy of diversification' into nursing homes, hotels and restaurants and accuses it of being 'slow to invest in its own pub division.' Devenish is sending a letter to Boddington shareholders suggesting seven questions that they should ask the board at the predator's extraordinary meeting in Manchester on Friday. Meanwhile, the document does not include a profits forecast, but says that between 1986 and 1990 operating profits per Devenish's managed pubs increased by 70 per cent. It also values Devenish's fully diluted net assets per share, as of September 30, at 272p, a premium to the Boddington offer price. On the subject of its brewery, Devenish says 'management has continued to be dissatisfied with the returns generated by our brewing business. Firm action is being taken to resolve this situation and we are actively working to achieve a solution on a financial basis satisfactory to Devenish.' The document shows that the directors of Devenish are employed on four year rolling contracts. Boddington's offer is 10 of its shares for every seven in Devenish; on the basis of Friday night's closing Boddington price of 156p, that values each Devenish share at 223p. There is also a cash alternative of 210p per share. Boddington is also offering 1,096 of its shares for every 1,000 convertible preference shares in Devenish, valuing each convertible share at 171p.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Murdoch denies 'super share' talk Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, yesterday sought to dampen speculation that his media and film company will make a new attempt to introduce 'super' shares - that is, shares with multiple voting rights. 'There has been continued speculation . . . that News Corporation is formulating a revised super shares proposal to put to the (Australian) stock exchange. This is definitely not the case,' Mr Murdoch said yesterday. 'News Corporation has no intention of putting a revised super shares proposal to the stock exchange. Comments and reports that the company has been negotiating with other corporations regarding equity are incorrect,' he added. News withdrew its super share scheme this week after strong criticism from Australia's investment community. It viewed the scheme as a means for the Murdoch family to establish an entrenched position of control in the company. In spite of News' move, the Australian stock exchange - which had to change its listing rules to allow the scheme to go ahead  - has said it will still pursue its inquiry into the merits of differential voting rights. Rumours about a revised News super share scheme, the possible issuance of non-voting shares, or some sort of off-balance-sheet joint venture have persisted because of Mr Murdoch's desire to strike strategic alliances. It is assumed the Murdoch family does not want to see its one-third stake in News diluted any further. Observers have been speculating about how News could structure future acquisitions or partnerships without risking this.</p>

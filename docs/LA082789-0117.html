			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE FARM ON THE RIVER OF EMERALDS BY MORITZ THOMSEN  (VINTAGE: $8.95)  </P> <P> At age 53, Moritz Thomsen set out to establish a farm on the Esmeraldas River  in the jungles of Ecuador. Working with a native partner, he battled weather,  insects, floods, animals, hostile neighbors and the jungle itself. A  potentially fascinating subject, but Thomsen's sentences are so chocked with  adjectives, adverbs and inapt metaphors that the reader needs the syntactical  equivalent of a machete to get through them. A description of the tropical  wilderness: "It is so opulent, so rich, in the final analysis so basically  vulgar -- like the over-orchestration of Richard Strauss -- that no one I can  think of, except Rousseau, has ever succeeded in capturing its  million-textured, chaotic quality and transforming it into art." Reading this  prose makes clearing jungle land seem like a simple task.  </P></p>

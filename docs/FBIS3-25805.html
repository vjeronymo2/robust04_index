So far, nine bid winners have been authorized to supervise  the whole preparatory construction of the Three Gorges Project,  taking the lead in China's supervision practice in the major  water conservancy project construction.    According to the supervision contract, the supervisors will  take up the overall administration of the quality and progress  of the preparatory construction and control its cost.    They will be empowered to endorse payment checks, start and  terminate project programs or have constructors do the work over  again if it is not done properly.    The construction of many preparatory projects, including the  building of the Xiling Chang Jiang River Bridge, are proceeding  smoothly under the supervision.    The supervision system will help guarantee the quality of  the  project with proper speed and controlled cost, said a member of  the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee.</p>

Speaking at the end of a two-hour Legco [Legislative Council]  debate last night, Mr Asprey said it remained necessary for  China to clarify the definition of "Chinese national", which was  a key concept in determining who would be entitled to right of  abode in the territory after the handover.    Mr Asprey said the Government had presented comprehensive  proposals to Beijing to amend the Immigration Ordinance to make  sure it fell in line with the Basic Law. He also revealed that  the Hong Kong Government had had informal talks on the subject  with China and further talks would be held in the territory this  month. "We have put comprehensive proposals to the Chinese  through the Joint Liaison Group," he said.    But it remained China's responsibility to clarify its law in  order to spell out who would be entitled to such a right.  "Apart from anything else, right of abode on the first of July,  1997, can be determined only by reference to a person's  nationality," he said. "And only the Chinese Government can  clarify Chinese Nationality Law." "We have already held  informal talks on this subject and further talks will be held in  Hong Kong later this month," he said.    The problem of right of abode of those Hong Kong Chinese  residents who held second passports had attracted great public  concern after it was revealed that such people would be  considered "non-Chinese" under Chinese law. The group,  estimated to amount to 400,000, would need to re-acquire the  right of abode under the Basic Law. So far, Britain and China  had failed to agree on a set of concrete arrangements under  which people with second passports could be entitled to regain  the right of abode.    Mr Asprey reiterated that the Government supported an  arrangement which was "simple and straightforward". Speaking on  the issuing of the future Special Administrative Region (SAR)  passports, Mr Asprey said there were "clear advantages" for the  Immigration Department to be allowed to do so. "There are clear  advantages for a smooth transition in Hong Kong travel documents  continuing to be issued by the Immigration Department. They  have the experience, the expertise and the records necessary for  this task," he said.    Director of Immigration Lawrence Leung Ming-yin said last  month that it would take at least three years to devise a system  to issue the SAR passports before the change of sovereignty.    Liberal Party legislator Howard Young, whose motion to urge  the Government to take positive steps to ensure freedom of  travel after 1997 was unanimously passed, suggested setting up a  separate "passport agency". He said the agency would act as a  processing centre for SAR passport applications on behalf of the  future SAR government.    "Whilst China may view passport issue as a matter involving  sovereignty and feel reluctant to be seen to be asking a foreign  government to act on its behalf, a 'passport agency' could be a  neutral medium to whom certain tasks could be delegated." Mr  Young, who represents the tourism industry, urged China  immediately to tackle the task of issuing SAR passports in a  "timely and pragmatic way".    At the moment, British Dependent Territory Citizen and  British National Overseas passport holders enjoy visa free entry  to more than 70 countries. "To process hundreds of thousands of  passport applications requires resources, The Immigration  Department processes 49,000 passports and (Certificates of  Identity) a month. This means it would take 11 months to issue  even if only one-tenth of Hong Kong's population wanted an SAR  passport."    United Democrat legislators, on the other hand, echoed Mr  Asprey's comments and urged China to clarify the criteria under  which Hong Kong Chinese with a second passport could be regarded  as permanent resident after 1997. United Democrats James To  Kun-sun said the future arrangement should be "open, fair and  simple".    Another United Democrat, Dr Huang Chen-ya, who holds an  Australian passport, said the two governments should immediately  clarify the grey area in the Basic Law. "These grey areas might  be manipulated by radical racialists to discriminate against  those who hold a foreign passport," he said.    Maverick independent Chim Pui-chung asked whether Governor  Chris Patten would fight for the right for the 1.2 million  Certificate of Identity holders to obtain visa-free entry to  Britain.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (4): U-turn seems possible / A look at the newly nationalised electricity industry Thirty years ago Italy's electricity industry underwent a radical reorganisation. Nationalisation created a state-owned body charged with production, transmission and distribution on a nationwide basis. Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica (ENEL) was born from the buy-out of about 1,300 private companies. Now ENEL itself faces the prospect of a revolution; privatisation seems a real possibility. The first step towards stock market quotation and privatisation was taken in July this year, when a government decree transformed ENEL into a joint stock corporation (societa per azioni: SpA). The share capital of just over L12,100bn was assigned to the Treasury. Mr Franco Viezzoli, ENEL's chairman, hopes quotation will be possible next year. 'But it needs careful thought, planning and execution, otherwise the operation could boomerang,' he warns. 'At least 51 per cent of the equity must be sold for privatisation to be a reality. Logic suggests that more than 51 per cent should be sold, but the decision lies with the Treasury. I would like to see 28m shareholders - as many as ENEL has customers.' ENEL will have to overcome a large obstacle in order to be appetising to investors: low profitability. After years of heavy losses it returned to break-even in 1985, advancing last year to a net profit of L229bn on net revenues of L27,222bn and net equity of L15,510bn. In spite of the improvement, such results are clearly not the kind to stimulate investors' enthusiasm. Before his conversion to privatisation, Mr Viezzoli often noted that the electricity sell-off in Britain was preceded by substantial tariff increases. But Italy's present climate seems to preclude this option for ENEL. Mr Viezzoli said, however, that ENEL already has some scope for declaring higher profits. Last year it booked L1,200bn of accelerated depreciation in its accounts, from the L5,520bn total charged. Mr Viezzoli says that the corporation must improve its profit and loss account in order to offer the Treasury the opportunity of undertaking stock market quotation in the best possible way. One objective is to reduce dependence on borrowing. (This rose significantly last year to L32,170bn and net financial charges also moved sharply upwards to L3,009bn.) ENEL's chairman believes that cooperating with and encouraging Italy's independent producers would help the accounts. At present the state corporation is responsible for just over 80 per cent of total Italian electricity production; the remainder is produced by local utilities and industrial autoproducers. There is scope for a greater contribution to demand coverage from other national producers, and the latest national energy plan seeks to exploit this. 'If others invest more, ENEL could invest less,' says Mr Viezzoli. Last year its investment totalled L9,088bn, compared to L7,979bn in 1990. When presenting the accounts earlier this year, Mr Viezzoli noted that the increase in investment in 1991 was the precursor of even greater expenditure. ENEL's five-year 1992-1996 programme budgets for total investment of L73,900bn, an annual average of nearly L14,800bn. Investment on production plant took nearly 45 per cent of last year's total, a share that rises to 54 per cent in the five-year programme. Part of this will be spent on making environmental improvements to existing plant. Overall, ENEL's planned investment on environmental measures absorbs one sixth of the total. This may help assuage the fierce opposition that the corporation's plans have encountered with green groups. Already active, Italy's environmentalist lobby advanced its cause significantly when it scored an important anti-nuclear victory in the referendum held in November 1987. Over 80 per cent of voters rejected nuclear power in Italy in the wake of the Chernobyl incident. Operational stations at Caorso, Trino Vercellese and Latina were shut down. Work on the 2 x 1000MW plant at Montalto di Castro, three quarters completed, was stopped, and site preparation for a similar plant as neighbour to the existing station at Trino Vercellese was abandoned. Italy has produced no electricity from nuclear power since 1987. Mr Viezzoli believes that there will be no return to nuclear in his lifetime. But the environmentalists have not limited their objections to nuclear power. From top to toe of the Italian boot, power station sites have been targets for verbal 'green' attacks.( In Tuscany it has reached the point where there is real sabotage, with high voltage lines being toppled.) Montalto di Castro, on the coast about 70 miles north of Rome, typifies the difficulties that ENEL has faced over recent years. After pulling out of the nuclear project, the switch to conventional power(4 x 660MW of multifuel plant plus 800MW of gas turbine repowering) encountered no serious planning obstacles, albeit the cost of abandoning nuclear was enormous. But there was strong opposition to the use of coal. Now that natural gas will be the main fuel, problems centre on logistics. Insufficient pipeline capacity means that an LNG terminal is needed. Former EC environment commissioner Carlo Ripa di Meana, who now holds the environment portfolio in the Italian government, said in July that studies need to be made of the environmental impact of the proposed terminal. It is hard to see Montalto di Castro enjoying trouble-free completion, in spite of the entry into service of the first gas turbine unit in April. But since conversion to conventional power, it has made easier progress than two large projects in the south. Brindisi Sud in the Apulian heel and Gioia Tauro in the Calabrian toe are long-running sagas that highlight the difficulties that ENEL has encountered in siting and building new plant. Authorised in June 1982, work started on the Brindisi Sud 4 x 660MW plant in November 1983. It was then dogged by frequent interruptions due to local political disputes and concern over the plant's environmental impact. But while the first two units of the Apulian plant are now feeding the grid, progress at Gioia Tauro is blocked. It is 13 years since the decision was taken to build a power station at Gioia Tauro, but ENEL seems no nearer to the finish. Leaping bureaucratic hurdles has been a problem. So has infiltration by the local families, eager for their share of the action. This led to the site's sequestration by armed carabinieri in July 1990. Mr Viezzoli may be optimistic in expecting the station to enter service at the end of the decade. But ENEL is now making better progress in commissioning new plant. After bringing just 3,400MW of new capacity into service in the five years 1986-1990, 1,280MW started producing last year, followed by a record 3,000MW this year. 2,000MW is expected in 1993. Indeed, ENEL's capacity situation is now such that talk about power black-outs has almost ceased. Slowdown in demand growth helped. After average annual increases of 4 per cent from 1983 to 1989, Italian electricity consumption registered growth of 2.8 per cent in 1990; 2.2 per cent last year and in the first eight months of 1992. From 181TWH in 1983, demand leapt to 235TWH in 1990, increasing modestly to 240TWH last year. That black-outs were avoided in the late 1980's owes much to imports. In 1983 net purchases from abroad totalled 11.1TWH and covered 6 per cent of total demand. Last year net Italian electricity imports were 35.1TWH and covered nearly 15 per cent of demand. This import dependence, caused by abandonment of nuclear power and slow progress on construction programmes, has led ENEL to examine some radical solutions. The project for a huge artificial man-made power station island in the Adriatic is still under consideration. So are proposals for building plant in the Ukraine and Tunisia. The technical and operational challenges facing ENEL are still considerable. To these it now adds the institutional and financial challenges of privatisation. If there is any certainty, it is that ENEL's unified structure and single national tariff will remain.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                       ENEL FINANCIAL DATA Lire bn  ------------------------------------------------------------------                     1987      1988      1989       1990      1991  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Net revenues      20,125    20,511    22,614     24,608    27,222 Added value       12,728    13,441    13,945     14,609    16,560 Depreciation       4,150     5,099     5,124      4,871     5,520 Net charges        2,289     2,141     2,189      2,445     3,009 Net profit           134       138       156        211       229 Financial debt    27,249    26,232    27,762     29,324    32,170 Net equity        12,823    13,961    15,117     15,256    15,510  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: ENEL  ------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------          ELECTRICITY DEMAND AND COVERAGE IN TERAWATT HOURS  ------------------------------------------------------------------                           1987     1988     1989     1990     1991  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Italian demand     209.8    220.4    228.7    235.1    240.3 Demand on ENEL network   182.3    191.7    199.7    205.4    210.3 ENEL gross production    169.5    170.3    176.1    181.3    182.3 Net imports               23.1     31.3     33.7     34.7     35.1  ------------------------------------------------------------------ ENEL  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

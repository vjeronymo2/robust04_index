A source in the Foreign Ministry of the  self-proclaimed Transdniestrian republic reported to INTERFAX  that "the proposals of the CSCE permanent mission in Moldova and  proposals of the Russian Federation are to become the starting  point for these negotiations."    According to the sources, the new stage of the negotiations  may start in the near future, immediately after the new Moldovan  parliament starts its work. This coincides with the proposals  of the CSCE mission which pressed for resumption of negotiations  after the parliamentary elections early this year. The source  pointed out that at present an official envoy of the Russian  president Vladlen Vasev takes the same position. The same source  reported that in accordance with Russia's proposals "working  groups will be formed at the new stage of negotiations, in  addition, plenipotentiary representatives of Moldova's and  Transdniestria's presidents will be appointed to coordinate the  negotiating process along with President Yeltsin's envoy." The  final decision on the time of the resumption of bilateral  consultations to be held under the mediation of Russia and the  CSCE mission is expected to be adopted this week after the  conclusion of Vasev's visit to Kishenev and Tiraspol.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / CBI urges 25% increase in university education University education should be expanded by 25 per cent with parents contributing much of the extra funds, the Confederation of British Industry says today. It says higher education should cover 40 per cent of 18-year-olds, instead of the present 32 per cent and the government's 33 per cent target. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman of the CBI's education and training affairs committee and chairman of Cadbury-Schweppes, describes government plans to halt university expansion for a few years as 'rationing higher education' and 'a switch from the market-based, demand-led approach which has been such a success'. The CBI proposals would create a 'funding gap' of Pounds 3bn a year, compared with current spending of about Pounds 80m, but the CBI says the provision of extra places would meet 'strong unmet student demand' while narrowing the gap in skills compared with the UK's competitors. It says expansion could be funded from three sources: More targeted grants for maintenance, with increases for children from poor backgrounds balanced by cuts for children from wealthy families, who should not even be eligible for a subsidised loan. Universities could deliver efficiency savings of 4 per cent a year to reduce unit costs. Public funding for higher education should take a constant proportion of national income, growing in line with the growth of the economy. Mr Cadbury said students should not have to contribute towards their own tuition. But the CBI suggests a green paper on possible extra sources of funds if demand for higher education continues to rise. Mr Tim Boswell, the higher education minister, said there would be no green paper as government policy on the issue - to increase maintenance loans while cutting grants - was fixed until 1997. He said: 'I do not share the CBI's view that burdens on parents should be increased. Our policy is to share the cost of student living expenses more fairly between graduates, taxpayers and parents.' He added that it would be impractical for universities and colleges to continue to expand 'at the recent breathtaking rate' while maintaining quality everywhere - hence the short period of consolidation. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents university managements, welcomed the report but denied that continued efficiency gains were possible.

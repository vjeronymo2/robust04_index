			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / DM1bn project to clean up east German industrial area A PIONEERING agreement was announced in Germany yesterday between government, industry and the Treuhand privatisation agency to clean up and modernise one of the largest and most polluted industrial areas in east Germany. The operation, which could eventually cost at least DM1bn (Pounds 338m), will focus on the region surrounding the Mansfeld metal conglomerate, near Halle. It involves a partnership between Metallgesellschaft, the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and engineering company, and US and European concerns, and could provide a model for rehabilitation of other polluted parts of Germany. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, said: 'The programme should act as a signal for other such operations to be carried out elsewhere in east Germany.' He has negotiated the agreement over the past year with the Treuhand, owner of the Mansfeld concern, the government of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where it is based, and other German and international companies. Mansfeld, which mainly produces copper and aluminium, was one of east Germany's biggest kombinats (industrial groups), employing 48,000. It now has around 30,000 workers and its survival is in doubt because of heavy cost and pollution problems. For Metallgesellschaft and its partners, however, it would provide a ready-made site for expansion at a time when approval of new sites in west Germany can take years. The agreement reached this week in Magdeburg, the state's capital, provides for Metallgesellschaft to head a consortium to produce a feasibility study for rehabilitation of the Mansfeld area. The next stages, once the study is finished, involve cleaning the soil, modernising the smelters, installing a new power plant and attracting new industry. Metallgesellschaft has much experience of business in east Germany and eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union. Its Lurgi engineering subsidiary has developed soil decontamination technology which would be used in Mansfeld.</p>

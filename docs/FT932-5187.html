			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Italtel chief arrested by Milan police ITALY'S state-owned telecommunications group, Stet, yesterday slid further into the widening political corruption scandal with the decision by Mr Salvatore Randi, managing director of its Italtel manufacturing subsidiary, to surrender to Milan police. Italtel, in which AT&amp;T of the US has a 20 per cent stake, is the country's leading producer of telephones and exchanges. Mr Randi's move followed the issue of a warrant for his arrest by magistrates investigating corruption allegations relating to contracts from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The detention of Mr Randi follows last month's arrest of Mr Luigi Montella, managing director of Stet's Sirti network engineering subsidiary. Mr Montella and other officials of Stet subsidiaries were arrested following allegations by Mr Davide Giacalone, an adviser to Mr Oscar Mammi, a former posts minister. Mr Giacalone's testimony, widely leaked, has given magistrates in Milan and Rome a string of new leads. These include contracts by the former state ASST telecommunications agency and the allocation of valuable television broadcasting frequencies by the posts ministry under Mr Mammi. Mr Randi allegedly paid L3.8bn to Mr Giuseppe Parrella, ASST's director general, detained by magistrates last month. The arrest of Mr Parrella, in connection with alleged kickbacks of about L40bn on ASST contracts worth L2,500bn between 1987-91, was followed by that of Mr Giuseppe Lo Moro, a former assistant to Mr Parrella, now believed to have incriminated Mr Randi. Separately, Mr Randi is believed to have contacted Milan magistrates independently before his arrest with written testimony regarding ASST contracts. Recent arrests, which include the heads of the Italian subsidiaries of the multinational Siemens and Ericsson telecommunications groups, suggest magistrates are investigating whether bidding procedures on ASST contracts may have been rigged by leading suppliers. Addressing Stet's annual shareholders' meeting in Turin yesterday, Mr Biagio Agnes, chairman, said: 'As far as Stet is concerned, I confirm that contributions have never been given to political parties or their appendages.' However, seeking to distance the group, which is widely followed by foreign investors, from its subsidiaries, he added: 'For the group's subsidiaries, which are administratively and managerially independent, we were never aware of irregular situations and we never received such signs even in these last turbulent months.' Mr Agnes said the arrests of senior executives had prompted him to commission an audit of the group and its subsidiaries. He gave no indication of when the results would be known but said he retained full confidence in the group's management 'until the opposite is proven'. The Stet group comprises six of the seven state-controlled companies which run Italy's telecommunications and part of the equipment-making business.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 102 (592)] </F>   [Text] President Snegur criticized his opponents who doubt  the importance of having a national army, and described their  statements as "incompetent and ill-meaning."    "It's not the president who needs an army, but the people  who  want to live and work in peace," he told the national army's  flight brigade.    He said he was convinced that Moldova's sound forces  supported the government's efforts to consolidate the state and  strengthened the armed forces.    "The creation of armed forces was not a caprice, but a  strong  necessity, given the current complicated geopolitical situation.  Obviously, Moldova cannot exist without armed forces capable of  curbing encroachments on its state system, integrity and  independence," said Snegur. He also said he favored further  improvement in the armed forces on the basis of other countries'  experience.    Speaking about the armed forces' future, Snegur said that  the  army must be oriented to the norms and standards of the western  European states with solid democratic traditions. He believes,  at the same time, that Moldova must have small but well-trained  and well-equipped mobile armed forces capable of ensuring  Moldova's security. He is convinced that the army must not be a  burden for the nation.    He emphasized that despite the problems of the transitional  period, the government will find ways of financing and equipping  the army, and urged the armed forces to help the nation solve  economic problems.    Speaking about the current political situation, Snegur said  that after the multi-party parliamentary elections a cardinally  new political situation had taken shape, an efficient deputies'  corps came into being and the Agrarian-Democratic Party formed  up a reformer government. All this is expected to help the  nation overcome the economic crisis. He also said that there  were objective difficulties which slowed down the implementation  of a resolute economic stabilization policy and measures to  enhance the population's living standards, above all unfavorable  weather conditions and price liberalization. He expressed  confidence, however, that all of these problems would be  overcome if the government were supported and understood by the  entire population, including servicemen.</p>

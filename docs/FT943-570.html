			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved higher yesterday, and although trading volume was low - at under 10,500 contracts - the market's broad undertone was said by dealers to be much improved. Ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, it was mostly a day of waiting on events, with just 10,453 contracts traded in the December FT-SE 100 future, down from 16,295 on Monday. The independent traders mostly had the field to themselves and as a result the December contract moved around sharply at times. Dealers said the most encouraging aspect of the session was the solid, general support shown when the contract touched 3,000 around midday. Once or twice the premium to the cash market extended to some 20 points, which put the premium, briefly, in excess of fair value for the first time in weeks. December peaked at 3,030.0 just before the afternoon close and ended nine points up at 3,018. At this level the premium to the cash market is 9 1/2 and the premium to fair value around 18. Traded option volume was 34,570 lots, down from a previous 39,507. FT-SE turnover was 10,776 but the Euro FT-SE was barely traded. British Gas was easily the most active individual stock option with 3,040 contracts. HSBC managed 1,955 lots and BP 1,705.</p>

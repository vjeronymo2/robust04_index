			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Veterans of Hedge End must scale the inner-city heights: Fresh objectives for the Liberal Democrats in the elections run-up The Liberal Democrats came to Cardiff seeking reassurance. The 1,300 delegates left convinced that the party's much-forecast breakthrough is once again just round the corner. This time they could be right. The Liberal Democrats trail Labour by about 25 percentage points in most national opinion polls. But the party could be the biggest gainer from the triple round of local, European and parliamentary elections due by early June. The biggest boost could come in the Eastleigh by-election, expected on May 5, in which Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, is widely expected to win the seat from the Conservatives. The omens are good. The Liberal Democrats hold 19 of the 25 seats on Eastleigh district council and last week won the last Conservative seat on Hedge End town council, in the heart of the constituency. A victory would return the party's national profile to heights not reached since last summer's by-election successes in Newbury and Christchurch. But the party is also well-placed for the local elections due on May 5 and the European Parliament poll on June 9. In both contests the tide is running in the Liberal Democrats' favour. Party leaders say they have realistic hopes of two or three victories in the European Parliament election. But an independent forecast by the Electoral Reform Society says the Liberal Democrats could win up to a dozen seats. Most of the local polls are in urban areas where Labour is defending seats and the Liberal Democrats are more credible challengers than the unpopular Conservatives. The party, which has 4,250 council seats across the country, compared with 800 held by the former Liberal party 15 years ago, won a net 78 seats in by-elections last year, mostly from the Conservatives. Labour failed to record a single net gain. Good results in all three rounds of polling would go a long way to consolidate the party's gradual breakout from its traditional heartlands in Scotland, Wales and south-west England. But while the party's prospects are clearly improving, the Cardiff conference showed that growing maturity is bringing fresh problems in its wake. The first is technical: how to switch from fighting the Conservatives in largely rural seats to fighting Labour in the cities. The answer, drafted largely by party leaders with big city credentials, such as Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Bermondsey, is to sharpen the party's image on issues which are important to urban voters. The main vehicle for the urban campaign is the policy document Reclaiming the City, approved by delegates on Saturday. It commits the party to decentralisation, radical reform of planning law and tough action against racism. Mr Hughes, who admits that political progress is harder for the Liberal Democrats in the towns than in the countryside, warned delegates that they could not hope to take power at Westminster until they demonstrated their ability to run the cities. But divisions are emerging between the party's urban activists and some of its leaders. They accuse the leadership of trying to stifle debate on controversial inner-city issues such as prostitution and a row over alleged racist campaigning by Liberal Democrat activists in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, the only large inner-city local authority controlled by the party. Mr Peter Hughes, leader of the Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrat councillors, accused the leadership of 'hypocrisy' over its decision to expel three local members. Ms Gwyneth Deakins, chairman of the Tower Hamlets party, announced her decision to stand down in protest at the leadership's lack of understanding of the problems faced by inner-city campaigners. The second problem is more fundamental: what does the party stand for? The dilemma was highlighted in a thoughtful speech to a fringe meeting by Mr Matthew Taylor, MP for Truro, who pointed out that 'we have a higher profile on Bosnia than on any bread-and-butter domestic policy issue that . . . determines how people vote.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, sought to refocus the party on domestic issues as he launched a 100-day campaign for the forthcoming local council, Commons and European elections. In his keynote speech to the conference Mr Ashdown highlighted education, employment, taxation and the economy as core issues. Among a list of 40 policy commitments were free nursery education for children aged three and four, and a minimum of two days a week of training for those aged 16 to 19. Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats would turn welfare payments into working benefits by giving subsidies to employers to take on the long-term unemployed. The difficulty of communicating core values worries other leaders. Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, said that the claim that Liberal Democrats were trying to be all things to all people 'hurts and does damage'. It is a charge to which the party does not have a convincing answer.</p>

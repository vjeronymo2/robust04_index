			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Palestinians to have right to set up stock market Palestinians preparing for self-government in the Gaza Strip and West Bank enclave of Jericho will have the right to establish a stock market, issue bonds, create an embryonic central bank and work towards a trade surplus with Israel, Israeli officials said yesterday. Although the economic accord signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last week makes no reference to a stock market or Palestinian bonds, Israeli officials said they were implicit in the agreement. Mr Avi Ben-Basat, head of research at the Bank of Israel, said yesterday the incoming Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority could establish a stock exchange which would be governed by a securities authority similar to Israel's. Palestinians, foreigners and Israeli citizens would be able to invest. Under the economic protocol, Palestinians will create a Palestinian Monetary Authority(PMA) responsible for licensing, supervising and inspecting banks; determining the liquidity requirements on all deposits held by banks operating in the self-rule areas; and managing foreign exchange reserves and foreign currency transactions. The agreement says the PMA will also have the power to regulate and supervise capital activities in the self-rule areas including the licensing of capital market institutions, finance companies and investment funds. Mr Basat said these provisions implicitly allowed for a stock exchange although he thought the Palestinians would first build up a money market. 'They may concentrate on the money market because it is not developed enough today,' he said. 'But they have the right to create all the institutions they need for an efficient capital market.' Mr Basat said the new trade policy of the accord, which allows Palestinians to import directly and boost exports, could eliminate the current Dollars 300m trade deficit with Israel, possibly creating a trade surplus with Israel leaving the self-rule areas with an excess of Israeli shekels which would remain the legal tender. Under the accord the PMA has the right to convert excess Israeli shekels into foreign currency at the Bank of Israel according to a mutually agreed annual estimate of the flow of goods and services between Israel and the self-rule areas. Mr Basat said this, combined with exports to the rest of the world, foreign aid and loans, could lead the Palestinian self-government to accumulate foreign currency reserves which could back significant bond issues. Palestinian and other Arab nationals would be the most likely investors in the new bonds. which would be an important source of financing for the activities of the self-government. Mr Basat said the monetary authority was not a central bank because under the agreement the Palestinians would not be allowed for the moment to issue their own currency, and would therefore be limited in their ability to influence monetary policy. Israeli officials said the decision not to allow a Palestinian currency was largely political because it was an issue of 'sovereignty'. But Mr Basat said there were also significant economic reasons behinds Israel's refusal. He said a common currency made trade relations much easier and cheaper, prevented Palestinian migrant workers from incurring high conversion fees and allayed Israeli fears that the Palestinian self-government would print money to finance its activities rather than work on collecting taxes and so risk high inflation. 'You could say high inflation was a Palestinian problem but we have a big interest in their success because their success will stabilise the peace in the area,' he said However, Palestinian economists and bankers said the PMA would be effectively an embryonic central bank that would be well poised to take full control over monetary policy within a year or two.</p>

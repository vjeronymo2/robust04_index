			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRAZIL ORDERS STOCK, OPTIONS MARKETS TO CLOSE FOR ONE DAY  </P> <P> Brazilian authorities Monday ordered all stock and options markets shut for one  day to sort out the chaos caused when checks written by a major brokerage house  bounced.  </P> <P> The refusal of the banks to honor an 11 million new cruzado ($8.8 million)  check written last week by Lebanese-born Naji Nahas to a brokerage company, Ney  Carvalho, has plunged stock exchanges into disarray.  </P> <P> The Rio exchange said in a telex late Monday that a total of seven brokerage  houses had debts at the close of business Thursday, when the Nahas check was  cashed.  </P> <P> Nahas, educated in Egypt and London but now a Brazilian citizen, was charged by  the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1985 with illegally  manipulating silver prices in 1979 and 1980 together with the Hunt brothers.  </P> <P> He was accused of helping coordinate silver purchases in a bid to corner the  silver market sparking a five-fold price jump to a record $50 per ounce in  early 1980. In 1986, Nahas was fined $250,000 by the CFTC for his role in the  alleged manipulation scheme.  </P> <P> A stock exchange official said that four firms had been reported on Monday  night to the Central Bank for failing to pay their debts. The central bank  would decide whether to close them or impose other penalties.  </P> <P> Exchange sources said the debts in the four companies so far reported to the  central bank totalled around 20 million new cruzados ($16 million).  </P> <P> But the final total of money involved was believed to be higher, perhaps as  much as 200 million cruzados ($160 million), they said.  </P></p>

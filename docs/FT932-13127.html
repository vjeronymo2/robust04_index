			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: ICI's rollercoaster - At a Glance Imperial Chemical Industries, which this week published the pathfinder prospectus for the proposed demerger of Zeneca, has had a rollercoaster ride over the last four months. During mid-February, its shares suffered the same fate as those of the drug groups, as investors registered fears about healthcare reforms in the US, Germany and Italy. The turning point was reached when ICI's board announced it was going ahead with the Zeneca demerger, that it was guaranteeing the 1993 dividend at 55p, and was cutting 9,000 jobs. The shares rose sharply for most of March, until they fell back again on worries about effects of the slowdown of the continental economy on the chemical operations. From mid-April, ICI's shares recovered again, with strong buying from US investors convinced the group will benefit from any economic recovery and an improved performance from the healthcare sector.</p>

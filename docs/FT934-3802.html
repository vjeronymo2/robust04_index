			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 3.5% on concern over stimulus package Reports that the government will not announce additional stimulus measures before the passage of the supplementary budget through parliament discouraged investors, and the Nikkei average tumbled 3.5 per cent, falling through the 17,000 level for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 618.97 to 16,840.38, its first decline in five trading days. The Topix index dropped 46.25, or 3.2 per cent, to 1,413.86, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 2.99 to 1,148.82. The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 17,425.14 but small-lot arbitrage selling depressed share prices after a fall in futures. The index hit the day's low of 16,783.48 just before the morning close, but resisted a further decline on encountering index-linked buying by investment trusts. Volume fell to 220m shares from 271m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 1,020 to 74, with 61 issues unchanged. Investors had hoped that the government would announce an emergency fiscal package this week, to include cuts in income tax and land transaction taxes. However, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa needs to clear other political issues before a decision on a new stimulation package can be reached. Meanwhile, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, reiterated that the government would not take steps to prop up the equity market. The arrest of Mr Shigeru Sato, president of Kabuto Decom, a property developer listed on the over-the-counter section, also depressed sentiment. Prosecutors allege that Mr Sato forged commercial bills in the name of Kabuto's subsidiaries. The Tokyo stock exchange suspended trading of Kabuto on the OTC market after the reports. Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, Kabuto's main creditor, slipped Y35 to Y480. Daikyo, a condominium developer, dropped Y64 to Y912 after Carolina, a real estate company listed on the second section and in which Daikyo has the largest shareholding, announced that it was withdrawing from textile and agriculture operations. Carolina eased Y1 to Y309. Banks declined on profit-taking. Sumitomo Bank relinquished Y60 to Y1,980 and Sakura Bank Y10 to Y1,500. Brokers were also weak, with Nomura Securities down Y80 to Y1,770 and Nikko Securities losing Y70 to Y1,030. In Osaka, the OSE average plunged 624.86 to 18,694.88 in volume of 11.3m shares. Roundup The fall in Tokyo seemed to have little direct impact on the region's markets. Manila was closed due to a typhoon. HONG KONG surged ahead 3.3 per cent on heavy foreign demand, in spite of rising friction between Britain and China. The Hang Seng index climbed 315.34 to 9,609.69 in turnover swollen to HKDollars 7.2bn from Friday's HKDollars 5.8bn. Last week's decision by Governor Chris Patten to press ahead with a partial electoral bill, in spite of Chinese opposition, was viewed as removing a major source of uncertainty in the market. The sharp rise was partly fuelled by surging index futures and a jump in the shares of HK Telecom, up 90 cents at HKDollars 15.60. December index futures added 400 at 9,785, for a premium of 175 points to the spot index. The newly listed Consolidated Electric Power, Hopewell's power operations in China and the Philippines, finished at HKDollars 15, against a high of HKDollars 15.50 and its offer price of HKDollars 12.50. Hopewell was 20 cents ahead at HKDollars 8.85. KUALA LUMPUR was driven to an all-time peak by heavy speculative demand prompted by rumours of takeovers and timber concessions. The composite index put on 17.19, or 1.7 per cent, at 1,041.11 in volume of 901.8m shares, the highest since October 28 when 909.2m was recorded, and compared with 628.5m last Friday. Idris Hydraulic rose 40 cents to MDollars 6.20 amid talk that it had secured a timber concession deal in Burma. KARACHI advanced to a two-year high on renewed foreign demand when the market reopened after a three-day break. The KSE 100-share index added 16.46 at 1,791.40. SEOUL moved ahead for the third straight session, with continuing demand for blue chip manufacturers outweighing institutional sales of financials and shares with low price-to-book ratios. The composite stock index rose 4.90 to 826.49. SINGAPORE edged lower on losses in some shipyard and property stocks, although Malaysian shares traded over the counter and Singapore's second and third liners were actively dealt. The Straits Times Industrial index dipped 3.96 to 2,147.54. TAIWAN advanced 2 per cent to close at its highest level since May on buying of the plastics sector. The weighted index gained 99.44 at 4,708.17 in turnover of TDollars 66.9bn. Plastics forged ahead on expectations that the industry will see a turnround next year. The Formosa Plastics group's announcement last week that it would soon start major construction work on its Dollars 9bn petrochemical complex also triggered strong buying . Formosa Plastics surged TDollars 2.80 to TDollars 52 and its affiliate Nan Ya Plastics ended TDollars 2 up at TDollars 53.50. AUSTRALIA rose moderately in thin trading and the All Ordinaries index finished 6.3 firmer at 2,053.7. Turnover amounted to ADollars 318.6m.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson It would be unwise to read too much into Hanson's decision to forgo involvement in Canary Wharf or to take the Pounds 144m gain from the sales of British Ever Ready and its ICI stake below the line. Hanson has pulled back from grandiose schemes before, for instance, its mooted role in UK power privatisation. Disposals have also been taken below the line, despite the different treatment accorded its Newmont Mining stake in 1991. Nonetheless the two developments tend to confirm suspicions that the sober-minded influence of its new top management is growing. If that is so, Hanson will increasingly be measured by the underlying profitability of its mainstream businesses. After adjusting for exchange rates and last year's Newmont gain the fall in profits slowed to 5 per cent in the first nine months compared with 6 per cent in the first half. The company is more optimistic on the US outlook. But it is not clear how far full year figures will rely on interest earnings or on the release of provisions. Besides, Hanson's gearing to US recovery can be overstated, not least because of Peabody's dependence on long-term coal contracts. Hanson is unlikely to benefit next year from the abnormally low tax rate - of 18 per cent in the first nine months - resulting from the ACT effect of its switch to a quarterly dividend. That, together with uncertainty about the speed at which the payout will rise, hardly makes the shares a raging buy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As he visits the United States on June 21 to 26,  Russian Prime-Minister Chernomyrdin will raise the problem of  discriminatory restrictions in trade relations with Russia.    Talking to newsmen at Moscow's Vnukovo-2 airport before  boarding a flight for Milan, Chernomyrdin said the United States  had failed to meet its year-old pledge to lift all restrictions  on trade with Russia.    According to Chernomyrdin, that although the United States  suffered as much damage from the Jackson-Vanik amendment as  Russia did, it kept stalling with moves to repeal it. [sentence  as received]    Chernomyrdin said Russia wanted equitable relations with,  and  no special privileges from, the US. It would not tolerate  discrimination, he said. Chernomyrdin hoped to find a solution  to that problem during his visit to the United States.    His plans to visit the Livermore nuclear center proved,  Chernomyrdin said, what progress Russian-US relations had made.  Chernomyrdin will be the first Russian leader to visit the top  secret center.    Chernomyrdin and the US leaders will be expected to focus on  formerly "unmentionable" issues on the order of nuclear  cooperation.</p>

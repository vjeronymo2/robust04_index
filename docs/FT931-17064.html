			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Markets: Lines from the rich and famous - Serious Money / Pointers for the economic year ahead A SMALL hole recently opened in the space-time continuum and a sheaf of letters dropped from the future into the FT's files. Our crack team of reporters are not quite sure who the letters are from, but careful analysis may provide some clues about the economic prospects for 1993. Dear Bill Glad you've forgiven me about the passport thing. I'm sure we can re-establish that special relationship. Given your time at Oxford, I'm certain, like me, you have developed a passion for cricket and Happy Eaters. And we're both quite considerably fond of Chelsea (joke). Indeed now that we've cut interest rates to 3 per cent and the pound is worth one dollar, it's almost as if we're one country again. Hope to see to you soon and you're welcome to look in our files on Dan Quayle any time (only kidding). Yours, John Dear Helmut, Will you please pass on to Herr Schlesinger our grateful thanks for the one-eighth of a percentage point cut in interest rates which the Bundesbank announced last week? I'm sure it will be invaluable in stimulating our economy, and a great help when it comes to our Parliamentary elections in May. Not] (as the stars of Wayne's World would say). Yours, Francois PS Sorry about our farmers setting fire to the Frankfurter and beer trucks. Dear Francois, Schlesinger Schmesinger. All that guy thinks about is the money supply. Maybe if you sent some of your farmers to blockade Frankfurt, he might see sense. Instead he keeps droning on about the cost of reunification. You don't know anyone who wants to buy a small, former Communist country on the cheap, do you? Yours, Helmut Dear (insert name of foreign leader), Thanks very much for your congratulations on my election. I am afraid I will not be able to visit your country until I need to look statesmanlike/ the US economy recovers/1997. But in the meantime, I hope to arrange a high level delegation led by Al Gore/Hillary/Socks the Cat. If you really want to help, we would be very grateful if you cut your interest rates/cut your tariffs/bought some GM cars. As a gesture of goodwill, I therefore include tickets to Disneyland/tickets to my next saxophone concert/a grits recipe. Yours, Bill NB. Could the State Department delete where applicable? Dear M Delors, Good news about the Maastricht vote. Parliament approved everything, subject to a few more minor opt-out clauses. Like the Common Agricultural Policy (just kidding). Yours, John PS Have you tried Bill's grits recipe? Tastes considerably good with chips and peas. Dear Bill, Sorry about the mistake with Hillary. My eyesight is fading these days and I thought she was . . . anyway, tell her she has an even better right hook than Edith Cresson. In any case, now the Bundesbank has lowered its interest rates at last, the strains on the ERM might lift. It's a pity there's only two currencies left in it. Yours, Francois PS Also sorry about what the farmers did to Eurodisney. Apparently, it can be fumigated in a few weeks. Dear Norman, Sorry about the cabinet reshuffle. It was time for a change and I wanted to move in some new faces. I am sure you will rise to the challenges of the Northern Ireland office. Yours, John Dear M Mitterrand, We have an old saying in Arkansas: 'Don't enter the pigsty unless you're ready to trade pork bellies.' We had a good laugh when we heard about what your farmers did to Eurodisney and an even bigger laugh when Congress passed the 'Goods from France (Large Tariffs) Act'. Enjoy your recession. Yours, Bill Dear Helmut Oh dear] Now that the trade war with the US and the lingering effects of the Bundesbank's policies last year have sent the whole of Europe into recession, it seems that the Anglo-Saxon economies are the only ones which will grow this year. If you need any tips on how to run a successful economic policy, don't hesitate to call. But I am really writing to put your mind at rest. I can categorically deny the reports in the British press which claim that we will be leaving the European Community and applying for England, Scotland and Wales to be the 51st, 52nd and 53rd states of the union. Oh no. Yours, John Dear Bill All the terms seem OK with us. But can you remind me what comes after: 'Oh say, can you see, by the dawn's early light'? Yours, John</p>

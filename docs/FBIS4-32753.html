			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 27 May (MTI) -- Ten of the 12 ministers,  plus one minister without portfolio, in the new government to be  installed in July, will be from the Hungarian Socialist Party  (MSZP), which won an absolute majority at the elections with 54  percent of the parliamentary seats. Three will be from the  second most popular party, the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ), which received nearly 18 percent of the seats.    The prime minister candidate is Gyula Horn, who was foreign  minister in the Nemeth cabinet in 1989-90; Laszlo Bekesi will be  finance minister for the second time; the new foreign minister  is Laszlo Kovacs; and the minister of industry and trade will be  the Former State Secretary Laszlo Pal.    Twelve members of the new cabinet also held seats in the  previous Parliament, and -- with one exception -- they entered  the new assembly from individual constituencies.    Gyula Horn (62), chairman and prime minister candidate of  the  main ruling party, the MSZP, filled diplomatic posts for thirty  years under the Kadar regime, and was foreign minister in the  reform-communist Nemeth cabinet, which paved the way for the  political changes.    Born in Budapest on July 5, 1932 to factory worker parents  with seven children, Horn studied at Rostov College of Economics  in the Soviet Union from 1950 to 1954.    After five years at the Finance Ministry, he worked for two  years at the Foreign Ministry's Soviet Department. He was a  diplomat in Sofia from 1961 to 1963, and in Belgrade between  1963 and 1969.    Later he joined the Foreign Affairs Department of the  Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party [MSZMP], which he headed from  1983 to 1985, invested with powers similar to a foreign minister.    He was secretary of state at the Foreign Ministry between  1985 and 1989, and foreign minister in 1989-90, all the while  ascending in the party hierarchy. As a reform-communist, he  became a presidium member of the MSZP, founded in 1989, and  became party chairman after the MSZP's election defeat in May  1990. Horn was heavily involved in preparing the Hungarian  Government decision that allowed East Germans to leave Hungary  for the Federal Republic of Germany through Austria, effective  September 11, 1989. For this move, which has been widely  regarded in world politics as the first rupture in the Berlin  Wall, Horn received the Charles Award, one of the most  prestigious German honors, in Aachen in 1990.    In 1989, he also became the first diplomat from a socialist  country to sign an agreement establishing diplomatic relations  with South Korea.    In the Parliament formed after free elections on May 2,  1990,  the opposition Socialist group gained prestige despite having  only 8.5 percent of the seats.    Polls put Horn among the three or four most popular  politicians throughout the last four years. As the Socialists  became more popular, Horn and his party increasingly came under  attack.    He headed Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee until early  1993, when pressure to resign came from the ruling parties who  claimed he could not represent national interests as the  Socialist chairman.    The prime minister candidate has dismissed the fears of a  Socialist victory bringing back the communist era as absurd. He  says that the social-democrat MSZP does not want, and Hungary's  plural democracy does not allow, a return to the old regime.    Gabor Kuncze (44), the SZDSZ's former prime minister  candidate and current nominee for interior minister and  coalition deputy prime minister, gained a seat in the previous  Parliament with the SZDSZ's support, joining the party only two  years ago. The politician -- who is a qualified economist and  production engineer -- became the SZDSZ's leader in Parliament  in 1993, and its prime minister candidate in autumn of the same  year.    At a televised debate prior to the first round of the May  general elections, the pragmatic, witty Kuncze outrivalled the  list leaders of the other large parties, as opinion polls  showed. (The Socialists were represented at the debate by  Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres due to Horn's car accident).  Foreign minister candidate Laszlo Kovacs, a 55-year-old  economist, won his parliamentary mandate via the MSZP's  Gyor-Sopron county list. From 1975 to 1986, he worked for the  Foreign Affairs Department of the former MSZP's Central  Committee, and was deputy foreign minister between 1986 and  1989. Under Horn's ministerial tenure, in 1989-90, he was  secretary of state for foreign affairs. He was a member of the  outgoing Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, which he headed  from 1993. He is in charge of the working group of the MSZP's  parliamentary faction for foreign policy, security, and defense.    The would-be minister of finance, Dr Laszlo Bekesi, 52,  holder of a high academic degree in economics, was a member of  the former council apparatus between 1968 and 1980. He held the  positions of economic policy secretary of the MSZMP's Budapest  committee from 1981 to 1985, deputy finance minister from 1985  to 1989, and finance minister from 1989-90. He headed the  outgoing Parliament's Tax Subcommittee, and was a member of the  Committee for European Community Affairs. It is a generally  held opinion that the liberal- minded Bekesi was the main  proponent of an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition. He is his party's senior  economic expert and leader of the team that worked out the  MSZP's economic program.    The MSZP's nominee for minister of agriculture, Dr Laszlo  Lakos (49) -- a veterinarian and company management engineer by  profession -- led a cooperative farm for 22 years. He was  deputy chairman of the previous Parliament's Economic and  Agricultural Committees. He has been local councillor in the  village of Korostetlen (east Hungary) since 1990.    Justice minister candidate Dr Pal Vastagh, a 48-year-old  lawyer, received a Ph.D. in political theory from Moscow in  1986. Holder of a high academic degree in law and political  sciences, he filled various posts at the law faculty of Szeged  University for almost 20 years, and became dean at the end of  the 1980's. He was a member of the previous Parliament's  Constitutional, Legislative, and Judicial Committee. He is a  member of the MSZP's presidium and board.    The 32-year-old Gabor Fodor, a lawyer by profession, is to  become the new minister of education and culture. In 1988, he  was a founding member of the Federation of Young Democrats  (FIDESZ), which he represented in the outgoing Parliament. He  headed Parliament's Committee on Human Rights, Minorities, and  Religious Affairs between 1990 and 1993, and was member of the  National Security Committee in 1992-93. In 1993, following  disputes within the FIDESZ leadership, he left the party and  simultaneously resigned as a deputy. At the elections, where he  won a parliamentary seat in the individual race, he was entered  at second place on the SZDSZ's national list, as a non-party  candidate.    The future labor minister, Magda Kovacs Kosa (54), a teacher  of Hungarian and French, was a full-time trade union activist  after 13 years of teaching and headmaster work. She was a  secretary of the National Council of Trade Unions from 1985 to  1990, and a member of Parliament's Immunity and Incompatibility  Committee.    Dr Ferenc Baja, the 39-year-old candidate for minister of  environment and regional policy, graduated from the Hungarian,  Popular Education, and Philosophy Faculty of Debrecen  University.

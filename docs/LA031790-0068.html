			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. MITCHELL SAYS 'BLUNDER' BY BUSH CONTRIBUTED TO SPLINTERING OF ISRAELI  COALITION;  </P> <P> POLITICS: DEMOCRAT LAUNCHES ATTACK OVER COMMENTS ON THE SENSITIVE ISSUE OF EAST  JERUSALEM'S FUTURE.  </P> <P> In a strongly worded attack, Senate Democratic Leader George J. Mitchell  accused President Bush on Friday of a "heavy-handed blunder" that contributed  to the downfall of the Israeli government when he raised the issue of East  Jerusalem's future status.  </P> <P> "His remarks have contributed to the recent political crisis in Israel and have  cast doubt upon America's intentions and role in promoting peace in the Middle  East," Mitchell (D-Me.) said in a statement. "A more heavy-handed blunder is  difficult to imagine."  </P> <P> Bush, speaking at a March 3 news conference in Palm Springs, voiced opposition  to settlements by Soviet Jews in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which  Israel captured in 1967 and subsequently annexed.  </P> <P> Although Bush's comments were consistent with longstanding U.S. policy, U.S.  officials generally have refrained from discussing East Jerusalem because its  future status is one of the most sensitive issues facing the Israelis.  </P> <P> Although a number of American Jewish organizations have been highly critical of  the President's remarks 13 days ago, Mitchell's broadside was the first  Democratic move to reap political benefit from the issue.  </P> <P> The Senate leader's response came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir's government fell on a parliamentary vote of no confidence, reflecting  its refusal to accept an American plan to start peace talks with the  Palestinians.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, responding to a  reporter's question, declined to acknowledge that the President's remarks had  contributed to the downfall of the Israeli coalition government headed by  Shamir.  </P> <P> "Obviously there is a pause in moving the peace process forward," Tutwiler  said.  </P> <P> She added, however: "The vote in the Knesset (Thursday) clearly reflected a  focus on the peace issue and the importance of moving forward. . . . The  Israeli government has fallen and Israel's constitutional processes will come  into effect. It will now take some time for a new government to be formed. This  is an exclusively Israeli matter that only Israelis can work out."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Mitchell said he decided to speak out, nearly two weeks after  Bush made his comments on East Jerusalem, because of press inquiries regarding  his view of the controversy. The statement was issued after a series of  fund-raising appearances in California for the Senate Democratic Campaign  Committee.  </P> <P> While most Democratic and Republican politicians take a pro-Israeli stance,  Mitchell's statement seemed likely to win more favor among American Jews and  other Israeli sympathizers than the President's position.  </P> <P> Israel says that it annexed East Jerusalem and will never give it up. But U.S.  policy regards the area as occupied territory, with its final status subject to  negotiation during peace talks with Palestinians.  </P> <P> Although Bush simply restated American policy in effect since 1967, the timing  of his remarks at a crucial stage in the drawn-out peace process has been  regarded as a mistake by foreign policy specialists.  </P> <P> Shamir has implied that Bush's comment was the final straw that led to the  collapse of Israel's coalition government. Many Bush Administration officials  believe, however, that Shamir's hard-line resistance to American  recommendations for peace talks with Palestinians was equally to blame for the  government's fall.  </P> <P> Mitchell praised the Bush Administration for paving the way for the Mideast  peace process through consultations with Israel and Egypt that built trust on  all sides. But he said the President's remarks have undermined that progress.  </P> <P> "There was simply no reason to suddenly thrust into the forefront of debate the  issue of Jewish Israelis' rights to live in East Jerusalem," Mitchell said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Norman Kempster contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 26 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb troops have  made a small advance in the western pocket of Bihac following  intense shelling of the region, a UN commander stationed in  Bihac said Thursday [26 May]. Major Jean-Francois Philippe,  spokesman for the French battalion based in the Moslem-held  city, said the Serbs advanced by about a kilometre (less than a  mile) in the southeastern part of the pocket Wednesday after  launching a barrage of 500 shells against positions of the  mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army stationed north of the city.    The Serbs also reportedly launched infantry assaults on  several villages north of Bihac, a UN-declared "safe haven."  Philippe said the Serbs want to reclaim territory captured by  the Bosnian Army along the Una River and a railway line that  runs nearby. According to Bosnian military sources, the army  still controls some 40 kilometres (25 miles) of the railway  line, which is crucial to the Serbs who are trying to link the  separatist Croatian region of Krajina with the Serb-held  stronghold of Banja Luka, in western Bosnia.    The Serbs have also started building a railway line in order  to link the northeastern Bosnian town of Brcko with the nearby  town of Bijeljina and Serbia proper. Philippe said the  situation in Bihac was calm Thursday although clashes erupted  Wednesday evening between government forces and troops loyal to  Moslem separatist leader Fikret Abdic, who has brokered his own  ceasefire with the Serbs in areas he controls.    Elsewhere in Bosnia Thursday, the army was pursuing its  offensive against Serb troops in the northern town of Tesanj but  UN observers stationed in the region said they had not detected  any territorial gains. In the eastern town of Gorazde,  meanwhile, Serb commanders were still refusing to pull armed  troops from a UN-imposed three- kilometre (1.8-mile) exclusion  zone around the city.    Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN  troops in Bosnia, met Wednesday with Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic in an attempt to convince him to pull government  troops from the east bank of the Drina River, which runs through  Gorazde, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Robert Annink  said. He said the retreat is the Serbs' "condition for  withdrawing from the three-kilometre zone." Annink added that  although a UN resolution on Gorazde does not call for troops  withdrawal, the belligerants must "make a step to show their  good faith." The Serbs last weekend ignored a pledge they had  made to pull their armed forces from the three-kilometre zone.    In other developments Thursday, three field clinics donated  by Britain began operating in Mostar, in southern  Bosnia-Herzegovina, devastated by fighting between Moslems and  Croats before both sides agreed a federation plan earlier this  year.</p>

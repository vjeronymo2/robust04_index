			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: COPING WHEN YOUR POPPER WON'T POP  </P> <P> This is what is going on today in the world of merchandising. Take a department  store -- any department store.  </P> <P> "Sir, I'm interested in this electric popcorn maker. Is it any good?"  </P> <P> " 'Good' is not the word for it. This machine is the best that money can buy.  It pops corn light and fluffy without ever missing a single kernel. We've been  carrying this model for three years and nobody has ever brought one back."  </P> <P> "In that case, let me have one."  </P> <P> "Yes, sir. That will be $49.99. Did you want a service contract to go with it?"  </P> <P> "I thought you said that it was a wonderful popcorn maker. Why do I need a  service contract?"  </P> <P> "You never know what will happen when you leave the store. A mail truck could  run over it, or some child on a skateboard could knock you down in the parking  lot. The cost is only $190 and it's good for 18 months."  </P> <P> "That's outrageous. What about the warranty?"  </P> <P> "The warranty only helps if something happens to the popcorn maker while it is  being used on a nuclear submarine."  </P> <P> "You have to be kidding."  </P> <P> "It also guarantees the machine for parts and labor if it breaks down in the  Amazon rain forest. Sir, it's none of my business, but you would be much better  off with a service contract. With this contract, a company representative will  fly from Asia on the same day to fix your machine."  </P> <P> "But you told me yourself that no customer has ever brought back one of these  popcorn makers."  </P> <P> "That's because they all had service contracts. If they didn't, the machines  wouldn't last 48 hours. We're already doing you a favor by letting you purchase  a contract from us."  </P> <P> "Can the store make money on these contracts?"  </P> <P> "Not with the popcorn machine. May I see your driver's license?"  </P> <P> "It seems to me that if the appliance sells for $49.99, the service agreement  shouldn't cost $190."  </P> <P> "I guess you've never seen the inside of a popcorn maker. It's a mess. It  wouldn't be worth our while to sell a contract for less."  </P> <P> "Does every item in this department come with a service contract?"  </P> <P> "Everything but Mr. Massey, the manager, over there. Nobody will take one on  him."  </P> <P> "All right, give me a service agreement on the popper. Now it's my  understanding that if anything goes wrong with it, I can have it fixed."  </P> <P> "In a jiffy. Just air freight it to the factory in Taiwan and they will repair  it for you at no charge whatsoever."  </P> <P> "I feel better knowing that there is someone out there if I need him."  </P> <P> "If, for any reason, it is not repaired to your satisfaction, may I suggest you  buy this vacuum cleaner to sweep up all the kernels from the floor."  </P> <P> "How much is that?" I asked.  </P> <P> "It costs $470, not including the insurance policy in case the popcorn stops up  the nozzle of the cleaner."  </P></p>

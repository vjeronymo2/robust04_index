			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Campaign for clarity aims to end Eurospeak In Brussels it is widely recognised that directives - or EU laws - are written in a prose so execrable that it violates all the languages of the Union. But from tomorrow Eurocrats in their multilingual drafting committees should watch out. The Plain English Campaign, the linguistic pressure group which is the self-appointed scourge of verbose British bureaucrats, is waging war on Euro-obscurity. The campaign is launching a lobby to ensure that all information released to the public by the European Commission is easy to understand. Though it has clashed with the Commission over incidents of verbosity, this will be its first all-out assault on catastrophes of comprehension. No longer should Article 8a of the Maastricht treaty, 'comitology', 'false 'B' points', or the ubiquitous Euro-grunt of 'Erf, erf' be daily currency in Brussels, though making headway might be difficult. The last, a violation of (French and English) language, could inadvertently help the campaign. 'Erf, erf' means 'Off, off' - as in 'off the record', and is designed to obscure the source of information. Ms Chrissie Maher, head of the Campaign, said the EU had been singled out for attack because many of its laws were 'so badly worded that no one knows what they mean'. The chief catalyst was the Maastricht treaty, which Ms Maher called 'so impenetrable that, if it wasn't so serious, it would have been a joke'. She wrote a letter of complaint to Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the Commission, which she sent together with 'the biggest Brussels sprout I could find'. Ms Maher received 'a very nice letter back' pointing out that Mr Delors had not written the treaty himself. She was unimpressed. One of the main targets of the campaign will be arcane new words - such as 'extensification' and the now-infamous 'subsidiarity'. Ms Maher sees them as 'a form of corruption that Euro MPs pick up over there and think it's clever to use here'.</p>

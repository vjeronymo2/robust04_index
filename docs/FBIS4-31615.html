			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Excerpts] Early this morning Mayor Mirsad Crnkic,  commander of the 511th Glorious Bosanska Krupa Brigade, died  after being shot [words indistinct] on the front line by a  maverick bullet from the positions of Abdic's rebels and  traitors. [passage omitted]    Since early this morning the members of Abdic's rebel  paramilitary have been shelling the areas of Pecigrad, Skokovi,  Todorovo, Golubovici, (Pljanici), and (Krivaja). They have  attempted several infantry breakthroughs, thus proving that  their warmongers are not giving up on further conflicts  regardless of the means and human cost. Since yesterday they  have destroyed dozens of houses and inflicted several  casualties. This is why they obviously do not want to carry out  the agreed exchange of the bodies of killed soldiers.    Karadzic's chetniks have been abundantly helping out the  Kladusa paramilitary as they have been firing with antiaircraft  weapons and small arms throughout the night and this morning on  the (Bihac) and Bosanska Krupa fronts. They have also  intensified their activities on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau.  Our defenders have not been responding to these attacks in  compliance with the arranged cease-fire.</p>

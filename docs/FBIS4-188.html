			<p>BFN     [Text] Lome, April 3 (AFP) -- Togolese President Gnassingbe  Eyadema on Saturday [2 April] appealed to the country's two  opposition parties, currently enjoying a parliamentatary  majority, to show their good will by helping him designate a  prime minister.    Eyadema, in a statement sent to AFP, said opposition leaders  had told him they could not "draft a list of candidates,"  although they had "committed themselves to do so." He said the  officials, whom he met Saturday, were unable to assemble a list  "because the rank and file members are at odds with their  leaders."    The two parties, the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and  the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), agreed on March 26 to  put forward CAR leader Yao Agboyibor as their choice for prime  minister. But General Eyadema called for a list of several  candidates, a request the two parties have so far been unable to  meet.    The opposition coalition won 43 seats in February's  legislative elections to the 81-member parliament, with CAR  capturing 36 and the UTD seven. But the supreme court  subsequently invalidated the election of three of its members.  As a result, CAR currently controls 34 seats and the UTD six.    Eyadema said in his statement he could "only express  surprise  at the sluggish pace at which the leaders of the majority  parties are trying to draft a list of candidates for prime  minister."    He reiterated his readiness to continue discussions with  Agboyibor and UTD head Edem Kodjo. But the parties on Saturday  vowed to boycott parliament to protest the court decision  invalidating the election of three oppostion deputies.    The coalition said the action would last "until the  situation  is clarified."    The supreme court nullified the election of the three  deputies for technical reasons in one case and because of  "trouble" during election day in the two others.    The opposition rejected all three decisions, charging that  election day "trouble" had been the work of the pro-Eyadema  faction.</p>

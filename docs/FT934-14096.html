Mr Christopher Carr QC, for Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the advertising agency opposing the discharging of the administrators, told the court that too little information had been supplied for the rescue plan to be assessed properly. Mr Michael Crystal QC, for the administrators Ernst &amp; Young, said the restructuring plan was the only means of securing some financial return for creditors.

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> CAMARILLO TAKES ITS TIME EN ROUTE TO 48-38 VICTORY  </P> <P> Usually, the Camarillo High boys' basketball team is an up-tempo scoring  machine. However, the absence of four of his top eight players has forced Coach  John Harbour to give the Scorpions a strange new look.  </P> <P> Even though it didn't look like the Camarillo of old, the slow-down,  ball-control offensive scheme worked well Friday night as the Scorpions claimed  third place in the Ventura tournament with a 48-38 victory over Newbury Park.  </P> <P> Newbury Park (6-5) forced Camarillo's hand with a tight, match-up zone defense  and a distinct height advantage.  </P> <P> The game was close most of the way, Camarillo (9-3) holding a tenuous 33-31  lead at the start of the fourth quarter. Newbury Park Coach Greg Ropes switched  to a man-to-man defense at that point, allowing Camarillo guard David Harbour  to break loose for 13 of his game-high 28 points to help the Scorpions outscore  the Panthers, 15-7, in the final eight minutes.  </P> <P> "Our players were really disciplined, and they showed a lot of self-sacrifice,"  John Harbour said. Six-foot-six center Kevin Loveall did most of the damage for  Newbury Park, scoring 15 points and grabbing 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> The slow-down offense also forced Camarillo to be selective with its shot  attempts. The Scorpions shot 59% from the field in the first half and 47% for  the game. Newbury Park shot only 30%.  </P> <P> In another tournament game:  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks 65, Ventura 62 -- The Lancers used a 12-6 run in the fourth  quarter to secure the consolation championship. Guard Scott Peterson scored  eight of his 16 points in the period for Thousand Oaks (6-5).  </P> <P> Center Mike Sandlin had a team-high 17 points for Thousand Oaks and forward  Chris Loll added 12. Forward Dusty Lysobey had seven points and 10 rebounds.  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / State oil companies dominate State-owned oil companies continue to dominate the top rankings of international oil companies in spite of a spate of privatisations in the industry. A report published today by Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a US newsletter, on the world's top 50 oil companies says that 28 are fully or partly state-owned. But it predicts that privatisations planned over the next few years will reverse this. The report shows that Petroleos de Venezuela has overtaken Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, to move into second place behind Saudi Aramco. Private companies in the top 10 include Exxon, the US energy group, in fourth place. Two other US companies, Mobil and Chevron, are ranked 7th and 8th respectively, while British Petroleum is in 9th place. On the basis of production, however, Gazprom, Russia's monopoly gas company, moves into second place behind Saudi Aramco, although it ranks 33rd overall. Only Shell among the private companies ranked in the top 10 by production. Private companies continue, however, to dominate the list of the largest refining and marketing companies. The rankings are determined by six operational criteria covering upstream production activities as well as refining capacity and product sales.</p>

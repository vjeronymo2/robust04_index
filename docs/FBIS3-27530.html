			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhong Yan (6988 1693): "Setting a Fire and Lighting a </F> Lamp"]    [Text] On 9 February, the U.S. CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR  carried an article entitled "U.S. Exports of Prison Goods." The  article says: "Just when the Clinton administration continues  to criticize China for exporting prison goods to the United  States, California and Oregon are stepping up efforts to export  their prison-made clothing to Asia." The article specifically  exposed the following fact: "Oregon will export $3 million  worth of prison-made jeans and shirts this year to Japan, Italy,  and other countries," "while California has sent selling offers  to Japan and Malaysia."    The U.S. export of prison-made products is no longer news.  What merits people's attention is that although the U.S. export  of prison goods is an open secret, some people in the United  States do not feel ashamed of it. They continue to castigate  others on the issue while posing themselves as persons of high  morals. This cannot help but arouse dissatisfaction from many  people, including some honest Americans. The article in THE  CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR precisely represents the sentiments of  these honest people.    Some people in the United States, however, put a label on  China for the so-called export of prison goods and the alleged  "violation of human rights." Why, then, does the United States  not violate human rights by exporting its prison goods? China  has issued explicit orders and taken practical measures to ban  exports of such goods, and why has the United States continued  sending its selling offers to market and export prison goods  everywhere? These people have made irresponsible criticisms of  China for compelling prison inmates to work and "produce export  goods without pay." Perhaps this is the reason why prison goods  exported by the United States are different from those exported  by other countries. However, the article in THE CHRISTIAN  SCIENCE MONITOR points out: "In California prison workshops  prisoners are forced to work like slaves. If they do not work,  they are at risk of losing some preferential treatments and  serving longer sentences." "The U.S. authorities exploit  prisoners." "The net pay of prison inmates is much lower than  the official minimum wage. California's prisoners sewing shirts  receive $0.35 an hour. Although Oregon prisons pay inmates $6  to $8 an hour, they take back 80 percent as charges of board and  lodging."    There is no wonder that the article quoted some Americans as  saying: "The U.S. Administration often criticizes other  countries for infringing upon human rights, but it turns a blind  eye to the domestic phenomena of human rights violations." Some  people even said indignantly: "The practice of two different  kinds of policies on prison goods may smack of old-fashioned  imperialism." It seems unnecessary to say anything else as the  foregoing is clear enough, but this writer cannot help thinking  of an ancient Chinese saying that reads: "The magistrate is  free to burn down houses while the common people are forbidden  even to light lamps." This indicates that the magistrate's  tyranny has developed to such a point that his policies "may"  not just "smack of" something.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / People: Next step in Galvin dynasty Young Chris Galvin has a tough act to follow, writes Laurie Morse. As newly-named president and chief operating officer of Motorola, he must maintain the momentum generated by former CEO George Fisher, who defected to Eastman Kodak in October. Under Fisher, Motorola became a legendary research machine with a reputation for quality products in two competitive high-tech arenas - wireless telecommunications and semiconductors. In 1992, Motorola's sales were Dollars 13.3bn, twice those of 1988, and profits in 1993 are projected to be close to Dollars 1bn. Galvin, at 43, seems young to take over; but his whole life has been training for the job. The grandson of Motorola's founder Paul Galvin, and son of Robert Galvin, who chaired the company for 26 years, Chris Galvin seems destined for the chairman's seat. His family owns 3 per cent of the company's stock. Colleagues say he has much more going for him than the Motorola pedigree. Bright and ambitious, Galvin began working part-time in the family business in 1967, and joined the company full-time in 1973, peddling portable telephones. He worked through a series of sales management and marketing positions, earned an MBA from Northwestern University, and grew the company's portable paging division in the 1980s. Galvin shares the chief executive office with Gary Tooker, a 30-year Motorola veteran who was Fisher's right-hand man, and who now holds the title of CEO. With Motorola facing stiff competition from Intel in the semiconductor market, and from a host of overseas telecommunications rivals, the company is at a critical juncture. It is just embarking on a number of untried technologies, including the global communications scheme, Iridium, projected to cost Dollars 3.4bn. The task won't be easy. Motorola's stock was flying at a high 33 times earnings, or Dollars 107 per share just before Fisher's departure. It has since skidded 19 per cent to Dollars 87.</p>

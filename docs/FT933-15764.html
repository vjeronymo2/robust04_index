			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cost controls and improved margins help Eurotherm advance to Pounds 9m EUROTHERM, the industrial process control equipment supplier, reported a 37 per cent increase in interim profits, reflecting cost cutting measures, improved margins and the positive impact of sterling's devaluation. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 9.19m in the six months to April 30, against Pounds 6.71m last time, while turnover expanded a modest 3.8 per cent to Pounds 81m (Pounds 78.1m) reflecting the 'patchy' state of the world economy, with few countries showing strong recovery signs. Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said the group had been doing 'rather well in adverse conditions,' and had concentrated on restoring profitability and generating cash over the past 18 months. Tight control on costs, including a further reduction in the workforce from 2,150 at the end of October to 2,080 at the period-end, helped boost operating profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 9.27m. Earnings per share jumped 37 per cent to 13.67p (9.97p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.5p (3p). Net interest charges dropped to Pounds 81,000 (Pounds 608,000) reflecting the reduction in net borrowings made possible by strong cash generation. Borrowings fell from Pounds 7.4m at the end of October to Pounds 1.8m and gearing dropped from 12.9 per cent to 2.9 per cent. Looking ahead Mr Leonard said that having strengthened profitability and the financial position of the company 'our next priority is to ensure a resumption of sales growth.' Provided there is no marked deterioration in international trading conditions in the second half he expects the group to achieve a 'significant' full-year profit improvement. COMMENT With almost 80 per cent of turnover coming from outside the UK, sterling's devaluation has significantly improved competitiveness. Sales are lower in Germany where the group has a relatively small presence, but are holding up elsewhere in continental Europe and growing strongly in the US. The one blackspot is the process automation business focused on the UK where customers are still postponing big investment projects. But after cutting the cost base the group is well positioned to take advantage of any upturn. Pre-tax profits this year should reach Pounds 19.9m producing earnings per share of 30p. Based on yesterday's share price of 591p, up 3p, the shares are on a lofty but well deserved prospective multiple of 19.7.</p>

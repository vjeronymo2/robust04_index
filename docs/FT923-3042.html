			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: French moves will depend on referendum THE French government yesterday warned that France was unlikely to follow the German drop in interest rates unless the electorate backed monetary and political union in next Sunday's referendum. 'Only a Yes to Europe, a Yes to Maastricht, can open firm prospects of a fall in interest rates for France,' said Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister. A French decision on rates would be taken on the Monday or Wednesday following the referendum, he said. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, denied that the government was blackmailing voters by linking a possible rate cut to their decision on Maastricht. It would simply be more responsible to decide in the light of the referendum result, given the fact that the close race between pro- and anti-Maastricht factions, shown in the final public opinion surveys before polls closed at the weekend, clearly weighed on currency and equity markets. If the Noes win, there would be 'a monetary shock and a stock market shock', he said. 'It has to be said, that from then on, everyone must take their responsibilities.' The government would stay on, whatever the result, Mr Beregovoy confirmed. He believed the political fall-out of a vote against the treaty would be worse for the deeply divided opposition than for the Socialists. President Francois Mitterrand was planning to stay in power until his mandate ran out in early 1995, he added. Both Mr Beregovoy and Mr Sapin denied that the Bundesbank cracked under international pressure. 'I don't see it like that at all, and I don't say that for diplomatic reasons,' said Mr Sapin. 'The Bundesbank does not surrender to pressure. It has enlarged its reflection to include more general considerations.' The French stock market, like others across Europe, was yesterday cheered by the German rate cut and the European Monetary System realignment, even though analysts said the fall in borrowing costs was so small as to be merely symbolic. By mid afternoon, the CAC 40 index had risen nearly 3.8 per cent, with companies sensitive to interest rate changes, such as banks and leasing houses, showing the strongest gains. Another optimistic sign came from the latest inflation results, showing a 0.1 per cent rise in consumer prices last month, down from 0.3 per cent in July. This brings the prices rise over the previous 12 months to 2.7 per cent, putting France on track to hit the 2.8 per cent annual inflation target for 1992 on which the state budget is based, said the Finance Ministry. The latest result widens the gap between French and German inflation rates, with the latter 0.8 percentage points higher over the year to August.</p>

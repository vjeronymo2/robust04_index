The proposed routine use would provide for disclosure from the systems of records to law enforcement agencies and private security contractors when information is needed to respond to, investigate, or prevent activities that jeopardize the security and safety of SSA customers, employees or workplaces or that otherwise disrupt the operation of SSA facilities. Information would also be disclosed to assist in the prosecution of persons charged with violating Federal or local law in connection with such activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We invite public comment on this publication.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  We filed a report of a new routine use with the Chairman, Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, and the Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget on September 20, 1994.

Discussion of Proposed Routine Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We propose to add a routine use to the systems of records listed below. The proposed routine use is necessary to ensure the security of SSA workplaces and the safety of SSA customers and employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Occasionally SSA offices find it necessary to disclose information to law enforcement agencies and private security contractors in order to ensure the security of the workplace and the safety of those in it. These incidents usually involve: Physical violence; the use, attempted use or display of a weapon; malicious damage to SSA or employee property; credible threats of physical violence against an employee, a customer or the premises; verbal abuse against an employee or customer; and other activities that disrupt the operations of SSA offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Disclosures to Law Enforcement Agencies and Private Security Contractors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and private security contractors have responsibility for preventing, handling, monitoring, and investigating incidents that affect the safety and security of SSA customers, employees and workplaces or otherwise disrupt SSA operations. Prosecution of persons involved in these activities for violation of Federal or local laws may also be appropriate. SSA managers of most SSA leased facilities have to rely primarily on local law enforcement authorities and private security contractors to meet the protective security needs of customers, employees and workplaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to protect individuals and premises and deal with incidents, law enforcement and private security personnel need information from SSA systems of records. Although the Privacy Act permits disclosure without consent to protect the health or safety of individuals (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(8)), the conditions which must be met under this provision sometimes preclude its application in follow-up investigations when there is no immediate emergency. Also, the requirement under this exception that the individual must be notified of the disclosure could have potentially dangerous consequences for SSA employees. They could be subjected to retaliation. The Privacy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7)) also permits disclosure without consent to a law enforcement agency for a valid law enforcement activity when an appropriate official of that agency submits a written request. However, this provision does not permit disclosure without such a request and would not apply when SSA has a need to disclose on its own initiative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To enable SSA to disclose information in compliance with the Privacy Act in all situations that affect the safety and security of SSA customers, employees or workplaces, we are proposing the following routine use to permit disclosure:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> To Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and private security contractors, as appropriate, information necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) To enable them to protect the safety of SSA employees and customers, the security of the SSA workplace and the operation of SSA facilities, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) To assist investigations or prosecutions with respect to activities that affect such safety and security or activities that disrupt the operation of SSA facilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> We are not republishing in their entirety the notices of the systems of records to which we are adding the new routine use statement because of the large number of those systems of records and the costs of republishing the individual notices of each one. Instead, we are republishing only the identification number and the name of each system, and the volume, page number, and date of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  issue in which the systems notice was last published, either in a composite listing of systems of records or as an individual system notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following systems notices were last published at 52 FR 12084, April 14, 1987, in a composite listing which added a routine use:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 09&hyph;60&hyph;0005_Hearing Office File, HHS/SSA/OHA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 09&hyph;60&hyph;0066_Claims Development Record, HHS/SSA/RO; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 09&hyph;60&hyph;0078_Public Inquiry Correspondence File, HHS/SSA/RO.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following systems notices were published at 58 FR 35025,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30, 1993, as individual notices:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 09&hyph;60&hyph;0058_Master Files of Social Security Number Holders, HHS/SSA/OSR;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 09&hyph;60&hyph;0089_Claims Folders System, HHS/SSA/OP;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 09&hyph;60&hyph;0090_Master Beneficiary Record, HHS/SSA/OSR; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 09&hyph;60&hyph;0103_Supplemental Security Income Record, HHS/SSA/OSR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Compatibility of Proposed Routine Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing the changes discussed above in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7), (b)(3), and (e)(11)) and our disclosure regulation (20 CFR part 401).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Privacy Act permits us to disclose information about individuals without their consents for a routine use, i.e., where the information will be used for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which we collected the information. As here pertinent, our regulation implementing that statute states that a disclosure serves such a compatible purpose when the disclosure is necessary to carry out SSA's programs. We believe that the disclosures contemplated under this routine use meet the compatibility requirement for routine uses under the Privacy Act and the regulation. In order for SSA to carry out its programs, it must ensure that its places of business are safe and secure for both customers and employees, that premises and property are safe from theft and damages, that employees can perform their duties without fear of intimidation or injury, and that SSA can prevent and appropriately deal with disruptions in the operation of its facilities. In so far as disclosure to law enforcement agencies and private security contractors will help to accomplish these objectives, the disclosures are an integral part of our program administration responsibilities. Thus, the proposed disclosures meet the compatibility criterion discussed above because they are necessary for program administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Effect of the Proposal on Individual Rights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although disclosures will be made to law enforcement and/or private security personnel, SSA will follow all statutory and regulatory requirements for disclosure. Therefore, we do not anticipate that the disclosures will have any unwarranted effect on the privacy or other rights of individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

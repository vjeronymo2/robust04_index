			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: ALPHAREL LAYS OFF 19, CUTS ASSETS' VALUE  </P> <P> Alpharel Inc., an ailing producer of computer equipment, cut its work force by  32% and wrote down the value of certain inventory and other assets as part of a  restructuring.  </P> <P> The Camarillo-based company, which laid off 19 of its 59 workers, said it would  take a $3.6-million charge against its fourth-quarter 1989 earnings to cover  restructuring costs.  </P> <P> Alpharel also said it hired the investment banking firm Houlihan, Lokey, Howard  &amp; Zukin Capital in Los Angeles to find a possible buyer or partner for the  company as a way of boosting Alpharel's financial health. Alpharel's financial  troubles have eaten away most of the company's cash. As of Sept. 30, the  company had cash and equivalents of $1.8 million, down from $9.4 million in  December, 1988.  </P> <P> Alpharel, which lost $7.07 million on revenue of $3.37 million in the nine  months that ended Sept. 30, said last month that it had contacted other parties  about a possible merger but had not received any serious indications of  interest.  </P></p>

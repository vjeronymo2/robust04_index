			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: State Farm says it expects Dollars 2bn hurricane claims STATE Farm, the biggest provider of home insurance in Florida, yesterday increased its estimate of claims resulting from Hurricane Andrew. The company now says it expects payments to total around Dollars 2.1bn - of which more than Dollars 1bn has already been paid out. The initial estimate was Dollars 1.5bn. State Farm's new estimate comes as many insurers are revising upwards the cost of the storm. The property claims services division of the American Insurance Services Group, the industry trade organisation, originally estimated insured losses to be around Dollars 7.8bn.</p>

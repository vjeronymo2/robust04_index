			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin today ordered Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  to nominate four deputy prime ministers within one week.    A presidential order said today that the Russian Government,  or the Federal Executive Power Institution, will have four  deputy prime ministers, including two first deputy prime  ministers.    The new government will have 23 ministries and seven other  state commissions and federal bureaus, including the Federal  Broadcasting and Television Bureau.    Yeltsin had earlier asked Chernomyrdin to present a plan on  government reshuffle before January 6, for discussions in the  new parliament when it opens tomorrow.    But Chernomyrdin failed to do so because of differences  among  the cabinet members over the set-up of the new government.    Therefore Yeltsin decided to take on the task by himself.    The present Russian Government has nine deputy prime  ministers, including three first deputy prime ministers.</p>

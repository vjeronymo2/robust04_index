			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL TRAINER CRUELTY CHARGES  </P> <P> "Colorful pageantry disguises the fact that animals used in circuses are mere  captives, forced to perform unnatural and often painful acts . . . they would  quickly lose their appeal if the details of the animals' treatment,  confinement, training and 'retirement' became widely known." Thus People for  the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA) position paper on "Circuses: Three  Rings of Abuse," begins.  </P> <P> Besides spending much of their lives in cages, legally required to be only  large enough for the animals to stand and turn around, in transit the climatic  conditions around the country force the animals to face radical shifts of both  heat and cold (bears especially suffer from heat, lions from cold) that would  not normally be encountered under "free range" (natural) conditions. During the  off-season, animals may be kept in crates, barn stalls or trucks, as few  circuses desire to put much money into comfortable winter housing.  </P> <P> As for training, physical punishment is giving way to mental control to teach  entertaining "tricks." However, some animals are less adaptable to various  training techniques and are stressed enough to require drugging and tooth  removal in order to make them manageable. As for the "tricks" themselves, bears  balancing on balls, apes riding motorcycles, elephants standing on two legs --  are physically uncomfortable and behaviorally unnatural.  </P> <P> After the animals have outlived their usefulness, they are permanently kept in  winter housing, or, more likely, sold to other circuses, zoos, private  menageries, game farms (to be shot for recreation or "exotic" meat) or even  research laboratories. They spend the balance of their lives in confinement,  coercion and misery.  </P> <P> Overseas, animals in entertainment have been restricted or banned in several  countries, including Sweden and Denmark. In England, circuses with animal acts  are often denied public space.  </P> <P> CRAIG HUMPHREY  </P> <P> Advocate for Coalition  </P> <P> for Animal Rights; Experienced  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gregor Koebl, FRG consul general in Gdansk, </F> by correspondent Andrzej Palmirski; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Palmirski] Your previous post was with the  diplomatic mission to the Sultanate of Brunei, where the  national income per head of population is the highest in the  world. I will not ask you to make comparisons, although I am  sure plenty could be made, but to share with us your reflections  concerning our new role as a country aspiring to membership of  the free market.    [Koebl] It is true that Brunei is a very rich country, but  it is also quite small and situated as far from Poland as it is  from Germany. Poland, on the other hand, is a large country  which, together with France, is our closest and most important  neighbor. That is why I believe that, in these  post-German-unification days, my principal task in Szczecin will  be to keep highlighting the fact that Poland is a most important  partner for Germany.    Thus, I am facing a major opportunity to engage my talents  here, and the best thing about it is that it will not be routine  work. As soon as the Berlin Wall fell, we faced new challenges,  with the possibility of making new cross-border contacts, and  with entirely new expectations from the people living on the two  sides of the border. So I see it as my most important task in  Szczecin to bring about the realization of all these aspects of  our new neighborhood situation.    [Palmirski] The Odra-Nysa border is now the frontier line  between the European Union [EU] and Central Europe. What are  the chances of making sure that it will not become a dividing  line between a community of wealth and a community of poverty?    [Koebl] I hope that that sort of dividing line will be  abolished to the same extent that a similar line was abolished  between Germany and France. That particular division does not  exist any more. The whole process will, of course, take some  time, just as in the case of our own western border.    A significant impulse lending an impact to the  transformation  process was the association agreement between the EU and Poland  which, according to our intentions, will eventually lead to  Poland's full membership of the Union. This is something that  we are striving for on both sides.    Consequently, I hope that the dividing line between the  present EU and Poland will gradually disappear in the future,  and that Poland will enter more and more deeply into the Union's  structures until finally it becomes completely integrated with  the Union.    Many new initiatives are springing up nowadays from the  background of these concerns, and the authors of these  initiatives attempt to accelerate the whole process of  integration. I am thinking here of the campaigns to create new  Euroregions on both the Polish and German sides of the border....    [Palmirski] But the proposed "Pomerania" Euroregion appears  at the moment to be sunk in deep slumber. What impulses are  necessary to wake it up and bring it to life?    [Koebl] This will depend on both partners. Associations of  parishes which have expressed the wish to create the new  Euroregion have already been set up on both sides of the border.  Both these associations are sovereign structures and it is  entirely up to them when they decide to set a date for the  creation of the Pomerania Euroregion. Nevertheless, if there  are still some reservations on either side, we simply need more  time for these to disappear. Patience is sometimes also needed  in politics. It is just like in a good marriage: Before you  enter into the contract, you should first consider your  decisions very carefully, because the principle of the whole  thing is that the marriage should be indissoluble.    [Palmirski] Your predecessor in this post, Mr. Rainald  Roesch, rendered many services to the cause of Polish-German  cooperation. What, in your opinion, will be the main directions  of further cooperation?    [Koebl] It is the consul's brief during his mission to see  to the development of economic cooperation. There is no need  for me to dwell here on the more obvious consular concerns, such  as attention to the legal and administrative problems affecting  citizens who come into contact with us.    However, it appears that political contacts will be among  the  most important matters for us to deal with in this particular  borderland area. After all, because of the complete change in  the political situation after 1989, our partners appear in an  entirely new light to us. The fields of action mapped out by  the new pacts and treaties between Poland and the FRG are new,  too. We are still discovering many new things about each other  and we are still learning how to understand each other.    That is why I am very happy to have been so well received by  the political leaders in your voivodship, from the voivoda down.  [passage omitted]    [Palmirski] Would you now be so kind as to comment on the  case that keeps Everyone's emotions engaged: What is your  position concerning Zhirinovskiy's declarations about the  changes in European borders that he proposes to make?    [Koebl] That particular issue belongs in the world of big  politics. Everything pertaining to such concerns--and  especially when these involve current developments in Russia--is  within the competence of relevant figures at the Foreign  Ministry in Bonn rather than a "minor" figure such as the consul  in Szczecin. Consequently, I would prefer not to make any  statements on these questions--which is not to say that I do not  hold a personal opinion in these matters.... [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Opinions" column: "Why the Siege on the Port of </F> al-'Aqabah," by Mikha'il Jumay'an]    [Text] Anyone following the accelerating events in the  world and the Middle East, particularly after the United States  became the sole party that dominates the world and controls the  resources of the Third World states and peoples, and also after  the UN Security Council came under U.S. sovereignty and after  the United States made the Security Council peddle its policies,  carry out its orders, and achieve its numerous interests in the  world, he will paradoxically discover that there is no special  U.S. interest in imposing its authority on al-'Aqabah; rather,  the United States wants to serve Israeli interests and make  Israel the strongest state in the region.    To achieve this, the United States found in imposing a  strict  and firm siege on the port of al-'Aqabah a way to humiliate,  pressure, and force Jordan into signing a separate peace  agreement with Israel, which Jordan rejects in part and parcel.    Jordan has frequently reiterated that it rejects separate  and  partial solutions because these are not among its policies.  Jordan also said that the siege imposed by the U.S. Navy on its  sole port will not intimidate it, and that it absolutely rejects  this siege because it harms Jordan's national sovereignty,  dignity, and reputation. His Majesty King Husayn asserted that  Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace process hinges on  lifting the siege on the port of al-'Aqabah and immediately  addressing this totally unacceptable issue in a new way.    This siege has inflicted huge costs and grave economic  losses  on Jordanian importers and merchants. Hence, both the Jordanian  merchants and citizens sustain these losses as a result of  searching the ships carrying Jordan-bound merchandise on the  high sea rather than on the dock at al-'Aqabah port and also as  a result of diverting these ships to ports other than the port  of al-'Aqabah. This doubles the expenses and delays the transfer  of merchandise to their owners for several months. This  constitutes a service for Israel, the strategic ally of the  United States, and achieves Israel's objectives and expansionist  and settlement schemes in Palestine and the Arab homeland.    The visible practices on the ground since 1948 and the  series  of vetoes which the United States used at the Security Council  and in other international institutions constitute a service for  Israel, especially since the United States turns a blind eye to  the series of hideous crimes and massacres committed by the  Israeli Army and settlers, beginning with the Dayr Yasin,  Qibyah, and Sabra and Shatila massacres.    The United States is still pressuring Jordan and other Arab  states to lift the boycott of Israel, focusing particularly on  Jordan because it is the most important state in the region and  because of its stand on the Gulf war and its demand to find an  Arab solution to the Gulf crisis.    The United States has recently intensified its pressures on  Jordan due to the latter's position on Jerusalem and its  dissatisfaction with inserting the Jerusalem issue in Resolution  904 because Jerusalem was marginally mentioned in it and because  this resolution did not address the substantive issues  pertaining to Jerusalem in its capacity as being part of the  occupied Arab territories.    Moreover, Resolution 904 raised the Jewish voices calling  for  making Jerusalem Israel's eternal capital, knowing that Muslims  are the ones most entitled to protect the holy places because  Islam acknowledges both Judaism and Christianity as it came  after these two religions. Jerusalem is also a dear city for  the Hashemites, Muslims, and all Arabs, including Christian  Arabs. It is the place from which Prophet Muhammad ascended to  heaven and the cradle of Jesus Christ, so protecting it is an  Arab and Islamic right that cannot be relinquished no matter how  dear the price may be.</p>

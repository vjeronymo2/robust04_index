			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Austria's top brewer to raise Sch1.9bn BRAU Beteiligungs (BBAG), Austria's leading brewery group, is seeking to raise Sch1.9bn (Dollars 160.5m) through a rights issue for itself and a warrant rights issue for its main subsidiary, Brau Union. The group, which dominates the Austrian beer market with a share of more than 60 per cent, has also disclosed first-half consolidated pre-tax profit of Sch323m, up from Sch169m last year. All but Sch37m of the rise came from property and share sales. BBAG, one of Europe's largest brewing groups with annual output of over 8m hectolitres of beer, has undergone a restructuring in the past year, simplifying a complex web of cross-holdings among Austrian brewers. Two main sub-groups, both quoted on the Vienna Borse, have emerged. Brau Union, in which BBAG has a 66 per cent stake, holds all the group's brewing interests, both in Austria and in eastern Europe. BBAG itself bottles soft drinks, mineral waters and fruit juices. BBAG's first-half consolidated sales were up 5 per cent to Sch5.2bn. Mr Christian Beurle, chief executive, forecast at a press conference that pre-tax profit would rise 19 per cent to Sch550m in the full year. Proceeds from the rights issues are to be used for financing expansion opportunities in eastern Europe. Both issues are on the basis of one new share for every five held. Prices will be struck on September 30. The BBAG issue is a conventional one, with a two-week exercise period. The Brau Union issue will run for six months from October 22. 'It is really a rights issue disguised as a warrant,' Mr Walter Schuster, deputy director of capital markets at GiroCredit Bank, said. Mr Schuster, who conceived the idea, said the problem was that both companies wanted to raise new capital, and their plan was for BBAG to go to the market this year and Brau Union a year later.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Data show girls outperforming boys Girls' schools are racing ahead of boys' schools in exam performance and girls are outperforming boys in mixed-sex schools, suggesting that equal opportunities should be turned on its head in education - boys, not girls, seem to need the most help. An FT analysis of the government's league tables appears to confirm that boys underachieve most in socially deprived areas and in non-selective schools. In GCSEs and vocational qualifications unacademic boys appear to have far weaker chances than girls of getting the basic qualifications needed for a job. This appears to strengthen claims that the UK faces social problems caused by the emergence of a large number of underqualified men who will have difficulty finding jobs. Except in independent schools, girls appear to be significantly ahead at A-level, offering them a better chance of higher university qualifications. Girls' schools had been expected to outperform boys' schools at GCSE, following the strong results announced by independent girls' schools in September. Of the 97 schools which according to the government managed to win five GCSEs of at least a grade C for 100 per cent of their pupils, 58 are for girls only, while only 13 are boys only. Analysis by the FT of average performance shows that in every sector girls' schools managed to achieve five GCSEs or more for far more of their pupils than boys' schools. Most worryingly for those who fear the emergence of a large group of underqualified and unskilled men, the gap is widest in non-selective schools. In secondary moderns, which exist in only a few parts of the country for children who fail the exams for grammar schools at either 11 or 12, an average of 34 per cent of girls managed five GCSE grade Cs, compared to only 21 per cent of boys. At comprehensives the disparity was almost as big - 44 per cent to 34 per cent. Less academic boys appear to be underachieving more seriously. This partly reflects educationalists' claims that selective schools have always had to take into account that girls are more able than boys at 11, and set higher pass marks for girls than for boys. The gap is comparatively narrow in selective schools, where academic boys have been creamed off, with girls' grammars managing 89 per cent to 87 per cent from boys' schools. In independent schools - predominantly more selective than maintained schools - the gap was 83 per cent against 75 per cent, in opted-out schools the gap was 71 per cent to 64 per cent, while in local authority schools, which tend to include those with the highest levels of deprivation, it was 52 per cent to 34 per cent. The superiority of girls' schools at 16 is not only academic, as they appear to be providing pupils with more vocational training as well. At local authority maintained girls' schools, 37 per cent of 16-year-olds take vocational courses, compared with 35 per cent at boys' schools. At grant maintained schools the disparity is 53 per cent to 28 per cent, while at independent schools it is 46 per cent to 34 per cent. Unacademic boys are not, therefore, being offered vocational passports to a job instead. Girls are more likely to show the necessary discipline to win a skill-based qualification. At A-level the picture is more mixed, with academic boys streamed into boys' independent and grammar schools doing slightly better than their counterparts at girls' schools. At independent schools those entering two or more A-levels could expect to win 20.62 A-level points, compared with 19.57 at girls' schools. At local authority maintained schools, however, girls' school pupils tended to get one A-level grade more than those at boys' schools, averaging 14.53 points compared with 12.61. These figures tally with overall data for pupils at both single-sex and mixed schools produced by the National Consortium of Exam Results for the BBC's Panorama programme last month. These showed girls marginally overtaking boys at A-level this year for the first time. According to the consortium's figures, girls' average point score per A-level exam was 4.8, compared with 4.7 for boys. In 1991 girls lagged, with 4.1 to 4.2. GCSE revealed a much wider disparity, with girls managing a C grade or better in 51 per cent of the subjects entered, compared with 41.4 per cent for boys. This was the second year running that a disparity on this scale was recorded, even though the coursework content of GCSEs - thought to favour girls - had been reduced. Individual subject entries revealed even wider disparities. In English 62 per cent of girls managed at least a grade, compared with 43.3 per cent of boys. There was a similar gap in French, passed by 48 per cent of girls and 31.2 per cent of boys. Boys held advantages in traditionally masculine subjects, but they were minimal - science GCSE was passed by 44 per cent of boys, compared to 43.6 per cent of girls, while in maths 41 per cent of boys and 40.08 per cent of girls managed a grade C. Professor Michael Barber, of Keele University's Centre for Successful Schools, disagrees with the theory that there is a 'glass ceiling' women cannot break. He said: 'When this batch of girls is in young adulthood they will break that ceiling and go far. What we really need to do now is address boys' underperformance in literacy.'</p>

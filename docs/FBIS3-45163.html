			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] The Vatican will establish formal diplomatic ties  with the PRC but will maintain its current ties with Taiwan, a  high- ranking Vatican official has said. The official's  statement was reported on semi-official radio in Taiwan, but  neither the official's name or rank was given.    A reporter asked the Reverend (Hsu Ying-fa), the secretary  general of the Catholic Bishop's Office in the ROC [Republic of  China], to comment on the report. (Hsu) said: The Vatican has  plans to establish formal ties with the People's Republic, but  the Vatican Parliament has also promised the Bishop's Office in  Taiwan that it would not cut its ties with any country,  including Taiwan. (Hsu's) office was not surprised when it heard  of the news. (Hsu) said the ROC Government should not worry too  much about the Vatican's decision. However, it was possible  that the Vatican would assign an ambassador to Mainland China  and a representative to Taiwan for future contact.</p>

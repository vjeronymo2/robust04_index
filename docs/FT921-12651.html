			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Humphreys quits at Saatchi Advertising Mr Richard Humphreys has resigned as chief executive of Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Worldwide (SSAW), the group's flagship international advertising network, less than six months after he was promoted to the job as part of a corporate reorganisation. Mr Humphreys' departure is understood to have followed differences with Mr Ed Wax, chairman of SSAW, and impatience on the part of Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of the Saatchi group, with the speed of cost-cutting at the financially-troubled network. A spokesman said Mr Humphreys' departure was part of a group-wide attack on costs intended to restore profitability following Saatchi's capital restructuring last year. Mr Wax has been named chief executive as well as chairman of SSAW.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: United Tech to cut costs UNITED Technologies, the US aerospace, automotive and building products group, is expected to announce details today of a major restructuring, designed to cut Dollars 1bn from the group's costs. UTC, which has been hard hit by the US recession and the Pentagon's declining defence equipment budget, will also announce losses for the fourth quarter and full 1991 year. UTC announced last November that it would have to take a large restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a programme to cut Dollars 1bn from annual costs by the end of 1993, and that this would push into losses both for the quarter and the year. Analysts are speculating that the move could involve major reorganisation at its Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine business, which has already introduced a voluntary severance and retirement programme.</p>

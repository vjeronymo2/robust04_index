			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: US hospital group to pay Dollars 2bn for rival National Medical Enterprises, one of the biggest US hospital groups, is to pay nearly Dollars 2bn in cash and stock for American Medical, another large hospital chain. The deal comes just a week after National Medical lost out to Columbia/HCA, the US's biggest hospital company, in a Dollars 3.5bn bidding war for HealthTrust, which owns 116 hospitals. The purchase of American Medical, if completed, will leave National Medical with 71 large acute-care hospitals and annual sales which it predicts next year will reach Dollars 5.3bn, compared with Dollars 15bn in the merged Columbia/HCA and HealthTrust. The proposed acquisition comes a year after National Medical was almost brought to its knees by allegations of fraud and abuse of patients in its psychiatric hospitals, which have since been sold. The deal, which echoes the three multi-billion-dollar takeovers engineered by Columbia/HCA in the past 18 months, is intended in part to reduce costs by increasing the enlarged group's bargaining power with hospital supply companies. It also reflects the growing importance of large institutional buyers of healthcare, such as health maintenance organisations. National Medical is paying Dollars 1.46bn in cash, and stock valued yesterday at Dollars 496m. The cash will come from bank borrowing and a bond issue, the company said. Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street firm, has supplied the company with a letter stating that it is 'highly confident' it can raise the bond finance - a technique common in the 1980s, when junk bond finance became a significant element in many takeovers. The use of such letters has re-emerged as a tool in US takeovers this year, most notably in the Dollars 2.7bn agreed offer by Conseco, an insurer, for financial services group Kemper, which was supported by a 'highly confident' letter from Morgan Stanley. That financing, however, has looked increasingly shaky in recent weeks. Conseco, at first said it would finance a larger part of the bid by selling assets, so reducing the junk bond portion. However, last week it filed to issue convertible bonds, a move taken as a sign the asset sales were not proceeding smoothly.</p>

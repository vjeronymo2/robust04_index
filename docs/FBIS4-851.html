			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norman Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 18 SAPA -- Trilateral talks between  the government, the African National Congress and the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] temporarily ended in Pretoria just after 3  PM on Monday (today) without any clear indication whether  progress had been made to include kwaZulu in the constitutional  process.    The talks were held at the Union Buildings between President  F. W. de Klerk, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Cyril  Ramaphosa, secretary general of the ANC.    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said after  the meeting the talks would be continued later on Monday or on  Tuesday. Mr Meyer, who refused to be drawn on whether he was  optimistic, said the discussions concerned the country's future.    All parties had expressed their concern about the situation  in South Africa and all were looking for solutions, Mr Meyer  added. He said the talks were at a sensitive stage.    Emerging from the Union Buildings, Mr Ramaphosa said: "We  are dealing with a very sensitive matter as you all know and  we're trying to see...What is possible."    Mr Ramaphosa was accompanied by SA [South African] Communist  Party National Chairman Joe Solo. It is believed the talks were  broken off in the afternoon to allow Mr de Klerk to attend a  pre- arranged meeting with Pan-Africanist Congress President  Clarence Makwetu.</p>

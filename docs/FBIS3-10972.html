			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Supreme Court President Mauricio Gutierrez Castro  today accused Justice Minister Rene Hernandez Valiente and  Nelson Segovia, the director of Salvadoran Legal Studies, of  playing into the hands of the U.S. Embassy, which, according to  Gutierrez, seeks judicial reforms even though they violate the  nation's sovereignty.    [Begin Gutierrez Castro] I will be very satisfied no matter  who becomes president of the [Supreme] Court as long as that  court president serves the country and not a foreign nation.  [end recording]    According to the Supreme Court president, Hernandez Valiente  and Nelson Segovia are at the service of the U.S. Government  which seeks major reforms to the judicial system. Reforms, such  as those to the penal codes, remarked Justice Gutierrez, have  been criticized by nationals as the nation's autonomy is lost.  This harms the nation, the justice noted.    [Begin Gutierrez Castro recording] Mr. Segovia makes up part  of the group of attorneys linked none other than to the nation's  financial sector; besides, he has extremely good relations with  the U.S. Embassy in our country. Now as far as Mr. Rene  Hernandez Valiente is concerned, there is nothing more to say.  His work has been limited to implementing the laws paid for by  the U.S. Government. [end recording]    Mr. Gutierrez Castro is currently seeking to be reelected as  a Supreme Court magistrate. He noted that his candidacy is in  response to attorneys' support, but most of all because [words  indistinct] judicial system's independence could be lost.    [Begin Gutierrez Castro recording] I feel that the Judicial  Branch's independence is in danger; this is why I am running.  It is not simply to seek reelection. This could or could not  happen. [end recording]    The Supreme Court president once again received  demonstrations of support for his reelection by the BAR  association in Ahuachapan Department. On 12 March, more than  2,000 attorneys will participate in elections to choose the 42  candidates for justices.</p>

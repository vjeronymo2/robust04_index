			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian jute faces stiff challenge The Indian jute mill industry, which always has enjoyed a high level of protection from the federal and state governments, fears that it is going to lose a large part of the domestic packaging market to synthetic materials following a recent revision of the duty structure. The excise duty on traditional jute products like hessian, sacking and yarn has gone up by 112 per cent with the government changing the levy from a fixed Rs760 (Pounds 16.30) a tonne to 10 per cent ad valorem. At the same time, the duty on synthetic bags has been reduced by 5 per cent to 30 per cent. In addition the customs duty on polypropylene granules, the raw material for synthetic bags, has been cut by 10 per cent to 65 per cent. The duty on synthetic packaging material had always been kept high to give protection to jute. According to the officials of the Indian Jute Mills Association, following the duty revision, the price of a jute laminated bag has gone up from Rs11.50 to Rs15 while that of a synthetic bag has fallen from Rs8 to Rs7.75. As a result, the fertiliser industry, which packs nearly 50 per cent of its production in synthetic bags is expected to reduce further the use of laminated jute bags. In the meantime, the cement manufacturers, responding the demand of consumers and lower prices of synthetic bags, have almost given up jute bags. This is in spite of a government order, introduced in 1987, that cement should only be packed in jute bags. The order also says that the principal packing material for fertiliser should be jute. But the federal government has let it be known that 'jute will not be given protection for ever' and the user industries should have the freedom to decide which packing material to use. IJMA officials, who have been able to enlist the support of the government of West Bengal, will entreat the federal government to restore the old duty structure so that jute does not lose any more of the domestic market. According to them, 'jute deserves special treatment since it supports over 4m farmer families and over 225,000 jute mill workers'. After the setback in the cement and fertiliser sectors, the mainstay for jute packaging material is foodgrains and sugar. But it is feared that once sugar is packed in 50 kg - the International Labour Organisation made a recommendation to this effect a long time ago - synthetics may become the preferred packaging material for sugar. As synthetic bags cannot hold 100 kg of sugar, the commodity is now exclusively packed in jute bags. While the industry was facing a crisis in the domestic market, its exports in the nine months to December 1993 rose to 158,024 from 137,778 tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous year. Export earnings from jute goods during the period increased to Rs2.77bn from Rs2.37bn.</p>

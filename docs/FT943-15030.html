			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Lilley acts on 'benefits tourism' The government yesterday announced that it was stopping the payment of three social security benefits to citizens of the European Economic Area on temporary visits to the UK. From August 1 people from the EEA - the European Union plus the Efta countries - will have to prove that they are habitually resident in the UK to claim income support, housing benefit or council tax benefit. These means-tested benefits are paid to people on low incomes as a form of 'safety net'. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the measures would bring an end to 'benefits tourism' - the use of the social security system to finance stays in Britain. 'In recent summers we have seen a growing number of European nationals taking advantage of the accessibility of our benefit system to spend a few months in Britain at the taxpayer's expense,' Mr Lilley said. Entitlement to these benefits was stopped for most people from outside the EEA in April. A series of court hearings involving foreigners who had abused the benefits system enraged Tory MPs and led Mr Lilley to promise action at last year's Conservative party conference. Mr Lilley did not know how many from the EEA were involved in benefit tourism. 'It is probably quite small, a few thousands at the start. But if we were not to close this loophole it would grow.' There would be no restrictions on freedom of movement, he said. People from the EEA would still be welcome to seek work in Britain and would be paid contributory benefits such as unemployment benefit if they already received it in their own country. Mr Lilley said that the measure would close a loophole, the existence of which amazed other European countries. He added: 'Most other European countries do not permit this kind of behaviour and neither should we.' The German Family Ministry in Bonn - responsible for sustenance payouts under the country's social security system - pointed out that Germany, too, was sometimes the target of foreigners seeking to profit from generous benefit payments. Needy people can claim living allowance benefits of DM1,100 (Pounds 458) a month. It is not limited to those with residence permits. Non-Germans qualify only if they convince local social security offices that they did not travel to Germany specifically to claim allowances. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, had serious reservations about the government's approach. 'Any reform must be based upon proper research and effectively target those responsible for abuse,' he said. 'The government must demonstrate that the new regulations are fair and workable.'</p>

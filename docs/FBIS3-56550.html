According to the preliminary figures of the Central  Electoral  Commission, the largest number of votes -- around 542,000 or  approximately 38.5 percent -- went to Yuriy Meshkov, the  candidate from the Republican Party of Crimea which belongs to  the "Russia" electoral bloc. In second place, with about 17  percent, is Nikolay Bahrov, an independent candidate and  chairman of the Supreme Soviet. These two will run in the  second round of voting which will be held in two weeks' time --  on 30 January.    None of the commentators expected such a success for Yuriy  Meshkov. His rating in independent polls varied from 19 to 20  percent, in contrast to which the rating of Leonid Hrach, the  Communist Party of Crimea candidate, reached 40 percent whereas  in fact he was supported by just 12.5 percent of the voters.    Meshkov, age 48, is a well-known political figure in Crimea.  His mother is Ukrainian, his father is Russian. He graduated  from Moscow University's Law Faculty. He worked as an  investigator and a lawyer. He is a people's deputy and  coordinator of the "Republic" deputies' group in the Crimean  Supreme Soviet and a founder and chairman of the Republican  Movement which later became the Republican Party of Crimea.    The main planks of his election platform are as follows:  Lifting the moratorium on the referendum on the status of  Crimea, the law on which was adopted by the Crimean parliament  on the initiative of and under pressure from Meshkov and his  comrades. He believes that the positive results of the  referendum and Crimea's acquisition of state independence will  make it possible to restore the republic's union with Russia.  Meshkov intends to restore Crimea to the ruble area, give the  inhabitants of the republic the right to dual citizenship,  preserve a free medical service and education, and lead the  fight against crime mainly by stepping up the penalties for all  offenses. Meshkov advocates Russian status for Sevastopol and  abolition of the act of 1954 [which transferred Crimea to the  Ukraine]. He believes that the Black Sea Fleet must belong to  Russia. Meshkov is against giving the Crimean Tatars a quota of  deputies' seats in the future parliament of the autonomous  formation.    Sergey Shuvaynikov, the Russian Party candidate supported by  Zhirinovskiy, received 13.5 percent.    The results of the first stage of the elections in Crimea  will undoubtedly provide food for thought for many people, and  not only in Ukraine. Should they be viewed as the Crimeans'  desire for a radical change in Crimea's status and state  allegiance? Or is this just a protest against the general  crisis in society which spontaneously developed into a vote  against the man in power who personifies Ukraine more than  Crimea itself? Kiev, meanwhile, can use the differences in  Crimean and Ukrainian law to declare the elections unlawful and  annul the results.</p>

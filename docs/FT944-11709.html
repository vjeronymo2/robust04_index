			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise Computer Enterprise Computer Holdings, which incurred losses of Pounds 2m last year and saw revenues fall from Pounds 58m to Pounds 16.4m after extensive restructuring, said it was still in discussions with its banks over its future. The company had warned in September that its viability would be in doubt if bankers refused to renew its lines of credit. The company added that its two banks had agreed to extend the company's facilities until the end of December while a range of possibilities for restructuring the company's finances were examined. Enterprise, originally a seller of used mainframe computers, has been repositioning itself in computing services but the change has been more difficult than expected.</p>

With the  approaching deadline, however, Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks remain deadlocked.    Growing economic friction between Japan and the United  States  will be more injurious than beneficial not only to the two  countries, but to the entire world. We hope that the two  countries will view the situation calmly and continue to make  maximum efforts to address the bilateral trade imbalance.    Treasury Secretary Bentsen, who was on a tour of Asian  nations, abruptly stopped in Japan at President Clinton's  request, and his surprise visit to Japan reflected deep concern  the United States has over the deadlock in the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks.    Treasury Secretary Bentsen met separately with Prime  Minister  Hosokawa and Finance Minister Fujii on 23 January. During the  meetings, he asked the Japanese Government to work for fruitful  trade agreements and take aggressive fiscal measures to expand  domestic demand. Speaking at a news conference, he hinted at the  possibility of reviewing the basis for the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks, saying, "If agreements hammered out at the  economic framework are inadequate, it would be better not to  hold such talks."    At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, both sides have  agreed to treat government procurement, insurance, and  automobile-auto parts as priority sectors and they have worked  to reach agreements on the priority sectors by 11 February when  Japan-U.S. summit talks are held. The United States still asks  for setting numerical targets as an objective criteria to  measure how wide the Japanese market is open. Treasury Secretary  Bentsen confirmed the U.S. request in his statement.    In response, Japan has persistently refused to accept the  U.S. demand for setting the numerical targets since last autumn  when the first round of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  was held, arguing that "setting such numerical targets will lead  to managed trade." The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have  made almost little progress from the "beginning."    It is hard to understand the method of setting numerical  targets one by one in advance in order to promote market  opening. Asian and European nations are guarding against the  possibility of Japan and the United States tying up to shut  third nations out of the Japanese market.    Setting targets for the expansion of the trade of individual  items is a matter to be judged independently by enterprises. A  government should not step into that matter. Prominent American  economists have sent their letters to leaders of Japan and the  Untied States, arguing against setting such numerical targets.  Perhaps, they have been motivated by the above rationale.    As for access by individual sectors to the Japanese market,  how about assessing Japan's imports six months or a year after  it takes bold measures to stimulate its economy?    The United States has stuck to its demand for setting the  numerical targets because of a "successful example" in the  Japan- U.S. Semiconductor Agreement under which Japan is said to  have committed itself to a 20 percent of market share. If Japan  is in recession, its enterprises would be unable to meet such  numerical targets. This foolish arrangement should not be  repeated.    What is most important in order to avert a showdown between  Japan and the United States over individual sectors is for Japan  to speedily decide on stimulus measures. If Japan further delays  taking the stimulus measures, it would undermine its  international trustworthiness. To that end, it should carry out  political reform at the earliest date.    Prime Minister Hosokawa should display his leadership in and  make decisions on cutting the income tax prior to raising the  consumption tax, compiling a budget for fiscal 1994 with  priority given to the improved livelihood of people, taking  monetary measures and tax incentives to spur land transactions  and enforcing deregulation in ways that it generates immediate  effects. The prime minister should make urgent efforts to spread  a transparent tender system not only for public works projects,  but for government procurement.    Japan should remove barriers to its market, while trying to  recover its economy steadily whereas the United States should  strengthen efforts to develop and manufacture goods that are  salable on the Japanese market. The two countries should keep  this principle in mind.</p>

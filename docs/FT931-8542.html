			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (8): Overlapping umbrellas - Andrew Bolger inspects the anatomy of an Anglo-Dutch deal THE TAX benefits of a large international deal are seldom quantified directly, so the merger between Reed International of the UK and Reed Elsevier of the Netherlands was an interesting exception. The merged group, which with a market value of about Pounds 6bn is one of the world's biggest publishers, said the merger would cut its effective tax rate by up to one percentage point a year. Given that the combined companies made estimated pre-tax profits of Pounds 424m last year, that is not an insignificant saving. Two of the people most involved in structuring tax aspects of the deal were William Harrison-Cripps and Nicholas Hughes, both partners in Price Waterhouse, although both emphasised that the commercial aims were set by the clients. Harrison-Cripps, head of European M&amp;A tax services, said: 'I think what we ended up with - which is pretty well what we put to them on the back of a fag-packet - is a long way different from what they had in mind at the very early stages, but that is fairly normal.' He added: 'What we were talking about was what would be the ideal commercial structure, if we could achieve it fiscally. Tax must never drive it.' The merger, which took effect on January 1, was on a 50-50 basis, without any premium or cash payment to either set of shareholders, and both Reed and Elsevier kept separate stock market listings. Reed was granted a 5.8 per cent cross-holding in Elsevier, to reflect the UK group's larger capitalisation. Although Anglo-Dutch mergers are inevitably compared with early link-ups such as Unilever and Royal Dutch/Shell, Harrison-Cripps said: 'I specifically told them that they did not have to live only with a Shell-type structure. If we had been putting together Shell today, we would have done it differently.' Harrison-Cripps strongly opposed the parallel company structure with two parallel operational streams, and complex mirror boards. He said: 'Over time  -and this is nothing to do with tax - you are looking at how quickly you can bring together and harmonise the two structures. The perception of working for the umbrella organisation is quite a powerful thing, and not to be passed over lightly.' Hughes said: 'You can look at the Reed/Elsevier structure and show it is not totally dissimilar from the Royal Dutch/Shell and the Unilever structures, but better because there is more flexibility on how you can set the dividends and you've got a company in the middle that gives strong operational control, and you can still get the money tax-efficiently to shareholders.' Close examination of the combined group's structure illustrates two of the deal's most important features: operating subsidiaries will be grouped under a UK holding company, Reed Elsevier, while finance subsidiaries come under Elsevier Reed Finance, a Dutch company which enjoys the continental European freedom to put money into a tax haven and earn tax-free interest on it. Harrison-Cripps said: 'It is not some underhand trick to deprive the UK Exchequer - actually, quite the contrary: we could have had the choice of bringing nothing to the UK Exchequer, because the whole lot was destined to go to an overseas country. 'Our task had to be to set something up and convince people that it was right and still proper for us to have a UK holding company and still allow the group as a whole to have these benefits which we would have had anyway if we had set it up as a Dutch holding company. In other words, to put us as a country on an equal footing.' Other notable features are that the values of the two groups were equalised without the use of cash, without any capital gains tax being due, and money can be remitted to Dutch shareholders without incurring any Advanced Corporation Tax. Hughes said: 'If we couldn't have solved these problems, then the deal would not have happened.' Price Waterhouse worked on the tax problems with Freshfields and Linklaters, legal advisers to Reed and Elsevier respectively, and their merchant bankers, SG Warburg and Swiss Bank. Harrison-Cripps said: 'The most interesting thing for us was our early involvement in the transaction. What all of us had been trying to defeat, which had been fairly traditional in the accountancy profession, was that you learned about something in the press - and then you might be lucky to get a crumb or two from the table.' Even having achieved that, Hughes said the question of who was in control was always an issue when a team was involved. 'We can work effectively in a corporate team with other players, such as Freshfields. The competitive element is that the lawyers might say that they can do all of the work, including the tax, but they don't have same international representation.' The merger cost between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m in advisers' and listings fees, reflecting the fact that the enlarged group operates in 43 countries. Harrison-Cripps is in no doubt that his team's tax work was worth 'an infinite amount' to Reed and Elsevier, relative to Price Waterhouse's fee of less than Pounds 2m. 'They will have had a payback within a month or so, in terms of the tax saving and the fact that the merged group works.'</p>

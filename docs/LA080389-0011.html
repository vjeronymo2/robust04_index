			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JONES' COLUMN  </P> <P> I write magazine articles for a living, and nothing delights me more than to  find good writing -- writing that transcends reporting -- in the news media.  </P> <P> The feature articles that you run on the front page, left-hand column, are  consistently good.The writers take obscure subjects (such as where artists live  in Los Angeles) and make them interesting.  </P> <P> But the high point of my week is the new column, "On California," written by  Robert A. Jones. Whether he's talking about real estate or a football team,  Jones is concise, entertaining and insightful.  </P> <P> DEBRA BALDWIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: NEC to increase business with Bull NEC, the Japanese electronics company, is to nearly triple its transactions with Bull, in a move to support the lossmaking French computer company's financial and business position. NEC said that trading with Bull, which is a subsidiary of the French state-owned Groupe Bull was being raised from an annual Y6bn to Y7bn to just under Y20bn (Dollars 192m) in the current fiscal year. As part of the increase in business between the two companies, NEC is expected to supply Bull with telecommunications equipment and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches for digital transmissions in order to support the French company's operations in Europe. ATM switches, which support multimedia communications, are relatively new in Europe and could provide Bull with a head start in this area, NEC said. Bull, in turn, will provide NEC with software for networks, and other systems. NEC currently supplies Bull with mainframe computers on an original equipment manufacture basis. The decision to increase mutual business comes as Bull has been seeking to refinance its operations. NEC also recently agreed to develop mainframe and middle-range computers with Bull, in which it owns a 4.43 per cent stake.</p>

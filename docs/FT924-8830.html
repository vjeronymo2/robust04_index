			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Spanish Bonds: Challenge of primary market reopening MR Manuel Conthe, director-general of the Spanish treasury, sees the reopening of the primary market for medium and long-term debt as an important challenge for his department. Mr Conthe, who pioneered longer-dated debt instruments, watched them flourish and then fall in popularity with international investors as Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty prompted foreigners - the chief buyers of Spanish long bonds - to switch out of the high-yielding European bond markets into the D-Mark zone. As a result, the Spanish treasury, unable to sell long-dated bonds, was forced to issue short-term paper instead. Spain was one of the countries to suffer from the bout of currency speculation which hit Europe's weaker members in September. The government devalued the peseta and came under attack for temporarily re-introducing exchange restrictions. Mr Conthe believes that stability has returned at last. Faced with a growing deficit and hemmed in by a tough repayment schedule, he wants to start issuing three, five and 10-year bonds again. His problem, and hence the challenge, is that the market seems to have forgotten about Spain's medium and long-term issues of six months ago as doubts linger over whether stability really has returned. Last month, the government tested the market's appetite at the first treasury auction to deal in medium and long-term primary debt since May 28. Only a small amount of paper was allotted, but it did serve as an indicator for what the market can expect at the next auction, on November 25. 'Essentially the primary market was put in line with the secondary one,' says Mr Alvaro Villacieros, of James Capel's securities house in Madrid. At the October 29 auction, three-year paper yielded 13.20 per cent, the five-year bonds 12.92 per cent, and the 10-year bonds 12.50 per cent. A total of Pta11.4bn was allotted, with the treasury pointing the market towards lower yields. An auction for three-month and six-month paper last week showed just how inverted the yield curve has become. A total of Pta334bn was allotted, with the three-month paper yielding 13.214 per cent and six-month paper 13.41 per cent. Mr Robert Barry, of Barclays, points out that 10-year Spanish bonds now yield 533 basis points over comparable German issues - 'a generous premium by anyone's standard'. In common with other dealers, he believes it may still be 'perhaps a little early' to come into the market. Foreigners are wary of the currency risk and the broadly-based anticipation of a second devaluation is spurred by outbursts of pressure on the peseta as it lies close to its ERM floor. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Governor of the Bank of Spain, argues that the peseta's depreciation against the D-Mark and the dollar makes any further devaluation unnecessary. Earlier comments by Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, suggested that the peseta will be pegged down as part of a general realignment of the ERM timed to coincide with the lira's return. In the absence of further currency turmoil, foreigners may be tempted back to the market. At least, that is what the treasury is hoping. In January alone, the treasury will be required to refinance Pta2.3bn worth of debt as the short-term paper of the past months matures. Once that hurdle is over an easing of interest rates could be on line.</p>

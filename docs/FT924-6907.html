			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Canada warning on drug exports CANADA'S generic drugs industry has warned that the sale of cheap medicines to developing countries will be imperilled if a proposed law to tighten patent protection for brand-name pharmaceuticals is passed. The warning is part of action by the industry against a bill, C-91, introduced in parliament in Ottawa this week. It will extend the same 20-year patent protection to medicines as applies to other products, fulfilling Canada's pledges under the Uruguay Round trade talks. It means the end of a 23-year 'compulsory licensing' system which has allowed cheap, generic medicines to be distributed within a few years of the brand-name products. Compulsory licensing has made Canada's generic industry one of the world's biggest. The industry is angry that Bill C-91, soon likely to become law, will be retroactive to last December. This provision would nullify pending compulsory licensing applications on about 35 products. An official at Apotex, the largest generic producer, said the new licensing curbs would hamper exports, a quarter of the company's total output. Apotex sells to 80 countries. It says many developing nations follow Ottawa's lead in approving medicines for sale. 'If we're not licensed to sell it in Canada, we can't export it.' The industry contends that by delaying introduction of their products, the new law will raise drug costs. Ontario's Drug Benefit Plan, giving free medicines to aged and welfare recipients, estimates generic products save it CDollars 80m-CDollars 100m (Pounds 42m-Pounds 52m) a year.</p>

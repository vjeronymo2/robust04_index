			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reuters shares fall as delays hit Globex SHARES IN Reuters Holdings closed down 39p at Pounds 11.86p yesterday after a technical problem forced the financial information and news company to postpone a test of Globex, its screen-based system for trading futures and options. Reuters said the problem was encountered at an early stage of Tuesday's test of 250 key stations in Chicago, London and Paris. The test would be rescheduled after analysis of the difficulty, which is believed to have been caused by a bug in the software. Globex is being created jointly by Reuters with the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and is to be launched later this year. Reuters is still expected to launch soon the long-delayed second phase of Dealing 2000, its automated trading system which enables foreign exchange traders to complete transactions on-screen. Reuters shares have risen strongly since the group last month reported a 6.3 per cent rise to Pounds 340.3m in annual profits, in spite of weak conditions in its traditional markets.</p>

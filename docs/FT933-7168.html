			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / French suspend overnight rate THE Bank of France yesterday pushed interest rates nearer to levels that prevailed before the recent currency crisis by reducing the cost of lending wholesale cash overnight for the fifth time in two weeks. The cut in the central bank's 24-hour rate, from 8.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent, was accompanied by a large injection of cash in the French money market. Later, the 24-hour rate was suspended, in a move which some analysts saw as a further indication that monetary policy was being eased. These moves followed several trading days which have seen the French franc appreciate sharply against the D-Mark inside the more relaxed European exchange rate mechanism. The cut in French rates was accompanied by indications that central banks in the ERM may be relaxing the high interest rate policy which has kept their currencies strong against the D-Mark. The Danish central bank yesterday cut its 14-day certificate of deposit rate by half a percentage point to 10.5 per cent, its first easing of monetary policy since the ERM bands were widened. Both the peseta and the escudo depreciated as dealers took the view that their central banks could cut interest rates ahead of this week's Bundesbank council meeting, the first since the summer recess. Officials at the Bank of France said the suspension of the 24-hour rate, introduced at the end of last month to control liquidity and support the French franc within the ERM, was a technical move. It reflected increased liquidity in the money market and the fall of short-term money market rates to near pre-crisis levels of 7.25 per cent. But economists said the central bank also wanted to signal that the pressures facing the currency had eased. The franc took the move in its stride, closing a little weaker at FFr3.485, against FFr3.478. Most currency analysts believed it remained vulnerable. They said the foreign exchange markets were expecting cuts in the intervention rate, which provides a floor for money market rates and stands at 6.75 per cent, and the 5-10 day borrowing rate, which stands at 10 per cent. The timing of reductions in French interest rates will depend on the Bundesbank's council meeting. If it decides on a cut in German rates this would allow France to trim its intervention rate, perhaps by as early as next Monday. However, unchanged German rates could lead to renewed pressures on the franc. Investors are eager for further rate cuts in France to help revive the economy and are not particularly concerned with any impact on inflation. The inflation figures for July, released yesterday by Insee, the national statistics institute, supported this view. The figures confirmed that consumer prices rose by just 0.1 per cent in July, compared with June, and that annualised inflation at the end of last month was down to 2.1 per cent.</p>

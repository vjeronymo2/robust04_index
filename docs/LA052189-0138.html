			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING HEALTHY: PACK LIGHT AND LOOSE FOR PROTECTION FROM A TROPICAL SUN  </P> <P> When packing for a cruise in the tropics, don't just pack for fashion. Pack for  protection. The sun can do damage to skin unaccustomed to too much of it.  </P> <P> This is especially important in late winter and early spring when protective  tans from the previous summer are gone. Then, even half an hour of morning or  late-afternoon sun can result in a burn.  </P> <P> Sunburn is the most common condition treated by ships' physicians. This is  because on a cruise, a good portion of time spent in the sun is spent near the  water. Because sun reflects off water the rays can come at you from all angles,  thus increasing your sun exposure. Using sunscreens and wearing sunglasses  helps, as does wearing the correct clothing.  </P> <P> Consider the weave of the fabric and the color of the material. The garments  most travelers pack, items light in color and wide in weave, often are least  suitable for tropical cruises. Such fabrics do not offer adequate protection.  </P> <P> Dyed fabric generally blocks more ultraviolet rays than undyed, and the thicker  the fabric, the better the protection.  </P> <P> As a test, hold garments up to a light bulb before you pack them. The more  opaque the better. If the garment allows too much light through, it may permit  an unhealthy amount of ultraviolet light to reach the skin, according to the  University of California, Berkeley, Wellness Letter.  </P> <P> But it's not just the pain of sunburn that should be of concern. Recent  research suggests that a rapidly acquired sunburn may suppress your immune  system and cause skin infections or cold sores by activating latent viruses.  </P> <P> Tightly woven cottons offer better protection than tightly woven  nylon/polyester knits. The best cottons are tightly woven blue denim, dark  whipcords and other dark cottons, according to the Wellness Letter.  </P> <P> Such materials have a sun protection factor (SPF) of more than 1,000, allowing  just 0.1% of the ultraviolet light to pass through. A loosely knitted nylon  jersey has an SPF of 4 and allows 24% of the ultraviolet light through. Good  sunscreens give you an SPF of at least 15.  </P> <P> Garments should fit loosely to allow air to circulate. This helps keep you  cool. And try to stay dry. Wetness greatly decreases a fabric's ability to  protect.  </P> <P> In addition to proper clothing, tightly-woven hats and parasols are useful.  Choose a hat with a broad brim, a high dome and holes for ventilation. No need  to pack these, though. They are readily available at most ports of call and  generally are inexpensive.  </P></p>

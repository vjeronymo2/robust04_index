			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Fazekas, secretary of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Workers' Party, by Daniel Bodnar; place and date not  given: "Convinced Communists"]    [Excerpts] The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party  [MSZMP] led by Gyula Thurmer changed its name to Labor Party in  March 1993. However, a small group of MSZMP members thought that  Thurmer's Labor Party wanted to become a bourgeois workers  party, and this was unacceptable for them. Therefore, they did  not join the new party and continued to engage in politics by  maintaining the party's old name. A 43-years-old entrepreneur,  Laszlo Fazekas, became the secretary of the MSZMP, a party with  a small number of members. He has been an MSZMP member since  1975. He proudly claims that he joined the MSZMP out of  conviction, and not by force, at the time. [passage omitted]    [Bodnar] How would you characterize the MSZMP?    [Fazekas] We are a party based on Marxist-Leninist ideas and  our collective decisionmaking mechanism is based on  collectivism. The present MSZMP can be defined as a democratic  party, building from below. With our efforts and our current  modest means, we would like to serve the future.    [Bodnar] How do you relate to the bourgeois democracy?    [Fazekas] We accept its existence, but it is our firm goal  to create a real democracy; our main goal is to create a real  people's power. Of course, we want to achieve our goals within  a constitutional framework, by means of elections. We attribute  a considerable role to the activity of political information; by  this, we would like to make sure that the masses finally  understand our real interests. We accept the multiparty system  and we believe that no party can function properly without a  really critical opposition. A multiparty system can be useful,  but it must be filled with real content.    [Bodnar] What kind of relations do you have with the various  leftist organizations? I mean here primarily the Labor Party,  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], and the National  Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ].    [Fazekas] Since March 1993, we have been doing our utmost on  our part to work out a cooperation and action program based on  the principle of equality. Unfortunately, our former  mother-party, the present Labor Party, does not show proper  flexibility toward our approach. Our approach to other leftist  organization is not really rapid either because of the  tremendous stakes of the parliamentary elections. Although we  have ideas regarding the future on paper, everything is too much  tied down in the current situation for a leftist cooperation to  emerge on an increasingly large platform. However, we are  convinced, and we also informed our future partners about this,  that only a real collaboration of the leftist forces can lead to  a real change in the political life. [passage omitted]    I think that the left can be definitely more successful in  four years time, because the domestic social processes and the  European and global economic processes will drift the people  toward the left, whether some political circles like it or not.  [passage omitted]    [Bodnar] What results do you count on in the elections?    [Fazekas] It would be a real achievement for us if we could  express our opinion about the current state of affairs and about  the future in as many places as possible, because the current  practice of turning to the past, something that characterizes  certain political circles, is absolutely inexpedient and it  draws the attention away from the really important problems. I  think it will definitely be a political gain for us if we can  voice our opinions in more than half of the election districts.  We will not despair even if the party remains without any  parliamentary deputy, because time is working for us anyway.  [passage omitted]</p>

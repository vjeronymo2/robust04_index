			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Unilever in Italian olive oil deal UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, is to acquire Bertolli, the Italian olive oil and vinegar business formerly owned by the state-controlled SME group. Last month, SME, which is being slowly dismembered via sales to the private sector, sold its Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica (CBD) canned foods, edible oils and milk division to Fisvi, an agro-industrial holding company with extensive interests in southern Italy. Fisvi has now sold Bertolli, Italy's second-biggest olive oils group, to Unilever. The disposals, which had been expected, follow an earlier unsuccessful bid by Unilever to purchase the entire CBD division directly from SME's parent, the IRI state holding company. Unilever has now achieved its aim of just acquiring the olive oil business, its target from the beginning. The deal, which encompasses the Bertolli olive oil brand, production and marketing operations in Italy, and foreign sales channels, will add Dollars 150m to Unilever's worldwide turnover in olive oil. No price for the deal has been disclosed. However, observers have estimated its value at some L 150bn (Dollars 91m). Fisvi will use the proceeds to help finance its L307bn purchase of the entire CBD group. It has announced a big rights issue to fund the remainder. The transaction will consolidate Unilever's dominance of the L 1,300bn Italian olive oil market, which it already leads with its San Giorgio and Dante brands. It also becomes the leading supplier in the US.</p>

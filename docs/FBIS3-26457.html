Situated more than 40 kilometers from Shenzhen and over 50  kilometers from Hong Kong, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has  two generating units each with a capacity of 900,000 kilowatts.    After seven years' construction, the No. 1 reactor unit went  into commercial operation on February 1 and the No. 2 unit  started trial operation today after it completed its "critical  state" test in January. It is expected to go into commercial  operation in the first half of this year.    The Chinese and foreign experts who are working at the plant  said that the type of reactors, their installation and try-outs,  and waste materials to be discharged are safe and reliable.    They noted that it poses no threats to nearby regions.    The reactors at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant are of the  pressurized water type, which has a high safety coefficiency.    During their installation, Chinese and foreign engineers and  workers adopted a series of quality control measures to ensure  safe operation.    Zan Yunlong, general manager of the Guangdong Nuclear Power  Joint Venture Co. Ltd., said that in constructing the nuclear  power plant, his company has strictly followed the principle of  "quality first and safety first".    Zan, who has worked in the nuclear power industry for many  years, said that the project was completed in line with the laws  and regulations on nuclear safety issued in China and it passed  several examinations and appraisal by the International Atomic  Energy Agency.    R. Vella, operations manager from France, said that the  operational system of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is like  that of the nuclear power plants in France.    He said that the operators of the plant received training in  France and they have made remarkable progress with the help of  20 French technological advisers.    He said that he was confident of the ability of the Chinese  technological personnel to operate the Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Plant.    He noted that it is totally groundless to say that the  nuclear power plant threatens the safety of Hong Kong and nearby  regions.    Experts said that the waste gas of the plant will be  processed before it is discharged into the air.    The radiation index of the processed gas is at a much lower  level than that by radiation of the universe.    The waste liquids will be recycled for re-use. The waste  materials will be sealed up in uniquely designed containers for  ten years before they are buried deep underground and they will  cause no safety problems.</p>

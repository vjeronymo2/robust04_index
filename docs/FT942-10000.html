			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank cuts make some strategists happy The Bundesbank made a number of strategists happy yesterday, with its cuts of 50 basis points in the German discount and Lombard rates, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr James Cornish, European market strategist at NatWest Securities, said the Bundesbank had helped to create conditions in which the US Federal Reserve could increase US short-term interest rates, and ease the global pressure on bond prices. Bourses thought the same way, initially, extending Tuesday's gains; but the lack of immediate action from the Fed, and the approach of the Ascension Day holiday today, led them into more cautious attitudes by the end of the day. FRANKFURT, where the Buba cuts came closest to home, had little time to respond during the session. The Dax index moved up 8.48 to 2,243.63 on the official day, but it held its gains and improved on them slightly in the post-bourse, where the Ibis-indicated Dax ended at 2,248.02. Metallgesellschaft rose DM17, or 7.5 per cent to DM243 on a few small buy orders, and talk that a major Swiss bank had upgraded its recommendation on the stock. In shipbuilding, Bremer Vulkan shares closed DM4.30, or 4.5 per cent higher at DM100.50 after news that the company expected a swing to profit in 1994 after a loss last year. Turnover rose from DM7.95bn to DM8.6bn. The big energy and chemicals group, Veba, which lifted the market with its first quarter results on Tuesday, climbed another DM9.70 to DM537. PARIS trimmed its intervention rate early in the day, before the news from Germany. The combination of events, along with expectations that a further rate cut will come next week, helped the CAC-40 index to a rise of 11.76 at 2,176.74. Turnover was nearly FFr4bn. Positive economic data - a rise in industrial productivity - was an added bonus, according to James Capel: 'The manufacturing recovery is getting under way', said the broker, 'and, given the buoyant optimism of surveys for March and April, the recovery has almost certainly gained further momentum since February'. BSN continued to rise following its statement on Tuesday that it was planning a series on international acquisitions, a gain of up FFr16 to FFr885 bringing its rise to 4 per cent on the week so far. AMSTERDAM rose following the German rate cut, with the AEX index up 2.58 at 412.57. But there were other matters on investors' minds. Royal Dutch slightly disappointed the market with its first quarter results and the shares shed 30 cents to Fl 205.70. Aegon, the insurer, was one of the session's best performers, adding Fl 2.50 at Fl 101.00 as it reported a 13 per cent increase in first-quarter profits. ZURICH closed early ahead of today's holiday, and was unable to reflect the German cuts. The blue chip, SMI index held Tuesday's recovery and rose another 5.4 to 2,634.4, but it closed well below the day's high of 2,659.7. Banks closed steady. Insurers were firm after Winterthur and Zurich Insurance reported surprisingly strong 1993 earnings growth earlier this week, the companies in question rising SFr19 to SFr689, and SFr22 to SFr1,255 respectively. In chemicals, Roche certificates recovered SFr5 to SFr6,335; but their recent weakness continued after hours, with a fall to SFr6,310 in London. Nestle registered, meanwhile, fell SFr12 to SFr1,102. MADRID saw Mr Felipe Gonzalez face parliament again to address the corruption cases which have bedevilled the socialist government. But unlike last week, when a confident prime ministerial performance lifted the market, yesterday closed with little response. The general index closed just 0.49 higher at 321.48 in turnover of Pta32bn. Construction stocks did best, Urallita rising Pta90, or 6.7 per cent to Pta1,430, and Cubiertas Pta520, or 4.8 per cent to Pta11,432. MILAN decided that the time had come to take profits after the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, finally announced the members of his cabinet. The market was not swayed by an easing in interest rates by the central bank, and the Comit index ended down 7.10 at 810.07. Mr John Stewart of Inter-Europa in Milan commented that the new administration still had to clear one hurdle - ratification of the cabinet by the senate on Monday. Morgan Stanley said that the Bank of Italy was expected to maintain its policy and forecast that short-term rates could decline by up to 75 basis points by the end of September. Ahead of its results due out today, Fiat slipped L230 to L7,010, while Fondiaria was off L880 or 5 per cent at L16,870 in reaction to Tuesday's disappointing figures. STOCKHOLM, which closed early ahead of today's holiday, strengthened moderately in trading dominated by Ericsson and Volvo. The Affarsvarlden general index added 5.4 to 1,505.1. Turnover rose to SKr3bn from Tuesday's SKr1.6bn. Ericsson, which disapponted analysts with its first quarter results, announced on Tuesday, traded ex a dividend of SKr4.50 and closed the day off SKr4.00 at Skr336.00. Volvo jumped SKr12 to SKr732 on rising expectations ahead of its first quarter earnings which are due next week.

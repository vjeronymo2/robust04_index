			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Borrie set to head Labour tax probe SIR Gordon Borrie, until last June director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, is set to head Labour's Commission into Social Justice - the party's showpiece inquiry into the tax and benefits system. The commission, proposed by Mr John Smith during his campaign for the party leadership, is intended to examine key questions for Labour's future policy proposals. These range from the relative values of universal and means-tested benefits and such issues as the merits or otherwise of progressive and redistributive taxation. The exact terms of reference for the commission - widely characterised as a new Beveridge report - and its personnel have yet to be agreed. However, Labour has confirmed that it will be independent of the party, will be serviced by the non-affiliated left-leaning think tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, and its findings will outline options rather than define positions. About 12 other commission members are expected to be named, alongside Sir Gordon, largely from the centre or centre-left of the British political spectrum. Academics, Liberal Democrats and representatives of pressure groups are all likely to be included. The recruitment of Sir Gordon, 61, to chair the commission - still not formally confirmed - will be seen as a coup for Labour. Sir Gordon is a respected academic and QC with a long track record for working on important social issues, who twice contested parliamentary seats for Labour in the 1950s. At around the same time he published with Professor Aubrey Diamond a seminal book on consumer issues, The Consumer, Society and the Law, that formed the agenda for the consumer movement in later years. Since then, Sir Gordon has served on bodies such as the Equal Opportunities Commission while working for 16 years as OFT director-general, surviving, in spite of his liberal credentials, the scrutiny of Mrs Thatcher's premiership.</p>

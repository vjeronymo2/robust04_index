			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Anglers hooked by permit sales at Post Office Something fishy is going on in the sedate world of freshwater angling. Sales of rod-fishing licences are soaring. The National Rivers Authority has sold more in the first seven months of the current financial year in England and Wales than it did in the whole of last year. By the end of October the NRA had sold 966,000 licences and exceeded its full-year revenue target of Pounds 11.8m. In 1993-94 895,000 licences were sold, raising Pounds 10.1m. Is the pastime more popular? Or anglers more law-abiding? Is there another explanation? Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, says he knows. He attributes the surge to the fact that rod-fishing licences have been available in 17,000 post offices since March. Before then anglers bought licences from fishing-tackle shops. He said: 'The Rivers Authority cannot believe their luck. The potency of the network of post offices in growing a market is very significant.' The NRA agrees that the increase is due to 'better distribution and better promotion'. It has also changed the licensing system this year, introducing more short-term permits and splitting the annual licence, which used to cover all species, into coarse-fishing and game-fishing categories. With annual licences valid from the start of the fishing season on April 1, the NRA acknowledges that sales are concentrated around that period. Nevertheless, annual licences for 1994-95 - allowing the holder to fish anywhere in England and Wales if local by-laws permit - are still selling. The Post Office's right to sell the licences was approved by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in spite of opposition from Mr Michael Portillo, the former chief secretary to the Treasury. In an exchange of letters revealed last December Mr Heseltine is said to have told his colleague to 'get your hook off my line'.</p>

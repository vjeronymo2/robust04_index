			<p>BFN     [Text] In the second half of the day, the French president  visited the National Park in the capital of the Republic and  placed a wreath at the monument of Ali Sheri Navoi, an  outstanding poet and statesman. The president of Uzbekistan  spoke to the highly esteemed guest on the great respect which  the people of Uzbekistan have for the talent of this great poet  who has left behind philosophical works and poems. On his side,  Francois Mitterrand noted the ever increasing role of Uzbekistan  in the world community.    Following this, talks were held between the two presidents  on  a number of questions of mutual interest. Official talks  between the French and Uzbek delegations were also held here  with the participation of the heads of state. Joint documents  were signed on the results of the talks, including the agreement  between the governments of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the  Republic of France on cooperation between the ministries for  internal affairs, a joint declaration on cooperation in the  field of air transport, and an agreement between France and  Uzbekistan on the freedom of movement of the citizens.

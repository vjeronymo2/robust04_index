			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Tougher sanctions for Haiti this week President Bill Clinton is expected to announce tougher economic sanctions against Haiti this week as the US moves to implement recommendations from the Organisation of American States to tighten the noose on the country's economic elite. Mr William Gray, the former congressman who has been named Mr Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said yesterday he expected the US to ban commercial flights and freeze financial transactions with Haiti in the next few days. 'I have confidence sanctions can create an environment where people come to their senses,' Mr Gray told the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee yesterday. Other nations in Latin America and the Caribbean have also promised to contribute troops for an eventual United Nations mission to provide civil law enforcement in Haiti if the military coup leaders step down and allow the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Mr Gray said the broad embargo imposed by the UN on May 21 was the first real attempt to apply economic pressure to Haiti, since an earlier ban on fuel and arms had been narrowly targeted. The new measures were agreed last week by the four countries - Canada, France, the US and Venezuela - which have taken the lead in efforts to restore democracy to Haiti since the military coup in 1991. Critics have complained that sanctions so far have hurt only the country's poor, while wealthy businessmen leaders have been able to fly freely to Miami.</p>

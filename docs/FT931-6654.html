			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Proposals for Daf buy-out expected ADMINISTRATIVE receivers of the Leyland Daf van manufacturing plant at Birmingham are expected to receive firm proposals on Monday for a management buy-out. The management team, led by managing director Mr Allen Amey, is believed to have formulated a plan for the vans operation to continue as a stand-alone business relying initially on the UK market alone. Neither the receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of accountants Arthur Andersen, nor executives at the plant, would last night confirm details of the proposals or how they might be funded. But it is known that informal talks have started between the buy-out team - believed to comprise six executives - and local Department of Trade and Industry officials on whether the managers' proposals would qualify for aid. Yesterday the plant, at Washwood Heath on Birmingham's outskirts, was continuing production against an order book now said to extend to 10 weeks, boosted by orders from Birmingham City Council, which is seeking to persuade other local authorities to follow suit. Royal Mail and Parcelforce, the vans operation's biggest customers, have also kept orders in place. A meeting of Leyland Daf's dealer council is understood to have pledged support for the managers' buy-out proposals.</p>

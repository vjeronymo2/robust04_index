			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Pinch on pay: Robert Taylor says the stability in UK wage levels may not last This week's batch of labour market statistics suggests the British economy may finally be achieving what most postwar governments have yearned for - sustained growth with falling unemployment, low inflation and above all relatively modest pay rises. Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, was quick to point out the benefits of moderation in pay: 'Provided companies keep a firm grip on wage costs at all levels, economic growth will continue to feed through into jobs as well as rising prosperity.' However, while pay settlements are stable and there are few signs of industrial unrest, pressures for higher pay may be building up in the labour market over the coming year. So far, there has been no steep upsurge in the level of wage settlements as the economy has revived. Annual earnings growth stood at 3.9 per cent in September. The underlying annual growth in manufacturing pay is now running at 4.5 per cent, nearly twice the inflation rate. However, this is only a quarter of a percentage point higher than at the same time last year, even though the recovery is now much further advanced. Manufacturing productivity is rising at an annual rate of 6 per cent, impressive by recent British standards. This has meant falling unit labour costs in manufacturing, where wages and salaries per unit of output were 1.4 per cent less over the three months ending in September compared with the same period last year. This is the greatest improvement since the current Department of Employment unit labour cost records began in 1970. It appears to mark a break from the past, when gains in productivity were outpaced by pay increases. In spite of the modest pay settlements, there are no signs of widespread industrial unrest. In September, just 17,000 days were lost in just 13 strikes involving 8,000 workers, the lowest since the government started collecting figures. The sporadic disruption by rail signalling staff this summer does not appear to have sparked a wider strike-wave. The Engineering Employers' Federation is confident that there will be no pay escalation in manufacturing in the immediate future. Independent forecasters such as Incomes Data Services expect settlements to remain stable, though slightly above the inflation rate. Even in the public sector, where the government has imposed a three-year freeze on the pay bill, there is apparent calm. Threats of resistance from the public service sector unions appear to have ebbed. What there has been is a loss of more than 420,000 public sector jobs in the first 18 months of the freeze, which have helped to fund pay increases. Public sector pay has therefore risen in line with wages in the private sector without any increase in the total pay bill. Yet despite this apparent stability and self-restraint on pay, there remain worries about future trends. Mr Howard Davies, director- general of the Confederation of British Industry, continues to warn employers about the need to rein back what he sees as 'upward creep' in pay settlements. He points out that German and US unit labour costs have fallen even more than the UK's in recent months, while British productivity remains well below the country's main competitors. There are also concerns - expressed at this month's CBI conference by its president, Sir Bryan Nicholson - that high pay rises for top executives unrelated to company performance may stoke up pay demands from the rest of the workforce, as the gap widens between the top and lower ends of the earnings ladder. Some pay negotiations this autumn have aroused fears of an upward trend in settlements. In September, Rover group car workers only narrowly accepted a two-year wage deal worth 10.7 per cent. Talks are continuing at Jaguar, where workers have rejected a 7.5 per cent pay package recommended by their union negotiators. In both cases, shopfloor workers said they were less concerned with the pay offer than the changes being demanded of them in longer hours of work. 'There are signs that workers elsewhere are less willing to accept workplace restructuring unless it is rewarded by higher pay,' says Mr Alistair Hatchett, editor of Incomes Data Report. Changes in the workplace have also made it harder to read pay trends. The demise of national or industry-wide pay bargaining in recent years and the government's active encouragement of decentralisation and performance-related pay in the public sector mean that wage bargaining is increasingly carried out at local level. This makes it more difficult to generalise about what is happening to pay levels across the country. But it may also be storing up discontent for the future if some groups are doing better than others because of local conditions. 'In the past people felt their pay was related to a concept of what was fair. National agreements reflected that feeling,' says Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the Public Finance Foundation. 'Now on pay they are finding themselves very much out on their own.' Mr Hatchett says there is 'immense frustration' among employees over pay at the moment. This view is reinforced by the latest British Social Attitudes Survey, published this week, which reveals an anxious workforce increasingly concerned about widening pay differentials, matched by fears about job security. It may be premature to conclude the UK economy is free at last from pay-push inflation and the concept of the going-rate. Wage expectations are less ambitious than they used to be, perhaps because for the time being most workers seem more concerned with their job security than big pay rises.</p>

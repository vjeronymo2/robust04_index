			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dankwart Guratzsch: "Another Dioxin Alarm in </F> Germany: PVC Production Generates Seveso Poison in Previously  Unknown Quantities -- Inquiry in Lower Saxony"]    [Text] The federal and land environment ministries are  alarmed: A new dioxin hazard, the extent of which is still  unknown, appears to be threatening the Federal Republic of  Germany.    Yesterday, the Lower Saxony Environment Ministry ordered an  inspection of the soil and waterways in the area surrounding the  Jadebusen and the PVC [polyvinyl chloride] producer ICI's works,  including mussels and sediment, for contamination by chemical  toxins, including the Seveso poison, dioxin.    Federal Environment Ministry spokesman Cay Frimuth told DIE  WELT: "Dioxins occur in PVC production in quantities of which we  were previously unaware and which have shocked us." Armin  Basler, head of the Chemicals Safety Department, added: "To  date, everyone has been pointing to the waste incinerators as  the presumed major dischargers of dioxin, but now we are seeing  that emissions from production are much higher."    Lower Saxony's Environment Minister, Monika Greifahn (SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany]), who was the first to  trace the poison to its source, mentioned an additional ground  for concern: "Exactly why and at which point in the production  process dioxins occur remains a complete mystery."    The realization "that these substances are also transported  in water" was recent, said Greifahn.    The high dioxin content in the flue gases discharged by a  Hoesch AG sintering plant had already come to light in North  Rhine-Westphalia -- an environmental scandal that has been  keeping a board of inquiry set up by the land parliament in  Duesseldorf busy ever since. The allegation is that Environment  Minister Klaus Matthiesen (SPD) failed to make public his  knowledge about the dioxin discharger.    The map of the Federal Republic is now being systematically  scanned by computers to establish the emission zones of the 10  German PVC manufacturers. The sludge "paths" must also be  traced.    The Wilhelmshaven works alone has been piling 400 tonnes a  year of highly contaminated sludge onto Lower Saxony's hazardous  waste dumps: Its dry substance contains record quantities of  400,000 nanograms of the superpoison per kilogram. There is  currently no technological solution at all for controlling this  new source of poison. Work on initial preventive strategies is  scheduled for completion by the summer.</p>

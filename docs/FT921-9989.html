			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): A change of management I HAVE used a self-select PEP plan manager since December 1988. But my choice is sadly under-performing and I would like to make changes. It is obvious that my ability to make good selections is inadequate and therefore I suppose I should seek a managed investment. My preferred route would be an investment trust and I would like to know to what extent this is permitted. 1) Is it permitted to sell any shares in existing general equity PEPs and buy investment trust shares - if so, is the amount restricted by year of investment and/or by proportion? 2a) Would it be possible to make a full disposal and via the PEP apply for a new issue of a particular class of investment trust share (income)? 2b) Could I over-apply for package units via the PEP and extract the capital shares, leaving income shares tax sheltered? 3) How will the rules apply to the new single company PEPs viz: established investment trusts and new issue investment trusts? 4) How do the rules on purchase of established trusts apply re dividends accruing within the PEP? The Inland Revenue has been good enough to provide us with the information to help answer your points. 1) It is possible, in principle, to sell UK ordinary shares and replace them with qualifying investment trust shares, 'provided that immediately after the switch the total market value of the investment trust content of the portfolio does not exceed 50 per cent of the market value of the whole portfolio (including uninvested cash)'. A 'qualifying' investment trust needs, broadly speaking, to be at least 50 per cent invested in UK and other EC companies. 2a) It is impossible to make a full disposal and then, via the PEP, apply for a new issue of income shares. 'The problem is not the class of investment trust share applied for, but that the maximum 50 per cent investment trust content may not be exceeded.' 2b) If you apply outside the PEP, in a public offer, then it is up to you to decide which shares to transfer under the 42 day rule, but the amount transferred must not exceed Pounds 6,000, less any earlier transfers or cash subscriptions. 3) Investment trusts have no role at all in single company PEPs, unless you happen to be employed by an investment trust which has a Save As You Earn scheme. This is the only way in which investment trust shares can be transferred into a PEP, and there is no way in which they can be purchased into a PEP. 4) Dividends received in respect of investment trust shares held in a plan enjoy full PEP exemption, according to the Revenue. Thus, both the net dividend and the tax credit reclaimed from the Revenue can be reinvested in further investment trust shares. There is one exception to this - if you have a 'mixed' plan holding both ordinary equities and investment trusts, the 50 per cent rule must not be broken. If the equities are not performing well, this might be a limit on performance. The Revenue added that PEPs are deliberately not dealt with locally.

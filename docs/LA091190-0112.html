			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chip Industry Barometer Falls: The semiconductor industry's benchmark indicator  dipped in August to its lowest level since November.  </P> <P> The San Jose-based Semiconductor Industry Assn. said the book-to-bill ratio,  which compares orders with shipments, fell to 0.99 in August from 1 in July. A  book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 means that for every $100 of semiconductors shipped  to the U.S. market in the three months ended in August, chip manufacturers  received new orders worth $99. A ratio of less than 1 is considered unhealthy  for the industry.  </P></p>

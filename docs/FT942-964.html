			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Working Life: Some like it hot but it's lovely in a cold climate - Style To sunny Rome from drizzly Heathrow. In these days of Euro-travel, such a hop for a day's business is a regular possibility. The destinations may vary but the flexible, user-friendly wardrobe, which doesn't involve a suitcase of changes, is an important consideration. This is where the cashmere investment makes the soundest sense. Warm when you leave from a chilly airport in early morning, appropriate for a strategic meeting and glamorous enough for an evening date. The right cashmere sweater even looks good thrown carelessly round the shoulders as a shawl. This season the choice of colour is simple. Cashmere is at its most luxurious in shades of beige, ecru, cream or biscuit. All these work with the basics - navy, black, brown or grey - or even with more beige, white or cream if the film star entrance is what you're after. The shape to choose? Try the re-vamped twinset last seen in Audrey Hepburn films with its prim little cardigan over a matching round-necked shape. Fashion buffs will wear them short and small, like the one by TSE (pronounced SAl) in silk and cashmere mix at Pounds 139 for the cardigan and Pounds 105 for the cutaway-sleeved top underneath (Harvey Nichols, Liberty's, Selfridges and Harrods). At Scotch House you will find a more conventional design at Pounds 235 for 100 per cent cream cashmere. But they do have a sweet cropped version in lambswool in their Hopscotch range. Easier on the silhouette is the loose, fingertip-length tunic-shape available at Pringle (in Hebridean cashmere for Pounds 190) and at Ballantyne (in two-ply, ribbed cotton/cashmere for Pounds 160), 153a New Bond Street. The single-ply cashmere tunic with side slits, at Pounds 235, is a bestseller at N. Peal in Burlington Arcade and the more expensive ribbed equivalent had to be brought back into the range due to its popularity. Women have discovered that the tunic shape works equally effectively with a skirt (whatever length you're wearing) or trousers. Cut like fabric, it is a sweater with none of the breakfast TV presenter connotations.</p>

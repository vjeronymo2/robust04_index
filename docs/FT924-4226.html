			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Shipyard closure costs 900 jobs: Cammell Laird decision prompts call for audit of VSEL books OPPOSITION calls for a government audit of the books of VSEL, the privatised nuclear submarine builder, greeted the company's decision yesterday to close the Cammell Laird shipyard on Merseyside with the loss of 900 jobs. Cammell Laird, which mainly builds diesel-electric submarines, will run out of work next June. VSEL, which bought the Birkenhead yard for Pounds 1 in 1986, has been trying to sell it for two years, since the end of the cold war curtailed Britain's submarine building programme. Under the terms of the 1986 deal, VSEL - itself a management buyout from Vickers, then part of British Shipbuilding - was supposed to pay the government Pounds 40m for Cammell Laird if VSEL made Pounds 100m of profits over a five-year period. VSEL obtained a stock exchange listing by introduction shortly after Cammell Laird's purchase. Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, who usually speaks for the cross-party group of Wirral MPs, said last night: 'VSEL management has kept under the Pounds 100m figure, but only because they provided Pounds 50m for the closure of Cammell Laird in 1991 and have reserved other money for development costs as they try to diversify out of warships at Barrow-in-Furness. 'The books have got to be looked at closely to see if these provisions are proper. In the meantime, we want Cammell Laird back in public ownership, plus a payment of Pounds 20m from VSEL to finance its development. The deeds of ownership should be put into trust while we look for entrepreneurs who can develop the yard.' VSEL builds Trident-carrying nuclear submarines at Barrow, but this work will also run out in the mid-1990s. The company, which employed 14,500 at Barrow in 1990, will have fewer than 5,000 jobs in two years. Mr Noel Davies, VSEL chief executive, said the company had 'done its damnedest' to save or sell Cammell Laird. The sale had failed because EC civil shipbuilding subsidies were not available for a warship yard; the recession had deterred buyers; and 'prevarication' over development of a new gas field in Liverpool Bay had prevented development of Cammell Laird in offshore markets. Another reason was failure to secure aid from the EC's intervention fund, which helps shipbuilding areas. Amec, the construction, offshore and civil engineering group, would have made a serious offer for the yard had the Liverpool Bay project - now held up by a planning inquiry over the siting of a north Wales gas terminal - gone ahead. 'It seems many people in the Wirral are more concerned about a pretty skyline as they look across to north Wales than they are for the jobs of the lads at Cammell Laird,' Mr Davies said. VSEL would try to get the yard redesignated by planners to allow mixed redevelopment for housing, offices, leisure, retail and industrial use, he added. This was dismissed by Mr Field as 'potty'. The GMB engineering union said the aim should be to keep Cammell Laird as a shipyard.</p>

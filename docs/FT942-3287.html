			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hawtin Hawtin, the leisure, textiles, building products and property group, reported profits of Pounds 824,000 before tax for the six months to March 31. The outcome, aided by a reduced net interest charge of Pounds 260,000 (Pounds 370,000), represented a rise of some 5 per cent on the comparable Pounds 783,000. But if the benefit of a one-off surplus of Pounds 315,000 last time on sale of goodwill is stripped out the underlying gain was 76 per cent. Turnover improved to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 13.1m). Earnings per share edged ahead from 0.75p to 0.78p and the interim dividend is lifted from 0.25p to 0.275p.</p>

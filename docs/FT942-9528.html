			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: Enfants terribles dance on - Clement Crisp on works by Michael Clark and Matthew Bourne To re-choreograph the Stravinsky/Balanchine Apollo is rather like re-writing Hamlet: the act of a dolt or a mad genius. For all his zany ways and interminably prolonged adolescence, Michael Clark is no dolt. Nor does he qualify as a mad genius. Rather, in his O, in which he does indeed give new choreography to Apollo, he shows himself a commanding and wonderfully imaginative creator. At last, say I, he has come of age. O is in two parts. In the first, the 'enfant terrible' still dominates in the choice of deafening, hell-sent rock, but this din accompanies dance of mature understanding. At the Royal College of Music, Manchester, on a stage bare save for six doors at the back, Clark explores a sequence of long adagio phrases. He is simply dressed in a leotard; the movement stretches out as his body unfolds, revelling in the curves of those perfect legs and feet, with the contraposto of his torso a ravishing balance and complement. His colleagues - three women, one man - follow discreetly in his footsteps (the Clark feet still a marvel of the dance world in shape and flexibility). There comes a wild coda when dress and dance are tatterdemalion, yet the final impression is, despite the maniac blast of the accompaniment, very pure. But the point of O is its second part, an interpretation of Apollo. It was with this score, in its white, formally serene measures, that Balanchine found himself, and found the way forward for classical ballet in our century. I hope it is not too fanciful to think something of the same for Michael Clark. The stage is dominated by a large reflecting box-structure, diagonally placed. Incident flashes off its sides - Leto giving birth to Apollo; the muses' entry - then as the music announces Apollo's manhood, Clark is brilliantly seen in its illuminated interior. White-suited, he awakens, stretches. Emerging from this altar-womb - its opening a thrilling coup - he dances. The action is sufficiently pinned into Stravinsky's music (and momentarily - the famous finger-touch with Terpsichore - into Balanchine's text) to make dramatic sense. But what thrills eye and mind - and heart - is the grace of Clark's movement language: its linear virtues, its imagination (he writes as well for the Three Muses as for himself), and its lovely logic. His own performance is superlatively good: noble, carved in light, Apollonian in its formal order. He demonstrates what Virgil Thomson, writing about musical craftsmanship, called the 'twin privileges: freedom and responsibility'. So Clark has at last found the freedom to use his own dance-style fully - the style proposed in the first part of O - and shown a responsibility to his score and to the exquisite rightness of his own physique as a symbol of Apollonian grace. I have in the past hated what Clark has done because unworthy of his talents. I salute this beautiful and cogent work of art, which honours its score and its creator/interpreter. The final moments, when a mirrored stage reflects multiple images of Clark and his cast, is a true apotheosis of his talent. This half of O is as beautiful and significant as Balanchine's Apollo. No greater praise. Taggart is a faggot. Jean Brodie - sit on my face. Gurn is a dork. Of such biting wit are the graffiti on the loo-doors that are the initial setting for Highland Fling, a view of balletic romanticism now on offer from Adventures in Motion Pictures. Even before the action begins, the trick has been played, the joke has run its miserable course. Matthew Bourne, AMP's director and choreographer, has clearly not heard Noel Coward's dictum: 'Never come out of the same trap'. With his version of Nutcracker two years ago, Bourne made an amusing revision of a dance cliche. With Highland Fling he has turned to another 19th century text - La Sylphide  -and has even cast a wandering eye at Giselle. A programme note warns us that next year he will made advances on Swan Lake. Is there time to find some Brussels directive that will stop this game before it gets out of hand? If Highland Fling is anything to go by, there is a case against Bourne for aggravated and witless vandalism. The piece is an unabashed stinker. Bourne's procedure is to transfer the story to the Glasgow of today. James is a pill-popping lout; other characters are crude and tartaned cyphers, fully armed with cans of beer; the sylphide is a cross between Vampira the Bloodsucker and a tipsy drag-queen. The second act's sylphs look like manic dirty laundry. People fall down, rush in an out of loos, and shreds of the old narrative are inexpertly woven into a crude inversion of romanticism, a subject on which I think Bourne needs some coaching. I watched two laboured and interminable acts with lowered spirits and rising gorge. David Garforth's fine recording of Lovenskjold's Sylphide score was played far too loudly. The cast romped in a flailing, family-charades manner, and in a culminating moment of charm, James takes a pair of garden shears, cuts off the sylph's wings, and we are treated to a bloody (bloody indeed) farewell. Of choreographic or dramatic interest I saw no trace. The original taut narrative is knocked senseless, Bourne, lacking that eye for the ridiculous which might make the joke work. The incorporation of elements from Giselle suggests desperation rather than any feeling for Romantic dance. Performances are uniformly dire, vulgar, as the cast bang about the tiny stage of the Baylis Theatre. How rewarding to learn from the programme that BBC TV plans to film this undertaking. Another bead on the corporation's rosary of mediocre dance. O can be seen in Sheffield, Oxford, Brighton, London (Brixton Academy), and Edinburgh during the next two months. Highland Fling is at the Baylis Theatre until May 28</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Trade gap widens as exports to EC falter: Rise in producer prices adds to uncertainty over upturn FRESH uncertainties about whether the UK recovery can be sustained emerged yesterday after official figures showed a widening of the trade deficit and a gradual increase in prices of manufactured goods. The deficit on visible trade for the first seven months of the year was Pounds 8.7bn, compared with Pounds 7bn for the same period last year, according to the Central Statistical Office. The deterioration was mainly due to a poor export performance in the European Community, where Britain does more than half its external trade. The shortfall in trade with EC countries was Pounds 848m, the biggest for two years. Manufacturers' prices, excluding the volatile food, drink, tobacco and petrol sectors, rose 3 per cent in the year to September. That compares with a 2.7 per cent rise in the year to August. Month-on-month prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent. The rises came in spite of subdued raw material costs and low wage costs. Underlying producer price inflation has been creeping up since April and is now rising at its fastest rate for 2 1/2 years, according to the CSO. The market shrugged off the news ahead of a busy week for economic indicators, including retail price inflation figures tomorrow. UK government bond prices were marginally lower across the board. The inflation figures also contained good news. Prices of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturers rose 3.5 per cent in the year to September, sharply lower than the August rate of 6.3 per cent. Month-on-month input prices fell by 1.5 per cent, reflecting a decline in the prices of raw materials, particularly metals, crude oil and food manufacturing materials. Seasonally adjusted, the index dropped by 2 per cent month-on-month, the biggest monthly fall since June 1986. The input price figure was further subdued by a stronger pound in September. Sterling rose by 2.2 per cent against the dollar between August and September, making imported raw materials cheaper. That compares with a 4.2 per cent drop in the exchange rate bet-ween August and September last year. Overall, producer prices rose 4.2 per cent in the year to September, slightly lower than in August when the rate was 4.3 per cent. The difference between the path of the overall index and the underlying index can be explained by petrol prices, which have been falling. Deficit increases as exports plummet, Page 9 Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Clinton turns to health after budget bruising: The president has still to make difficult decisions on healthcare reform PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday signed the US budget bill, voted through Congress by a whisker last week. With opinion polls showing widespread public distrust of the budget's measures, White House officials admit they have a large marketing job to do to win support for the package. But already the administration is preparing for the next items on its legislative agenda, for when Congress returns in September. Heading the list are plans for legislation on crime and welfare, and Vice-President Al Gore's report on 'reinventing government', a compendium of suggestions on how to make the federal government more efficient and less wasteful. The biggest task facing Mr Clinton, however, is healthcare reform. The president is making no attempt to underplay the size of the undertaking. Speaking in West Virginia this week, he described the issue as the greatest threat to economic security, and to the personal security of most American families. 'Unless we reform the healthcare system of this country, we can never get the deficit down to zero,' he warned. The Clinton health plan, already much delayed by recognition that it stood no chance of progress in Congress until the budget had been dealt with, has still not been finalised. The plan outlined by a taskforce headed by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president's wife, is based on the managed competition approach. This involves setting up health purchasing co-operatives to bring more bargaining power to bear on pricing by doctors and hospitals. It would guarantee universal insurance coverage, although not necessarily at once, and compel employers to provide cover for their workers. Difficult details have still to be decided: the degree of government control over medical prices, the precise illnesses and treatments to be covered by insurance, and the extent to which companies would be compelled to join co-operatives in buying insurance for their employees. Most troublesome is a congressional Budget Office estimate that pure managed competition would increase national healthcare spending. The report found, on the other hand, that a comprehensive government-run health insurance system, similar to Canada's, would produce big savings, bolstering the substantial minority of Democrats in Congress who favour this single payer approach. Bruised from the budget battle, Mr Clinton cannot relish the prospect of arguing for further tax increases to pay for his health plan, even if White House officials insist the reforms will cost money only over the short term. Higher taxes on tobacco, and possibly other 'sins' such as alcohol and guns, appear to be a relatively uncontroversial way of footing some of the bill. Payroll taxes will be less popular in Congress. If the Democrats in Congress are divided over the president's plan, so too are the Republicans. Mr Clinton needs at least a handful of Republican votes to avert the threat of a filibuster in the Senate, and stands a good chance of winning it. Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who has been his party's leading spokesman on health issues, favours a managed competition approach which bears striking similarities to elements of the Clinton plan. Several centrist Republicans are also anxious to shed the obstructionist image they fear they could earn if they systematically oppose everything Mr Clinton tries to do. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, has so far favoured the tactics of all-out opposition, preferring not to be outflanked on his right by rivals such as Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas right-winger who is angling for his party's presidential nomination in 1996. Some of Mr Dole's friends in Congress believe, however, that his legislative instincts will eventually lead him to negotiate with Mr Clinton. The budget battle may have reduced Mr Clinton's clout at the negotiating table. The budget itself has not won him resounding support  - a poll conducted for the Washington Post and ABC television showed 48 per cent of respondents disapproved of the economic plan, and only 43 per cent approved  -and the delay it caused has sapped momentum from healthcare reform. This will make it difficult to craft a plan that satisfies competing groups in Congress, let alone the different medical, insurance and consumer lobbies. Nevertheless, the overall pressure for reform remains strong.</p>

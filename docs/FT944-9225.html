			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Yamaha Corp rises 110% at halfway Yamaha Corp, the world's largest maker of musical instruments and the leader of Japan's Yamaha group of companies, yesterday announced a 110 per cent rise in its unconsolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y6.15bn (Dollars 63.4m) for the six months to September, from Y2.92bn a year ago. Net profits rose 149 per cent to Y3.05bn from Y1.22bn last time, as sales edged up just 2.8 per cent to Y176.95bn from Y172.14bn. The dividend is held at Y3 per share. Yamaha said its higher recurring profits resulted from both increased sales and its restructuring efforts. As previously reported, Yamaha said it took an extraordinary loss of Y14.70bn in the first half in order to merge a money-losing Hokkaido resort development company with another subsidiary. The company said it sold Y14.66bn of marketable securities to offset the loss. For the full year to March, Yamaha is forecasting recurring profits of Y4bn, up 83 per cent on last year's actual Y2.19bn, and net profits 237 per cent higher at Y2bn, against Y593m, on expected sales up 4 per cent to Y330bn from Y316.18bn. On the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday, Yamaha shares closed Y40 higher at Y1,250. The interim results were announced after the market had closed.</p>

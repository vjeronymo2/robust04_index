The offices of  the five deputy interior ministers, the permanent secretary and  deputy permanent secretaries have also been declared "restricted  zones", where unauthorised entry is prohibited.    A source said yesterday the tightening of security at the  ministry was agreed on at a meeting on Friday in the aftermath  of bomb attacks on the homes of Social Action Party [SAP] leader  Montri Phongpanit, SAP MP Bunphan Khaewatthana, Permanent Labour  Secretary Sawai Phrammani in Nakhon Ratchasima and on a  locomotive in Songkhla.    As part of the new measures, the source said, the offices in  the Interior Ministry of the Local Administration Department,  the Secretariat, the Permanent Secretary, the Welfare and Labour  Protection Department and the Institute of Prince Damrong  Rachanuphap are now regarded as restricted zones. Earlier,  Permanent Interior Secretary Aree Wong-araya had declared his  office and the area in front of it off-limits to reporters.  [passage omitted]</p>

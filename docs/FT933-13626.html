			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Classic in different ways - Radio WHILE Melvyn Bragg is away on his summer break, Monday mornings will begin with Live Wires in his place - a pleasant talk-to-guests show presented by Emma Freud and Richard Coles and produced by Cathie Mahoney. They began by telling how they would find news from the provincial papers that we would not have had so well covered by the national dailies, but they kicked off with a Belfast paper on July 12, hardly a characteristic source. Still, they both sound pleasant enough. I hated Sue Townsend's The Queen and I the last time it was broadcast, and I hated it again this week in Book at Bedtime. Disapprove of the Royal Family if you must, but do not make fun of them when they have no real chance to answer back. Perhaps I am in a minority over this; anyway, the people that enjoy laughing at the Queen can now get the jokes on cassette from the BBC Radio Collection, and welcome. Radio 3 continues its classical series with an extract from The Golden Ass by Lucius Apuleius, dramatised by Peter Mackie. In spite of Richard Griffiths as the transmuted Lucius, it made me laugh less than I expected. The jokes are described, rather than actually made. We will see how we get on with next week's tale, which goes well on the page. Classic in quite a different way are Frank Richards's stories about the boys at Greyfriars. Radio 2 on Tuesday calls them The Billy Bunter Stories, but when I read them Bunter was not much more memorable among the fellows in the Remove than, say, Hurree Jamset Ram Singh. They were just there for contrast with such normal schoolboys as Harry Wharton and Co. Bunter, unpredictably, was the hero this week; he saved a little girl from being run over by a train, and sensibly hoped for a reward (of coconuts) from her father. Having established that Bunter is for laughs, surely the other Greyfriars boys (Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie) should sound more like the chaps at a decent public school? When I read the title Terry Nutkins' Nature on Radio 5 I reckoned we were in the Beatrix Potter country; but no, Terry Nutkins is a real nature-lover, and his new series from BBC Education sounds fine. The first programme, on Wednesday, dealt first with Liz Dorer, 'the birdwoman of Boxmoor', who devotes herself to the rescue of swans, though other birds may apply. What we heard about injured swans was ghastly; thankfully, lead weights on fishing-lines are now proscribed, for a swan has only to swallow seven of them to die of blood-poisoning. Then on to the Durham puma (so called), the big feral cat seen by a local police-sergeant over seven years - and as far away as Carlisle by hopeful believers. Next week we get badgers and seal pups, and there is a great variety to come - ideal radio for young people. I meant to listen to Cajun Routes on Radio 2 on Thursday, as the word Cajun meant little to me. Well, I learned how to pronounce it and where Cajun music originated (in the once-French part of Louisiana) and who performed it; but the music seemed to me so uninteresting I reckoned I could live without it.</p>

Tolkova, Nizhegorod University, Nizhniy </F> Novgorod; UDC 535.317.1]    [Abstract] Reconstructing the image of an astronomical and  thus remote object seen through a distorting medium such as the  atmosphere is considered, specifically reconstructing the phases  of its spatial spectrum from closure phases obtained in one  exposure. A spectrum phase can be completely determined from two  interference patterns simultaneously recorded by two  interferometers with angular shifts _a_ and 2_a_  respectively.  These data are sufficient for determining the closure phases on  three basises forming an isosceles triangle whose base is longer  than its arms, each closure phase then representing a recurrence  relation. One known reconstruction algorithm (F. Roddier, C.  Roddier; OPTICAL COMMUNICATION, Vol. 60 No. 6, 1986) yields an  exact solution to recurrence equations in the form of an  infinite series on basis triangles shrinking toward the center  of the aperture with coefficients forming a geometric  progression, but gives no evidence about the convergence of this  solution and about its immunity to noise in the input data.  Another algorithm is therefore proposed which includes  determination of the permissible noise level in the input data.  First the plane of closure phases is constructed from the light  intensity distributions on two interference patterns with /2  and  angular shifts respectively. Next is formed the  combination k(u,v)= _b_(u,v) + _b_(v,-u) + _b_(u+v,v-u) of  bispetrum phases for reconstruction of the spectrum phases. The  problem of reconstructing the image from noisy input data is  solved by avoiding the inherent ill-conditioning of this  problem, namely by reconstructing not the absolutely exact image  of an object but the image most closely approximating it and,  therefore, by using the optimally long k-series which will  minimize the error at the given noise level. Both correctness  and effectiveness of this algorithm are confirmed by a numerical  experiment involving the image of letter T and the image of  letter C with superscript ++ (C[.sup]++[/]).

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL AND GAS FLOW NORMAL, LITHUANIA OFFICIALS REPORT  </P> <P> Oil and natural gas flowed normally into Lithuania today, officials of the  breakaway government said, despite Moscow's announced plan to halt the supplies  to curb the republic's independence drive.  </P> <P> Lithuanian officials said they had expected the Kremlin to begin cutting oil  and natural gas supplies early today to enforce Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's threatened economic embargo.  </P> <P> Soviet troops were seen near a pumping station at an oil refinery in  northwestern Lithuania this morning, but there was no change in the supply of  fuel at the facility, according to a report on Lithuanian television.  </P> <P> Lithuania's energy minister said oil supplies were normal and he had not been  informed of any planned reductions.  </P> <P> Lithuanian gas officials received a telegram late Monday from the acting  general director of the Soviet Union's western gas network saying natural gas  supplies would be "sharply reduced from the 17th of April."  </P> <P> On Friday, Gorbachev threatened to impose an embargo of critical supplies  unless Lithuania rescinded within 48 hours several laws meant to bolster its  March 11 declaration of independence. Lithuanian leaders have made no move to  meet Gorbachev's demands, but say they are willing to negotiate. Gorbachev  refuses to meet with them until they rescind their declaration of independence.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III today told the House Ways and Means  Committee that U.S. support for perestroika, Gorbachev's economic reform  program, is at risk.  </P> <P> "Our bilateral commercial contacts with the U.S.S.R. may be more directly in  their interest than in ours. And those contacts are being put to risk by Soviet  actions in Lithuania," Baker said.  </P> <P> Baker did not specify which commercial ties could be harmed if the Soviets  suppress the independence movement in the Baltic republic. But Senate minority  leader Bob Dole of Kansas and others in Congress who have taken a hard line  toward Moscow are suggesting a suspension of superpower trade talks.  </P> <P> Lithuania's parliament, the Supreme Council, met today to forge an official  response to the Soviet leader, and they were still debating the tone of the  resolution into the afternoon, said Rita Dapkus of the legislature's  Information Office. Also under sharp discussion was the composition of a  delegation to be sent to Moscow, she said.  </P> <P> Also today, a Soviet mental patient hijacked a plane in Moscow and forced it to  fly to Lithuania, saying he wanted to help the breakaway republic in its  independence struggle.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Radio Vilnius said the unidentified man, who carried a  package which he claimed contained explosives, surrendered quietly when the  plane landed in the Lithuanian capital. No weapons were found.  </P></p>

The delegation  consisted of Minister R.F. Botha (Minister of Foreign Affairs),  General George Meiring (Chief of the South African Defence  Force), and Messrs Mac Maharaj and Fanie van der Merwe of the  Management Committee of the TEC.    Minister Botha informed President Mangope that the South  African Government, acting in conjunction with the Management  Committee of the TEC had noted that:    1. The Government of President Mangope is no longer in  control    events in Bophuthatswana;    2. All effective administration has seized [as received] to    exist;    3. The civil service, including the police and army refuse  to    recognise the authority of the government of President    Mangope.    Accordingly, the SA Government in conjunction with the  Management Committee of the TEC had come to the conclusion that  President Mangope was no longer in charge of the administration  of Bophuthatswana.    In the circumstances the current South African Ambassador,  Professor Tjaard van der Walt has, as an interim measure, been  placed in charge of Bophuthatswana until such time as the South  African Government and the TEC agree upon the appointment of  stable administrative structures and the elections have been  held in terms of the 1993 constitution. Professor van der Walt  will meet the secretaries of all departments and other public  servants to ensure the immediate restoration of effective  administration.    The South African Defence Force (SADF) has been entrusted  with the task of maintaining law and order under the direction  of the South African Government acting in conjunction with the  TEC.    President Mangope, for his own safety and protection, will  be  secured by the SADF.    Citizens of South Africa, and all those resident in  Bophuthatswana, can now engage in free political activity and  participate without let or hinderance in the forthcoming  elections. We urge all to exercise the right in a peaceful and  orderly manner and with due regard to the urgent need for proper  administration to be established.    All public servants, the police and the army, including  those  dismissed by the government of President Mangope in the recent  weeks, are guaranteed their jobs, salaries and pensions and are  urged to co-operate with the interim administrator, return to  their duties and participate in the process of establishing  effective administration for the benefit of all citizens and  residents in the area. We urge all to enable a speedy return to  normality in all spheres of life.    We have taken these steps in the interest of good  governance,  sound and effective administration, protection of life and  property and in order to ensure that all are able to engage in  free and fair elections in an atmosphere of peace without any  intimidation in whatever form.</p>

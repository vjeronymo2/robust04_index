			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM ACCUSED IN HAZARDOUS WASTE CASE  </P> <P> A South Gate chemical firm was charged Tuesday with unlawfully bringing  hazardous waste into California in what the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office called the first such criminal prosecution in the state.  </P> <P> The Stauffer Chemical Co. allegedly transported 10,000 gallons of phosphorus  waste from Tennessee to the firm's South Gate facility, where it has been  stored in a railroad tanker car for two years.  </P> <P> If convicted on all 19 counts of unlawfully transporting, storing and trying to  dispose of the waste, Stauffer could be fined up to $20 million and ordered to  pay cleanup costs of $1.5 million.  </P> <P> Phosphorus waste is extremely dangerous because it can ignite if it comes into  contact with oxygen and will generate heat of up to 6,000 degrees, said William  Carter, the deputy district attorney handling the prosecution.  </P> <P> Such a fire would generate toxic smoke and fumes, and would be almost  impossible to extinguish, Carter said.  </P> <P> One of the most notorious phosphorus waste fires occurred five years ago in  Sparks, Nev., when a rail tanker caught fire. The only way to put out the blaze  was to bury the car, Carter said.  </P> <P> At Stauffer's plant in South Gate, employees first tried to eliminate the  phosphorus waste by burning it. They failed because they could get only a small  amount out of the tanker and some workers refused to help because of the danger  involved, Carter said.  </P> <P> Years ago, Stauffer manufactured phosphorus at its South Gate facility but has  since ceased, Carter said. The manufacturing portion of the plant was razed in  the early 1980s and all that is left on the site now is a distribution and  sales office.  </P> <P> Stauffer is owned by a French company, Rhone-Poulenc, whose American  headquarters is in Connecticut. Company officials could not be reached for  comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Arraignment on the charges is set for Sept. 5 in Los Angeles Municipal Court.  </P></p>

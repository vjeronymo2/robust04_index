The Service has reopened the comment period to ensure that the public may review and comment on significant comments and analyses received during the original public comment period, which was open from June 2, to December 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and materials must be received by January 26, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and materials concerning the original public comments and analyses should be submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Carlsbad Field Office, 2730 Loker Avenue West, Carlsbad, California 92008.

In its decision to the list the gnatcatcher, the Service relied, in part, on taxonomic studies conducted by Dr. Jonathan Atwood of the Manomet Bird Observatory, Manomet, Massachusetts. As is the standard practice in the scientific community, the Service did not request, nor was it offered, the data collected and used by Dr. Atwood in reaching his conclusions. Instead, the Service depended upon the conclusions published by Dr. Atwood in a peer-reviewed scientific article on the subspecific taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher (Atwood 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to a suit filed by the Endangered Species Committee of the Building Industry Association of Southern California and other plaintiffs, the United States District Court of the District of Columbia vacated the listing of the coastal California gnatcatcher because the Service did not make available Atwood's data for public review and comment. In response to the court decision, Dr. Atwood released his data to the Service, which the agency made available to the public for review and comment on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28508). On June 16, 1994, the court reinstated threatened status for the coastal California gnatcatcher until the Secretary of the Interior determines in a finding whether the listing should be revised or revoked in light of his review of the subject data and public comments received during the comment period. As a result of the court orders of July 27, 1994, and September 30, 1994, the Service extended the comment period to December 1, 1994, (59 FR 38426, 59 FR 44125, and 59 FR 53628). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

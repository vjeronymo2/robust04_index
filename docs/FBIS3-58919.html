Tsai] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Jan. 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Belgium have  decided to form a "quarantine task force" to facilitate  bilateral agricultural trade, the Taipei Economic and Cultural  Office in Brussels announced Wednesday [19 January].    Problems involving inspection and quarantine practices have  stood in the way of farm trade between Taiwan and Belgium, a  spokesman for the office pointed out, adding Belgian traders  have been longing to sell fresh flowers to Taiwan.    The quarantine task force will be composed of officials from  Belgium's Ministry of Agriculture and Taiwan's Council of  Agriculture, the spokesman said.    Meanwhile, he noted, the first meeting of the task force  will  be held in Taipei in April or May.</p>

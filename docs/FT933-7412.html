			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Caution on sterling DEALERS in the sterling interest rates market ended the week taking a rather less optimistic view about a near-term cut in UK base rates than they had at the start of it, writes James Blitz. Last Monday, the December short sterling contract was still above the 94.75 level, pricing at least  3/4 of a percentage point off base rates by the end of the year. But several events brought the contract down to a close last night of 94.56, a level which assumes that three-month money will be at 5.44 per cent by the year's end. The most important trigger for the downturn were bearish comments from Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who said on Wednesday that he did not want to lead people to think there would be a near-term easing in monetary policy. But sentiment about a rate cut has also been eroded by the speed of rate cutting in Europe. This has been slower than was expected when the exchange rate mechanism's currency fluctuation bands were widened. France has still not reduced any of its main official interest rates. However, some dealers think that the December contract is now fairly priced. This week's retail sales figures showed a slight fall in July and uncertainty remains about the pace of recovery in the UK. 'There are so many sales on in the West End that I would be astonished if there were no cut in rates by the end of the year,' said a dealer at a leading London house. Three month sterling cash has sat doggedly at 5 7/8 per cent all week. But the 6 and 12 month deposit rates have risen on the week, with the former closing at 5 21/32 per cent last night and the latter nearly at 5 7/8 per cent. There was a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn in the discount market and late assistance of Pounds 3.9m. French franc futures have risen strongly this week amid two cuts in the overnight rate by the Bank of France. The September French franc contract closed up 11 basis points yesterday at 93.27 and the December contract was up 3 at 93.31. The effects of summer tax payments were finally making themselves felt on German call money, which rose well above the Bundesbank's repo rate level of 6.80 per cent yesterday. Call money was quoted at 6.92 per cent yesterday, having been well below the repo rate level earlier in the week.</p>

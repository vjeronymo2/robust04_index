			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARMON OF MICHIGAN MADE A DIFFERENCE  </P> <P> Every person in radio and television sports broadcasting is able to do a better  job because of Tom Harmon. In 1958, he gathered together a group of sports  announcers to end the second-class citizenship under which we worked.  </P> <P> We had to wait outside press conference rooms after major sports events until  the print media representatives had concluded their questioning of players and  coaches. Then we were allowed to conduct a second press conference with  fatigued athletes. Getting locations at many sports events found us pushed away  from the center of action in favor of the print media.  </P> <P> That day we formed the Southern California Sports Broadcasters. Tom led the  fight to get us nothing more than equal opportunities to cover sports events  and press conferences. His name and his reputation, plus his announcing of  sports events from coast to coast, gave him many opportunities to carry on the  fight.  </P> <P> BILL WELSH  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

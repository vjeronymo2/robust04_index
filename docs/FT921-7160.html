			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / TUC plans cuts as membership falls: General-secretary Willis seeks to reduce staff numbers by up to a fifth THE Trades Union Congress is planning to cut staff numbers by up to a fifth as part of a package of cost-cutting measures forced on it by a steep decline in union members. Proposals include implementation for the first time of a programme for early retirement and voluntary severance among the 250-strong staff. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general-secretary, says in a paper to be discussed by union leaders today that there could be a deficit of more than Pounds 500,000 this year, against a targeted surplus of Pounds 500,000, unless action is taken. The document provides a graphic example of how the TUC and its affiliates are struggling to cope with growing membership losses on top of the 4m recorded since 1979, when they had a combined total of more than 12m. The planned staff cuts would be the second in two years. In the first programme, about 30 jobs were cut through natural wastage from a total staff of 280, the highest number ever. Mr Willis wants to trim the pay bill of about Pounds 2.5m by 20 per cent. He suggests a reduction in staff numbers and departments and a revised structure for senior posts. The plans were drawn up after a confidential survey of TUC affiliates' memberships. Although Mr Willis does not reveal the results in his report, two unions - the AEU engineers and the FTAT furniture workers - have admitted a 10 per cent decline in the past year and other unions are likely to be similarly affected. The TUC will suffer because the amount each affiliate pays to it each year is based on its membership. This year the affiliation fee for each member is Pounds 1.23. Mr Willis says the problems follow accumulated deficits since 1989 in the administration fund, used to run the TUC, of Pounds 1.165m. This has come from reserves which stand at Pounds 3.28m. The report, which will be discussed today by the TUC's finance and general purposes committee, says it is unlikely that an economic upturn will result in any real improvement in TUC affiliation numbers before 1995. It acknowledges that unions are unlikely to accept anything more than a modest increase in affiliation fees. These have already risen 23 per cent from the Pounds 1 a member of 1990. Mr Willis suggests the introduction of a formula for future affiliation fee rises based on the average rise in union subscription rates. He plans to take more detailed proposals to next month's finance and general purposes committee meeting with the intention of implementing changes 'as speedily as possible'.

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The Confederation of British Industry is decidedly gloomy about the UK's short-term economic outlook. But one consolation from yesterday's survey is that the impact of recovery on corporate earnings could be remarkable when it comes. With costs under control and two-thirds of respondents still operating below capacity, any revival in demand should produce a striking growth in margins. The benefit would, however, be felt more strongly in manufacturing than in the services sector, where companies have been less successful in controlling cost pressures. There is also a risk that it could be short-lived, as cuts in investment spending during the recession give rise to bottlenecks when it is over. The CBI is understandably anxious that the government should not make this problem worse by concentrating its spending cuts on investment projects. Sadly there is little, if any, historical precedent for a chancellor heeding such advice.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / French bank base rates cut to 9.85% THE FRENCH government yesterday followed the UK and engineered a cut in interest rates in a move which raised further questions about the anchor role of the D-Mark in the European Monetary System. The cut from 10.35 per cent to 9.85 per cent in the main French banks' base rates came just two days after Britain shaved borrowing rates by half a point. Both actions test the received wisdom that most EMS member countries have to keep interest rates substantially above those in Germany because of Bonn's good record on inflation. The theory that Germany's economic problems have weakened its pivotal role in the EMS was further bolstered by a strong performance by the French franc and the pound on currency markets, in spite of the cuts in borrowing rates. The D-Mark closed last night in London against the franc little changed at FFr3.3669, while the pound gained 1 1/2 pfennig to close at DM2.94. Both currencies were helped by the expected decision by the Bundesbank council to hold its emergency Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent. The pound also benefited from a decision by a big UK company to buy a large volume of sterling for dollars. France's base rate reduction came after the Bank of France announced a reduction in its reserve requirements  - the sums the banks are obliged to lodge with it  - while leaving its official intervention rates intact. The reserve requirement on current accounts have been cut from 4.1 to 1 per cent and on passbook savings accounts from 2 to 1 per cent. This should save the banks an estimated FFr31bn (Dollars 5.55bn) a month. Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said the reduction was intended to help small businesses by making it easier for them to obtain credit. Mr Sapin said it had been facilitated by 'moderate growth in demand for money' and low inflation. The reduction in French borrowing costs comes on the eve of an informal meeting of EC finance ministers in Oporto, Portugal, where the impact of interest rates on growth will be high on the agenda. The meeting has special importance for the French, having been initiated by Mr Pierre Beregovoy because of his concern about the EC's sluggish growth. Mr Beregovoy, previously finance minister, became prime minister last month. The relatively high level of interest rates is one of France's main economic problems. The government reduced its official intervention rate last autumn, only to be forced to raise it when the franc came under pressure. The consensus among economists is that France will not risk reducing the intervention rate again, despite the low level of inflation at 3 per cent, until the Germans do so. Currencies, Page 29</p>

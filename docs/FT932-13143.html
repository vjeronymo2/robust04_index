			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers as yen stabilises against dollar RENEWED buying by arbitrageurs and pension fund managers lifted equity prices in light volume, as the yen's rate against the dollar stabilised, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 112.84 higher at 19,704.15 - for a 2.9 per cent decline on the week - after trading between an intraday low of 19,554.86 and a high of 19,785.06. The Topix Index of all first section issues closed 9.66 higher at 1,532,69, while in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.21 to 1,209.77. Volume was estimated at 320m shares, compared with Thursday's final 382m. Declines led advances by 526 to 495, with 157 issues unchanged. Foreign exchange considerations eased after comments by Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, that the yen's advance against the dollar this week was an exaggerated response to recent remarks made by Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, that a rising yen was one way to reduce Japan's trade imbalance. Investors bought futures contracts as the yen's climb against the dollar slowed, triggering arbitrage-related buying, which carried over into the cash market. Equity prices are now expected to trade within a tight range, while turnover on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange is likely to remain light ahead of the Golden Week holiday at the end of next week. One analyst pegged the upside of the stock market at the 20,000 level, with support around 19,500. Investors bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which ended Y19,000 higher at Y912,000. Elsewhere, the stability of the yen boosted the consumer electronic sector. TDK gained Y70 to Y3,830, Matsushita Electric Y20 to Y1,330 and Sony Y10 to Y4,700. The financial sector also rose: Fuji Bank Y50 at 2,040, Mitsubishi Bank Y40 at 2,480 and the Bank of Tokyo Y30 at 1,290. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 42.19 to end at 21,408.03 in volume of 18.4m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday with profit-taking much in evidence. HONG KONG closed a volatile week marginally lower on profit-taking amid the Sino-British talks, due to end Son unday. The Hang Seng index fell 8.30 to 6,750.94, up a marginal 0.2 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to HKDollars 4.1bn from HKDollars 6.1bn. China Gas lost 30 cents to HKDollars 14.50 and HK Telecom shed 25 cents to HKDollars 9.95. China Light was unchanged at HKDollars 36.75 after reporting a rise in half-year net profit much in line with expectations. BANGKOK rose on heavy trading as investors regained confidence after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges for alleged share price manipulation. The SET index closed up 2.25 at 901.26, rising 1.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was Bt7.2bn, the highest in two months. KUALA LUMPUR gained ground on renewed interest in speculative stocks after a strong week. The composite index, which hit an all-time high of 701.32 during intra-day trading on Thursday, closed up 0.2 to 691.65, or 4.4 per cent on the week. Volume rose to 345.7m shares from 337.9m. SEOUL lost ground as profit-taking emerged following the week's rally. The composite index eased 1.89 to 735.70, but posted a 4 per cent advance from the previous week. TAIWAN was also easier as investors took profits on Thursday's gains, prompted by the passage of the copyright laws in parliament. The weighted index closed 62.44 lower at 4,569.25, rising 0.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was TDollars 42.3bn. NEW ZEALAND weakened on profit-taking after five successive rises with the NZSE-40 index falling 13.59 to 1,613.53. BOMBAY's fall gathered pace with the BSE index 58.29 lower at 2,100.67.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "It is unquestionable that there is corruption  within the Armed Forces, as in any other level of our civil  society." This remark was made yesterday by General Anibal Rejis  Romero (retired) during a break at the Armed Forces seminar that  is currently being held at the Chamber of Deputies building.    Gen. Rejis Romero and his colleague Mario Escobar  Anzoategui,  also retired, participated in the seminar on "International  Meeting on Military Issues," at the Chamber of Deputies, which  was also attended by Argentine and Paraguayan congressmen and  special guests.    Gen. Rejis Romero skirted round the issue of corruption  quite  craftily. He nonetheless acknowledged that "nowadays, thanks to  the invaluable help of the press, we are learning that some  members of the Armed Forces have also fallen into  corruption--that general so-and-so is well off, but  what's-his-name has this and that, etc. Nevertheless, the fact  that a sergeant, a captain, or maybe a colonel are involved in  corrupt practices does not give us the right to say that the  Armed Forces are racked by corruption. This is not so," he  warned.    He conceded that "we can all make a slip, but this is no  reason to implicate the entire Armed Forces. The Armed Forces  are too great and meritorious to mix them up with individual  actions," he said.    Later in the interview, the retired general said that a war  is being waged against corruption. "Have you not read that the  Army commander in chief has ordered the investigation of  criminal acts? A pre-trial inquest was ordered not long ago to  identify those guilty of smuggling logs out of the country,  after charges were made in Pacova, Canindyu District. A sergeant  was indicted for this crime, but this does not entitle us to  involve the Armed Forces as a whole in it," he explained.    Gen. Rejis Romero further stated that relations between the  military and the public are more intense at present because  there are many officers who are attending school. "This was  totally forbidden during the dictatorship. Things are different  now. The commander in chief allows officers to go to the  university, where they are brought into contact with other  citizens," he stated. Gen. Rejis Romero declined to answer a  question about the prevalence of authoritarianism in the  government's top echelons, saying that as he had been retired  for months, he had relinquished all official duties and was  therefore not abreast of current affairs. He later praised the  Army commander in chief and the military leadership.</p>

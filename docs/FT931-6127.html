			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Employers cut cash for pension funds MORE THAN half of British employers are using pension fund surpluses to reduce or eliminate their contributions to employee pension schemes, the National Association of Pension Funds has found. In its 1992 survey of pension schemes, the association found that 38 per cent of employers are making no contribution while another 16 per cent are making reduced contributions. A further 1 per cent have used scheme surpluses to refund cash to themselves. The figures show a rise from the 1991 survey when 47 per cent of schemes were on full or partial contributions holiday. Mr Mike Brown, the association's director of information, said the rise in contributions holidays showed the effects the recession was having on employers. 'They would rather use the money to pay their suppliers and staff,' he said. The question of whether employers should have the exclusive right to use scheme surpluses is among the most contentious issues under review by a government panel headed by Professor Roy Goode. The survey did not ask respondents whether contributions holidays have been accompanied by benefit improvements for scheme members. It covered 852 association members, covering roughly 40 per cent of all UK pension scheme members. Last year 19 per cent of employees eligible to join a scheme chose not to do so, compared with 16 per cent in 1991. Mr Brown said there may have been reasons other than disenchantment with occupational schemes which might account for the figure, such as the inclusion of part-time workers who may feel their earnings are too low to afford contributions. The survey also found no sign of a much-touted trend suggesting that employers are abandoning final-salary schemes in favor of money-purchase schemes. Mr Brown said: 'It's the sort of thing many people are talking about but very few are actually doing it.' Employers have threatened that, if the government imposes new regulations on occupational schemes, they will abandon them in favour of money-purchase schemes. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (14): Old fears, but a new enemy TURNING JAPANESE by Tim Jackson Harper Collins, Pounds 16.99, 254 pages FOR A British government faced with the brutal combination of a yawning trade gap and the worst recession since the war, there is a ray of hope in the gloom. Up and down the UK, brand new Japanese factories are turning out Toyota cars and Sony televisions for the export drive. But what if this benevolence masks a fiendish plot? What if the new European single market is to be overrun by the enemy within? As Tim Jackson's book points out, we have been here before. In 1968 Servan-Schreiber's Le defi americain raised the spectre of a Europe crushed by American industry. Then as now, the aggressor was supposed to have unfair advantages: cheap finance, better links with government and universities, and so forth. As Jackson also points out, this was not mere paranoia. The true pan-European car companies are now General Motors and Ford. The true pan-European computer company is IBM. The new threat is posed by an extraordinary surge of Japanese investment in Europe in the past decade. In 1985 new plants totalled 25. In 1989 the figure was 118 - more than had been established between the end of the war and 1979. 'What made all this frightening was partly the suddenness of Japan's move across the globe. But it was also the fact that the sectors in which Japanese companies appeared to be investing most aggressively - the car industry, computers and electronics - were precisely the same as those in which Europe felt itself most acutely lagging behind.' This is not all. 'It is chilling to note that many of the biggest Japanese companies have not merely built their transplants from scratch, but have also deliberately chosen sites far away from other companies in the same business. This suggests that they consider the problems of the existing industry so deeply ingrained that they outweigh all the advantages of joining it. There could be no more powerful reminder of how much European firms will have to unlearn when they try to reform themselves from within.' The thesis is thought-provoking, but not wholly proven. As Jackson says, the Japanese banks made as bad a botch of their expansion in the late 1980s as did their European rivals. In computing, the Americans are holding a commanding and increasingly important lead in software. In consumer electronics, by Jackson's account, the much-battered Philips is fighting its corner better than its wretched financial record suggests. And above all, the late 1980s were a very odd time for Japan and Japanese business. Jackson tackles the issue of the bursting of the financial bubble. But what he cannot yet say - nor, indeed, can anyone else - is whether the Japanese financial and industrial machine has suffered lasting damage; nor, indeed, how far the surge of European investment was merely a product of the bubble, rather than a long-term shift in strategy. But it does not do to quibble. The author has worked as a journalist in both Tokyo and Brussels and has an impressive grasp of many of the big issues facing global industry. His treatment of them is always clear and often illuminating. The manufacturer planning an international trip could do a lot worse than take a copy along.</p>

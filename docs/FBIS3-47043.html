			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Firmly resolving to form an alliance with Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], headed by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata,  on 31 December Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (representative  of the Japan New Party [JNP]) began to study the possibility of  establishing a joint group within the House of Representatives  or a united consultative body to discuss election cooperation  and other issues. He did so in anticipation of reorganization of  the political environment, which is expected to gather momentum  immediately following approval of the political reform bills.  Hosokawa ultimately aims to create a political system led by  "two major parties" by forming a political power base strong  enough to compete with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP].  Hosokawa envisions yet another new party to be formed from the  merger of the Japan New Party, Sakigake [Harbinger] (led by  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura), and Shinseito at  some point in the future. It will be different from the  "moderate multiparty system" of the past. Most JNP members and  some Sakigake members have already expressed support for  Hosokawa's plan. The prime minister's plan will inevitably have  a major impact on changes in the political scene. Since the  potential parties' merger is related to developments at Diet  deliberations on political reform bills, each party is likely to  be quite active when the extraordinary Diet session resumes.    The prime minister met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura  and other members of Sakigake at a Tokyo hotel on the evening of  31 December and exchanged opinions on political realignment,  including Hosokawa's idea on the merger of the three parties.    Reportedly, Takemura disapproved of the idea. However, it is  said that under Hosokawa's plan, the JNP and Sakigake would  merge as early as February after the end of the extraordinary  Diet session, according to sources close to Hosokawa; Shinseito  would join them later. With the JNP acting as an intermediary,  the three parties would form a nucleus later to be joined by  Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party, LDP members who desire  political reform, and liberal reform-minded members of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ].    Hosokawa devised these plans for the following reasons: 1)  it  is necessary to consolidate a power base within the ruling  coalition parties to prevent the LDP from regaining power; 2)  because both the JNP and Shinseito are new conservative parties,  there are few differences between the parties' political ideas  and basic policies; and 3) if the heiretsu formula of combining  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation is  introduced to the lower house as a result of the Diet's passage  of the political reform bills, the change will likely initiate a  shift toward a system featuring two large parties.    In this connection, a senior official of the JNP who is  close  associate of the prime minister clearly stated the following in  a YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview on 31 December: "It appears that  the prime minister is planning for an eventual grand merger  among all ruling coalition parties. However, for the time being  at least, he wants his party to merge with Shinseito."    When he met with Satsuki Eda, director general of the  Environment Agency, on 26 December, the prime minister  reportedly touched on the issue of reorganizing the political  world, saying: "A merger with Sakigake only is too small. I am  of the view that a greater change will occur." Eda plans to  actively take part in such a reorganization.    The JNP and Shinseito formed a joint group within the House  of Representatives (which was also joined by the Democratic  Reform Parliamentary Group) in November 1993. It is said that  they formed the group in "preparation for a future merger,"  (according to a senior JNP official).    However, Takemura makes a clear distinction between his  party  and the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. Therefore, it is said that he  aims to form a coalition with LDP members who want political  reform and other groups after the merger with the JNP.  Reportedly, Takemura is wary of the idea of forming an alliance  with Shinseito.    From this stance, Takemura tried to reconcile different  views  at the 31 December meeting. The prime minister explained his  position: "It does not mean that I promised to form a merger  with Shinseito. However, as Sakigake and the JNP unite together,  we must give due consideration to Shinseito." In this way, he  explained his view of tackling the issue of merging Sakigake and  JNP while keeping an eye on the possibility of forming a merger  with Shinseito.    However, Takemura and some Sakigake members are not  favorably  disposed toward Shinseito, which played a central role in LDP  politics. Some JNP members disagree with Shinseito's political  style as well. It can be said that the prime minister's concept  will have a subtle impact on the issue of the merger between the  JNP and Sakigake.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / BT to cut 1,187 operator jobs BRITISH Telecommunications is to shut 10 of its 29 telephone operator centres with the loss of 1,187 jobs. The company said some of the job cuts were included in last year's announcement of a plan to cut 30,000 jobs over the two years to March 1995. About 8,000 operators, mainly working on directory inquiries, will be left after the latest cuts. But BT said last night that the company had not ruled out further job losses. Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the Union of Communication Workers, said last night that the news came as a 'devastating blow'. He added: 'These closures are on a far greater scale than we could possibly have expected.' BT said the company hoped to achieve the staff reduction through non-replacement and redeployment, without having to resort to any compulsory redundancies. It added that the main reason for the cuts in the number of centres stemmed from the decline in the number of calls being made by customers needing help. The union claims this is because BT now charges for this service but the company believes the decline in demand stems partly from improvements in the telephone network and from the greater use of pay phones. The centres to be closed are at Chester, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Kettering, Leeds, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton and Taunton. The latest job cuts are likely to intensify the dangers of industrial disruption this autumn, union officials claimed. The union is already urging all BT operators to support calls for a strike ballot in preparation for industrial action. This is in protest at planned cuts in operators' allowances and benefits. A union conference is planned for next week where delegates are expected to endorse the leadership's strike call by agreeing to the calling of a ballot. Mr Johnson said that the union was concerned that the rundown in the number of the operator centres would reduce the quality of BT's service to the customer. Last month it was revealed that BT may move as many as 18,000 office jobs out of central London under a relocation strategy being considered by an internal review team. The move would leave only about 2,000 posts in central London. The relocation is aimed at rationalising BT's substantial office holdings and could save the company up to Pounds 44m in London-weighting payments.</p>

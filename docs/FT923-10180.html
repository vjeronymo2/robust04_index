			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Red faces on Britain's blackest day The British Olympic Association's vigorous anti-drugs policy left it in an embarrassing position yesterday. It caught three of its own team and had to expel them from the Games in the glare of world attention. The three - sprinter Jason Livingston and weightlifters Andrew Davies and Andrew Saxton - had been tested as part of the BOA's random drugs testing programme. Competitors are tested without notice at training or at home. The first they know about it is often a knock at the door. Livingston was the best-known of the three, because athletics is such a high-profile sport. Livingston, from London, was second in the world junior championships in 1990. After that it seemed that he failed to grow enough to realise his promise. He was 5ft 6in in a sport where a good big 'un always beats good little 'uns. This year, however, Livingston's performances improved sharply. He equalled the European 60m record and cut his 100m best to 10.09secs. His short, stocky build made him look a bit like Ben Johnson, the hulking Canadian who finished first in the 100m in Seoul but then failed a drug test and was dubbed sport's biggest-ever cheat. Livingston shaved his head to emphasise his resemblance to Johnson. Linford Christie, Britain's 100m silver medallist in Seoul and Livingston's training partner, even nicknamed him 'Baby Ben.' The official games profile says that Livingston 'imitates the way Johnson starts and his room is full of posters of the Candian.' It seems that imitation went to far. Livingston's disgrace was seen as good news in some quarters. Bob Inglis said yesterday that he resigned as Britain's national sprint event coach after the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland. 'On the basis of what I could see, I anticipated this kind of situation and I wanted to distance myself from the sport. "There will be other sprinters with higher levels of anxiety than yesterday, and not just in the British team.' The world of sprinting, said Inglis, was 'pretty unsavoury.' 'In the last ten years I have found no legitimate way to move sprinters into the area of performance you see regularly on television.' Inglis said it was possible to guess which athletes were using drugs. 'When you see no body fat and when you take that with the improvement of times over 12 months you can have a reasonable guess.' Dick Palmer, British Olympic chef de mission, was at pains to stress yesterday that Britain's drugs testing programme was not a mechanism for ensuring that drug-takers were clean before the Games, but was intended to eliminate drug use. Yesterday, Primo Niebolo, president of the International Amateur Athletics Federation, claimed the federation was doing its best. 'We are making a great battle but there are too few laboratories in the world. There are none in Africa, just three in Asia and only one in South America.' Tony Ward, of the British Athletic Federation, called on the IAAF and the International Olympic Committee to establish an international random drugs testing programme. Soon, sportsmen and women everywhere could hear a knock on the door. Prior to yesterday, Britain's sports associations professed pride in their relatively clean records. In 1989 Britain was a signatory to the Europan Anti-Doping Convention, which agreed on the need to introduce random, out-of-competition testing without advance warning. Earlier this month, Wally Holland, secretary of the British Amateur Weightlifting Association, said he believed Britain was 'getting on top' of steroid abuse in weightlifting, generally regarded as the sport in which drug use is most prevalent. In international weightlifting competitions now, Holland says that up to 40 per cent of competitors are tested. But he has also admitted that the temptations of new types of drugs are enormous. 'The trouble is keeping up with new methods of doping. If I came up with a new drug tomorrow that would increase chances of winning, but also had chances of killing a competitor, I would still find plenty of people willing to take it.' Clenbuterol, the drug that put Andrew Saxton and Andrew Davies out of Olympic competition, is one of the most popular of a new generation of performance-enhancing drugs. It was originally developed as an asthma medication. Despite Saxton's and Davies' contentions that they employed it to relieve bronchial conditions, its main interest to athletes lies in two key qualities. The first is its fat-burning ability. In its chemical composition Clenbuterol, a non-steroid drug, is related to adrenalin, a hormone naturally secreted by the body. Like adrenalin - which is released only in periods of stress - Clenbuterol stimulates the burning of large quantities of fatty acids in the blood. Clenbuterol also has strong anabolic, muscle-building properties. Without the side effects of steroids - hair loss, acne and testicular shrinking - it has a stronger effect than many steroids and pays a quick muscle-building bonus. Although there is general condemnation of drug abuse, there are individuals within many groups who have an interest in keeping drug abuse under cover: athletes and their trainers, sports federations and national sports committees wanting to avoid embarrassment, and commercial sponsors and advertisers. To work, say reformers, testing must be fairly and uniformly applied by all national and international sporting bodies.</p>

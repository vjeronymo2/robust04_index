			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPARATIONS FOR BLACK AMERICANS  </P> <P> It was with growing anger that I read the article (Metro, Dec. 10) detailing  Robert Brock's desire for "reparations" for black Americans.  </P> <P> To say that I, a 26-year-old white American, am responsible for things done to  long dead black Americans by equally long dead white Americans is an affront to  intelligence.  </P> <P> Brock would have, I suppose, all white Americans have a special tax levied on  them because of their race. This would be done in order to punish white people  for the sins of their race. Is this not the worst sort of racism? Is this not  the same of thinking that Hitler had toward the Jews?  </P> <P> Rather than ever submit to a plan like Brock's, I would die fighting it.  </P> <P> What still amazes me is that you at The Times would run this trash.  </P> <P> MARK EDWARD NOONAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

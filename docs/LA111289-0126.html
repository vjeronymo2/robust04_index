			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRANADA AVENUE LAUNCH RAMP RULES CHANGED TO ALLOW JET SKIS  </P> <P> The Parks and Recreation Marine Bureau has changed the use of the Granada  Avenue beach launch ramp in Belmont Shore to allow for personal watercraft,  which the Coast Guard describes as jet propelled vessels under 10 feet long,  mainly jet skis. The ramp had been reserved for sailboats, which are no longer  allowed.  </P> <P> The following rules will apply on a trial basis through the end of the year:  </P> <P> The launch area is marked by orange, steel-ball buoys at the east and west  boundaries. The farthest seaward buoy of the eastern boundary is white. The  buoys are not to be used as a slalom course.  </P> <P> There will be no overnight stays or camping, no parking or leaving vehicles on  the ramp, no dogs, no alcoholic beverages, and no driving on the beach.  </P> <P> All operators must observe inland rules for prevention of collision at sea,  safe vessel operation and all applicable California boating laws.  </P> <P> The launch area will be open from 8 a.m. to dusk and will be supervised by  lifeguards. There will be a $5 launch fee per vehicle and trailer, according to  Mike Little, marine operations officer.  </P></p>

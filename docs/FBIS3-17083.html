			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 23 Mar -- We appeal to the sides for a  political solution to the Korean peninsula problem, questions  must be tackled by political and diplomatic measures, the  ITAR-TASS correspondent was told today by a high-ranking  representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian  Federation. The efforts of Russian diplomacy are directed at  this. We are in contact with all the sides. The heat of  passion should be lowered. Russia is firmly pursuing the line  of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, including on the Korean  peninsula.    Replying to a question regarding the possibility of economic  sanctions by the international community against the DPRK, which  is suspected of developing nuclear weaponry, the Russian  diplomat noted that the problem of sanctions did not yet stand  on a practical plane. Sanctions are an extreme measure after  all political possibilities have been exhausted, he stressed in  conclusion. [passage omitted]</p>

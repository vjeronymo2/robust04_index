			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / People: Avon Rubber plumps for Willcox Tony Mitchard, who worked his way through the ranks at Avon Rubber from clerk to chief executive, is to bow out this December at the age of 60 after more than 40 years at the tyre and motor components company. He will be replaced by the head of Avon's industrial polymers division, Stephen Willcox, 47, (above). The succession was decided after months of deliberation by a board torn between Willcox and the finance director, John Harper. In the end, Willcox, who joined Avon as a graduate trainee in 1968 and only left briefly for a stint at Miles Laboratories, won the race by a nose. While the appointment was welcomed in the City, some suggest the new regime would face greater pressure to perform. 'We do not mind who is running it as long as he does better than has been done in the past,' says one analyst. 'There has been a regular deferment of profits growth . . . and as a result a degree of impatience about the performance.' Mitchard, whose outgoing style contrasts sharply with the quieter approach of Willcox, is widely credited with having transformed Avon from a sleepy UK industrial group. However, the group's purchase of Cadillac Rubber and Plastics in the US in 1988 took longer than expected to bring benefits, partly because of recession but because of its dependence on a few automobile manufacturers.</p>

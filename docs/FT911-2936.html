			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Air France in talks with Sabena AIR FRANCE, Europe's largest airline in terms of sales, yesterday confirmed it was in talks about a possible co-operation deal with Sabena, the Belgian carrier, while announcing heavy losses for 1990. 'Yes, there are currently talks, nothing more and nothing less,' said Mr Bernard Attali, the Air France chairman. The French company became the latest carrier to announce a heavy loss for 1990. It warned that the deficit was continuing to increase in the current year. Air France revealed a net FFr717.2m (Pounds 71.22m) loss for last year, its first trading period since the merger with its two main domestic competitors  -UTA, which flies to Asia and Africa, and Air Inter, the internal French carrier. Earlier this year, Sabena and British Airways revived an attempt to create a new European airline. Last year, the Sabena World Airlines venture with BA and KLM was wound up, mainly because of the Belgian airline's financial problems. Mr Pierre Godfroid, Sabena's chairman, in February described the talks as being based on 'a very concrete proposal'. He said the plan would already have gone ahead but for the Gulf war. But BA indicated at the time that there was little prospect of agreement being reached soon. Since then, the Belgian government - which owns 52 per cent of Sabena - has approved a more than Dollars 1bn reflotation plan for the airline, to be financed or underwritten by the state. This has lengthened the list of potential suitors, which include SAS and Lufthansa, as well as Air France. Air France estimated that the collapse in air travel since the Gulf crisis had cost the group FFr3.3bn by the end of March. The cost to Air France alone - not including its two new subsidiaries - was FFr1bn in the first quarter of this year, it said. 'If the war is over, the crisis is not,' warned the group.</p>

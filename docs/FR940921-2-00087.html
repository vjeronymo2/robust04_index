MTA will ensure that the EIS also satisfies the requirements of the Maryland Environmental Policy Act (MEPA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This effort will be performed in cooperation with the Montgomery County Department of Transportation (MCDOT). Other key supporting agencies include the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG), the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), and the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M&hyph;NCPPC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS will evaluate transportation improvements in the corridor between the central business districts (CBDs) in Bethesda and Silver Spring, Maryland. In particular, the focus will be on the former CSX Railroad Georgetown Branch right-of-way (ROW) which has been purchased by Montgomery County. Additionally, the corridor will connect the Bethesda and Silver Spring Metrorail stations located in the respective CBDs. In addition to a proposed transitway, which may be either a busway or light rail transit in conjunction with a parallel hiker/biker trail, the EIS will evaluate the No-Build and the Transportation System Management (TSM) alternatives and any new alternatives generated through the scoping process. Scoping will be accomplished through correspondence with interested persons, organizations, and federal, state, and local agencies, and through a public meeting.

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: IBJ forms 'bad loans' specialist The Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ) announced yesterday the joint establishment with a number of other financial institutions of a company specifically intended to help liquidate bad loans. Port Island Acceptance Limited Liability, based in Kobe, will formally come into existence today. The company will begin accepting in September the problem loans to 10 non-banking companies affiliated with Hyogo Bank, a troubled regional bank. It will be the first 'special purpose company' since the ministry of finance allowed the establishment of such companies in February. Banks with loans to the non-banks will be able to transfer to the new company some of the principal on which interest rates have been cut, allowing them to write off the balance as tax-free losses. The IBJ and its affiliated companies will be the major shareholders in the company. Other subscribing companies will include The Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp, the Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo Life Insurance and Nippon Life Insurance. The company will be headed by Mr Takao Suzuki, of the IBJ's business co-ordination department. The scale of the discount at which loans will be transferred to the new company is not yet clear, but analysts believe it could be as high as 40 per cent.</p>

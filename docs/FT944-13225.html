			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Observer: High achiever The chattering classes in the City of London know all about PosTel boss Alastair Ross Goobey, 48, and Matthew Oakeshott, 47, co-founder of Olim money managers. Both learnt their trade managing the Courtaulds pension fund. However, few have heard of the man who came before and after them  - John Evans, 59, who steps down at the end of the year. Of the three, Evans probably turned in the best long-term performance. During his stint on the bridge, the fund has outperformed its peer group by about 1 1/2 per cent a year. Might sound peanuts, but it is the equivalent of nearly Pounds 20m a year, or about a tenth of Courtaulds' profits. Rather than a gold watch for 28 years' service, perhaps Courtaulds should reward Evans with a performance-related pension?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 3 -- Senator Jan Mulak was reelected  leader of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) on the second day of  the 30th PPS congress on Tuesday. According to PPS press  spokesman Andrzej Ziemski the congress marked the final stage in  the unification of the independent PPS, the reborn PPS and Jan  Mulak's PPS. Leaders of all the fractions were elected to the  party leadership.    The PPS led by Piotr Ikonowicz which has 3 parliamentary  deputies was not represented at the congress. Miroslaw  Krajewski who was elected chairman of the central executive  committee hoped that Ikonowicz's PPS and the "Freedom, Equality,  Independence" group would unite with the unified PPS during the  second round of the congress in autumn.    The PPS supports the reform of the hitherto existing system  in Poland wanting a far-reaching economic transformation. It  does not accept that this has to be accompanied by growing  poverty and stark social inequalities.    "If we do not work out a democratic method of social  agreement for solving the most difficult problems we are  threatened with the danger of anarchy or authoritarian  government," the party programme states.    Krajewski blamed the government coalition for the current  strikes. Guest at the congress, OPZZ Union Federation leader  Ewa Spychalska said that Solidarity and the OPZZ had the same  matters to sort out but Solidarity's methods (i.e. widespread  strikes) were unacceptable.    Another guest at the congress, former OPZZ leader, now  leader  of the Movement of Working People (RLP), Alfred Miodowicz,  stressed that the left had no character and that it apologised  too much. Krajewski, who is a Democratic Left Alliance (SLD)  parliamentary deputy, said that various colourful and  well-defined groupings needed to be formed within the SLD if it  was not to fall apart.    On Monday Mulak had stressed that the 30th congress was a  continuation of the tradition of struggle for independence and  socialism (the first PPS congress was held in 1892).</p>

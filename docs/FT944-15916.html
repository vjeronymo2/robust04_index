			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Motoring: A-plus for effort, B-plus for the car - Stuart Marshall believes Chrysler's compact competitor will mature like a young wine Chrysler deserves an A-plus for effort with its Neon compact car. Here we have an American manufacturer, known best for its millions of standard-size US automobiles, Jeeps and mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles), challenging Europe and Japan at their own game. By US standards, the Neon is a small car (although medium sized in European and Japanese eyes). A four-door saloon that seats four to five people, it is larger than a Ford Escort but a little smaller than a Mondeo. The 132 horsepower, two-litre, four-cylinder engine drives the front wheels though a five-speed gearbox. Suspension is all-independent, power steering and two air-bags are standard, and the styling is clean and vaguely mid-Atlantic. The Neon is innocent of chromium-plated excesses. Inside, it looks sober enough to please German buyers, although the well-shaped seats yield comfortably in the Italian style. The driving position is excellent - a tilt-adjustable steering wheel helps - and the gear-shift is light and positive. Head-room is ample and all-round visibility good. The only features Europeans will find unfamiliar are the old-fashioned push-pull lighting switch on the fascia, and a clutch pedal that has to be depressed before the starter will operate. (US car-makers had bruising experiences with insurance claims from owners careless enough to have started in gear and driven though garage walls.) A day spent driving a Neon in Germany left me with mixed feelings. On the plus side, the ride and handling felt strictly European because the suspension has been developed to suit tastes on this side of the Atlantic. (American buyers get a similar suspension only on the sportiest Neon. The standard car there is sprung much more softly to cope with broken road surfaces.) It was a reasonably lively performer, although I would have expected more muscularity from a two-litre engine in a modestly-sized car. But the most important thing was that, within five minutes of moving off, I felt completely at home. On the debit side, it lacked the refinement buyers have come to expect of European and Japanese cars in the Neon's class. In town, the engine was flexible - due, in part, to low gearing (about 20mph/32kph per 1000rpm in top) - but it sounded quite strident when accelerating and fussy when cruising on the autobahn at 80mph (130kph) and over. The transmission whined and, especially at low speeds, was affected by what is known in the trade as shunt; that is, it jerked when going from power-on to power-off because the engine rocked on its mountings. The Neon is being sold in mainland Europe now but will not arrive in Britain with right-hand steering until the end of next year - its first UK appearance will be at the London Motor Show in October 1995. By that time, Chrysler should have removed the irritations and be on the way to realising the Neon's potential as competition for established marques. Apart from Fords and Opels, Renaults and Peugeots, Nissans, Toyotas and Hondas, rivals will include such cars as the Korean-made Hyundai Lantra. But Chrysler Jeep Imports UK - which, in the past year, has beaten all expectations with its sales of petrol-engined Jeep Wranglers and Cherokees in a 4x4 market dominated by diesels - thinks the Neon will appeal to buyers looking for something a bit different. Price will be the key. When the Neon gets to Britain early in 1996, an educated guess puts the target figure for a basic right-hand drive model at about Pounds 10,000. A top of the range model loaded with every extra, including air-conditioning, might be just under Pounds 13,000. At that, a Neon could look attractive as an alternative to something more conventional. As a car, I give it only a B-plus at the moment but, like a young wine, it will mature. Nor should one under-rate the customer appeal of its Chrysler name - one of the oldest and most famous in car-making - and American provenance.</p>

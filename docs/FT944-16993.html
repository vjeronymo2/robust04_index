			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Mucous membrane injury claims to be reviewed Campaigners pressing for compensation for sufferers of mucous membrane disease caused by exposure to industrial irritants claimed a breakthrough yesterday. Welfare rights workers who launched a drive to alert sufferers to their potential eligibility to compensation said new medical evidence on the condition meant that cases previously rejected by the Department of Social Security would be re-examined. The campaigners, who have already helped win about Pounds 500,000 compensation from the DSS for people in the Wearside area, estimated that the eventual total in their area alone could run into many millions of pounds, with up to 10,000 cases being re-examined. Awards so far include lump-sum payments ranging from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 20,000. Successful claims may also result in weekly disablement pension payments and reduced earnings allowances. The Benefits Agency said it understood more medical evidence about the disease had become available. Previously unsuccessful claims could be reviewed on production of new evidence, but this did not necessarily mean decisions would be reversed. The campaign was launched by the Trades Union Congress Unemployed Centre in Sunderland two years ago, in conjunction with Sunderland City Council's social services department. Industrial hygiene specialists from Newcastle upon Tyne University and ear, nose and throat surgeons from Sunderland Royal Infirmary and Newcastle's Freeman Hospital have been involved in collecting data on the disease.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Arab Opinion" column by Mahmud al-Rimawi: "Siege and </F> Negotiations"]    [Text] Does the request made by some esteemed deputies to  suspend the Jordanian-Israeli talks until the United States,  through the UN Security Council, publicly and practically lifts  the siege imposed on the port of al-'Aqabah seem "exaggerated"  since the negotiations are being held with Tel Aviv and not  Washington? The answer is no.    The United States is the godfather of the settlement and  negotiations are being held on its territory. Because of this,  a U.S. delegation, led by Dennis Ross, is touring the Arab  capitals to expedite the negotiations. The Americans themselves  consider their role in the peace process a full-partner role.  But such a partnership cannot hold when Washington is appeasing  and blindly siding with the Israeli occupiers. It even  pressures the Arab parties, including Jordan, under the pretext  of its stand on the war in the Gulf; a war that ended more than  three years ago and in which Jordan played no role.    As far as we know, several U.S. promises were given over the  past two years to lift the unjust siege imposed on the port of  al-'Aqabah, Jordan's only maritime outlet to the world. These  promises have not been realized at all, even while the U.S.  statements were praising the responsible Jordanian role on more  than one level, inducing its role in the peace process. This  situation dictates a legitimate Jordanian stand in the face of  the violations, which threaten the rights of sea navigation and  trade and which cause major damage to the Jordanian economy.    These challenges are not founded on international law or the  resolutions of international legitimacy. They are brought about  by a U.S. decision aimed at pressuring Jordan and influencing  its steadfastness and stability. This will later reflect on the  course of the negotiations, where Israeli intransigence  continues on the Jordanian-Israeli track of negotiations as well  as on other tracks.    Consequently, if Washington is truly concerned--and so far  it  is not--about the stability and growth of the Jordanian-U.S.  relationship and for the resumption of negotiations in an  appropriate atmosphere, then there has to be a swift U.S.  decision to lift the unfair and illogical siege imposed on the  only Jordanian port. It also requires pressuring Tel Aviv, the  aggressor party, to abide by the resolutions of international  legitimacy and start implementing them by withdrawing from the  occupied territories, including the Jordanian territory. This  will herald the beginning of a new age in the region; an age  that guarantees the rights and interests of all parties without  exception; and an age that ends once and for all the use of  force or the threat of the use of force, as Israel has always  done. Israel is the only state in the region that carries out  military infringement and violations under the very eyes of the  United States, and collects limitless support from it as well.</p>

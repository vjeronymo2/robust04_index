			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Anti-apartheid leader Nelson R. Mandela told his family during a five-hour  birthday reunion that he will not be freed from prison in South Africa this  year, his wife said. "His exact words were: 'There will be no release,  definitely not this year,' " Winnie Mandela said outside the Victor Verster  Prison Farm where the black African National Congress leader is held. "On his  personal agenda his release will be the last item," Mrs. Mandela said. "He  wants freedom for his political views."  </P></p>

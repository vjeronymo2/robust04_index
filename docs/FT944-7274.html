			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Arts: The British take the Met by storm - New York thrills to Graham Vick's Shostakovich and Bryn Terfel's voice The Brits are the talk of the town. Not just on Broadway - where Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard has opened to respectable reviews, mainly on the strength of Glenn Close's performance as Norma Desmond. Not just in the art world, which has been saluting two influential British potters, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper, in their first major American show at the Metropolitan Museum. Nor has the talk been confined to Manhattan's many musical Anglophiles, who have been treated over the past two weeks to well-prepared performances of Nicholas Maw's Odyssey and Rutland Boughton's The Immortal Hour. No, the real buzz has centred on the New York debuts of Bryn Terfel and Graham Vick. Terfel, who sang in Le nozze di Figaro at the Metropolitan Opera and gave a recital with James Levine, was an overnight sensation. There have been chat-show appearances, a profile in Time magazine and a spread in the New York Times, which crowned him 'the next Wotan'. The bass-baritone from rural north Wales, still in his 20s, seemed unspoilt by riches and stardom - which only added to the charm of a story tailor-made for the American public. Meanwhile, Vick's uproariously sophisticated staging of Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk turned the Met's image on its head: for once there was real drama on stage and a sense of intellectual engagement among the audience. Add Maria Ewing's kittenish Katerina and a hair-raising orchestral performance under James Conlon - and you have a milestone in the work's history. This is the kind of 'modern' repertory one expects to be championed by New York City Opera rather than the Met, where anything after Turandot is anathema. In fact, a touring production of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk visited the Met for a single performance in 1935 - a year after the St Petersburg premiere - since when the opera might never have existed, judging by the reaction of New York's audiences, musicians and critics. So the new production has been blissfully cathartic, for the company as much as its public: 20th century opera is OK after all, it can be interesting and funny, it sells well, and why have we waited so long for this to happen? Perhaps Levine and his board of directors can now be persuaded to take glasnost an inch further, and open the Met's door to other artistic luminaries of our fast-receding century. Of course, it could all have gone disastrously wrong. Vick's decision to modernise the setting, to choreograph the orchestral interludes and punctuate the drama with Pop art and construction-site machinery, was a huge risk. His courage was rewarded. The staging, a mixture of real and surreal, of macabre farce and absurd fantasy, had the same perspicacious imagination that characterises Shostakovich's music. Here was a tale of passion, greed and brutality, mercilessly parodied. Paul Brown's permanent set was a painted skyscape, slung diagonally across the stage in the shape of a room. The refrigerator, television and saloon car - not to mention the dated appeal of Katerina's rose-patterned dress - could have been 1960s middle America, were it not for the icon on the wall, the workers' red scarves, the socialist tower-blocks and neo-Stalinist riot police. The beauty of it all was that the images were never specific. The message was timeless, universal - and devastatingly true-to-life. The wrestling and whipping, for example, were far more realistic than the tame expressionism served up in most European stagings. And the equally combative seduction scene had a frantic abandon reminiscent of The Postman Always Rings Twice - except that a giant rose wafted up (love blossoming) and the fridge door burst open at the climax, puncturing the tension with laughter. That was typical of the whole evening - and the Met audience did not need Russian to get the jokes (there were no surtitles). Vick's sense of comic timing was immaculate. His sense of tragedy was not so keen. The last act was an anti-climax, partly because the setting was a spotless contemporary gulag, partly because the action was reduced to naked convention. Where the staging sagged, Shostakovich's music came into its own. Conlon lent extra savagery to the brass batteries by having the players line up in costume on a stage gallery. The impact was chilling - even if the more private moments were underplayed. That was entirely in keeping with a production which refused to caricature the minor characters or beatify Katerina. Ewing bore the sultry, sexy, self-conscious look of the girl who cannot help attracting male attention. The voice is as problematic as ever - sometimes no more than a high-pitched wail - but she was never less than audible, and her whole performance was enthralling. Vladimir Galouzine, a name new to me, was the perfect Sergei: macho and musical, with a rapier voice and the cheeky swagger that goes with a lack of scruple. Mark Baker made an impressive Zinovy, looking more like a workaholic provincial contractor than a wimpish husband. Sergei Koptchak was the foul-mouthed Boris. The smaller parts were strongly cast. The previous evening saw a revival of Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 production of Don Giovanni, stiffly conducted by Leopold Hager. Here we returned to the Met of international repute - museum opera in all its gormless, decorative inertia. You could almost read the production-book as the singers took up position for their arias. On one score alone, Zeffirelli deserves credit: he never forgets the giocoso element. As in Lady Macbeth, the audience had no need of surtitles to pick up the laughs. But this was hardly the environment for deft ensemble or individual imagination. The title role was sung by James Morris, one of the few world-class Wagner singers who can sing Mozart with authority. He made a tall, handsome, old-fashioned seducer. Sharon Sweet was the big, blowsy Donna Anna, Carol Vaness a refined Donna Elvira, Stanford Olsen a small-scale Don Ottavio. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo made a subdued local debut as Masetto. The main attraction of the revival was to have been Terfel's Leporello - but he was forced to withdraw at the last moment because of back problems (Herbert Perry substituted). According to Terfel's associates, he may have a slipped disc and require an operation. Coming so soon after his Met debut this is a cruel blow. But it is surely no more than a temporary one, for his debut performances have built a huge reserve of goodwill. Assessing his Figaro in glowing terms, the New York Times said there was 'a bit of the rustic in Mr Terfel which he uses with the savviness of an urbanite'. About his all-German recital, the paper said he had 'a poet's affinity for words and their underlying worlds of colour and emotion'. All America now wants to hear him and there is talk of a Carnegie Hall recital. It is now up to Terfel to decide how fast he wants his career to move. He has the kind of once-in-a-generation talent which Columbia Artists Management Inc, the American music industry mogul, would love to get its hands on. If he is sensible, he will remain loyal to his Cardiff agent and continue at his own steady pace. He has already agreed to sing Wozzeck for Abbado and Stein at Salzburg in 1997, and he will record Wagner for Deutsche Grammophon. But contrary to New York's expectations, let us hope he does not become 'the next Wotan' - or the one after that.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo at the </F> closing ceremony of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 15 June -- recorded]    [Text] His Majesty, President of Portugal, heads of state  and governments of Ibero-American countries, foreign ministers,  representatives of international organizations, members of  delegations, ladies and gentlemen:    In 1594, exactly 400 years ago, Bautista Antonelli, a  military engineer in the service of Philip II began constructing  the wall and fortifications that would protect this city from  the appetites of the pirates and filibusters that marauded the  Caribbean during those times. For two centuries Cartagena de  Indias was fortified until it became the architectonic patrimony  of mankind we know today. Fortunately, as time passed its use  has changed, and its defensive walls are now a warm refuge for  evening lovers. In this enchanting city, the memory of Fernando  Claver becomes a permanent lesson of philantrophy. In this  city, Bolivar dreamed of a single America as the epicenter of  liberty and equality. Here, Cesar Gaviria, your delighted host  who for the last time has attended this Ibero-American summit as  Colombian president, has been honored to share with you the  commitment, responsibility, and dignified task of molding the  present and near future of our nations. This task can be no  other than advancing as brothers in building a new political,  social, and economic order capable of eliminating inequality,  eradicating violence, and promoting culture, solidarity,  respect, and knowledge to create a new Ibero-American man proud  of what he is, what he has, and what he can obtain in the future.    This has been an inspiring and pleasant task, which we have  all fulfilled for the benefit of our compatriots, without  forgetting that this benefit is only possible if each one of our  Ibero-American brothers, their children, and grandchildren who  also receive their share.    Our people's interdependent independence [as heard] was  conceived as the visionary paradox that would make our dream a  reality and is now approaching the millennium. Not in vain,  through the centuries our cultures have acquired a pragmatism  characterized by unselfishness, as well as the vision and  capacity to excel in that that we call civilization.    A new era, which offers great possibilities, demands  struggling tirelessly, maintaining the capacity to listen, and  also the determination and firmness to make ourselves heard,  until we have finally made an overwhelming reality which not  long ago was just a fantasy. As participants mandated by our  peoples, we are drawing the map that will determine the future  of Ibero-America, which we have sketched with an imaginary line  that begins in Guadalajara, and continues to Madrid, Salvador de  Bahia, and Cartagena de Indias. Now, that line will extend to  the Southern Cross, to Buenos Aires, the site of our next summit  and will project itself beyond that point.    With your permission, my dear friends, I would like to  express what may seem a digression, but is not. I cannot forget  for a moment my compatriots, the Paez Indians, who live in Cauca  and Huila Departments, who are now in distress. I cannot forget  that thanks to the solidarity of so many friendly nations, my  brothers who have lost their dear ones and their belongings due  to a misfortune, have been able to take the first steps toward a  new life. Normalcy, no matter how difficult it may seem, and  although it may take a while to come, is something we must build  each day. We thank those who have tendered their friendly and  generous hand to us.    Finally, I must recognize the work carried out by the  government officials of the other member-countries of the  penta-troika [pentatroika] -- that is, Argentina, Brazil, Spain,  and Mexico -- who along with Colombia assumed their share of  responsibility with great enthusiasm and dedication.    This summit would not have been possible without them. We  also want to extend our recognition to several institutions and  groups of people who, enthused with the significance of the  summit and possessing a true Ibero-American spirit, contributed  their valuable cooperation.    The millenial Iberia and the young America are united by a  word, a gesture, and a tone. We understand and express the  universe in Spanish and Portuguese. This communion of concepts  grants us an identity.    However, more than a past, Ibero-America is the future, the  hope, and it is a voice that calls for a place in the world. We  are the crossroads that humankind will pass in the coming  decades.    Colombia, as a member of the Ibero-American fatherland, has  wanted to be your home in these past days and it bids you  farewell today, hoping that when you return to your homes, the  Caribbean sun, Cartagena's hospitality, and, especially, the  Colombians' unlimited warmth and gratitude are engraved in your  memories forever.    Friends, the project started by Antonelli so many years ago  was intended to defend Cartagena de Indias. At that time, the  walls were needed to separate men from other men, people from  other people, and cities from other cities. Today, these walls,  stone by stone, should serve to unite Ibero-America, to build  new bridges that will unite men, to turn our countries into an  everlasting brotherhood, and make the land of the Portuguese,  the Spaniard, and the American one where it is possible to make  our dreams come true.    I thus declare this Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State  and Government closed, not without wishing that any one of our  six teams at the World Cup Soccer Games be victorious so we can  accomplish our dreams in this respect. Thank you. [applause]</p>

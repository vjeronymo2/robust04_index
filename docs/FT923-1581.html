			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (10): Chewing gum regains its old-time flavour - Forestry THE CHANGING tastes of gum chewers are playing a small part in the revitalisation of Belize's once valuable market for forest products. The country had been a significant supplier of chicle, the base for chewing gum, but lost the market to synthetic substitutes. Chewers again favour the natural material and Belize is looking at an increase in chicle production. There is unlikely to be any similar expansion in the export of other forestry products, including hardwoods and dyes, which were once the mainstay of the economy. This activity, and the use of 'slash and burn' techniques by peasant farmers, damaged significant areas of woodland. Now there is a more enlightened approach with the emphasis on sustainable development which seeks a careful balance between exploitation and natural and artificial regeneration of the forest. The concerns were dramatically illustrated a few years ago when environmentalists objected to plans by the Coca Cola Company of the US to grow citrus on a large tract of land it had bought in Belize. There were threats to boycott Coca Cola products internationally. The company balked and presented the land as a nature reserve to the Programme for Belize, a private, non-profit corporation which is trying to achieve a balance between conservation and sustainable economic development over the 200,000 acres which it manages. 'We are trying to get sustainable forest projects in which there is a balance between the business aspect and concern for the environment,' says Ms Joy Grant, managing director of the Programme for Belize. 'For example, we would like to extract chicle and manufacture gum locally.' Belize's forests are also being put to work by the growing tourist industry, in particular, for holidays with an environmentalist theme. Officials say nature trails have become more popular and that Belize has a growing reputation among bird watchers and nature lovers. Traditional forest industries still continue, but at a reduced level. 'There is production of pine, mahogany, rosewood and a range of hardwoods,' reports Mr Joe Smith, director of agricultural projects. 'These are used for local industry and some for export. Resin from pine is being extracted and exported for use in chemicals and adhesives.' Exports of sawn wood products last year reached 3.8m board feet, 65 per cent more than 1990 exports. The trend is continuing, with exports in the second quarter of this year being 25 per cent higher than the same period of 1991. The government is keen on adding value to exports by increasing the quantity of processed wood and furniture, while reducing shipments of sawn timber. The production of wood veneers has started, but the forestry sector suffers from inadequate curing milling and facilities. 'It is the concern over the indiscriminate use of the forest which has caused the decline in the export of forest products over the past few years,' explains Mr Smith. 'The forest has not yet fully recovered from exploitation. Our approach to forestry now is more enlightened because of our concern over the impact on the environment.'</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Observer: Let them drink beer When the boss of a Cotswold limestone quarry received orders regarding the construction of a pub in Napa Valley named Winston's, after Britain's war-time prime minister, he thought it was 'a wind-up'. An emissary of Winston's had pitched up, delighted to find the quarry had supplied parts of Blenheim Palace, Sir Winston Churchill's birthplace. Duly sceptical, however, Farmington Stone boss Martin Robins contacted Winston Churchill, the grandson and MP. The latter did in fact know something of the project, and Robins felt able to proceed. Graham Cook, the driving force behind Winston's, is an Englishman living in Napa who somehow seems convinced that a 1880s-style pub (when Churchill was about 10), in the heart of wine-growing country, will be a licence to print money. With a historical consultant and civic responsibilities director among the shareholders, he is leaving nothing to chance. But it sounds as if the quarry has the better deal.</p>

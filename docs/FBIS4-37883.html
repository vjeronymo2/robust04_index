			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 27, IRNA -- The terrorist Mojahedin-e  Khalq Organization (MKO) claimed responsibility for a bomb blast  at a military center in northern Iran on June 15, reported the  Iraq-based MKO radio station Monday [27 June]. Officials have  not so far confirmed the claim but an informed source said that  the MKO has made the claim in order to project the country as  insecure.    The MKO also followed the same objective in the Mashhad bomb  blast, he said.  Twenty-six pilgrims were martyred and 170 others injured when a  bomb went off at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) [peace be  upon him] on June 20. He said that by spreading rumors about  attacks on military centres, the terrorist MKO try to pretend  that their terrorist attacks are focussed on military centres  and not social meetings.    The claim is made at a time when security forces have  collected documents and evidences on the involvement of the MKO  in the bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as). The  Information Ministry has published a facial sketch of Mahdi  Nahvi, a member of the terrorist MKO who was involved in Mashhad  bomb blast and called on the nation to introduce him to security  forces.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Longman headquarters BRYANT CONSTRUCTION has won a Pounds 21m contract to build the international headquarters in Harlow, Essex for Longman Group, a member of the Pearson Group, owner of the Financial Times. Next to Longman's existing Harlow headquarters, the new block, designed by architects Conran Roche, will be six storeys high, over 170,000 sq ft and have a roof garden, conservatory and restaurant. The design team has developed a naturally ventilated building which relies primarily on passive measures to save energy. The building plan places 13.5 metre wide office floor plates on either side of a 12 metre wide atrium. Both sides of the office areas have opening windows so that air can cross- ventilate from the outside and into the atria where a natural stack effect is created to assist in the general movement and vent the heated air at high level. At night the process is maintained to cool exposed concrete soffits in the offices to offset heat gain during the day. Windows in both the external and atrium walls are at high level to allow as much air as possible to pass over the slab. Windows at low level will give localised control.</p>

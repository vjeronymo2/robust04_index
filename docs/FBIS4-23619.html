			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] said in the Zambian capital that it accepts the  government offer on its participation in the country's  government, but it stresses that it wants to govern Huambo  Province. UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim:    [Begin Valentim recording] We have received two documents  from the mediators. The mediator gave us one document which is  his own, dealing with four ministerial posts. We have accepted  it. We have also accepted the following: seven deputy ministry  posts, six ambassadorial posts, 30 district administrator posts,  35 deputy district administrator posts, and 75 communal  administrator posts.    With regard to provincial governments, the mediators  proposed  three provincial governors for us. We accepted that. We are  only adding one more province, namely the province of Huambo.    With regard to UNITA's participation in district and  communal  administration, the government presented its stand. At the  level of administrators, there is a lacuna of 10 administrators.  The government left blank 10 district administrator posts. We  intend to fill the posts in the interest of peace in Angola.  The government also left blank 10 deputy district administrator  posts and 30 communal administrator posts that we have decided  to fill.    Taking into account our flexibility toward the documents  presented by the mediators and the government, we think that we  have found a common denominator to resolve the serious problem  facing our country. It is our hope that the two parties's good  will continues and that the supreme leaders of the two  organizations will accede to the imperatives of history so that  there can be peace and national reconciliation in our country.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MU: "Consortium for Rapid Application </F> Development"]    [Text] Amsterdam -- A consortium has been formed to  standardize methods for rapid application development, starting  in the United Kingdom, but with the aim of expanding to  worldwide operation. The consortium, Dynamic Systems  Development Methods (DSDM), wants to make the most of the  advantages offered by this method of systems development. The  members of the consortium include Software AG, Sapiens, Oracle,  Logica, and Cognos. The British firm Butler Group is  coordinating its efforts. The advantages of rapid application  development, according to Butler, are shorter construction time,  lower costs, and improved quality. DSDM is based on interactive  prototyping with input from the end user. Prototyping means  building a demonstration model to test whether the application  meets the required standards. The actual application is then  only constructed at a later stage.  <H5>  Users Too </H5>   In addition to the members listed above, companies such as  Information Builders, McDonnell Douglas, Data Sciences, and  Knowledgeware also form part of the consortium. Furthermore,  Butler Group expects the number of interested suppliers to  expand rapidly. "Software manufacturers, consultancies, and  major user organizations are showing an interest. It looks as  if DSDM will radically change the method of application  development," says Peter Constable of Butler.    According to the firm, companies are expressing growing  dissatisfaction with traditional development methods.  "Companies deserve better. Using old methods with the latest  technologies is like putting a diesel engine in a Formula-1  racing car."    The first meeting of the new consortium is planned for  January next year. Butler expects approximately 30 suppliers to  attend.</p>

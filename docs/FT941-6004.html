			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks to restructure loans to embattled Mexican farmers Mexico's private banks are to restructure about 5.5bn pesos (Dollars 1.74bn) of agricultural loans in default, in a move that will help rescue up to 18,000 farmers from bankruptcy. Mr Roberto Hernandez, the head of Mexico's bankers' association, estimates the restructuring will cause 1bn pesos in lost revenues over the next three years. Private banks have largely replaced the state rural development bank as the main source of financing for the sector. The restructuring comes after intense political pressure on the banks to offer solutions to the farm sector's debt problems. These have grown since the new year peasant uprising in the state of Chiapas. Last week, thousands of farmers from the Barzon campesino movement blocked the entrance to banks in eight state capitals in an effort to prevent their land from being seized. The banks have agreed to restructure loans over 15 years. The farmers will pay a fixed annual interest rate of between 4 and 4.5 per cent above inflation: in the first five years they will be able to defer the inflation component of the interest rate for debts less than 200,000 pesos. After the eighth year, they will have to start paying back the principal. Most Mexican farmers pay more than 20 per cent interest on their debt in nominal terms. However, Fira, a government agricultural trust fund run by the Bank of Mexico, will offset some of the cost to the banks. It has agreed to guarantee 50 per cent of the non-performing loans and to provide cheap funding to recapitalise the loans. 'Overall, this is positive for the banks,' says Ms Susana Ornelas of Baring Securities 'This will improve the asset quality of their loans. Although they will be receiving less interest payments, they will be making fewer loan-loss provisions.' Mexico's farmers have suffered from low international prices for basic commodities such as coffee, and have been hit by the government policy of opening up the agricultural sector to imports and reducing subsidies.</p>

Leo Glasser in  Brooklyn.  </P> <P> In a 60-count indictment announced July 25, the defendants were charged with  conspiring to defraud the government, wire fraud, falsification of documents  and obstruction of justice.  </P> <P> The defendants, including Edward Upton, former vice president of maintenance  and engineering, and Thomas Lewis, Eastern's maintenance director for the  Washington-to-Montreal region, were charged after a 10-month grand jury  investigation of the troubled carrier.  </P> <P> Prosecutors charge that the defendants did not perform required maintenance  work on Eastern aircraft, and then conspired from July, 1985, to October, 1989,  to falsify records to show that the work had been completed to avoid flight  delays and cancellations.  </P></p>

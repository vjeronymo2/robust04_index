			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Economic report" by Trinidad Murillo from "The Morning </F> Paper" newscast]    [Text] The government of the moral revolution, as Honduran  President Carlos Roberto Reina has named it, is experiencing  great pressure from the international financial institutions  [IFI's] to reduce the budget deficit to less than 4 percent, to  reorganize the economy, to stop the wave of speculation of our  currency in the face of the U.S. dollar, and to put an end to  the deterioration of the national economy. Many government  officials regret inheriting what they believe could have been  overcome by the previous government -- a high budget deficit of  more than 10 percent and an uncontrollable economic imbalance.    According to government officials, the country is currently  facing a severe crisis. Prices cannot be stabilized, nor can  economic order be maintained to avoid additional burdens on the  Honduran people. A lack of decisionmaking in the face of high  fuel prices has angered the people. There has been a shortage  of staple products, and, worse, prices are out of reach of  ordinary citizens' pocketbooks. The people are also enduring a  milk shortage -- a heavy blow to the children of Honduras --  without any solution to this serious problem in sight.    The IFI's will continue to pressure the government to comply  with its debt commitments. In order to meet this demand, the  government must reduce its budget deficit and its expenses,  stabilize the currency, and reduce the size of government. The  IFI's are even recommending taxes, such as a sales tax of 7-10  percent.    The World Bank itself, in it latest recommendations, demands  that the tax structure be simplified; that the tax base be  broadened; and that existing tax exemptions, including some  income tax exemptions, be reduced. More serious to consumers is  that the government has been asked to eliminate subsidies that  are not directed at the poorest sectors, including urban  transportation subsidies, and to improve supervision of the  decentralized enterprises and to revise their rates, which means  higher priced public services such as electricity, water, and  telephone service.    In the same way, there is a clear intention on the part of  the IFI's to privatize as soon as possible Hondutel [Honduran  Telecommunications Enterprise], SANAA [National Autonomous  Aqueduct and Sewage Service], and ENEE [National Electric Power  Company]. As a result, the people will continue to suffer  through greater increases in the price of food and other  household products -- in other words, the price of staples.    At this moment there is a natural concern among the  country's  different organized sectors. These sectors already foresee a  weak and wavering government, despite its promised humaneness  and boasts of social liberalism. It is not easy for President  Reina to carry out a definitive plan to face Honduras' economic  and social problems in the first 100 days of his government.  Moreover, the external pressure is so strong that the  government is seen as being a (?hybrid) without a true policy of  its own to confront the country's economic and social problems.  In other words, nothing is getting accomplished.    The campaign promises were a good means for gaining power,  but thousands of Hondurans will continue to buy more expensive  food. Thousands of Hondurans will continue to pay more taxes,  and thousands of Hondurans will continue to bear an increase in  public service rates. The country is on the brink of economic  imbalance and desperation, hoping that a governmental solution  will avoid so much abuse against its citizens.</p>

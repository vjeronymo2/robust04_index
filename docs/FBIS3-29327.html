			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yasuyuki Hayase, Sakura Bank Research Institute </F> senior researcher: "Corporate Support Based on Heteronomous  Coordination Has Not Diminished"]    [Text] In the past, Japanese corporations were  managed from the long-term perspective, but changes in corporate  financing have caused an increase in the number of stakeholders  and the future will see greater emphasis placed on the  "short-term perspective." Even if Japanese corporate policies  place greater emphasis on the shareholder, substantial leeway  will still exist to utilize main bank systems which represent  long-term stakeholders in concurrently preserving heteronomous  management and growth potential.  <H5>  Control by Owners and Control by Managers </H5>   Management styles of Japanese corporations that embrace  management from a "long-term perspective" are often compared  with U.S. corporate management which reflects management from a  "short-term perspective." Management based on the "long-term  perspective" may sacrifice short-term profits, but assumes a  posture whereby it strives to secure greater future profits with  a tendency to place emphasis on market share and revenues. In  contrast, management based on the "short-term perspective"  embraces as its foremost objective revenues, profits, and  appreciation of stock prices and has a tendency to emphasize  clear-cut numerical values reflected in investments versus their  effects through such actions as capital investments and product  development, rather than on the education and training of  personnel or organizations and systems.    A basic principle of the stock company system is that it is  managed by the owners; i.e., "the corporation is owned by the  shareholders." Needless to say, as the economy progresses in  sophistication and complexity and the stock company grows in  scale, it becomes difficult for the shareholders to actually  engage in the direct management of operations and a division  between ownership and management evolves, but as long as  shareholders retain the final authority to hire and fire  managers, control by the owners can be considered as being  maintained.    U.S. corporations can be considered as reflecting classical  corporate formats which strongly characterize owner management  of this style. Generally speaking, chief operating officers of  U.S. corporations themselves seldom own stock in the firm they  represent and serve as pure agents, but because the stock price  serves as a basis of determining their performance bonus, there  is a strong tendency for them to pursue the interests (stock  prices) of shareholders. This is why U.S. corporations tend to  opt for management from a "short-term perspective."    By contrast, in Japan, a manager-controlled format has  evolved in which managers have taken control of corporations. In  other words, major shareholders representing cross-shareholding  among corporations do not concern themselves directly with  management or operating results and managers entrusted with  decisionmaking authority have in effect established substantive  autonomy from owners.  <H5>  Banks Which Regulate Corporations </H5>   The question arises how did Japanese corporations maintain  management effectiveness under the manager-controlled format.  Stated in another way, shareholders maintained surveillance to  ensure that U.S. corporate management did not become  inefficient, but the question is what heteronomous factors other  than the managers' self-regulating factors functioned in the  case of Japanese corporations? In Japan, a major role has been  played in regulating corporate management by "creditors" instead  of "owners" of corporations, especially financial institutions  or main banks.    This condition is rooted in the fact that the economy in  postwar Japan was basically faced with a capital deficit and  corporations were heavily dependent on external debt. Capital  deficits meant that corporate investment plans were subject to  severe budgetary restrictions and credit examinations of  financial institutions serving as main sources of capital or  their representative main banks functioned to preserve corporate  management efficiency.    However, as economy shifted from high-growth to  stabilized-growth stages, Japanese corporations were emancipated  from severe budgetary restrictions and, additionally, the  proportion of indirect financing for capital procurement  declined. A survey of major corporations with capitalization in  excess of 1 billion yen covering the composition of capital  raised in five-year segments beginning in fiscal year 1970 shows  that in the fiscal year 1970-1975 period, 79.6 percent of  capital raised consisted of loans from financial institutions;  but that in fiscal years 1985 to 1990, capital raised directly  from financial markets consisted of 55.9 percent of capital  procured; and that loans from financial institutions had dropped  to 44.1 percent. Changes in financial transactions of this  nature have led to a potential decline in the heteronomous  function of main banks over corporate management.    Recently, significant operating difficulties and incidence  of  scandals have directed attention to corporate policies in terms  of the lack of a surveillance function over management control  and protection of shareholder rights, but it is believed such  problems are rooted in a major way in changes in corporate  financing. Environmental changes have rendered it difficult to  seek heteronomous effects on corporate management solely from  the main bank sector.  <H5>  Abuses Emanating From Short-Term Ownership </H5>   If consideration is given to the trend toward greater  reliance on a shift from indirect to direct financing known  accompanied by excessive emphasis of market value of common  stock and reinforcement of shareholder rights as seen in the  revision of shareholder class action procedures, it can be said  that the potential has risen for Japanese corporations to change  to the classic U.S. corporate format of control by owners.  However, on the other hand, the classic U.S. corporate format is  plagued with a major problem amidst excessive emphasis of market  value of common stock.    Because operations of U.S. financial institutions  traditionally place major emphasis on commercial financing, they  have a strong tendency to raise funds primarily for large  corporations directly from capital markets. As an example, a  look at the procurement method for long-term capital of major  corporations with capitalization in excess of $1 billion shows  that 86.9 percent of such funds are obtained through the  issuance of corporate bonds and additional stock, while loans  from financial institutions are a mere 13.1 percent. Further,  even in the area of short-term capital, commercial paper  balances grew rapidly since the 1980's and as of the end of May  1993, commercial paper market balances stood at $541.7 billion,  a figure that almost equalled the $592.5 billion balance for  commercial and industrial loans.    Because major corporations in the United States raise most  of  their capital needs directly from financial markets in this  manner, heteronomous corporate management influences have been  exercised by the shareholder. Shareholders investing capital are  logical, important stakeholders exercising an interest in  corporations and are unmistakable candidates to serve as  corporate managers. However, in recent years, investment trusts  and annuity funds have grown in stature and we must focus on the  gains in prominence of institutions in securities markets.  Institutional investors are short-term stakeholders who trade in  stocks based on movements in stock prices. If complete reliance  is placed on such short-term stakeholders for management of  corporations, managers cannot help but devote themselves to very  short-term aspects such as stock price trends and run the risk  of jeopardizing corporate growth potential. It is well known  that U.S. corporations are giving increasing consideration to  management from a "long-term perspective" as practiced by  Japanese firms.  <H5>  Heteronomous Function of Main Banks </H5>   In contrast to the foregoing, employees and main banks can  be  considered as representatives of long-term stakeholders.  Employees develop their careers with corporations or enhance  their skills in response to the special needs of corporations,  and as they increase their ties with the destiny of the  corporation, they hold a major interest in the future of the  corporation.    Since main banks enhance the "productivity" of credit  information through continuing long-term transactions with  corporations and possess the incentive to accrue transaction  benefits, they exercise an interest in applicable corporations  from a long-term perspective. Moreover, since employees and main  banks possess knowledge of corporate management and the  information or know-how to render appraisals, it can be said  that they are well qualified to serve as members of corporate  management.    I believe it is possible from the foregoing perspective to  say that while Japan adopted modern capital stock company  legislation, it has built a management format which in substance  avoided the abuses inherent in classic corporate formats. In the  case of Japanese corporations, managers are often selected from  among employees, thus making it possible to position managers in  consideration of employee interests, while such an approach  combined with the heteronomous function of the main banks served  to create a management system based on the "long-term  perspective."    As stated previously, excessive emphasis on the market value  of common stock in the United States has given birth to  distortions based on overemphasis of management from the  short-term perspective and the simultaneous forfeiture of the  mechanism whereby they could use bank loans as a shock absorber  during shifts in management environment and corporate  operations. If flexibility is diminished in corporate management  systems of this nature, there is the risk that the condition  will adversely affect corporate growth. The approach of  establishing corporate management based on the reinforcement of  shareholder rights in the management of our nation's  corporations is an appropriate course in view of changes taking  place in the financial environment.    However, in order to enhance the growth potential of  corporations, I believe it is important to exercise caution  against excessive emphasis on market value of common stock,  while nurturing a system which provides for the appropriate  merging of heteronomous functions of owners in the form of  shareholders and creditors in the form of main banks.  <H5>  Transaction Trends Since Collapse of Bubble </H5>   However, some quarters appear to have arrived at the  viewpoint that the main-bank functions of financial institutions  have been paralyzed in connection with the creation of  nonperforming debt accompanying the collapse of the bubble. In  this respect, in this final section of this article, I would  like to review recent transactions between corporations and main  banks.    We will first examine the shock absorber function of the  main  bank in relation to changes in the financial environment. We  will examine changes in the share of loans issued by main banks  before and after the collapse of the bubble to a total of 29  firms, including 24 firms with the highest loan balances from  banks, and real estate firms with loans outstanding in excess of  300 billion yen, based on their relatively high dependence on  bank loans among firms listed on stock exchanges. The 24 firms  exclude three firms currently undergoing reorganization and  three firms which were not listed on the stock exchanges at the  end of fiscal year 1986. An industry breakdown indicates the  group includes nine trading companies, seven nonbanking  financial institutions, six real estate firms, six electric  power companies, and one other firm.    During the bubble expansion period of 1986-1989, main bank  loan share rose for seven firms, 24 percent of the firms covered  in the survey, while the main bank share loans declined at an  overwhelming number of 20 firms, 69 percent of the firms. It is  believed this situation arose from the fact that firms increased  the number of marginal funding sources during the so-called  excess money supply period.    Subsequently, a look at the situation after the collapse of  the bubble in fiscal years 1989-1991 shows that the share of  loans handled by main banks rose at 12 firms, 41 percent, while  the number of firms where loans dropped totaled 15, 52 percent,  indicating an increase in the number of firms where main bank  share of loans rose. Of special significance is that among  nonbank financial institutions and real estate firms the number  of firms with rising main bank loans numbered four while those  with decreasing main bank loans numbered nine during the bubble  expansion period, in major contrast to nine firms rising and  three firms dropping after the collapse of the bubble. It is in  this manner that the main banks' role has expanded during the  monetary deflationary stage and has served to function as a  shock absorber for corporations in a changing financial  environment.  <H5>  Economically Logical Bank Actions </H5>   Next, we will examine the shock absorber function of the  main  banks as it relates to corporate operating results. We will take  a look at 35 firms recording deficits for the two most recent  fiscal years and listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock  Exchange and examine how loans from main banks fluctuated during  the five-year period of 1986-1991. Of those firms, the share of  loans from main banks rose at 22 firms or 63 percent and the  share of loans from main banks dropped at 13 firms or 37  percent, indicating that the share of main bank loans rose at  two-thirds of the firms recording deficits.    However, it can be said that main banks are not necessarily  functioning as shock absorbers at one-third of the firms, thus  indicating that certain aspects of main bank functions are  difficult to judge. But, main banks extend aid to firms when  they suffer from operating difficulties, because if such firms  fail completely, all the data accumulated in the past on a  long-term, continuous basis lose their entire value. In other  words, extension of such aid is the result of judgments based on  economic logic that short-term aid liabilities are outweighed by  the investment value of past data collection and productivity.  On the contrary, if such logic cannot be recognized, there is no  guarantee that the main bank function will take effect.    Actions based on the economic logic of such main banks are  also important from the standpoint of corporate management. If a  firm should lapse into operating difficulties and main bank aid  were available on an unqualified basis, it would mean that no  budgetary restrictions exist in connection with corporate  investment actions and result in main banks functioning in a way  to exacerbate inefficient corporate operations.    It is fact that nonperforming loans have been created at  financial institutions as a result of the bursting bubble and  that countermeasures to be taken are a major issue for the time  being, but we do not believe it is appropriate to assume the  view that those conditions have caused a paralysis in main bank  functions. We believe that even if Japanese corporate management  concepts lean toward placing more emphasis on shareholders,  there will be the potential for continuing use of main bank  systems in coordinating the diversity of interests, seeking  corporate growth and providing for heteronomous controls over  management.</p>

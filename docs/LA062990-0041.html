			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANS FACING FUTURE WITH EXHILARATION, FEAR  </P> <P> It was an hour after official closing time for the town's only bank, yet 14  weary souls waited quietly in the cheap fluorescent glare as the lone teller  labored on.  </P> <P> In calmer times, everyone here would have long since been home, the bank's  manager, Martina Bengsch, admitted, and she would occasionally see her infant  daughter before she went to sleep.  </P> <P> But for East Germany, these are not calm times.  </P> <P> In this gray industrial town 20 miles east of Berlin, as elsewhere in the  country, the ritual of standing for hours in a seemingly endless line to open  new accounts is part of a precarious balancing act of family finances in the  run-up to Sunday's scheduled union of the East and West German currency.  </P> <P> In the coming months, jobs will disappear, taxes will jump, pensions will rise,  grocery bills and rents will rocket while salaries remain a giant question mark  in a disorienting flurry of change.  </P> <P> Indeed, what economists regard as a first-of-its-kind experiment in what  happens when a former Communist country gets one of the West's premier  currencies, and what politicians view as the first step to German unity, has  become, above all, a powerful personal drama for the people of East Germany.  </P> <P> It is a moment when the lives of an entire nation are about to be turned upside  down, when the only certainty is uncertainty.  </P> <P> For a people subjected over four decades to Eastern Europe's most carefully  programmed Stalinist society, it is an unsettling, yet perversely exhilarating  experience. It is also a moment of truth for each of those who helped build  what was arguably the most remarkable of all the revolutions to sweep through  Eastern Europe last fall: Can they make it in a free, open world?  </P> <P> The answer is as crucial for Germany and for Europe as it is for Martina  Bengsch and her customers.  </P> <P> "If the experiment succeeds . . . then it's not just a victory for East Germany  . . . but also an encouraging example for the other East European countries,"  noted Hans Tietmeyer, a director of the West German Bundesbank and a key  architect of the currency union.  </P> <P> If the East Germans, with massive assistance from West Germany and their own  inherent industrial discipline, fail to make the transition from Communist to  free market society, then the future for the rest of Eastern Europe looks  bleak, diplomats and other analysts in both Germanys believe  </P> <P> The change will be painful.  </P> <P> From wages that are already less than half West German levels, East Germans  will, by the start of next year, give up hefty bites of between 19% and 53% for  the previously unknown Western practice of personal income tax. Social security  and health payments will also rise.  </P> <P> There is talk of increasing wages and salaries to compensate, but no one knows  how, when or by how much.  </P> <P> East Berlin garbage collectors this week threatened to strike over their demand  for a 60% wage increase. Such a strike could trigger an avalanche of industrial  unrest, said city government spokesman Klaus Hetzel.  </P> <P> Low rents and subsidized services that characterized the Communist command  economies will also go, but few understand what will come in their place.  Jacqueline Nun, a 28-year-old East Berlin office cleaner, for example, said she  had been told the $38 monthly rent on her small public housing apartment would  be frozen through the end of the year, but then be quadrupled before the end of  next year.  </P> <P> Also, she has no idea what will become of the $156 state subsidy she gets as a  single parent for her two children or if the child-care center to which she  pays $2.50 a month for each child will be closed as uneconomic. Both are  critical to her financial survival, but she has found little real information.  </P> <P> "There are rumors the child-care center will be closed, but nobody really knows  anything," she said, her eyes welling with tears of frustration. "How am I  supposed to plan for a family under such conditions?"  </P> <P> Under the currency union, pensions will rise by an average of about 11%, but  for pensioners as for everyone, the heavily subsidized 7-cent pound of flour,  10-cent pound of sugar and baby food for a dime a jar will also disappear. A  loaf of rye bread that costs 33 cents in Dresden today will cost more than $2  Monday morning. As a consequence, such staples that can be frozen or stored  have been swept from the shelves by eager buyers.  </P> <P> The family budget is only one of the many unknowns for which a disoriented East  German bureaucracy has few answers.  </P> <P> For millions of East Germans raised in the belief that access to a job was a  right, it has become a distinct possibility that a quarter of the work force  may be out of work by year-end.  </P> <P> At East Berlin's prestigious Humboldt University, history professor Steffi  Gloess says the 60-member department may be cut in half.  </P> <P> Internal East German government studies indicate that between one-fifth and  one-quarter of the country's obsolete, over-manned industry may go under  immediately in the face of Western competition.  </P> <P> "There's no such thing as a secure job now," said Deitmar Seelig, 32, who has  already quit his old job as an engineer in a factory with an uncertain future.  He is studying to get in on the ground floor of a growth industry in East  Germany: tax consulting.  </P> <P> Others worry that their homes, confiscated by the Communists from former West  German property owners decades ago and handed over to East Germans, may be  taken away.  </P> <P> Bank manager Bengsch's family home for the last 25 years is one of up to 1  million such cases in East Germany.  </P> <P> "Sure, these homes were seized illegally, but 25 years of upkeep, care and  remodeling has to count for something," she argued. "The lawyers and the courts  will be booked up for the next 20 years."  </P> <P> Yet despite such personal worries about homes, jobs and salaries, there is no  visible panic. On the eve of the great experiment, a perceptible, yet tenuous  optimism prevails.  </P> <P> In its own unspoken way, this collective leap into the unknown has somehow  bound together the 16 million people of East Germany with a sense of common  destiny that doesn't exist in richer, more individualistic West Germany.  </P> <P> It has bred a solidarity that leads Bengsch to close but not lock the bank's  door at the normal closing time and then to let in anyone who knocks. The  sickening fear expressed frequently among East Germans that -- for them and  their country -- life could be very bad for a while, is held in check by the  oft-repeated comment, "It can only get better for us, because it can't get  worse."  </P> <P> To an outsider, this optimism occasionally seems unrealistic: Such is the case  with a shopkeeper here whose upbeat mood did not reflect the fact that he faces  immediate eviction because the premises have been bought by a West German and  he has few prospects of relocating in a decent area.  </P> <P> But for those who have lived their entire lives as second-class Germans,  Sunday's currency union means much more than getting the deutschemark.  </P> <P> With it comes a freedom of choice, of travel and a new self-respect that is  hard to understand for those who have never listened to East Germans dream of  impossible journeys or seen East German couples refused tables at restaurants  in their own country only to watch West Germans with hard currency be seated in  their place.  </P> <P> "I'm happy for my daughter, that she can buy things, that she doesn't have to  be humiliated by our relatives from the West," said a sales assistant at the  East Berlinfurniture store Wohnkultur, who identified herself only as Heide.  "The constant 'Thank you very much' for a piece of (Western) chocolate was  humiliating. We were basically second-class human beings."  </P> <P> Poor quality goods, endless shortages and waiting impose their own degradation  that they see the deutschemark and the free market bringing to an end.  </P> <P> Those who had waited an hour in the rain just to get inside a local supermarket  here expressed that hope. Although the store was far from full, no one was  allowed in without a shopping cart and carts were in short supply.  </P> <P> "We have a hundred in the basement with broken wheels but where are we supposed  to get new wheels?" asked the store's assistant manager, Gabrielle Knobel, with  a shrug.  </P> <P> And so, in hopes of leaving such dilemmas to a bygone age, some East Germans  will celebrate Saturday night in their own way, taking advantage of a large  party being advertised on posters in East Berlin.  </P> <P> "Dance in the D-mark," the posters say. "The ostmark is valid until the end."  </P> <P> BRIGHT FUTURE -- For a 28-year-old mechanic, the outlook is good. A12  </P></p>

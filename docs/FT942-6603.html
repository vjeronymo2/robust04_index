			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / UK airlines win access to Orly from June 13: Paris places limits on flight frequency and aircraft size France has agreed to open Orly airport in Paris to UK airlines from June 13, but is seeking to limit any single airline to four return trips a day between London and Orly. The French government is also proposing to ban smaller aircraft from serving Orly - a move expected to be challenged by the UK government. The decision to open Orly on June 13, which will be announced today, was taken after a meeting between Mr John MacGregor, Britain's transport secretary, and Mr Bernard Bosson, his French counterpart, at Annecy in France on Saturday. UK carriers have been keen to start services to Orly to link up with the extensive French domestic network operating from the airport on the southern side of Paris. Although the European Commission had told the French government to open Orly, France had resisted the move. This nearly provoked a confrontation between France and the UK, with British Airways and Air UK both threatening to defy the French ban on flights from London to Orly. The two countries reached a compromise two weeks ago with France agreeing to open the airport to UK carriers by the end of the June at the latest. That has now been brought forward to June 13. France had argued that technical and environmental problems forced it to delay opening the airport to UK flights and it also claimed that French airlines were not getting adequate access into London's Heathrow Airport. The Heathrow slot co-ordinating committee, which allocates landing slots, will meet on Thursday to consider applications from two French carriers, Air Liberte and AOM, to start services to Heathrow. The proposed four round trip flights a day limit would fit exactly with BA's plans, but Air UK has been seeking five return flights a day. British Midland has also indicated it plans to start services to Orly in September but has not yet said how many daily flights it intends to operate. Under the latest proposals, Air France will be limited to four return daily flights between London and Orly. TAT, BA's French affiliate, is also seeking to operate flights from Orly to London but its plans were not discussed at Saturday's ministerial meeting. The UK is believed to be unhappy about the proposed flight limit and is expected to seek greater liberalisation. But Mr MacGregor has stressed that his priority was to get UK flights into Orly as soon as possible. The French proposal to limit the size of aircraft is also expected to be challenged by the UK. Paris is considering limiting services to Orly only to larger aircraft to ease congestion problems at the Parisian airport. Should France go ahead with this proposal, Mr MacGregor is expected to raise the issue with the European Commission. Mr MacGregor is expected to continue opposing French government plans to inject FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) into Air France. He said he welcomed last week's decision by the Commission to investigate the proposed Air France aid. 'As a matter of principle, the UK is opposed to state aids that distort competition in the single market,' he said. Business travel, Page 10</p>

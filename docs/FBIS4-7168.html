			<p>BFN     [Text] A prominent economist called yesterday for Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai to dissolve Parliament in order to  prevent an economic depression that may result from a coup  d'etat.    Dr Chalongphop Susangkan, human resources programme director  at the independent Thailand Development Research Institute  [TDRI], warned that if the current political situation continues  unchecked, it could become an excuse for the military to seize  power.    Business figures and stock market investors contacted by  Business Post yesterday also called for the House of  Representatives to be dissolved although they did not  necessarily agree that continued problems would encourage a coup.    And Dr Chalongphop's boss, TDRI president Amma Sayamwanla,  also an economist, blamed the largely military-appointed Senate  for the political problems. He said the Senate should be  dissolved as well, although he did not think a coup would be  encouraged if Parliament is not dissolved.    "I know that the constitution doesn't allow for the  dissolution of the Senate, but many of the country's problems  would be solved if the Senate also could be disbanded," he said.    Dr Amma blamed senators' voting against the Government's  constitutional amendment proposals for the current political  problems.    He argued that since senators and their allies in the  Opposition had preferred to adopt the now-defunct 1978  constitution as the basis for their proposals, they had created  an "open season" for criticising all aspects of the present  constitution, including the composition and continuation in  office of the present Senate.    Dr Chalongphop issued his warning at a seminar organised by  Board of Trade of Thailand to evaluate the economy in the first  quarter and the outlook for this year. He said that the outlook  is bright for the economy to grow at least 8 percent as  predicted by many institutions.    The only clouds he could see were political: conflict over a  possible Cabinet reshuffle, the constitutional dispute and the  bombs attacks in the South.    These situations contained the risk that someone might want  to be a "knight on a white horse" coming to the rescue by  staging a coup, Dr Chalongphop said.    "In order to pre-empt such a situation, I suggest the Prime  Minister dissolve Parliament and return authority to people to  vote again because already there are many signs that the  political situation is the virus that would harm the economy."    He said he believed the private sector and the country's  economy were immune to political changes accomplished in a  democratic manner. Nondemocratic changes would not be accepted,  he said.    Responding to a comment that he is too pessimistic, Dr  Chalongphop said Thai history provides warnings to politicians  that they must not allow anyone to take advantage of political  drift.    Asked whether he thought the political situation would  continue until the end of this year, Dr Chalongphop said that in  the past significant changes usually occurred unexpectedly.  These would affect some industries such as tourism and slow  foreign investment, particularly from Japan.    Prayun Thaloengsi, executive director of the Board of Trade  of Thailand, took the contrary position, saying the country  should give the coalition more time to amend the constitution  and then decide their future.    Prida Tiasuwan, managing director of Pranda Jewelry, said  jewellery exports would grow by 8-9 percent even at a time of  political conflict, but a coup would mean a bleak future for his  industry.    Dr Wicha Chiwalai, president of the Condominium Traders  Association, said that political uncertainty, the government's  failure to privatise telecommunications and public transport, as  well as fluctuations on the Stock Exchange of Thailand would  jeopardise the growth of the property industry.    Other government and private-sector participants in  yesterday's seminar felt the economy would continue to grow  satisfactorily, based on the rise in exports, the stimulus  provided by infrastructure projects, the expansion of industries  to rural areas, and positive external factors such as the  recovery of the world economy.    Bank of Thailand representative Suchada Thirakun said  economic growth in the first quarter was 8 percent, better than  the same period of last year because of a 17 percent rise in  exports, particularly industrial and agricultural products.    Ms Suchada said the outlook for the whole year is expected  to  be better than 1993 but she cautioned that inflation may be as  high as 4.5 percent.    Business Economics Department representative Manop Tahongyen  said exports in the first two months were about 150 billion  baht, up 1213 percent from the same period last year; the March  figures will be higher still.    National Economic and Social Development Board [NESDB]  representative Akhom Toemphitayaphisit said the NESDB had  suggested the government do three things to improve the economy:  speed up infrastructure projects; increase private sector  confidence in investing in rural areas; and restructure the  tariff system.    Local investors contacted at the SET yesterday said a  dissolution of Parliament would improve investment sentiment.    Stock analysts believed dissolution is highly possible after  Parliament approves the budget.    Phaibun Ratniyom, an analyst from Asia Securities Trading,  said Thai politics is at turning point. If dissolution occurred  now it would stall economic growth since the budget allocation  process has not started.    He ruled out the possibility of coup, saying "people power"  now dominated Thai politics.    American investor Doug Grahan said Thai politics were not an  important factor in his decisions to invest in Thai stocks. He  said dissolution or any changes in the government could be  positive for Thai investors.</p>

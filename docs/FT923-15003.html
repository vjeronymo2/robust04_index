			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Seafield losses double to Pounds 22m Losses at Seafield, the Dublin-based group with interests in property, transport and warehousing, virtually doubled from Pounds 11.48m to Pounds 22.38m in 1991. The figure was after taking account of exceptional provisions of Pounds 19.52m (Pounds 18.65m), of which Pounds 18.12m (Pounds 13.86m) related to property write-downs. Seafield's transport distribution and warehouse division had a good year and the directors said it was in that area that they intended to focus most of the company's future thrust. Group turnover declined to Pounds 22.76m (Pounds 30.7m). Operating profits of Pounds 2.53m compared with Pounds 9.26m last time. Net interest payable rose to Pounds 5.39m (Pounds 2.09m). Losses emerged at 31.9p (15.8p) and at the year end net assets per share stood at 41p (73p). The shares dipped 1p to 10p.</p>

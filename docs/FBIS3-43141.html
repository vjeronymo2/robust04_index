			<p>Beijing,     Paris Restore Bilateral Ties      In a move that could have serious implications for U.S. trade and  economic relations with China, Beijing has announced the  restoration of bilateral ties with France.  Relations between  Beijing and Paris had soured after France agreed in November 1992  to sell 60 Mirage 2000 jet fighters to Taiwan.  According to a  joint communique on the previously unpublicized 23-28 December  visit to China by Jacques Friedmann, a special envoy of French  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, the two countries have decided  to restore their "traditional friendly relations and cooperation"  on the basis of the principles on which they established  diplomatic ties (Xinhua, 12 January).  In addition, Xinhua  reported that the two governments also agreed to "intensify"  their "political consultations" and to "develop" bilateral  economic and trade relations.  The communique went on to suggest  that Paris will also reap economic rewards for its agreement not  to "authorize" French companies to sell arms to Taiwan, noting  that China "welcomes participation on an equal footing" by French  enterprises in the Chinese market.  During Chancellor Helmut  Kohl's late November visit to China, Beijing had rewarded Bonn  for its decision not to sell weapons to Taiwan and for its low-  key position on human rights by awarding a number of lucrative  economic contracts to German companies.

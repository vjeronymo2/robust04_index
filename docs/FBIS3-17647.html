			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A report of the Central Electoral Commission has  just been brought into our studio. Here is the first data on  the progress of voting: 20 percent of the electorate have  already voted in Sevastopol, Crimea; 34 percent in Zaporozhye;  40 percent in Ivano-Frankovsk; and more than 50 percent in  Chernovtsy Oblast.    The Central Electoral Commission also reported that 186  candidates have withdrawn their candidacies, thus facilitating  the task facing the electors or, maybe, disappointing some of  them.    According to the Central Electoral Commission, preliminary  data on the number of those who voted will be announced at 1600  and 2000.</p>

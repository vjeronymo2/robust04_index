			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WHO DIED IN CUSTODY IDENTIFIED  </P> <P> Aman who died in police custody after a violent rampage through a Sylmar  neighborhood was identified Saturday as James Michael Opp, 33, of Canoga Park.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Detective Stephen Fisk said Friday that the man, who  witnesses said was "frothing at the mouth" and screaming incoherently, died  Thursday of what appeared to be drug-related causes.  </P> <P> Autopsy results should be available this week, but results of toxicological  tests to determine if drugs were involved will not be ready for a month or two,  said David Campbell, a supervising investigator with the Los Angeles County  coroner's office.  </P> <P> The man died about 2 p.m. in the back seat of a police car that was taking him  to the Van Nuys Jail infirmary for treatment, Fisk said. He was arrested in the  15500 block of Bledsoe Street after he allegedly attacked an elderly couple who  were getting into their car, authorities said. Neighbors said he appeared to be  attacking a mailbox and stumbling through bushes, Fisk said.  </P> <P> Campbell confirmed a published report that identified the man as Opp.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Netherlands and Suriname Agree </F> On Control of Economy"]    [Text] Last weekend, the Netherlands and Suriname agreed on  an "honorable" way in which the Netherlands will assess the  developments of the Surinamese economy in the next few months.  Depending on that assessment, the Netherlands will decide  whether it will resume its support to the Surinamese balance of  payments and whether it will provide funds for the creation of  an industry fund.    This was stated by Surinamese President R. Venetiaan last  Sunday [22 May] at a news conference in Amsterdam, during a  short stay in the Netherlands. The disagreement between both  countries concerned the question whether the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) would be granted permission to "report" to  the Netherlands about the reorganisation plans for the  Surinamese economy. Cooperation Development Minister Pronk had  requested the IMF to express such an independent opinion.    The disagreement on the meaning of the IMF report was not  due  to "childish stubborness on the part of Suriname," Venetiaan  stated, but was a matter of "honor and national sovereignty."  The compromise, which was reached after almost half a year of  negotiations, holds that Suriname will admit observers from the  IMF, but that it will not officially submit the reports and  recommendations to the Netherlands. The Netherlands will,  however, get the reports from the IMF later on, informally.    Last March, Minister Pronk had already agreed with his  Surinamese colleague on the way in which the IMF would supervise  the changes to the Surinamese economy. It had been agreed that  the organization would draw up quarterly reports, with  suggestions to gear the economy to the existing recovery plans.    Later on, there was political disagreement on this issue in  Suriname. The country objects to the IMF's formal role, because  it refuses to comply with the organization's recommendations,  which are expected to be strict. According to Venetiaan,  Minister Pronk hinted last Saturday that "compromises" about the  IMF approach could lead to the recovery of Dutch support to the  balance of payments.    The Surinamese president was in the Netherlands after visits  to Indonesia, Malaysia, and China, but he refused to elaborate  on the results of this trip. In Indonesia, there were talks  about the large-scale tree felling projects, for which  Indonesian businessmen were given a license. According to  several environmental groups, the relevant developers have a bad  reputation.    They fear that the Surinamese rain forest might be developed  in the same way as parts of East Kalimantan in Indonesia. In  spite of the strict forest legislation, the jungle has been  irreparably damaged there in many places, because the control of  the development failed due to corruption. Venetiaan said that  he found no evidence of irresponsible lumbering in Indonesia.    Indonesia did promise Suriname's support for the training of  forest rangers. The Netherlands has also provided money for  that purpose.</p>

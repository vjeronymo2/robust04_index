			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A LARGE buying order trig-gered a squeeze of stock index futures, leading to a sharp advance in the March contract on the FT-SE Index, writes Joel Kibazo. March opened firmly at 2,550, with traders moving quickly to cover short overnight positions. An order for 800 contracts, combined with earlier demand, led to a squeeze by late morning, sending the contract sharply forward to touch the day's high of 2,587, and pulling the underlying cash market higher. Light midsession profit-taking saw the contract drift off, and a further decline occurred following an easier opening on Wall Street. March closed at 2,579, up 24 on the previous session and around 13 points above the estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was a healthy 9,040 contracts. The traded options market remained dull with turnover reaching only 22,419 lots. The FT-SE 100 index option was busy, trading 9,031 contracts. British Airways was the busiest stock option on 1,318 contracts dealt, with April 260 calls particularly active. Thames Water had 1,296 contracts traded, while British Aerospace recorded a total of 1,239 lots transacted.</p>

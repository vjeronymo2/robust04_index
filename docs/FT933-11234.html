			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: Significance of National Trust backing for organic farming Sir, The launch by the National Trust of its organic farming development fund is of very great significance to the future of organic food production in the UK ('National Trust moves to promote organic farming', July 22). Interest in organic farming methods, as characterised by the avoidance of artificial fertilisers and chemical pesticides and the development of diverse, ecologically sustainable systems, has never been greater. Yet it would appear that many of the organisations in the grant-making trust sector have yet to acknowledge the wider social and environmental benefits that are associated with organic farming. As an example of this, not a single charity listed in the usual directories of grant-making trusts includes the support of organic farming among its objectives. This unfortunate situation no doubt arises from the fact that most existing charities were established long before the poisoning of our land and drinking water by intensive farming methods had become a matter of national public concern. We would therefore like to appeal to the controllers and trustees of these many charities to consider amending their list of objectives to include organic farming and to give it a high priority in their rankings for financial support. Not only are organic farmers and growers producing a food commodity that is in demand in the marketplace, but they are actively pursuing practical and principled solutions to the continuing denuding of the countryside by conventional agriculture, the welfare of farm animals and the very fabric of our rural communities.

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: French GDP up 1% in quarter French gross domestic product grew by 1 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first three months, according to Insee, the national statistics office. This was in line with forecasts, although several economists said consumption and investment growth were at the top end of expectations. Growth in the first quarter was 0.7 per cent, unrevised from the figure given earlier this month. Industrial output gained 2.1 per cent in the second quarter, Insee said , following a 1.2 per cent rise in the previous three-month period. It was boosted by a recovery in energy output and 'dynamism' in manufacturing, which rose 3 per cent (2.7 per cent). Consumer spending rose 1 per cent after two stagnant quarters; investment increased by a similar figure in a marked break with the recent trend. Exports rose 2.6 per cent and imports by 2.8 per cent. German M3 money supply growth was revised down by the Bundesbank from 9.9 per cent to an annualised growth rate of 9.8 per cent in July, final data released by the Bundesbank showed. The bank said final data showed a 6.4 per cent rise from the last quarter of 1993, after a provisional 6.5 per cent. Italy's trade surplus with non-EU countries totalled L2,770bn (Pounds 1.14bn) in July, against L2,540bn in June and L3,920bn in July 1993, reported Istat, the national statistics institute. Imports totalled L9,610bn and exports L12,390bn. Istat said imports grew by 15.3 per cent compared with a year ago while exports had increased 1.1 per cent. The cost of living in western Germany edged 0.1 per cent higher in the month to mid-August from a month earlier and was 3 per cent higher than a year ago, according to federal statistics office figures.</p>

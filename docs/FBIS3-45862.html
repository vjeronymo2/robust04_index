The U.S. President and his Russian counterpart held  talks on such issues as bilateral relations, European security,  and the nonproliferation of weapons of massive destruction and  signed a series of documents. President Yeltsin and President  Clinton spoke highly of this visit and issued the "Moscow  Declaration" to proclaim the advent of the "new stage of mature  strategic partnership" between Russia and the United States.  The press maintained that Russia and the United States had  settled some problems in bilateral relations and coordinated  their positions in international affairs through this summit,  but they "failed to open up a new era in bilateral relations."    The timing of the Russo-American summit was not fortuitous.  Over the past few years, the United States treated Russia as  the major country for implementing "democratic values and a free  economic system." The United States once again demonstrated its  support for the "forces of democratic reform" when great changes  occurred in Russia's domestic situation. Meanwhile, the United  States fell short of its wishes in handling international  affairs. It had to seek Russia's cooperation on the issues of  establishing a new security structure in Europe and settling the  problem of nuclear proliferation. On the other hand, Russia  tried to work through this summit to strengthen its economic  cooperation with the United States and to emphasize that power  status was on an equal footing with the United States so as to  "regain its external prestige."    Russia's economic reform was still the key item on this  summit's agenda. As indicated by the results of Russia's  parliamentary elections last December, the Russian people had  exhausted the limit of their tolerance for the pain caused by  reform and the opposition in the new parliament would strongly  criticize any radical reform policies implemented by the  authorities. The question of whether Russia would drastically  change its economic policy in the face of this pressure was a  U.S. concern. During the talks, President Yeltsin guaranteed  that Russia would not slow the pace of market economic reform.  Meanwhile, he did not overtly ask for direct aid from the  United States but rather urged the United States to open its  market to Russia, abolish trade restrictions left over from the  Cold War period, and engage in economic and trade cooperation on  an equal footing. President Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. firm  support for Russia's "democratic market changes" and the  fulfillment of the promise of granting aid to Russia that was  made during the Vancouver Summit and afterwards. The United  States agreed to reduce tariffs on over 4,000 Russian  commodities. In addition, the two countries also reached an  agreement on a $12 billion purchase of Russian uranium fuel. In  the future, Russia will orient its economic policy toward  society to a greater extent and will try to utilize every means  to alleviate the pain of reform. People have noticed that the  United States showed its understanding and support for this  practice and declared that it would help Russia in this area,  without making any new promises.    As a measure to "establish relations of mutual trust," the  two presidents agreed that both sides would change the posture  of targeting their strategic nuclear weapons on the other party  by this May. The press considered that this decision signified  the formal consent of the two nuclear powers to relax the state  of alert which threatened to trigger off conflicts at any moment  over the past few decades and that this decision was conducive  to the further development of Russian-American relations. To a  greater extent, however, this was regarded as a symbolic gesture.    The most eye-catching scene during Clinton's visit to Moscow  was Russo-American cooperation in settling the issue of  Ukraine's nuclear weapons. Russia, the United States, and  Ukraine signed a formal agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons  in Ukraine within a scheduled period of time. The press here  was quite cautious in responding to this, however, saying that  the agreement would be strongly opposed by the Ukrainian  parliament. Russia's IZVESTIYA pointed out: In view of the  mood of the Ukrainian parliament, it is impossible, in any case,  to think that this problem has been solved.    Another focus of the Russo-American summit was the question  of establishing a new security system in Europe. Under the  present circumstances, good handling of relations with Russia  has an important bearing on overall European security and  stability. Because of this consideration, the NATO Summit --  which ended not long ago -- neither gave East European countries  any guarantee of security nor worked out a clear timetable for  these countries to join NATO. President Yeltsin expressed his  support of NATO's "partnership for peace" plan and stated that  Russia was willing to join the plan, thus opening up the path of  extensive positive cooperation between Russia and NATO. An  examination of the remarks made by President Yeltsin and  President Clinton, however, reveals that the views of Russia and  the United States on the new security system in Europe are not  completely identical. Clinton stressed that East European  countries would eventually join NATO through close cooperation  and, on this basis, a unified Europe without new boundaries  would be established. Yeltsin maintained that NATO's  "partnership for peace" was only one of the new plans for the  construction of a new Europe, and the role of collective  security organs such as the CSCE should not be neglected. In  addition, the United States and Russia still have divergent  views on a number of issues, such as the question of whether  Russia has a "special status" and "guiding power" in East Europe  and in the CIS, the rights of Russian inhabitants in Baltic  states, and the withdrawal of Russian troops from that area.    As commented by the press here, although the Russian and  U.S.  leaders said that they would consistently take new steps to  establish a "strategic partnership" between the two countries,  the prospects for this kind of relationship are still very  uncertain. The future development of Russo-American relations  hinges to a very large extent on Russia's political situation  and changes in its foreign policy.</p>

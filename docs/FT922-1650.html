			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lowered expectations Thanks partly to Ireland's vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty, equities closed yesterday in better shape than some might have feared on Wednesday and Thursday. The Footsie shed only 19 points over the week, and there is some evidence of support below 2,600. This level hardly seems demanding on fundamental grounds, but it is still difficult to dismiss the array of negative factors confronting the market. The most eye-catching of these - the GPA flop and the unsettled tone overseas - are not as immediately significant as ICI's sudden profits pessimism and 3i's postponed flotation. Both developments set the tone for a weak recovery which will do little for corporate earnings. Indeed, reaction to the ICI downgrading suggests that investors may remain too optimistic generally on the earnings outlook. Any demand for equities now seems likely to favour companies which can demonstrate quality earnings with good cash flow and comfortable dividend cover. Investors who were reluctant to shell out for GPA will not necessarily prove so cautious over Wellcome, but that does not imply much overall bounce for the market. Inflationary pressures at the factory level may, as the CBI says, be at their lowest for 25 years, but that takes the market back to the kind of low-growth, low-inflation environment of the mid-1960s when equity prices only crept upwards. While investors adjust to that, there are few reasons for London to outperform if New York should take another turn for the worse.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Rail union will meet on dispute THE EXECUTIVE committee of the RMT, the main rail union, meets today to decide its next move in its dispute with British Rail which has already resulted in two one-day strikes which paralysed the network, Robert Taylor writes. There had been speculation that the RMT would switch the strike day from Friday to midweek, but Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary, has stressed that no decision on further action has yet been taken. The prospects of an early settlement improved over the weekend after the union said it had detected signs of a change in BR's bargaining stance over compulsory redundancies and the use of contract labour. It wants a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies for its members and a moratorium on the further use of contract labour. Today, Aslef, the drivers' union, is due to meet BR to try to resolve their specific differences over the future of the drivers' national agreement.</p>

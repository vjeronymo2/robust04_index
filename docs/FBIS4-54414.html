			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The export of  non-renewable resources and products which have not been very  highly processed made up 32 percent of overall Czech exports, a  fact which Environmental Minister Frantisek Benda considers  alarming, he said at a press conference of the Christian  Democratic Party (KDS) today. Benda commented that practically  no government policy for raw materials was in existence.    Concerning the Temelin nuclear power plant, the minister  said  he thought it essential that an atomic code be created which  would include the atomic law as well as other laws concerning  nuclear power. The code would primarily concern legal  regulations for the storage of nuclear waste or the  establishment of a fund for the disposal of nuclear equipment.    The ministry has completed a document entitled "Government  Environmental Policy" which the government received last  December as an outline proposal for the activities of the  Environment Ministry. After being discussed by  inter-governmental agencies, the document will be presented to  the government. The ministry included in its outline an  environmental action program which includes short term programs  of about three years in duration.</p>

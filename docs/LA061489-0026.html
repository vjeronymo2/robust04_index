			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> OUTDOORS NOTES / PETE THOMAS;  </P> <P> LOCAL ANGLERS' ALBATROSS OF NO ALBACORE COULD BE ENDING  </P> <P> Will the albacore, the popular tuna that have been frustratingly elusive for  Southland fishermen in recent years, show along Southern California this  summer?  </P> <P> Experts will say only that conditions appear better than last year.  </P> <P> "Basically, the conditions look good," said Ron Dotson, a National Marine  Fisheries biologist and albacore specialist in La Jolla. "The cold, off-color  water extending from Point Conception to Ensenada should not block the fish  from entering Southern California waters."  </P> <P> Last year, Dotson said, the band of off-color water extended about 50 miles  south of Ensenada and, for the most part, prevented the fish from making their  way into local waters from the west. Albacore migrate from the mid-Pacific,  west of Hawaii, to the waters of Baja, Southern and Central California.  </P> <P> Last year, fishermen off the Central California coast caught only a smattering  of albacore, but those off the Oregon and Washington coasts experienced some of  the best albacore fishing in years. In fact, northern fishing was so good that  much of California's commercial fleet spent the summer near Westport, Wash. By  and large, the albacore have bypassed Southern California for the last three  years.  </P> <P> A fairly large school of albacore was reportedly found this week by the skipper  of a tanker at the Erben Bank, about 700 miles west of San Diego. According to  Dotson, a commercial boat is at that location but has yet to report its  findings.  </P> <P> Based on the reports made by the tanker's skipper, the American Angler of Point  Loma Sportfishing will make an exploratory three-day run for albacore June 22.  </P> <P> "We're presuming that they'll be in a little closer by then," said the  landing's Judy Collins.  </P> <P> Otherwise, there has been no albacore effort made so far by the San Diego  sportfishing fleet, which relies heavily on the albacore -- and the following  they generate -- to pay its bills. The American Angler is going, according to  Collins, "because nobody else wants to take the chance."  </P> <P> According to Dotson there has been no commercial effort in the mid-Pacific  either, primarily because the albacore fleet has been busy working the  productive South Pacific.  </P> <P> "There's no effort and no (concrete) information to go on," he said. "All we  can do is look at the conditions."  </P> <P> For the record: It was reported here two weeks ago that there had never been a  1,000-pound marlin caught by a recreational fisherman off Baja Peninsula, but a  blue marlin weighing 1,056 pounds was caught off Cabo San Lucas by John Conant  of North Hollywood in 1977.  </P> <P> AeroCalifornia, a Mexican air carrier based in La Paz, is scheduled to make its  United States debut Thursday when its fleet of DC-9s begins flying from LAX to  Loreto, La Paz and Cabo San Lucas.  </P> <P> Resorts Airlines, which had been the only carrier from Los Angeles to Loreto,  went out of business last month.  </P> <P> Tag applications for deer, bear, bighorn sheep, elk and antelope are available  at sporting goods stores and DFG offices, which are reminding hunters that the  applications must be filed before the annual tag drawing July 8.  </P> <P> A DFG spokesman said that X zone, special deer and special bear, antelope and  elk hunters must have applications in to the DFG License and Revenue Branch  office in Sacramento by 5 p.m. June 26 to be eligible for the July computerized  drawing.  </P> <P> Deer tags for A, B, D, and archery-only hunt applications are available over  the counter at DFG offices in Long Beach, San Diego and Fresno or by mail from  the Sacramento license office.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> Grunion season has reopened after a two-month closing to allow the fish to  spawn uninhibited. The next runs are expected to be during the late nights of  June 20-23 along dark, sandy beaches. San Pedro's Cabrillo Marine Museum will  hold its final two grunion programs -- with films, lectures and the actual  viewing of a grunion run -- July 3 and 20 beginning at 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Silvio Calabi of Rod &amp; Reel magazine will present a show on the World Fly  Fishing Championships, held last fall in Tasmania, at the Sierra Pacific  Flyfishers' meeting June 22 at the Odyssey Restaurant in Mission Hills. The  program follows a 7:30 p.m. dinner. For details, call (818) 785-7306.  </P> <P> The eighth annual Invitational Benefit Stag Shoot for Hoag Hospital in Newport  Beach will be held today from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Coto de Caza Hunt Lodge  in Orange County. Olympian Dan Carlisle will give a shooting demonstration  before the competition. . . . Hunting season for cottontail rabbits begins July  1 with the best prospects, according to the DFG, to be in "areas adjacent to  agricultural lands where water and feed are generally available."  </P></p>

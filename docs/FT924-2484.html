			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Lombard League hopes to clean up in local polls: With many established politicians accused of corruption, northern Italy's regional party is gaining VARESE, with its neatly parked cars, pedestrian zones, clean streets, expensive shops and hard-working people, epitomises the numerous provincial towns in the northern industrial belt around Milan that have become seriously rich in the past 30 years. As the Christmas decorations go up and the first snows fall, there is little to suggest these solid citizens are protagonists of epoch-making municipal elections. But when it votes tomorrow and on Monday, Varese could become the first city to elect a mayor of the populist Lombard League, the political movement sweeping all before it in northern Italy. 'What happens here will have repercussions throughout northern Italy,' says Mr Roberto Maroni, deputy head of the League parliamentary group and one of the organisers of the Varese campaign. 'If we have a strong showing, all the other municipal administrations in the north where the traditional parties have lost their credibility will be under threat and risk early elections.' The vote - which also takes place in the nearby town of Monza and more than 50 others throughout Italy - is the first serious electoral test of the political parties since the April general election. It will determine not only how far the long-ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists have lost support but also indicate the extent of the growing political divide between north and south. The League needs a good showing in Varese, the home town of Mr Umberto Bossi, the movement's leader. Polls suggest it could win well over 35 per cent of the vote, compared with 20 per cent in 1990 municipal elections and 27 per cent in April. Varese, with a population of 88,000, is feeling the political earthquake that has hit the north in the past year as a result of investigations into municipal corruption by zealous magistrates. 'The entire leadership of the Christian Democrats and Socialists have been wiped out by the corruption scandal,' says Mr Roberto Maroni, deputy head of the League parliamentary group. Since June no fewer than 40 party officials - all but two from the Christian Democrats and Socialists - have been arrested or are under investigation on suspected corruption charges. Of the eight parliamentary representatives elected in April, only the four League members are not under investigation for alleged corruption. Those arrested include two former mayors. The decapitation of the ruling elite, which also extends to former members of the communist party reformed into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), makes it easy to see why the League has become so popular. 'Our support is from the small and medium-sized industrialists, not big business, from artisans and especially among the young. We are getting votes from across the political spectrum as well as from people who have previously been apolitical,' says Mr Maroni. While the Christian Democrats and Socialists have been struggling to find candidates and rebuild demoralised organisations with much reduced funds, the League has prepared a 21-page programme of action. If Mr Guiseppe Leone, a 47-year-old architect, close friend of Mr Bossi and a League founder, becomes mayor, he plans radical overhaul of the administration. This would include creation of a 'citizen manager' to oversee the administration. 'At present our annual budget of L160bn (Pounds 73m) is eaten up 80 per cent by current expenditure,' says Mr Maroni. To raise money, the League aims to privatise local transport, gas and water supplies and sell off municipally owned assets such as a milk plant. Control of those authorities and their patronage in jobs and contracts has been the source of the traditional parties' power. It also explains why in Varese, as in other towns throughout Italy, the politicians have always concentrated far more on manipulating power at a local rather than a national level. Not everyone is happy about the League's ascendancy. The Industrialists' Union distrusts the virulent tone of the League's diatribes against 'the robbers of Rome' and its threat to separate the north from the rest of Italy. The left sees dangerous neo-fascist tendencies in the League's contempt for southerners and undertones of racism in its desire to rid the town of non-EC immigrants. The church, always a pillar of the Christian Democrats, believes the League is too secular and materialistic. Although combined opposition to the League is strong, it remains disparate. Nevertheless, when the League won a third of the vote in local elections in September in Mantua, every other party combined to prevent it taking power. As a result local government in Mantua is deadlocked and new elections will have to be held next year. 'The Mantua experience won't be repeated here,' says Mr Maroni. 'The political parties weren't ready for Mantua: they were still digesting their drubbing in the April general elections. Here we believe we can form an administration, probably with the PDS.' The PDS might seem odd bedfellows but the left-wing party is anxious to take advantage of the disarray of its traditional rivals and retain its influence in northern municipal affairs. Mr Maroni is convinced that if such an alliance occurs, it could be repeated elsewhere, particularly in Milan.</p>

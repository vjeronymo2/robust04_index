			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (22): The wages of rigidity - Edward Balls analyses the structure of Europe's unemployment THE LABOUR market is the Achilles heel of the European economy. High and persistent unemployment across the continent are the most direct, and most distressing, manifestation of Europe's labour deficiencies. But unemployment is just one product of the more general problem of inflexibility and immobility that threatens to hamper Europe's single market. The OECD, in its latest economic outlook, calculates that total unemployment in OECD European countries will rise to 19.9m in the first quarter of this year . More than 80 per cent of Europe's unemployed are located in EC member countries. The EC unemployment rate is expected to be 10.7 per cent of the total workforce, up from 8.4 per cent in 1990. This quarter's EC rate compares with 7.4 per cent in the US and 2.3 per cent in Japan. There is surprisingly little national variation in unemployment rates among the largest EC countries. Italy, at 11 per cent, had the highest unemployment rate of the four largest countries in 1992, followed by France with 10.3 per cent, the UK with 10.1 per cent and Germany with 7.6 per cent. But many of the southern European states have much higher unemployment rates with Spain's 18 per cent the highest. The EC's high unemployment rate is, in part, a reflection of Europe's poor recent growth record. EC gross domestic product is expected to have risen by 1.1 per cent in 1992 compared with 1.8 per cent in both the US and Japan. But even when growth does eventually return to Europe, the Community may remain hampered by high unemployment. EC unemployment rates have remained at persistently high levels for more than a decade. The average EC unemployment rate in the 1980s was 9.6 per cent of the workforce, up from 4.8 per cent in the period 1974-79. The US average was 7.2 per cent in the 1980s and 6.7 per cent in 1974-79. Why does Europe have more unemployment than the US? One commonly cited reason is unemployment benefits. In the US, most men are disqualified from receiving any kind of welfare support after 26 weeks. In Europe, by contrast, unemployment benefits tend to be both more generous and open-ended. The second reason is the relative rigidity of real wages in Europe compared with the US because of Europe's more regulated labour markets and more effective trade unions. The OECD calculates that the amount of unemployment needed to keep inflation from rising is much higher in Europe than in the US, Japan or Sweden. To reduce inflation by one percentage point, unemployment must rise by more than twice as much in EC countries as in OECD countries overall, and by four times more than in the US. Yet, these unemployment rates tell merely part of the unemployment story. They only include people who are available and looking for work. They exclude the 'economically inactive': people who have no jobs but have given up searching for employment. In fact, there has been a sharp rise in male inactivity across the developed world over the past decade, particularly among older and younger men and the unskilled. Non-employment rates, the sum of the unemployed and the 'inactive' as a percentage of the population, are much more constant across countries than unemployment rates. The US, Canada and Australia have non-employment rates similar to those in Europe. Only Japan and Sweden have low non-employment rates by OECD standards. In continental Europe, this rise was largely reflected in the unemployment statistics. Elsewhere - the UK, Australia, Canada and Sweden - the rise in activity was at least as important as the rise in unemployment. The conventional view that Europe has a more serious problem of joblessness than the US is misleading. The fact that the US has less generous unemployment benefits and more flexible real wages does not mean that the US has less non-employment. Instead, they explain why much of this US non-employment fails to show up in the jobless statistics. In the US, where wages are very flexible, the real wages of the lowest-paid 10 per cent of workers have fallen by 30 per cent since 1970. Very low relative wages for unskilled jobs, and the absence of income support for single men, help to explain the rise in crime among less educated men. In continental Europe, by contrast, the relative rigidity of wages, and high unemployment benefits has prevented unskilled real wages from falling but employers have been unwilling to hire the unskilled at those wages. The downside of America's less regulated labour market is more non-employment outside the legal economy. But the advantage is a much more impressive record of employment growth, particularly for women and young people, albeit in lower paid and often part-time occupations. US total employment grew by an average 2.6 per cent a year between 1983 and 1989, compared with just 1.0 per cent for the EC. Employment in Britain's deregulated labour market grew by an average 2.0 per cent a year over the same period. Both the UK and US have higher female participation rates and lower women and youth unemployment rates then continental Europe. But the US has one additional and unambiguous advantage - the mobility of its population. The pattern of US employment growth is not equal across states but the US does not have persistent high or low unemployment regions. Regional problems caused by unequal rates of economic growth are offset by migration. Research by Mr Larry Katz and Mr Olivier Blanchard, published last year by the Brookings Institution, shows that if employment in a particular state falls by 1,000 in any year, then, on average, 300 workers stay unemployed, fifty drop out of the labour force and 650 leave the state. Eventually, out-migration erases the effect on unemployment and participation rates. Migration does not play this equilibrating role to anything like the same extent in European countries, let alone across national borders. In 1987, 2.8 per cent of the US population changed their state of residence compared to 1.1 per cent of Germans who changed their region of residence, 1.3 per cent in France and 1.1 per cent in the UK. The European single market should encourage the creation of new jobs in the Community but the geographic distribution of these jobs is unlikely to be evenly spread. The inflow of migrants from eastern Europe and north Africa may improve the currently low levels of mobility of EC workers. But, for now, the relative immobility of the EC workforce remains an important barrier to economic integration.</p>

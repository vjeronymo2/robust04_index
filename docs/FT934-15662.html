			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Polls in provinces benefit Bhutto MS BENAZIR BHUTTO'S ability to form a durable government in Pakistan was strengthened at the weekend by the outcome of provincial elections. Her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won a narrow lead in Punjab, the largest and wealthiest province, where her rival, Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif, has been chief minister. As in Wednesday's national elections, in which Mr Sharif's Pakistan Moslem League (PML) also won fewer seats than the PPP, he refused to concede defeat. Ms Bhutto said in Lahore: 'Although the margin is small, the message is clear. . . that the Pakistan People's Party and its allies will be forming the government of Punjab.' However, Mr Sartaj Aziz, secretary general of the PML, said in Islamabad: 'How can they make such claims? They are still far from being there.' The PPP and its allies won 112 seats against the PML's 106 seats in the province, which has a total of 240 seats for Moslems and eight for non-Moslem members. The result has suddenly increased the importance of the non-Moslem members as well as another two independents. Both sides are now trying to win their support. Ms Bhutto's party won a comfortable majority in her home province of Sindh. The PML and its allies won enough seats to form the government in the North West Frontier province, while in Baluchistan no single group won enough seats to form the government. At a national level Ms Bhutto is trying to win over smaller parties and independent members in the 217-seat lower house of parliament, where she and her allies have 95 seats so far against Mr Sharif's 72. The house is due to meet next week to elect the prime minister. The Karachi stock exchange 100-share index fell 7.71 points to 1,362.12 yesterday, the first trading day after the election.</p>

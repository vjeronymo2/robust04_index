			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional gains boost OEM figures An increase in exceptional income has enabled Office and Electronic Machines to raise its pre-tax profit from Pounds 14,000 to Pounds 267,000 for the first half of 1992. Turnover fell to Pounds 767,000 (Pounds 1.34m, including Pounds 615,000 for discontinued business) and the operating loss rose to Pounds 390,000 (Pounds 341,000, of which Pounds 144,000 discontinued). The pension fund refund, less reorganisation provision, contributed Pounds 587,000 (Pounds 273,000). Mr Richard Noonan, chairman, said trading in retail operations was marginally better in money terms and virtually unchanged in real terms. It remained the case that the business was too small to be viable in the present economic conditions. The operating loss of continuing business rose partly because margins had suffered and costs had risen, and partly because of the increased costs as the company explored various possibilities. After a tax charge of Pounds 351,000 (Pounds 2,000) losses per share came to 1.4p (earnings 0.2p). The interim dividend is again 0.1p.</p>

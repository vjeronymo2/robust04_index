			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> EGYPT ROUNDS UP MILITANTS  </P> <P> Security forces detained Muslim militants as Egyptians voted in a national  election seen as a test of the militants' strength. Interior Minister Zaki Badr  denounced the militants as Iranian-backed saboteurs and confirmed press reports  that security forces had rounded up Islamic fundamentalists. The opposition  newspaper Wafd said hundreds were detained ahead of the voting for the Shura  Council, a consultative body that recommends laws to Parliament. Security  sources reported scattered incidents of violence but said voting was mostly  peaceful. The ruling National Democratic Party seemed certain to win a majority  despite attempts by the militant Muslim Brotherhood to woo voters weary of  Egypt's economic troubles.  </P></p>

This  is what he had to say during the return trip to Havana:    "There could not be a Cuban foreign policy and Cuba would  not  have the voice and vote it has today if it were not thanks to  the dedication we have seen in the fields, thanks to the  dedication we saw at the biological factories, thanks to the  efforts of so many men and women whom we do not have the  privilege of personally knowing, and who do this 24 hours a day  under conditions much more difficult and complex than those  under which I travel the world."    Regarding the results of his first year as head of the  Foreign Ministry, Robaina said:    "It has meant a significant change in my life, not so for  the  work. I believe the only reason we have to be pleased is that it  seems that some people believe that we are doing what needs to  be done. I am not comparing whether the work is better or worse  than that done before me. I prefer to think that we do today  what we do thanks to what was done before. My only interest is  for the foreign policy conducted to reflect the times. I believe  we have been doing so."    Foreign journalists asked Robaina the trite question about  his work style as head of the Foreign Ministry.    "I insist that when I was given this responsibility I was  not  given conditions. They simply knew me when they appointed me.  The mission I was given was to conduct the country's foreign  policy following aspects of the work initiated with the youth  dealing with our image abroad. I can say that no one has asked  me to change my style. I was given a task and I have assumed it  in the manner I think it should be assumed. I also think that  style is part of the revolutionary training. I do not think it  is just the fruit of an individual's private initiative. I think  I have interpreted the revolution in this manner and I am trying  to carry it out.    ``Concerning contradictions and concerns about this mission,  I think there were concerns when I was appointed foreign  minister. Concerns and worries will always exist, and there will  be favorable and unfavorable opinions about this mission. But I  can honestly say that I do not worry about the number of people  who might be in favor or against this mission. I do that which I  am positively convinced is the best thing to do.''</p>

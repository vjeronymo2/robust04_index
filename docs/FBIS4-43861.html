			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--With the closure of the Democracy Party  (DEP) and the upcoming eviction of 13 deputies from Parliament,  the fate of Turkey's politics has fallen into the hands of four  former DEP members.    On Friday [17 June], the DEP's last acting chairman Remzi  Kartal appealed to his former colleagues from Brussels, calling  on them too to resign from Parliament.    If the four Kurdish-origin deputies agree to Kartal's plea  in  order to "avoid being instrumental to the system"--as he put  it-- Turkey will enter a crucial election period in which  by-elections to fill vacant seats in Parliament have to held  within three months.    With its ailing economy, political observers say the  financial burden of an "election economy" in Turkey would be too  great, and would impose a serious threat for the future of the  current coalition government.    Currently, there are eight seats vacant in Parliament, but  once the detailed verdict is published in the Official Gazette  and relayed to the Parliament Speaker, the vacancies will number  21-- only two short of the number required for by-elections to  be held.    If two more DEP-origin deputies agree to resign immediately,  as Kartal has called for, they will be playing a major role in  Turkish politics.    The Turkish Parliament has 450 seats shared between the  ruling True Path Party (DYP), which holds 178 seats, the junior  coalition Social Democrat Peoples' Party (SHP) with 55 seats,  the main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) with 100 seats, the  Welfare Party (39), Republican Peoples Party (18), Nationalist  Action Party (14), Grand Unity Party (7), Democratic Left Party  (3), New Party (3), Nation Party (2), with independents holding  the remaining 10 seats.    In order to avoid expulsion from Parliament in the case of a  party closure, DEP deputies Mehmet Emin Sever (Mus), Muzaffer  Demir (Mus), Mahmut Uyanik (Diyarbakir) and Mahmut Alinak  (Sirnak) said earlier they had either resigned from the party or  were never actually members of it.    The Constitution says that any politicians who are members  of  a party when a case is launched by the Constitutional Court,  will lose their parliamentary status and immunity if a closure  decision is taken.    Although Alinak's immunity was lifted earlier he is still in  prison, he has insisted that he resigned from the party before  the case was launched.    On Thursday, the Court did not remove the parliamentary  status of these deputies, agreeing that they were not members of  DEP when the case began.    Although DEP executives still argue that they were members,  they have had little support in this argument and claim that the  decision not to abolish the parliamentary status of these  deputies stemmed from the political decision not to force Turkey  into an election atmosphere.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Son Ke-yong] </F>   [Text] As Seoul and Washington have been at loggerheads  over imported American sausages for several months, the Foreign  Ministry is seeking to defuse looming trade frictions between  the two countries.    "The ministry is positively considering improving current  regulations," said a ministry official, hinting that the  government would move to partially accept U.S. demands.    The trade dispute was ignited March 22 when the  Health-Social  Affairs Ministry decided to reclassify U.S.-produced sausages,  virtually banning their import.    The ministry said that Korean importers had brought into the  country heat-treated chilled sausages after making a false  declaration to authorities that they were importing non-heat  treated frozen sausages in order to lengthen their shelf life.    The regulatory shelf life of non-heat treated frozen sausage  is 90 days while that of heat-treated chilled sausage is 30 days.    Meanwhile, the United States raised the sausage issue at a  recent GATT session, threatening to "review all options  available and appropriate," a remark which has been used just  before threatening to impose Super 301 trade sanctions.    The U.S. side claimed that the Seoul government slapped the  import ban without any prior notice and any scientific evidence  to determine that the sausages are hazardous to the public  health.    An American sausage producers association has already asked  the U.S. Government to designate Korea as a priority foreign  country (PFC) in accordance with the Super 301 trade act.    So far, the Health-Social Affairs Ministry is showing no  signs of yielding to the U.S. demand, asserting that it took due  measures within legal boundaries.    "In consideration of public health, the ministry has no  alternative but to ban the circulation of the sausage," said a  health ministry official said.    The ministry has already taken punitive actions against  officials in charge of the sausage import for neglecting their  duties, which gives the ministry little maneuvering room in  dealing with the issue.    In support of the ministry's decision, domestic consumers  groups are preparing to launch a large-scale campaign against  the import of American sausages, calling the U.S. threat  "unacceptable."    The Citizens' Alliance for Consumer Protection of Korea  already issued a statement last month, saying that it would  boycott U.S. products if Washington doesn't drop its trade  pressure.    In contrast with the health ministry's stand, the Foreign  Ministry is considering adopting new measures to minimize trade  frictions.    Currently, 37 container loads of U.S. sausage, worth $1.3  million, have been sitting at the southern port of Pusan since  mid- February.    The Foreign Ministry seems to think that there is no way to  save the sausage in Pusan because its shelf life has almost  expired.    It takes about one month to ship sausage from the United  States to Korea and almost two months have passed since the ban  was imposed.    "Even though the $1.3 million worth of sausage is relatively  small in view of trade volume between the two countries, it  could have a serious impact on the bilateral trade  relationship," an official said.    The ministry is expected to hold another consultation  session  with the Health-Social Affairs Ministry to upgrade the current  food regulation laws.    The domestic market share of U.S. sausages amounts to 15  percent and large department stores and supermarkets have sold  them to Korean consumers at relatively low prices compared with  locally produced sausages, the health ministry said.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> QANTAS TO PUT EMPHASIS ON ASIA  </P> <P> Australia's national airline Qantas today said it will drop four unprofitable  routes later this year to focus on Asia, which the carrier believes will become  a major source of tourists for the country.  </P> <P> "We are taking our resources from one part of the planet and putting them in  another, much more profitable part of the planet," Rodger Robertson, director  of corporate planning for Qantas, told Reuters.  </P> <P> By this fall, Qantas plans to stop flying to Amsterdam, Athens, Bombay and  Bahrain.  </P> <P> "These places are losing us money, and there's very little prospect of them  becoming profitable," Robertson said.  </P></p>

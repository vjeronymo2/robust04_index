			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Algiers, May 19 (MAP) -- The National Transition  Council to act as a legislative body during the transition  period in Algeria was officially instituted Wednesday. [passage  omitted]    The Algerian dailies of this Thursday [19 May] have all  commented on the president's speech noting that he had  deliberately avoided to speak of dialog with all parties `with  none of them debarred'. For the dailies, President Zeroual has  thus definitely given up the carrying on of contacts with the  leaders of the banned `Islamic Salvation Front' (FIS) to find a  political solution to the Algerian crisis.    The National Transition Council is made up of 178 members  including 12 women. The members are representing about 30 small  political parties in addition to the moderate Islamist party  `HAMAS' [Islamic Society Movement] (63 seats), state  institutions (30 seats) and economic and social organisations  (85 seats). 27 seats are still vacant in the prospect that they  will be occupied by the major political parties such as the  National Liberation Front (FLN/former single party), the Front  of Socialist Forces (FFS of Hocine Ait Ahmed) and the Islamic  Renaissance Movement (Ennahda) that decided to boycott the  council.</p>

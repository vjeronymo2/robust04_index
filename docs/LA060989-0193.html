			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KLEIN TO QUIT RACING, SELL ALL HIS 146 HORSES  </P> <P> Eugene V. Klein, three-time Eclipse Award winner as North America's leading  thoroughbred owner, is getting out of horse racing, he said today.  </P> <P> Among the 146 horses Klein will sell are 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning  Colors, 1986 Horse of the Year Lady's Secret and current 3-year-old filly Open  Mind.  </P> <P> "I guess it's just the time of my life and the stage of life that I'm at," the  68-year old former owner of the San Diego Chargers said. "All my life I have  been very, very competitive -- since the days of flying for the Air Force in  World War II.  </P> <P> "There comes a time you should do what you want to do and take it easy."  </P> <P> In addition to the stars of his stable, Klein's stock of brood mares,  yearlings, foals of 1989 and horses in training will be disposed of at the  two-day November Breeding Stock Sale at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Since entering the thoroughbred business in 1982, Klein has raced six champions  in his name or in partnership, won seven Breeders' Cup races and 11 Eclipse  Awards.  </P></p>

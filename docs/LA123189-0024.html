			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> '89 ENCORES;  </P> <P> ON THIS LAST DAY OF THE YEAR, AND OF THE 1980S, THE VIEW STAFF PAYS A RETURN  VISIT TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE NEWS IN 1989.;  </P> <P> WAITING FOR OPEN DOOR  </P> <P> When a Times reporter phoned Doris Bartlett to pursue the story of her  husband's May 5 death, she was reluctant to discuss it.  </P> <P> Mired in grief, rage and fear, she was not sure how to cope with or get past  her emotions. Her husband had died -- after 39 married years and before the  joys of retirement -- while awaiting an insurance company's approval of his  request for a pacemaker.  </P> <P> But Bartlett didn't decide to talk about her husband's death "until I talked  with my minister and my husband's doctors and they, too, insisted I share my  story."  </P> <P> Looking back at her decision, she now says the story, which ran Aug. 15,  changed the course of her grief and perhaps her life.  </P> <P> From the day the article appeared, she began receiving friendship calls and  letters from acquaintances who hadn't known her husband had died. And from  people who looked her up in the phone book to tell her their similar  experiences. And from one friend who said he had a sleeping disorder and needed  oxygen therapy in his home, but that his insurance wouldn't provide it. "He  told me he was afraid he'd die in the middle of the night. Then he read the  article and got the courage to call (his carrier) and complain again. The man  there had just read the article, too, and he said, 'Don't worry, within two  hours you will have the oxygen you need and we'll keep it coming to you,' "  Bartlett says.  </P> <P> Thus, Bartlett believes her candor has helped save at least one life. And then,  she says, the television stations started to call for interviews.  </P> <P> Bartlett says she became an activist almost without realizing it. But she  decided not to sue her insurance company because "I am 67 years old and it  would be in the courts for five to seven years, and I do not want to spend my  remaining time that way. There is no amount of money that will bring my husband  back."  </P> <P> Now, she says, she is "waiting for God to open another door. I have to find  something to do that would be more beneficial than sitting in a courtroom.  </P> <P> "And just this week," she adds, "I decided I've become a whole person again.  I'm back to being me. I feel I can do almost anything now, if I could manage to  get through all of this." BETTIJANE LEVINE  </P></p>

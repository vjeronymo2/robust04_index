			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / S Africa's image problem makes investors wary: Fear of labour unrest and exchange controls mean foreigners are still nervous of taking the plunge When it comes to attracting new foreign investment, South Africa has an image problem. Potential investors like the rhetoric of the country's new government, which constantly promises fiscal discipline; but they are waiting to see intention translated into action. The retention of exchange controls and daily headlines proclaiming a crisis of industrial unrest have done much to perpetuate the image of South Africa as a high-risk destination for international capital. This is not entirely fair. However nervous whites may grumble about striking black checkout girls or car workers, the country is not wracked by industrial strife - or at least, not any more than normal for this time of year. July and August are traditionally the 'strike season' in South Africa, the period every year when collective bargaining reaches its peak in the mining, engineering, motors and other industries. This year's disputes appear to have captured more than their fair share of publicity for two reasons: strikes have provided just about the only news available during the political lull which followed the April 27 elections; and whites have seized on the unrest as a focus for dissatisfaction with the new government which began to surface once economic realities dispersed the happy glow of the peaceful transition. But whatever the popular perception, there is no real evidence of a fundamental shift in strike patterns, or a serious upsurge in militant action. According to Johannesburg labour consultants Andrew Levy and Associates, 233,066 man-days were lost to industrial action in July this year, higher than in the previous two years but less than a third of the figure for 1991 (752,655). Some rise in strike action may have been inevitable. With the economy finally recovering after four years of recession and real wage cuts, there is substantial pent-up demand for wage rises. Equality at the ballot box has also fuelled new demands for the narrowing of wage differentials between the (almost entirely white) management and the (almost entirely black) shop-floor. According to the Cape Town-based Labour Research Service, which has close links to the unions, the average pay of the directors of South Africa's 70 largest public companies is 47 times that of the companies' labourers. A crisis of union leadership may also be exacerbating unrest. The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the largest federation, has lost nearly 100 top unionists to the government and the private sector in recent months, and many who remain lack the authority to push for unpopular settlements. Still, most unionists and employers believe all the big disputes - in engineering, the car industry and mining - will be settled, and that no national general strike is likely. Cosatu had threatened a general strike in the industrial heartland around Johannesburg last Monday, but abandoned the threat after talks with President Nelson Mandela. That is the good news. South Africa is not a labour battleground (though if disputes drag on into the autumn, this view would have to be revised). But the bad news for investors is South African labour is expensive in relation to productivity. According to figures compiled by Pretoria's National Productivity Institute, hourly manufacturing wages in South Africa, at Dollars 4.78 in 1993 dollars, rank just below wage rates in Singapore and South Korea (where productivity is far higher) and far above countries such as Malaysia (Dollars 1.80), Thailand (Dollars 0.71) and the Philippines (Dollars 0.68). With most manufacturing employers likely to agree to above-inflation wage demands this year, South Africa's competitive position could worsen unless steps are taken to improve productivity. In the meantime, the image problem will persist - and foreign investors so desperately needed to create jobs may remain wary.</p>

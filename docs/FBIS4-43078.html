			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Venizelos] </F>   [Text] The Americans are said to have leaked President  Glavkos Kliridhis' letter to President Bill Clinton and Prime  Minister John Major. According to I SIMERINI information, the  American Embassy in Nicosia leaked the content of the letter,  specifically President Kliridhis' reference that if talks on the  CBM's [confidence-building measures] continue he would resign,  in order to test the Cyprus Government's reaction and to record  the amount of persistence in this warning.    The Cyprus Government's message with Kliridhis' warning to  the U.S. and British Governments, who are playing a pioneering  role these days behind the scenes for the resumption of talks on  the CBM's, was crystal clear: We will reject a Security Council  appeal if it decides to continue the process. This is what a  reliable source in Nicosia has told I SIMERINI and noted that  President Kliridhis briefed the Ambassadors of these countries  on his intentions at the meetings he had with them last week.  These ambassadors briefed their governments before the letter  was sent, and at least the Americans began the leaks on this  question from the very beginning. What did they expect to gain  by the leaks? Through the official statements by the government,  they would test how serious the president was about his  resignation, or more probably, they would force him to back down  in the face of publicity.    A government source in Nicosia, without confirming or  denying  the REUTER report on the content of Kliridhis' letter, told I  SIMERINI that Nicosia is determined to avert a resumption of the  talks. At the same time, it warns that if elections were held  today, the climate to be created in public opinion would favor  the election of hard-liners on the Cyprus issue.    All the government actions are based on understandings with  the Greek Government. Greek Ambassador in Nicosia Alexandros  Sandhis is being kept fully briefed on the developments by  President Kliridhis, and it appears that some moves are being  formulated jointly. Reports from Athens did not rule out the  possibility that the Greek Government would also send warning  letters. The statements by Karolos Papoulias, Evangelos  Venizelos, and Yeoryios Papandreou (which he made after meeting  Alekos Mikhailidhis) that the CBM's are dead indicate the Greek  side's intentions and activities that will follow.    The British and American moves in New York and Kliridhis'  reaction with the warning that he would resign are the climax of  a series of developments. According to I SIMERINI information,  when President Kliridhis recently talked with a foreign diplomat  he said that for one year the Greek side has been saying "yes"  despite the reaction on the domestic front. Then the foreigners  were telling us "bravo," but now they reward Rauf Denktas'  intransigence, President Kliridhis pointed out.</p>

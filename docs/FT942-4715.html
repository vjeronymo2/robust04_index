			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Ricardo gears up for Pounds 13.6m acquisition Ricardo Group, the engin-eering consultancy, is to acquire the company that built the transmissions for the Jaguar XJ220 and the factory Ford Escorts in the world rally championship. It is paying Pounds 13.6m for FF Developments, raising the money through a rights issue at 130p. The issue of 10.5m shares at 1-for-3.07 is fully underwritten by Hill Samuel Bank. Yesterday, Ricardo's shares closed 3p lower at 162p. FFD, which is based in Coventry and Detroit in the US, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.58m last year on turnover of Pounds 16.5m, with the profits divided equally between the US and UK. It is 49 per cent-owned by Chrysler and 51 per cent by the Rolt family. Mr Christopher Ross, Ricardo chairman, said yesterday that the group had been looking for a sensible acquisition after organic growth of 25 per cent in the automotive division for the past three years. FFD would broaden the group's scope in the transmission and chassis engineering sectors, complementing Ricardo's expertise on engines. Ricardo has grown by selling its expertise on refining so-called NVH (noise-vibration-harshness) to large motor manufacturers. FFD's customers include Chrysler, which accounted for 45 per cent of the US turnover, Ford, General Motors, Massey Ferguson, Volkswagen and Toyota. The company has five divisions - chassis engineering, transmission engineering, transmission assembly, limited slip differentials and an engineering recruitment business. It was formed in 1971 by Maj Tony Rolt in order to apply four wheel drive systems and anti-lock braking systems, which the company pioneered. Mr Stuart Rolt, chairman and chief executive of FFD since 1988, is receiving Pounds 2.34m of his consideration in Ricardo shares, which he has agreed not to sell for two years. He is also taking up a two-year service contract to remain with the company. At the interim stage Ricardo doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.97m on turnover of Pounds 30.1m. The board intends to recommend a final dividend of 4p (3.8p) on all shares in issue at the end of its financial year this month.</p>

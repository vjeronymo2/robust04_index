In order to find out  its aims and objectives our correspondent turned to a long-time  RDRM supporter, Air Force Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, former  commander in chief of the CIS Armed Forces, a political figure  who ran on the movement's ticket in the 12 December elections.    [KURANTY] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, what are the main aims of the  RDRM's second congress?    [Shaposhnikov] First: We need to sum up the results of our  work in the period between the congresses and during the  election campaign. To make an analysis. Second: to determine  our program for the immediate future. The program should be  specific. Metaphorically speaking, our aims and objectives  should be more "down-to-earth."    [KURANTY] Can organizational changes be expected?    [Shaposhnikov] I am not a leader of the movement. To some  extent I would like some changes to take place, but without the  movement's evolving into a party. I categorically oppose a  strict hierarchy or party centralism.    [KURANTY] What are the main methods the RDRM employs to  raise its effectiveness?    [Shaposhnikov] We have a fairly large number of  sympathizers. At present, to pursue our political line we need  to strengthen our vertical structures somewhat.</p>

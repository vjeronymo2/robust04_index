			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Poor basic skills 'cost Pounds 5bn a year' POOR BASIC skills, including problems with reading and writing, are costing industry nearly Pounds 5bn a year, a survey of companies published today by the government-funded Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit shows. One in seven companies interviewed felt the impact of poor basic skills on its organisation was severe or very severe. Eighty-five per cent felt that poor basic skills contributed to reduced efficiencies, a poor image with customers and to increased costs. Thirteen per cent of adults over 16 years of age in the companies interviewed had serious reading, writing, mathematical and verbal difficulties. Estimates on the total cost to British industry included the cost of staff who could be dispensed with if basic skills were better and the cost of rectifying customer orders dispatched incorrectly. Gallup interviewed more than 400 companies. The Scottish education system, although widely recognised as good, is failing too many children by not teaching them basic skills, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday. Many young Scots were leaving school unable to read or write, or add up, he said in a speech to Conservatives in Aberdeen. 'They don't even have the tools to do the jobs of yesterday, never mind tomorrow,' he said. The Cost to Industry: Basic Skills and the UK Workforce, ALBSU, Kingsbourne House, 229-231 High Holborn, London WC1V 7DA. Pounds 3.95.</p>

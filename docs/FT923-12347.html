			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (2): Chill from Denmark - Gilts dulled by EC doubts EUROPEAN government bond markets started the year in bullish mood, after EC leaders reached agreement on European monetary union at Maastricht last December. But their enthusiasm was soon dampened by growing concerns about political risk. The Danish vote against ratification of the Maastricht treaty in June came as a bolt from the blue, sending European bond markets into turmoil. While an uneasy calm has now returned, investors and traders are still reeling. The uncertainty seems certain to linger over European bond markets at least until the French referendum on the issue on September 20. By this stage, the prospects for European monetary union should have been clarified. But economic conditions for most European markets are still broadly positive. 'The European environment is fairly friendly to bond markets,' argues Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg. Real interest rates are rising, fiscal policy is mostly under control, and inflation is not only falling, but falling at a surprisingly quick pace. 'The only thing holding European bond markets back is the question of the timing of interest rate cuts,' argues Mr Juckes. 'When they start to come, we will see bonds perform well.' In the meantime, the French referendum could well provide a potent injection of volatility. Only the German and Dutch bond markets are likely to be immune, if traders get a renewed attack of the jitters about European monetary union. Consequently, Germany and Holland are likely to be the main beneficiaries of any new money invested in European markets ahead of the referendum. Meanwhile, the repercussions of the Danish vote are still being felt. In early July, the Bank of Italy raised the discount rate by a full percentage point to 13 per cent, in an effort to stabilise the lira and fend off devaluation rumours, which had triggered heavy speculative selling of the currency. Investors are questioning the new Italian government's ability to control its budget deficit: there is no longer an assumption that targets set by Maastricht will be met. Italian bonds are now trading at a yield spread of around 540 basis points above the German Bund market. That implies a devaluation of the lira amounting to 25 per cent in the next five years. The Spanish market, which was also sold off dramatically after the Danish referendum, has recovered better than the Italian market. 'In the longer term, the market still has excellent prospects,' argues Mr Major. Investors still believe in Spain's convergence plan. Still, he expects Spanish bonds to trade in a spread range of 350 - 380 basis points above the Bund curve, until the French vote. Sterling, which had been trading in a narrow range, has also come under pressure, damaging sentiment in the gilt market. Until now, gilts have performed outstandingly, with a particularly sharp rally following the reelection of the Conservative government earlier this year. In the first six months of the year, according to the JP Morgan Government Bond Index, gilts offered returns of close to 8 per cent for sterling-based investors, and of 9.8 per cent for dollar based investors, outperforming all major markets. But the recent pressure on sterling has dimmed speculations of an early rate cut, and the gilts market's advance may also have stalled. The tone of the French bond market has also been undermined by the prospect of further setbacks to the Maastricht treaty. The issue has become highly politicised in France, so that a vote for Maastricht is being touted as a vote for President Mitterrand. Consequently, the markets are now viewing the matter as fraught with political as well as economic implications. The September referendum is likely to remain a focus for investors throughout the generally quieter summer months. 'If the French say 'no' there will be a major sell-off in the higher-yielders,' said Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income at Legal General, the UK insurer. 'We got half of it with Denmark - we would get the other half with France.' Meanwhile, the continuing strength of the US Treasury markets continues to defy expectations. The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession caused a further cut in the discount rate by half a point to three per cent in early July. However, fund managers are becoming increasingly hungry for yield, given the low yields available on government debt. In addition, with short-term interest rates at historically low levels, investors are increasingly focusing on the long end of the very positive yield curve. Despite the problems facing the European bond markets, they nevertheless outperformed other markets in the first half of the year, for both dollar and sterling-based investors. According to the JP Morgan index, European bond markets offered returns of nearly 3 per cent in sterling and 4.7 per cent in dollars, compared with 1.4 per cent in sterling and 3.2 per cent in dollars globally.</p>

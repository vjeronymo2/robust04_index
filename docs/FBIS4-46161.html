			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Libyan leader Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by </F> unidentified correspondent in Tripoli; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] AL-HAYAH: What is  preoccupying you most these days?    Al-Qadhdhafi: At the national level, we are  preoccupied with the current confrontation between a small  country and a small people, that is, the Libyan people, and  three major states, all of which are nuclear and Christian  states. Libya is a Muslim state and they are imperialist states  which have the right of veto (in the Security Council). And  they have atomic bombs. Of course, we cannot ignore the fact  that we are very busy with the confrontation with three  oppressive, arrogant, insolent, and tyrannical states. [passage  omitted]    At the international level, we are preoccupied with that  international arrogance and that insolence. Because the world  has turned into a jungle. But we are certain that the small  animals in the jungle will fight with their claws and teeth --  which means that the jungle will drown in blood because of what  imperialism is doing. [passage omitted]    AL-HAYAH: What about Algeria? Is it not  preoccupying you?    Al-Qadhdhafi: Of course, regrettably, France is  currently taking revenge against Algeria. France and the United  States are behind all that is happening in Algeria. France is  backed primarily by the United States and the Israelis. The  Mossad, French intelligence, and the CIA are involved in the  murder, financing, training, and armament operations, so that  Algeria would pay the price for its independence and rebellion  against France. That is what is happening in Algeria.    AL-HAYAH: How can you help Algeria?    Al-Qadhdhafi: By God, that is a worry.... If the  aggression was foreign, the matter would have been clear. But  as long as the Algerians are fighting one another inside the  country, no one can do anything except offering advice and kind  words. They [not further identified] are also trying to get  Egypt to pay the price for its war against the Israelis, the  'Abd-al-Nasir era, the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and  its leadership of the Arab nation. Egypt is paying the price  for that, because the Americans, the West, and the Israelis  consider Egypt the archenemy. The Israelis want to destroy  Egypt. There is a truce between Egypt and Israel, not peace.  They want to exploit this truce to destroy Egypt so that it  will be under Israel's heel.    AL-HAYAH: With regard to the Libyan issue and the  blockade imposed on it, how do you view the possibility of  finding a solution or a way out, and do you believe that is  possible?    Al-Qadhdhafi: If the issue is to do with  Lockerbie, there are solutions proposed which are very feasible  and which will save face for all the parties. But if the  Western states have another objective, then the attempts are  improper and we would be facing a state of colonialism and  insolence. And thus we should prepare ourselves for a  confrontation and a war which the enemy should lose or not win.  If the issue is to do with Lockerbie, it can be resolved easily  in accordance with the formulas being proposed. All  international organizations and the world as a whole support  Libya. The three states are isolated, exposed, and lack even a  fig leaf to cover their nakedness before the world with regard  to the Lockerbie issue and the Libyan position. If their  objective is colonialist, then in this case we are facing a new  colonialist attempt and we will fight.    AL-HAYAH: With regard to the proposed solutions,  is there anything new and practical?    Al-Qadhdhafi: Of course, there is a proposal from  the Arab League and from international jurists, namely that a  Scottish court be sent to another country -- The Hague, for  example. And that the two suspects be handed over to the Arab  League and then to this court under agreed UN guarantees. This  is the latest solution we have heard. It is not a Libyan  solution or a Libyan proposal. It is a proposal made by  international jurists, espoused by the Arab League, and  supported by the world as a whole.    AL-HAYAH: What is the fate of all the weapons in  your possession? Can you look after and service them? You  purchased large quantities of weapons....    Al-Qadhdhafi: It has become clear that we were  not wrong when we purchased and stockpiled the weapons. Time  has shown that Libya is a target for aggression. One day  al-Sadat was against us, Bourguiba was against us, al-Numayri  was against us, and Hissein Habre was against us. France and  the United States fought alongside them in Chad and Egypt. And  Niger's Kountche was against us, and U.S. fleets threatened us  from the sea. And we were attacked in 1986 by the two biggest  states in the world, that is the United States and Britain. Our  children were killed while asleep in their homes. It has become  clear that we were right when we purchased the weapons and that  we were targeted by an oppressive and direct aggression, and  that we were entitled to have weapons to defend ourselves. The  biggest danger threatening us now is the Israelis' possession of  atomic bombs and nuclear missiles with a 4,000-mile range aimed  against Libya, North Africa, Sudan, and the other Arab states.  It is a very serious matter. Israel has atomic weapons, and  the United States and the West are refusing to talk to the  Israelis about them or to deprive them of this weapon. While  the United States continues to pursue Libya, Korea, Iran, and  Pakistan. As for the Israelis, they are exempt from the  pursuit, punishment, and questioning. They are above  international law. They are above Chapter VII of the UN Charter.  If the Security Council decides a punishment for Israel, the  United States uses its right of veto. Actually we are faced  with a very serious situation: An adversary state is exempt  from punishment and from Chapter VII of the UN Charter, is above  international law, and is entitled to own any weapon of mass  destruction, and no one questions it about anything. They  pursued us because of a pharmaceutical plant until they  ascertained it was a pharmaceutical plant. Why do they not  pursue the Israelis, who admit their possession of atomic bombs  and who have not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty?    AL-HAYAH: You have helped numerous allies since  the revolution erupted. Who is now with you, who has turned  against you, and who has been able to help you during the  blockade period?    Al-Qadhdhafi: By God, all those we helped support  us, each according to his ability. We helped numerous forces in  the world. We helped people who are now presidents of republics  and heads of state. The West used to say that these are  terrorist camps. These terrorist camps have turned into heads  of state and regular armies, like Museveni and Sam Nujoma in  Namibia, or the presidents of Congo, Angola, and Mozambique...  all of them had their camps in Libya. They [the West] used to  call them terrorists. [passage omitted]    AL-HAYAH: A final question regarding those  describing themselves as oppositionists abroad: What would you  say to them?    Al-Qadhdhafi: I say that with the establishment  of people's power, there is no room for opposition. Oppose  whom? The Libyan people? So you are opposing your people and  homeland. In that case, the person becomes a stray dog. That  person is a stray dog when he opposes his people and his  homeland. [passage omitted] There is no possibility of  opposition at all. If there are Libyans abroad, they are  miserable. Most of them are businessmen. A large number of  them returned, carrying catalogs and business contacts from  which we have benefited. They enter and leave the country after  they realized that matters are different. They laughed at the  conditions they had been in. Even people who used to attack us  over the radio came and laughed at their previous conditions,  admitting they had been miserable and their statements were  unreasonable. They told us: Forgive us, and indeed we did when  they entered the country... Anyone who wants to return can  return, and anyone who repents is forgiven. God accepts  repentance, so shouldn't human beings do the same? Anyone who  repents enters the country safely. As for anyone who does not  repent, his only option is to become an agent for foreign  intelligence, and this is what has happened. One escaped after  stealing the people's money and another escaped to avoid  military service and national service.... These cases do not  represent opposition. Opposition takes place when there is  colonialism in the country, when there is dictatorship or  exploitation.... This is opposition. But when the people have  the power, foreigners expelled, and the homeland and the people  are free, what do you call those who escaped? Miserable. They  are informers for U.S. intelligence. They say things against  their own people and their own homeland, like hit Libya, boycott  Libyan oil, or attack Libya. What does this incitement mean? It  means that intelligence services tell them: say this. So they  say it. They do not even merit a question being put about them.</p>

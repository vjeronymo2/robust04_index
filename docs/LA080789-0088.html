			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ZIGGY MARLEY LIVELIES UP HIMSELF IN THE NICK OF TIME  </P> <P> Ziggy Marley did not wait a minute too long to dip into his father's songbook  for "Lively Up Yourself."  </P> <P> The first few songs of the nearly two-hour set Saturday at Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre by the Melody Makers slid by uneventfully, with proficient but  colorless renditions of material from the band's current "A Bright Day" album.  </P> <P> But the charged rendition of the celebratory "Lively Up Yourself," the only Bob  Marley tune the Melody Makers performed Saturday, galvanized the performance.  </P> <P> The Melody Makers band is made up of four singers: Ziggy, Steven and Cedella  Marley, all children of Bob Marley, plus Sharon Prendergast. They are backed up  by the instrumental band Dallol, which followed up the "Lively Up" high point  by locking into the ominous, rolling groove of "Lee and Molly." When lead  guitarist Earl (Chinna) Smith ripped off an unusually raucous solo, the Melody  Makers were on their way to a set that visited far more peaks than valleys.  </P> <P> The early section had foundered as much on Ziggy's lack of animation as any  inherent weakness in the material (although the songs on "One Bright Day" do  generally lack the catchiness of the Melody Makers' breakthrough "Conscious  Party" album). Dressed in a loose, mismatched ensemble that sported  Afro-Caribbean prints in black and white on the tunic and in red and gold on  the pants, Ziggy came across as a distant performer who did not seem concerned  with making audience contact.  </P> <P> That initial impression may have stemmed from the difference between his  performing style and that of his late father. Where Bob Marley functioned as  the shaman-like visionary and projected that spirit to the audience, Ziggy cut  a more private, Sphinx-like figure who required the audience Saturday to come  to him.  </P> <P> But he did progressively loosen up; the catalyst was the powerful support of  his eight-piece band. Smith's raw-edged tone repeatedly injected added  electricity into the arrangements. Ziggy took particular delight in the  frequent "dub" excursions featuring the potent rhythm section of drummer  Raphael W'Mariam and bassist Zeleke Gessesse.  </P> <P> The Melody Makers are still a youthful unit, so the performance periodically  suffered from rough stretches, such as the melodic fussiness afflicting some  tunes and the overextended arrangements plaguing others. Prendergast and  Cedella Marley (joined by a third vocalist) chipped in with sharp backing  vocals and nonstop dancing, but the group needs to find something for Steven  Marley to do other than wander around the stage, add very occasional snatches  of percussion and sing a couple of songs.  </P> <P> But Ziggy remained the focal point. In the ongoing speculation over whether he  is filling his father's footsteps, what gets lost in the shuffle is that Ziggy  is just 20 years old. The almost exclusively teen-age makeup of the crowd  Saturday made it obvious that Ziggy is successfully talkin' to his generation  -- the tomorrow people, not the reggae crowd that was fired and inspired by Bob  Marley. Songs like "Tomorrow People," "Tumbling Down," "Pains of Life" and  "Black My Story" are dealing with (or at least introducing in rudimentary  fashion) some universal themes and major issues.  </P> <P> Far better Ziggy Marley as a model than Pato Banton, whose well-received  opening set included a brief cameo appearance by Ranking Roger, the former  vocalist with the English Beat and General Public. Banton is a slick,  personable reggae cartoon who relied on a kinetic stage presence and  interminable audience participation numbers that plumbed the lowest common  denominator of reggae cliches.  </P> <P> At one point, he "challenged" the audience by shouting, "Do you people out  there believe in freedom?" Way to ask the really tough questions, Pato.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENER'S CHECKLIST  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  </P> <P> * Plant a tree this summer to shade the hot spot in your garden next year.  </P> <P> Choose from a good selection of container trees available now at nurseries.  </P> <P> * One last planting of dahlia tubers will give you fall bloom as the plants you  set out earlier are dying back.  </P> <P> * When spraying plants for insects and diseases, don't forget the underside of  the leaves.  </P> <P> * It's not too late to plant tomatoes. Set them deeper in the ground than they  were in the nursery container to prevent weak, leggy plants.  </P></p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Charges to watch - Personal pensions and you When you take out a personal pension, it is tempting to assume that if the provider is a household name and its performance record is up to scratch, you are on to a winner. But this is simply not true. Performance, arguably, is the most important criterion but the provider's charges come a close second. Where charges are high, the performance must consistently be outstanding to compensate. Yet, the latest survey from Money Management magazine* reveals just how many second-rate products are available. Hearts of Oak friendly society deducts just under 40 per cent of your premiums in charges while its performance is unexceptional, to say the least. By comparison, one of the lowest chargers, Abbey Life, deducts about 14 per cent. Other high chargers identified in the survey include Royal London, Eurolife, British Life Office, Lifetime, Refuge, Acuma, Colonial Mutual, Hambro Guardian, Crown Life, Gartmore, Providence Capitol and Windsor Life. Analysis of charges is particularly important when, as at present, there is a marked lack of consistency in performance league tables. In the survey, several household names failed to match up to expectation. Standard Life's with-profits plan is one of the worst performers over 10 years as is NPI's, which only just avoided the bottom five category. National Mutual's overall performance, one of the best in Money Management's March 1994 survey, took a nose-dive in the latest tables. But while high charges can undermine a good performance elsewhere, charges alone do not guarantee good value. Several of the lowest charging offices also achieved notably poor returns. Guardian Assurance and NPI fall into this category. Personal pensions have attracted a lot of criticism since their launch in July 1988. Nevertheless, more than 5m have been sold to the self-employed and to employees who are not in a company scheme. Although there is nothing wrong with the concept of personal pensions, the high commissions and charges associated with them mean they have been mis-sold widely to employees who would have been better off in the state earnings-related scheme (Serps) or their company plan. Despite the adverse publicity, however, there are still more than 100 financial institutions selling these products. Surveys such as Money Management's indicate that over half are not competitive. Clearly, it is vital to shop around to get the best value for money (see below). Until January 1995 this will not be easy because, at present, providers do not have to tell you what their real charges are. Unless your adviser consults the latest surveys and has a comprehensive database on charges and performance, the advice will be worthless It will continue to be worthless if, when the new rules come into force and providers must tell you their true charges, these are not compared with those of competitors. Yet, according to the Association of British Insurers, the vast majority of regular-premium personal pension plans continue to be sold by direct salesmen or companies that agree to sell only one provider's products and do not have to tell you that you can do better elsewhere. *Money Management, FT Business Magazines, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A IND (tel: 071-405 6969).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOWEST AND HIGHEST CHARGERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lowest five              Pounds Abbey Life               34,830 Equitable Life           34,781 Rothschild AM            34,444 NFU Mutual               34,299 Guardian Ass             34,285  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Highest five             Pounds Hearts of Oak            28,772 Refuge                   29,490 Lifetime                 29,565 Eurolife                 29,837 Royal London             30,487  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows what your fund would be worth after charges if you invest pounds 200 a month for 10 years in a unit-linked plan, assuming a growth rate of 9 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Management  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP AND BOTTOM PERFORMERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top five                Pounds Sun Life                57,297 Royal London            56,131 Co-operative            54,739 Scottish Mutual         54,210 Scottish Eq             53,714  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bottom five             Pounds Guardian Ass            39,014 London Life             40,797 Standard Life           41,214 Royal Life              41,288 Prudential              42,279  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The tables shows the amount paid out after charges if you invested pounds 200 per month for 10 years in a with-profits plan.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Management  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

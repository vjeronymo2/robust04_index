			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bidder opts for derivatives contract Trafalgar House is planning to offset a large part of the expenses related to the offer for Northern Electric by entering into a derivatives contract with Swiss Bank, its financial adviser. In return for an undisclosed fee, Trafalgar will benefit from any rise in the share price of Northern Electric and several other regional electricity companies over and above reference prices set when the contracts were struck a month ago. Trafalgar expects to close out the contracts during the offer period. It is thought to be the first bidder to use such 'contracts for differences' which should reduce its costs whether the offer succeeds or fails. Trafalgar opted for this mechanism rather than buy shares in the target in the market, the traditional method used by bidders to cover their costs. Rival merchant bankers said it was a clever scheme which was likely to be copied. 'Buying shares before or at the start of a bid has become more difficult because institutions are increasingly loath to sell. And while picking up 2 or 3 per cent hardly makes much impact on the outcome it can still leave you with a hefty loss if the bid fails,' said one investment banker. The advisory side of Swiss Bank does not know how its derivatives arm has covered its position, if at all. If it has bought Northern Electric shares, under the Takeover Code it will not be able to assent them to the offer until it goes unconditional.</p>

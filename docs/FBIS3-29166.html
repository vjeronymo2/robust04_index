			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa expressed his desire Tuesday [15 February] to reshuffle  his six-month-old cabinet, a move which is likely to escalate a  power struggle among the ruling parties. "I would like to  contemplate the decision (on a cabinet reshuffle) from a  comprehensive point of view," Hosokawa said at a ministerial  meeting.    Speculation has been surfacing that Hosokawa might make  changes to his cabinet following Tuesday's approval by the  government of a 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 which  begins April 1. Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a key  strategist in the coalition government, also supported  Hosokawa's policy, saying, "It is the premier's exclusive right  (to reshuffle the cabinet), so I will follow his judgment  entirely."    There have been increasing rumors that, if a new cabinet is  formed, Hosokawa will replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, head of Sakigake, and six other cabinet ministers of  the Social Democratic Party (SDP).    Takemura, along with the six SDP ministers, expressed  dissatisfaction earlier this month with Hosokawa's handling of  the consumption tax issue as a quick solution to offset tax  shortfalls created by income tax breaks.    Asked about the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle, Takemura  told a regular press conference on Tuesday that "although it is  the premier's prerogative it is still preferable to get people's  understanding."    Fearing the dismissal of their party head Takemura, Sakigake  held an emergency meeting of its Diet members Tuesday morning  and decided to oppose the idea of a cabinet reshuffle at this  time. Sakigake officials also hinted the party might withdraw  from the coalition government if Hosokawa forces the reshuffle.    Late Monday, Hosokawa urged SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama  to  cooperate with his plan for a cabinet shakeup that he is  considering for early implementation, political sources said.    In his talks with Murayama, Hosokawa asked him to enter the  cabinet in place of former SDP chairman Sadao Yamahana who is  now in charge of political reform, the sources said.    Earlier on Tuesday, Hosokawa told reporters that he was  neutral on the question of reshuffling his six-month-old cabinet  within the day.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The biological opinion also includes protective measures designed to reduce the impact of Delta operations on winter-run chinook salmon. The reasonable and prudent alternative in the opinion contains the following measures to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon: (1) Closure of the Delta Cross Channel each year from February 1 through April 30; (2) operation of the cross channel gate each year from October 1 through January 31 to minimize the diversion of juveniles into the Delta based on the use of a real-time monitoring program; (3) operation of the delta water export facilities each year to ensure that no reverse flow conditions occur in the western Delta from February 1 through April 30; (4) operation of the delta export facilities each year to ensure that reverse flow conditions are minimized from November 1 through January 31; and (5) monitoring of winter-run chinook incidental take at the Federal and State export facilities. The incidental take statement included with the opinion also contains measures designed to minimize the taking of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon incidental to the operation of the water export facilities. This take statement identifies the level of incidental taking by the Bureau and State export facilities to be no more than 1 percent of the estimated number of outmigrant juvenile winter-run chinook salmon entering the Delta in any year, and requires the Bureau and the State to submit daily, weekly, and annual reports based on an extensive monitoring program to ensure the incidental take authorization is not exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the 1992 run size estimate (1,180 fish), NMFS determined that the allowable take of outmigrating juvenile winter-run chinook salmon incidental to operation of the export facilities in 1992&hyph;93 was 2,700 fish. Monitoring of winter-run chinook salmon incidental take during the 1993 outmigration season indicated that the level of taking was substantially higher at the State export facility than at the Federal export facility. The monitoring program also indicated that the rate of taking by mid-February 1993 was higher than anticipated, and that continued high pumping rates could result in exceeding the annual take level authorized by NMFS. As a result, the State voluntarily curtailed pumping at its Delta pumping facility in late February to reduce the loss rate and cumulative loss of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon at its facility. Although pumping rates were gradually increased during March and April 1993 at the State facility, the cumulative loss of juveniles was less than 1 percent of the estimated outmigrant population in 1993. As a result of these and other actions taken by the State and Bureau in accordance with the February 12, 1993, biological opinion and incidental take statement, NMFS believes that the survival of outmigrating juveniles in 1993 was significantly improved over previous years. Continued implementation of these protective measures in future years is expected to improve outmigration success of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon and aid in recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Suisun Marsh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Operation of the Suisun Marsh salinity control gate structure by the State can potentially affect winter-run chinook adversely by diverting outmigrating juveniles from the Sacramento River into Montezuma Slough where conditions for survival are poorer because diverted fish have a longer migration route, and are exposed to increased water temperatures, increased predation, and numerous unscreened water diversions. Upstream migrant adult winter-run chinook that enter the downstream end of Montezuma Slough may also be blocked or delayed by operation of the gates as they attempt to migrate into the Sacramento River.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to minimize impacts on winter-run chinook salmon juveniles, NMFS required (in the 1992 CVP opinion) that salinity control gates to either close from March 1 through April 15, or that unscreened diversions in the Slough not operate during this period. The California Departments of Water Resources and Fish and Game conducted monitoring during this period and provided documentation to NMFS that these diversions were not operated. However, sampling by FWS during April 1992 also indicated that only a small percentage of marked juvenile salmonids (0.2&hyph;1.5 percent) were diverted into Montezuma Slough.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the potential impacts of operating the salinity control gates on winter-run chinook salmon are unclear based on the available information, NMFS addressed the need for additional studies at the facility in the incidental take statement included with the 1993 CVP biological opinion. Specifically, the incidental take statement requires the Bureau and the State to develop and implement a program to evaluate the effects of operating the salinity control structure on winter-run chinook salmon by spring 1994. The program is expected to assess the diversion rate of chinook salmon juveniles into Montezuma Slough, predation at the structure, survival of juveniles passing through the slough, and passage of adults upstream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Droughts/El Ni&ntilde;o  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The natural factors of greatest concern to NMFS are drought conditions and the oceanographic phenomenon known as El Ni&ntilde;o. The effects of the extended 1987&hyph;1992 drought on California's water supply have likely exacerbated the effects of management of State and Federal water operations and other activities on winter-run chinook salmon over the past several years. However, the end of the drought in 1993 due to above normal levels of precipitation throughout the State, and the implementation of protective measures contained in NMFS February 12, 1993, biological opinion are expected to reduce the adverse effects of drought in future years by ensuring that minimum carryover storage is maintained in Shasta Reservoir each year, and that conservative water supply forecasts are used by the Bureau to make annual water allocation decisions. In addition to these measures, the Bureau is expected to construct a temperature control device at Shasta Reservoir that should improve its ability to provide suitable water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The El Ni&ntilde;o event that began in 1991&hyph;1992 may result in reduced ocean survival of winter-run chinook salmon produced in 1990 and 1991 when the estimated run sizes were very low (441 and 191 fish respectively) and drought conditions prevailed. For these and other reasons, NMFS anticipated that the 1993 run size would be low, and also expects that the run size in 1994 will be weak. The only measure that may help to mitigate the impact of El Ni&ntilde;o events may be the hatchery supplementation program developed by the FWS to augment natural juvenile production. If the hatchery supplementation program proves to be successful, it may provide the necessary juvenile production to offset any adverse effects of El Ni&ntilde;o conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

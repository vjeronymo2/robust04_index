			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: ASE extends foreign currency warrants range THE AMERICAN Stock Exchange (ASE) has begun trading a currency warrant based on the performance of the US dollar against the British pound. It already trades foreign currency warrants based on the Japanese yen and German Mark, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. Currency warrants are derivative financial instruments which allow investors to buy a specified amount of currency at a predetermined time and exchange rate, although warrants traded on the ASE can be settled in cash at any time before the contract expires. The pound warrants are aimed at institutional investors who participate in long-term investment or hedging strategies linked to the pound. They act much like call options in the dollar, and their value fluctuates as the value of the US dollar rises or falls against a specific currency.</p>

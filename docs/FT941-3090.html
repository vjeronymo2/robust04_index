			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Price cut likely for Northwest offering Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, appears to be substantially cutting the asking price of a public offering of shares through which it plans to return to the stock market over the next few weeks. When Northwest announced its offering in January it indicated that it hoped to sell the shares at around Dollars 20, raising between Dollars 400m and Dollars 460m in new capital. However, Wall Street analysts said yesterday that it appeared now to be seeking some Dollars 13 to Dollars 14 a share. Northwest declined to comment, citing securities regulations which preclude discussion of public offerings. Lehman Brothers is lead underwriter for the offering, which is expected to be priced next week. Analysts said the offering was never going to be a particularly easy one to sell. Northwest narrowly escaped bankruptcy last year by persuading employees to accept an equity stake in return for labour concessions. It faces a continuing fares war against rival carriers in the depressed North American market and is one of the leading US airlines serving the Pacific, where Japan's recession has hit trade.</p>

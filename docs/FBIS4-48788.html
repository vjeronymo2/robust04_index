			<p>BFN     [Text] Monrovia, 25 May (AFP) -- Four members of two  Liberian armed factions were killed and 12 civilians injured  when the lorry they were riding on ran over a mine north of the  port town of Buchanan, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday [25  May].    Those killed were a colonel of the Armed Forces of Liberia  (AFL) and three guerrillas in a recently emerged faction, the  Liberian Peace Council (LPC), ministry spokesman Arthur Dennis  said.    The presence of an AFL general staff officer in the company  of LPC fighters has stirred up new suspicions that the AFL  helped form the new armed movement last September in a bid  indirectly to pursue a conflict with Liberia's main armed  faction, the National Patriotic Front (NPFL).    But Dennis said "it is not the AFL that sent (the colonel)  to  the territory. He went to the LPC-controlled area on his own."    The LPC, which currently controls the region on Liberia's  central coastline where the truck hit the mine, has declared  that the NPFL is its avowed enemy. It is not a party to a peace  pact signed in July last year among the NPFL, the AFL and a  third faction, the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO).    Dennis said that 10 of the civilians travelling with the  fighters when the mine blast occurred Sunday had been taken to  hospital in serious condition.</p>

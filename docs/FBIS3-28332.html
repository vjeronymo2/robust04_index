Heads of the seven parties, except Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, reached the agreement at a meeting  at the head office of Rengo, Japan's largest labor organization,  which played a key role in helping the parties form the  coalition last April.    Leaders of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party  (DSP), Sakigake (Harbinger), and the United Social Democratic  Party (USDP) attended the meeting.    The chief of the Democratic Reform Party, a minor  parliamentary group in the House of Councillors, also joined.  Hosokawa, who heads the Japan New Party (JNP), was absent.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who met Hosokawa  at his official residence, told reporters that Hosokawa hopes  for a solution to the tax dispute as early as Sunday, and by  Monday at the latest.    Takemura said, "the prime minister will give a decision if  representatives of the coalition parties cannot reach a  solution."    At Sunday's meeting, the coalition leaders agreed to first  implement the 6 trillion tax reductions and to establish an  interparty consultative body to discuss a new 7 percent indirect  tax, which Hosokawa proposed as a revenue source for the cuts.    Rengo President Akira Yamagishi told a news conference that  he will ask the coalition to reach a conclusion in one year's  time on the matter of revenue sources.    "I hope the coalition will decide in one year. There will be  no progress as long as the SDP continues to insist on two years'  time," Yamagishi said.    The SDP, the largest among the seven ruling parties, has  called for a large tax cut and for discussion in two years on  how to finance the tax reduction.    Other coalition parties have agreed to formulate a  conclusion  in one year's time.    Attendees at the Sunday gathering were SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama, Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, Komeito Chairman  Koshiro Ishida, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, Sakigake leader  Takemura, USDP head Satsuki Eda, and Yasumatsu Hoshikawa, head  of the Democratic Reform Party.    In the coalition, Hata serves as deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, Ishida as director general of the Management  and Coordination Agency, Ouchi as health and welfare minister,  and Eda as director general of the Science and Technology  Agency. The seven met before attending Rengo's Central  Executive Committee session.    Meanwhile, Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a main  strategist for the coalition government, suggested his readiness  Sunday to make all-out concessions to the SDP.    Ozawa, appearing on Fuji TV's "News Report 2001" talk show,  said he accepts the idea of imposing the new indirect tax as a  special-purpose levy for welfare affairs only.    Last week, Hosokawa announced a 6 trillion yen tax cut  retroactive to January 1 and also proposed imposing a 7 percent  "National Welfare Tax" effective from April 1997 to offset  resultant revenue shortfalls. But the tax cut and increase  program hit a snag in the wake of strong opposition from the  SDP, which threatened to quit the coalition unless the new tax  plan was dropped.    On Friday, the coalition scrapped Hosokawa's program and  agreed to spend more time discussing it, averting a major  political crisis that could lead to a breakup of the  six-month-old Hosokawa cabinet.    Hosokawa has repeatedly expressed hope for an early solution  to the tax dispute in time for his departure to the United  States on Thursday for a summit with U.S. President Bill  Clinton. The Clinton administration has been urging Japan to  take drastic economic stimulus measures to pull its slumbering  economy out of a recession, revive consumer spending and thereby  pare down Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States  totaling 50 billion dollars annually.    Government sources said the Hosokawa cabinet was compiling  the 15 trillion yen stimulus package featuring the 6 trillion  yen tax cut as well as increased public works spending in the  face of a veiled U.S. threat to invoke its Super 301  retaliatory trade provision.    The SDP has blasted Hosokawa's tax plan as a ploy to force  the nation to accept a de facto more than double the current 3  percent consumption tax rate, and merely renaming it a "National  Welfare Tax."    The SDP has argued that the coalition should insert into the  legislation wording that would ensure all fresh revenue from the  new tax be used solely for welfare purposes. But the Finance  Ministry has resisted the demand, saying that such a provision  would tie the hands of the government in funneling the revenue  to fund various policy measures.    The SDP has insisted on the abolition of the consumption tax  imposed five years ago. It boosted its parliamentary strength  in a 1989 House of Councillors election shortly after the then  cabinet of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita imposed the levy.</p>

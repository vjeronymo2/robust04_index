			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariangela Velasquez] </F>   [Excerpt] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage yesterday met  with Venezuelan Investment Fund [FIV] Minister Abdon Vivas Teran  to discuss the possibility of establishing bilateral investment  agreements in tourism and to obtain information about the  guidelines of the Venezuelan program on economic opening for  foreign capital.    Lage said this opening is one of the paths that the Cuban  Government must try in an effort to pay off its debts. The  official said Cuba could pay what it owes Venezuela,  approximately $47 million, through investments by Venezuelan  businessmen.    Cuba's debt problem can be traced back to the agreement  signed between Venezuela and Russia in 1986. Under that  agreement, Russia committed itself to supplying oil to Germany  (a client of Venezuela), and, in exchange, Venezuela supplied  oil to Cuba. In 1991, the Caribbean island found itself in the  position of having to pay for Venezuelan oil deliveries in cash  in line with demands made by the Venezuelan Government. Cuba,  however, was unable to meet the requirements.    With a view to establishing trade relations that would allow  the island to pay off its debt, the Cuban vice president showed  special interest in activities related to tourism, because he  believes this sector could ultimately attract Venezuelan  investments. Lage also believes that Venezuela has more tourist  experience than Cuba. Cuba wants to learn from other Latin  American countries, avoid environmental problems, and create a  modern infrastructure.    The meeting held at FIV headquarters was attended by Cuban  Ambassador Norberto Hernandez; Gonzalo Garcia Bustillo,  Venezuela's diplomatic representative to Cuba; and Carlos  Sequera Yepez, former president of the Venezuelan Federation of  Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry.    Although it is gratifying to know that the representative of  a nearby country considers Venezuela's experience to be a  reference point for establishing its own framework for  development, the FIV's record in attracting foreign investments  has been scant in recent years. We have to give time to the new  FIV administration headed by Abdon Vivas Teran to determine  whether we will see the fruits of the privatization of hotels  and the channeling of multilateral financial support aimed at  turning tourism and the services industry into a source of  economic development.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has decided to oppose a measure  promoted by the United States of turning a joint declaration of  the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into an  international treaty in an effort to block North Korea's nuclear  development.    On 17 January an official concerned of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs said that "a joint declaration of the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is not an act between  countries [kukka kanui haengwi] and it is, therefore, impossible  to turn it into an international treaty," adding "the issue of  nuclear reprocessing facilities on the Korean peninsula should  be solved between North and South Korea."    The official continued: "The government's policy is that if  the radiochemical laboratory North Korea possesses now turns out  to be a small-scale nuclear reprocessing facility it will  persuade North Korea, through the North-South Joint Nuclear  Control Committee, to close the facility and abide by the joint  declaration of denuclearization."</p>

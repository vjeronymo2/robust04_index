			<p>Japan's      Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  appears to be divided over whether to press the United States for  the repeal of the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement when  the pact comes up for review in July 1994.  On 13 June two senior  MITI officials gave conflicting signals on the issue to the  Japanese press.  According to the 14 June edition of the  business-oriented Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a senior MITI official  told the newspaper the previous day that Japan was considering  presenting a proposal to terminate the accord at the round of  U.S.-Japan semiconductor talks which began on June 15.  The  official argued that the accord "sets a bad example" because it  contains a numerical target for the foreign share of the Japanese  semiconductor market, and because it "gives the United States an  excuse to impose sanctions against Japan" if Tokyo fails to meet  this target.  By contrast, the 14 June Mainichi Shimbun reported  that another unnamed senior MITI official told the paper on the  13th that the Japanese Government "will not seek to repeal the  agreement" before it expires in July 1996.  The official told the  paper that a number of MITI officials feel strongly that Japan  should not risk further straining relations with the United  States by pressing to repeal the Semiconductor Agreement just as  the contentious bilateral framework talks are resuming.  The ministry may be under pressure from the Japanese  semiconductor industry to push for the repeal of the  Semiconductor Agreement--a factor that may be influencing the  views of those in the ministry who want to terminate the accord.  According to the 10 June Asahi Shimbun, at a news conference  following a meeting of officials from U.S. and Japanese  semiconductor firms on 9 June, Hidehiko Yoshida, vice president  of the Toshiba Corporation and chairman of the Committee of Users  of Foreign Semiconductors, called for the termination of the  Semiconductor Agreement.  Yoshida criticized the provision in the  agreement stipulating that foreign semiconductors should reach a  20 percent share of Japan's semiconductor market, asserting that  "in the past, this figure has tended to take on a life of its own  beyond the purpose for which it was originally intended."  He  argued that the figure was "no longer necessary" and that "the  private sector should be left alone to look after its own  affairs" now that increasing contacts between the U.S. and  Japanese semiconductor industries had laid the foundation for  future cooperation between the two.

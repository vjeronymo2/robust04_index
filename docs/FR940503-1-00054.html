			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 113(f) of the Act, any officer or employee of the United States or any State or local government who furnishes information or renders services to the Agency in the performance of an official duty is ineligible for an award. Also, section 113(f) authorizes the Administrator to prescribe, by regulation, additional criteria for eligibility for an award. In response, the regulation proposed today prescribes additional criteria for eligibility. The regulation proposed today also prescribes general criteria for the Agency to consider in determining whether and how much of an award is appropriate and procedures to be followed by persons who want to be considered for an award. Additional authority for these provisions is provided by section 301(a) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposed rule prescribes regulations for EPA's awards authority under section 113(f) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7413(f). The proposed rule sets forth general eligibility criteria, criteria to be used in considering petitions for awards, the procedures for petitioning consideration for an award, and other matters designed to assist the Administrator in exercising her discretion in this area. The goal of this proposal is to assist in the implementation of an awards program that would encourage citizens to cooperate with and voluntarily assist the EPA's Clean Air Act enforcement efforts and thereby deter violations. Inherent in a program for awards are concerns regarding the confidentiality of the identity of those who provide information or services and the need to evaluate the quality of such information or services. This proposal is intended to address those concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Application of Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA intends that this proposed regulation will apply only after promulgation. Petitions for an award based on information or services provided to the EPA after the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Amendments) but before the regulation is promulgated may be processed using the proposed criteria as nonbinding guidance. The EPA will not consider a petition for an award based on information or services provided entirely prior to enactment of the Amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Eligibility Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, section 113(f) renders certain persons ineligible for an award, and also authorizes the Administrator to prescribe additional eligibility criteria. In response, this proposed rule categorically excludes EPA employees from eligibility to receive an award. The proposed regulation further delineates eligibility limits for employees of, and others who have a contractual relationship with, federal, State, or local governments. Thus under the proposal, officers, employees, contractors, and grantees will be ineligible to receive an award if at the time they come into possession of the information or render services which constitute, in whole or in part, the basis of the award, they were performing an official duty. Furthermore, any members of the immediate family of those ``performing their official duty'' are likewise ineligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA believes these provisions will help ensure that employees and others contractually obligated to the EPA or other governmental entities will fulfill their obligation and will not withhold information that they would otherwise provide to the government. The proposed provisions also address the concern that such persons could indirectly benefit by passing information obtained while performing their official duty to family members, who could then use that information to petition for an award. The concern addressed here is protection of the integrity of compliance and enforcement activities. By declaring such persons ineligible for an award, the proposed regulation seeks to ensure that the awards program will not create an incentive for employees to abuse access to information and authority otherwise unavailable to the public. The term ``immediate family member'' is purposely not defined in the proposed regulation, as the EPA prefers to maintain its discretion in referencing other sources of law and otherwise evaluating the circumstances of the particular case in making its award determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> So that persons who may receive awards are aware that certain persons are ineligible to be paid an award, the proposal requires that a certificate of eligibility be signed by the person before the Administrator may pay the award. This requirement assists the EPA in assuring that an award is not paid to ineligible persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Addresses for Tips  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tips from citizens to the US EPA and State and local air pollution control agencies provide useful information on the possible existence or extent of a violation. Since the goal of the awards program is to encourage citizens to cooperate with and voluntarily assist EPA enforcement efforts, the proposal provides the addresses to which information may be sent. The information or services provided may or may not lead to eligibility for an award. Providing such information does not create an obligation on the Agency to issue an award, or vest in any person a right to such award. Nevertheless, the Administrator encourages all persons to provide any information they have regarding violations of the Act to the appropriate persons listed in Appendix A. Such information improves the Agency's ability to enforce the Act. The EPA encourages persons to provide the information or services to State and local agencies as well. Although completion of an enforcement action by a State or local agency under authority other than section 113 of the Clean Air Act cannot lead to an award paid by the U.S. EPA under section 113(f), it is important that information be provided to State and local agencies. In most situations, the U.S. EPA will defer to State enforcement authorities to address violations in a timely and appropriate manner. However, persons who provide information or services to a State or local agency may become eligible for an award if the EPA overfiles or otherwise takes over the enforcement action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT 'TOO TOUGH,' LUJAN SAYS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: COMMENTS BY THE INTERIOR SECRETARY EVOKE ACCUSATIONS OF  INSENSITIVITY AND 'WATTISM.'  </P> <P> Under mounting pressure to protect the embattled Mt. Graham red squirrel in  Arizona, the squawfish in Colorado and the spotted owl of the Pacific  Northwest, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has suggested that Congress take  a look at the Endangered Species Act to see whether it is unnecessarily  restrictive.  </P> <P> Lujan's comments in a copyrighted interview in Friday's Denver Post incited an  uproar from environmentalists, who interpreted them as a call for weakening the  federal protection of a host of endangered plants and animals.  </P> <P> After an interview at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado, the newspaper  quoted the secretary as saying that the law "is just too tough," questioning  whether endangered species must be protected in every locale where they exist,  and asking: "Do we have to save every subspecies?"  </P> <P> The reaction was swift, with environmentalists accusing the secretary of  insensitivity and creeping "Wattism," a reference to Ronald Reagan's Interior  secretary, James G. Watt, who resigned after developing a reputation as  notoriously anti-environment.  </P> <P> "We are incensed that the very Cabinet official whose job it is to be the  country's front-line protector of endangered wildlife would make such  outrageous statements," said National Wildlife Federation President Jay D.  Hair.  </P> <P> "Secretary Lujan was quoted as saying that nobody has told him the difference  between a red squirrel, a black one, or a brown one, and whether we have to  save every subspecies," Hair added. "I would gladly meet with the secretary to  provide him with a much-needed education about the importance of biodiversity."  </P> <P> The proximate cause of Lujan's criticism of the act apparently was a fight  between scientists supporting construction of a $200-million telescope atop Mt.  Graham in Arizona and environmentalists trying to protect the habitat there of  100 or so red squirrels confronting extinction.  </P> <P> The squirrels, Lujan said, presented "the best example" of the dilemma  presented by the act's requirements and the interests of development. "Nobody's  told me the difference between a red squirrel, a black one, or a brown one," he  told the newspaper.  </P> <P> Opposing forces in the Arizona struggle have gone to court and two biologists  for the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service have said in  depositions that their superiors ordered them to prepare reports stating that  the squirrels and the telescope could coexist on Mt. Graham.  </P> <P> Lujan's complaint that the Endangered Species Act makes no provision for  economic considerations came during the same week that the Interior Department  was forced to suspend work on a Western water project because of scientists'  concern over a protected fish.  </P> <P> The department's Bureau of Reclamation put an indefinite hold on a $589-million  Colorado reservoir project after scientists for the Fish and Wildlife Service  concluded it would threaten the survival of the Colorado squawfish, a large  member of the minnow family.  </P> <P> Some $9 million already had been invested in the $589-million reservoir, which  is designed to provide water for irrigation, for municipal supplies in  southwestern Colorado and for Ute Indian tribes. Environmentalists hailed the  action, but critics ridiculed the protection of a species regarded locally as a  trash fish.  </P> <P> Lujan said the project will be restudied, and he argued that consideration  should be given to the fact that the squawfish exists in other places far from  the contested Animas-La Plata project.  </P> <P> Just hours before his Colorado interview, Lujan was asked by San Bernardino  City Attorney James F. Penman to stop malathion spraying around the city until  it could be determined whether threatened and endangered species would be  harmed by the chemical war on Medflies.  </P> <P> Lujan declined, and an Interior Department spokesman called Freeman's request  an attempt to make political use of the act.  </P> <P> Steven Goldstein, Lujan's press secretary, denied Friday that the secretary was  calling for a weakening of the Endangered Species Act, saying he was expressing  mounting frustrations caused by efforts to enforce it.  </P> <P> The secretary, he said, is concerned that the law is being misused to block  economic development. Rather than calling for a weakening of it, Goldstein  said, Lujan would like Congress to review how it applies to the protection of  subspecies and officially endangered species that exist in more than one  locale.  </P> <P> "He is suggesting," Goldstein said, "that Congress might want to examine it to  determine whether it is being implemented for the purpose for which it was  intended."  </P> <P> Lujan's remarks seemed certain to add fuel to the already furious debate over  protection of the spotted owl in Washington, Oregon and Northern California.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and timber interests have battled over the issue of  restricting logging in century-old forests that provide the habitat of the  1,500 pair of breeding owls still believed to exist.  </P> <P> The spotted owl currently is not listed as endangered, but a study by the Fish  and Wildlife Service has been under way for months. An announcement is expected  next month on whether the owl will be put on the list, a move that timber  interests contend would have massive economic repercussions.  </P></p>

GERMANS UPSET OVER BILL FOR ARMENIA AID  </P> <P> The West German Red Cross said Tuesday that it has asked the Soviet ambassador  to Bonn to intercede over a bill from the Soviet airline Aeroflot for  transporting emergency supplies to Soviet Armenia after the Dec. 7 earthquake.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman said Ambassador Yuli A. Kvitsinsky has agreed to appeal to  Aeroflot to drop its demand for the equivalent of $353,000 for 20 flights from  West Germany to Armenia with Red Cross clothes, medicines and digging  equipment.  </P> <P> "We do not know how long an appeal will take but we hope to hear something in  the next few days," she said.

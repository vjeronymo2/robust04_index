			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ROK President Kim Yong-sam by IZVESTIYA </F> Chief Editor Igor Golembiovskiy in Seoul; date not given: "`We  Must Combine Our Technologies and Your Potential.' ROK  President Kim Yong-sam Answers IZVESTIYA Chief Editor Igor  Golembiovskiy's Questions"]    [Excerpt] [Golembiovskiy] Mr. President, you were the  first South Korean politician to come to Moscow. That was five  years ago. You played an important role in establishing  diplomatic relations between Moscow and Seoul, which presaged  the most extensive links between our countries. Why, in your  view, have Russian-Korean relations proved to be so modest?    [Kim] As you have correctly remarked, I was the first South  Korean politician to visit the Soviet Union. Afterward, in  March 1990, I visited the USSR again. At that time there were  no diplomatic relations between our countries, and therefore my  visits were extremely difficult. Official diplomatic relations  between the ROK and the USSR were established six months after  my visit; I think that even my modest efforts played a part in  this.    Relations between our countries have been developing very  dynamically since September 1990 right up until the present  moment. The treaty signed between the ROK and the Russian  Federation during President B. Yeltsin's visit to the ROK in  November 1992 became the systemic basis for the development of  bilateral relations. Relations in the political, economic,  social, cultural, and other spheres are being developed on this  basis. In the political sphere, in addition to top-level  bilateral visits, frequent exchanges have taken place at the  level of foreign ministers and other state figures.    Trade turnover between the two countries last year reached  almost $1.6 billion, almost twice the level of the previous  year. This testifies to a dramatic growth in our economic  relations.    The number of visits by citizens of the two countries has  also grown. Thus last year 18,000 Russians visited the ROK,  almost twice as many as in the previous year. But at the same  time, when I say that our relations do not yet meet our mutual  expectations, I mean that they do not yet fully correspond to  the great potential for cooperation which is worthy of our  countries.    My visit to Russia should serve as a boost to relations  between the new Russia and the new Republic of Korea. We have  accumulated healthy experience. Our cooperation will develop  further on the basis of this experience and our mutual interests.    [Golembiovskiy] Your predecessor, President Roh Tae-Woo,  promised Moscow a loan of $3 billion, of which our country  received only half. Now the question of returning this $1.5  billion has arisen; moreover, the Republic of Korea refuses to  accept anything Moscow offers in payment for this debt -- from  raw materials to arms. The impression arises that Seoul is not  very committed to trade and economic relations with Russia. Is  this so?    [Kim] The loan was frozen because the major part of the debt  had not been paid. Bilateral relations are now under way at a  working level; moreover, all proposals put forward by the  Russian side are discussed. I believe that we will be able to  resolve this problem.    Your words about the ROK's lack of interest in trade and  economic relations with Russia are evidently connected with the  fact that you do not have an exact idea of how our relations are  developing. Once again I will repeat that our cooperation with  Russia in the economic sphere is developing very dynamically.    Russia is a country with great economic potential, the basis  of which is constituted by its fundamental science and advanced  high technology, its rich natural resources, and its high level  of public education. The development of economic relations  between the two countries on the basis of our economies'  complementing one another will proceed more quickly if we manage  to combine with Russia's potential our industrial technology and  our experience of working in the international market.    At the same time, investments and trade depend mainly on how  mutually profitable our direct links with individual countries  become. Hence the two countries' governments must work on  expanding and consolidating the legal and structural base in  order to exclude difficulties and obstacles in the activity of  Korean and Russian entrepreneurs alike.    Many South Korean entrepreneurs are already working in the  Russian market, and I hope that my visit to Russia will help to  create favorable conditions for more energetic activity on their  part.    [Golembiovskiy] The absence of international monitoring of  North Korea's nuclear installations worries the whole world. Do  you not think nevertheless that talk of the possibility of war  and any kind of military preparations only aggravate the  situation? Ultimately there is no precise information regarding  the existence of nuclear weapons in North Korea, and it is hard  to imagine its leaders' really wanting a military conflict.    [Kim] At the moment there is no precise evidence that the  DPRK possesses nuclear weapons. However, there are suspicions  that Pyongyang has long time been developing nuclear weapons and  is already using a considerable number of nuclear components for  military purposes. In order to rid the international community  of these doubts it is necessary to ensure total glasnost  regarding North Korea's nuclear installations. The DPRK should  accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as quickly as  possible and ensure that full inspections are carried out in its  country.    The ROK Government and the world community are making every  effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem peacefully if  possible. However, there is a limit to the world community's  patience. In the event that North Korea does not renounce its  plans and continues to develop nuclear weapons, rigorous  sanctions by the world community will inevitably follow.    [Golembiovskiy] Do South Korean diplomats plan to take part  in the multilateral conference on this subject proposed by the  Russian Foreign Ministry?    [Kim] I would first like to express gratitude to Russia for  cooperating in tackling the North Korean nuclear problem. The  International Atomic Energy Agency, South and North Korea, the  United States, Japan, China, Russia, and other interested  parties are not only holding bilateral consultations but also  making efforts in this area on a multilateral basis via the UN  Security Council. In this connection I think that for the time  being we should continue to follow the efforts made by the world  community. [passage omitted]</p>

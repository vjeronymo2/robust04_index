			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 14 March within its  regular 10-minute newscast carries several reports on the combat  situation in the republic.    Hajrudin Fermic reports from Maglaj on "the Serbian  aggressor's fierce attacks on the free territories" and says  that "tank and mortar shells are occasionally (?pounding) all  the front lines and chetnik snipers are looking for civilian  victims in the northern part of the city."    A correspondent whose name is indistinct reports that "Olovo  was again a target of the aggressor's attacks yesterday. During  the day, long-range artillery was occasionally used to attack  the defense lines. In the evening, [words indistinct]  (?villages) came under heavy fire from the aggressor's  howitzers, guns, and mortars." He says that "in Olovo this  morning the enemy army is making infantry provocations."    Mirza Sadikovic reports from the Bihac region that "despite  Yasushi Akashi's open invitation for NATO aircraft to be used to  prevent the Serbian aggressor from running further amok in the  Bihac region, they have nevertheless continued their [word  indistinct] practice of ignoring the international public." He  says that "artillery and tank activity against the center of  Bihac intensified in the afternoon and evening. There are many  casualties, and incomplete information indicates that at least  eight citizens have been seriously wounded. There are many more  people with slight wounds and some have been killed. The  material damage is huge. These activities then spread to the  outskirts, to the Cazin commune region, as well as to major  roads. As for the defense lines, the artillery and tank  activity and attempts at infantry breakthroughs are incessant.  For the first time since the beginning of the offensive, the  chetniks have shelled Orjanska Glavica and (Culumak), while in  the zone covered by the Headquarters of the Croatian Defense  Council, chetnik artillery targeted [word indistinct] the front  lines and the regions around (Skocaj). There have also been  activities from the so-called Serbian autonomous region of  Krajina. In this period, major infantry battles have taken  place, in which our defenders managed to thwart new attempts to  break through. In addition, the chetniks have introduced a new  tactic--their snipers are using silencers. At the front lines  facing the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa  autonomy, there are sporadic provocations and artillery activity  all the time, particularly in the Cazin regions of (Trbac) (?or)  [word indistinct]."</p>

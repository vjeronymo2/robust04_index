			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Representatives of white-collar workers reject 1.5 per cent pay offer REPRESENTATIVES of 750,000 local government white-collar workers yesterday 'flatly rejected' a 1.5 per cent pay offer from their council employers, Lisa Wood writes. Ms Jean Geldart, leader of the staff side, said that unions were not going to be 'browbeaten' by the government's pay-control policy. The five unions had lodged a claim for a Pounds 700 flat-rate increase. Mr Charles Nolda, head of negotiations at the local government management board, had told union representatives that there were no circumstances in which employers could increase the amount available.</p>

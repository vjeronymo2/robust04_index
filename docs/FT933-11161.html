			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Christiania bounces back to black CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second-biggest bank, has bounced back to profit during the first six months, helped by securities gains, increased net interest income and a reduction in credit losses. The bank's operating profit, after credit losses, was NKr348m (Dollars 47.4m) for the six months to June, against a loss of NKr131m previously. Net profits totalled NKr324m, compared with a loss of NKr162m. However, Christiania warned that problems in the fisheries industry - to which it has loans of NKr8bn - had forced up credit losses to NKr381m in the second quarter, from NKr261m in the first three months. At the end of the second quarter, gross non-performing fisheries loans reached NKr2.2bn, while exposed commitments were NKr1.1bn. The bank has made specific provisions of NKr1bn to this end. Christiania said its main exposure to the fisheries industry was loans to clients outside Norway - primarily in Seattle, where excess capacity in relation to fishing quotas had sharply reduced revenue. The bank said it had been forced to lower the value of collateral covering fisheries loans and warned of considerable uncertainty attached to the new valuations. It charged accounts with NKr111m in a write-down of fixed assets, against NKr32m last year. However, the tone of the bank's statement was generally upbeat. 'Christiania's performance continues to improve and I note with satisfaction that in the second quarter the bank has again shown a net profit despite heavy losses within the fisheries sector,' said Mr Borger Lenth, president. First-half net interest income rose by NKr44m to NKr1.6bn as non-interest income increased by NKr377m to NKr1.18bn, including a NKr419m gain on securities against NKr75m last year. The bank said the end-June market value of its share portfolio was NKr133m higher than its book value, while the market value of bonds and certificates was NKr58m higher. During the six months, Christiania cut non-interest expenses by NKr38m to NKr1.41bn.</p>

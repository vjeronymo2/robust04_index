			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (7): Giants, niche players and others - Liberalisation in Europe ON JANUARY 1 1993, the European Community moves another step towards deregulating the skies over its 350m citizens. Although the details will not be finalised until mid-summer, in theory, airlines from one country will be able to sell tickets for flights between two other countries and perhaps even within other countries. Airlines with captive home markets such as Lufthansa in Germany and Air France face the prospect of competing on the Paris-Berlin route with the likes of British Airways or KLM. The result of such competition should be cheaper fares. When the US deregulated its skies in 1976, rival airlines threw themselves into a sometimes deadly war. Low fares eventually brought low some of the great names of US aviation history. PanAm, Braniff, Eastern and People Express disappeared. TWA, Continental and others are in deep trouble, protected from their creditors by Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules. In spite of such failures, supporters of deregulation point to busy routes such as Los Angeles-San Francisco where fares are low and still profitable much of the time. Successful airlines argue that the years of competition have simply eliminated the inefficient. However, many in the industry believe that Europe is not like the US. They say deregulation will lose its airlines a lot of money and that fares will not fall far. The Association of European Airlines, which represents 22 national carriers, says that this is because the cost structure is different in Europe. Air traffic control charges are higher to reflect the crowded skies and complexities of international travel. Landing charges are higher, reflecting demand for use of the most important airports. American Airlines briefly flew transatlantic flights on from Brussels to Zurich. 'It was expensive. We were paying double the landing costs on a short-haul flight' says the airline. Salaries, which account for one third of costs, are higher. This has been damaging already in some countries. Swissair, for example, is moving its accounts department to Bombay, India, this autumn to cut costs. Such obstacles have not dissuaded US airlines from piling into Europe ahead of 1993. American now flies from a dozen European cities while Delta has a hub at Frankfurt with feeder flights coming in from many European cities. European airlines are struggling to anticipate the changes. They have tried to organise mergers or alliances with varying success. Most spectacularly, British Airways failed to merge with KLM of Holland earlier this year after months of negotiation. In contrast, Air France finally succeeded this month in taking a stake in Sabena, the Belgian carrier. The deal had been delayed for many months and followed an aborted attempt to forge an alliance between Sabena, BA and KLM. The logic is that a deregulated Europe will, like the US, allow only two types of airline to prosper: the giant, whose economies of scale give it greater financial strength, and the niche player, which concentrates on taking a slice of revenue from busy routes. Europe is full of airlines that do not fit into either category. One, Scandinavian Airline System (SAS), has been among the most energetic in trying to find partners. It is in the European Quality Alliance (EQA) - which allows for the co-ordination of timetables and sharing of some airport facilities - with Swissair and Austrian Airlines. Last month it boosted its stake in Airlines of Britain, the parent company of British Midland, from 24.9 per cent to 40 per cent. In February, it agreed to buy 51 per cent control of Linjeflyg, the Swedish domestic carrier. The acquisition is designed to consolidate the airline's position in its home market in anticipation of Swedish airline deregulation. 'By combining SAS with British Midland and EQA, we will have an annual passenger volume of 35.2m passengers,' says Mr Jan Carlzon, the chief executive of SAS. This, he says, makes his partnership the largest in Europe, ahead of Air France with 33.4m passengers a year. Few deny that such alliances will improve the chances that airlines become more efficient. And if European deregulation follows the US example, then there will be heavy competition among efficient airlines on busy routes between financial and industrial centres. Business travellers will be among the first to benefit. But with Europe's high cost base, airlines' flexibility to cut fares is limited. Such cuts that are likely could be slow in coming as some European governments resist rapid liberalisation. Before the end of the century - possibly in less than a year - business travellers will have a greater choice of airlines on which to fly. But those looking forward to sharp falls in fares will probably be disappointed.</p>

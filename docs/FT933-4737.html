			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / French to reform pay-TV and cable THE French government is considering plans to forge closer links between Canal-Plus, the successful pay-TV channel, and the struggling cable television network, as part of its forthcoming broadcasting reforms. Mr Alain Carignon, communications minister, told Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, that the reforms could include the sale of Canal-Plus as part of a package including cable channels in an attempt to boost cable subscriptions. At present Canal-Plus, which offers a mix of films and sport, is sold separately from cable. Since its 1985 launch it has become one of France's most dynamic channels, with 3.6m subscribers at the end of last year. The cable system, by contrast, has attracted only 1m subscribers and is burdened by heavy losses. Some observers suspect that Canal-Plus's success and its popularity with viewers has made life even more difficult for the cable companies. The original franchise for Canal-Plus, whose chairman, Mr Andre Rousselet, is a close friend of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president, comes up for renewal at the end of 1995. The new centre-right government will in December present its proposals for the new franchise. Mr Carignon told Les Echos that Canal-Plus should benefit from his plans to change the franchise system so that each licence lasts for five to six years and is automatically renewable three times, provided the holders meet their legal obligations. As a result, he said, the pay-TV channel should try to help cable's development. Canal-Plus said it could not comment on the government's plans as the situation was 'so delicate'. The reforms are also likely to include proposals to raise the maximum size of shareholdings in television companies from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.</p>

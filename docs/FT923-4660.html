			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Collor crisis to grind on BRAZIL's political crisis now seems unlikely to be resolved quickly as government lawyers believe the intricacies of the impeachment process mean that President Fernando Collor will not face a congressional vote before the end of next month. The delay is expected to result in a big cabinet reshuffle and a possible change in economic policy towards more growth-oriented strategy in an attempt to win popularity and political support. Mr Collor is under mounting pressure from his political advisers to drop technical ministers or those 'not fully in line with him' in favour of political nominees who could help win Congressional support for the impeachment vote. Mr Odacir Soares, the newly-appointed leader of the government in the Senate, told the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper that he expected new ministers to be named within the next few days for important posts, though Mr Ettewaldo Dias, Mr Collor's spokesman, denies that any cabinet changes are planned. Those most expected to go are Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, Mr Jorge Bornhausen, the political co-ordinator, and Mr Celio Borja, the justice minister. Although the entire cabinet signed a 'pact of governability' pledging to stay on until the end of the crisis, the three are known to now be discussing resigning, dismayed by the delay in the vote. The impeachment process could be brought forward however if the attorney-general recommends a criminal case against the president for which congressional approval would be necessary. He is studying the results of a three-month congressional inquiry into government corruption.</p>

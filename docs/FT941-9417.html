			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Dustbin-lids to the fore The British cabinet spends more time re-organising local government than it does on everything else, not excluding the delicate process of halving and quartering the truths that its esteemed ministers vouchsafe to parliament. The word 're-organising' is of course a euphemism. What has actually been going on since the Conservatives came to power in 1979 has been the steady, purposive, and highly effective destruction of local democracy. It is customary to regard the centralisation of power in Britain as roughly equivalent to that in France. Historically, this may be true. Today, we cannot be so sure. Local party bosses dominate the French chamber of deputies, but in Britain councillors assume that if they are elected to parliament they must stand down locally. In the power-grabbing stakes, London surely has the edge over Paris. No? There is a doctoral thesis in this. If someone takes it up, bet on Britain turning out to be the most centralised state in Europe. According to Mr Jack Straw, the Labour spokesman on such matters, no fewer than 144 're-organising' acts of parliament have been passed in the 14 years since the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher first took office. The precise number may be debatable, but it certainly feels as if a huge quantity of new restrictions have been imposed. Locally-elected councils have seen their public housing sold off to tenants, or transferred to the control of self-selecting committees. Education is steadily being taken away; first the polytechnics went to a quango, now the secondary schools are being picked off. Soon Whitehall will attempt to tie the strings of patronage around Britain's 24,000 primary schools. The onslaught never ceases. A new bill is diluting the presence of locally elected representatives on police authorities. Traditional powers to raise finance locally have been circumscribed or removed altogether. Before 1979 around half local spending was financed by locally-determined taxes; today the figure is 15 per cent. The geographical borders within which the system works are, it seems, perpetually redrawn. The current plan to replace the two-tier structure of county and district councils in England with single authorities has run into difficulties, but the Whitehall army does not know how to halt. Defenders of this 14-year blitz do have a case. In the 1960s and 1970s much of British local government was a form of indoor relief for otherwise unemployable white collar workers. It was bloated and inefficient. The housing estates were Labour theme parks, inhabited by captive voters. Schools were often ideological play-centres. Finance was out of control. Regular services, such as refuse-collection, were the property of trade unions. Too much was done with too little care by too many employees. Something fresh has arisen from the Tory-created rubble. Spending is under strict Treasury control. The unions are quiescent - or is it battered into submission? Decisions are made at or near customer-level. School boards run schools, hospital trusts hospitals, housing associations housing. Instead of town hall dictators we have consumer choice and open competitive tendering. Local businessmen and women take part in making things run smoothly. This pretty picture conveys only a mandarin's fraction of the truth. What is missing is the electorate. Ministers appoint reliable party hacks, chums of chums, to the new quangos. This has one advantage. It is less tedious than campaigning for office. It also gets better results: across the country, Labour has some 2,000 more elected councillors than the Conservatives. Their deliberations are open to the public. The Tory-packed boards and management committees usually meet in secret. They are answerable to no one, except perhaps a civil service voice on the telephone, purporting to be that of the minister. These local worthies and party hacks are supposed to serve parents, patients, tenants, victims of crimes, householders and, indeed, all of us. But we, poor boobies, have nowhere to turn for redress of grievances, no influence over policy, nobody to dismiss. It is an outrage. If England's blood still ran red and strong it would be in mid-revolution by now. Local citizens would stand enraged behind dustbin-lid barricades. Instead we must make do with a pair of mild analytical pamphlets. One, from the Fabian Society*, asks what the Labour party's commitment to decentralisation really means, and comes up with limp answers. Labour favours unitary authorities, but what has been missing, the Fabian authors complain, is any debate or agreement about the purposes of the new councils. A second pamphlet, from the European Policy Forum** accepts what has happened since 1979, but offers suggestions for improvement. Its approach is, you might say, Fabian. The EPF authors would make quangos more accountable, by getting elected local authorities to keep an eye on them. Whitehall's monopoly of control, although not necessarily of patronage, would be diluted. Elected councillors would sit on the new boards and governing bodies, as representatives of democratic local authorities. As to finance, the EPF and Fabian authors both argue that the business rate should be set locally, and that other forms of local taxation should be allowed. Thus would a portion of the power grasped by the Tory centralisers be returned, as burglars might be asked to hand back a share of their loot. This is not quite good enough. We need to decentralise within Britain as much as within the European Union. John Stuart Mill wrote in 1861, 'it is but a small portion of the public business of a country which can be well done, or safely attempted, by the central authorities.' He might have added, 'or their appointed puppets'. Perhaps he has been misunderstood. Our government, headed by a former Brixton councillor, has all the sense of history, the probity, the global vision, of your average inner-city town hall. Inexplicably, it keeps losing local elections, and will doubtless do so again in May. No wonder it seeks to replace all councils everywhere. *Beyond the Town Hall by Margaret Hodge and Wendy Thompson. Pounds 3.50 from 11 Dartmouth St, SW1H 9BN **The New Local Governance.

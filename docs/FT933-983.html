			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / How To Spend It: Are you sitting originally? FOR SOME TIME now furniture and interior designers have been exploring the world of myth and legend, using symbols and imagery from astronomy and alchemy, from fairy-tales and fables. Designers such as Paolo Guidi and Katherina Harlow explore the metaphysical world of the Renaissance mystics, while the style of the French designers Bonetti and Garouste is heavily laced with references from the realm of primitive myth. Tim Chitty and Simon Bacon, too, love delving into themes from ancient myths and legend but they apply it thus far in a small, though admittedly important, area - chairs. Their small design making production company is called 'Chairs' and it specialises in . . . yes, chairs. All are produced in limited editions, all are traditionally made by hand and all are filled with references to myth and legend. Photographed right is Medusa. Medusa is made from an ash frame and velvet or hand-painted suede is used for the upholstery. Pictures of Medusa come with a little caption of soft-sounding words - The Source/First born/bearer of dreams/the softness of sleep/the bane of content. Quite what that all means I'm not entirely sure but it sounds harmless enough, if a little potent for a mere dining chair, however original, to carry. But I have to admit I like the chair. It is an original, yet functional and practical, solution to the problem of the dining-chair and a welcome change from the serried ranks of Provencal, pseudo-Chippendale, heavy Victorian or steely modern that more frequently grace the contemporary dining-room. If Medusa doesn't seem quite YOU there is always Hecate which has a back topped by a huge crescent moon. Or what about Achilles - or Inducement. . . . All the chairs are hand-made to order only, and orders take between four and six weeks. Chairs is at 10a George Road, Guildford, Surrey GU1 4NP but for those going to Decorex at Syon House next week the range can also be seen on the Bosanquet Ives stand there. Still in an utterly contemporary mood, Richard Ward's sofa, upholstered here in a new Firifiss Contemporary Textiles fabric (Capella from the Columba range, Pounds 42 per metre), has a laminated birch ply frame with a maple veneer and is made to order only.

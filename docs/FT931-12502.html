			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Goalkeeper shoots for the Big Idea  -Ivo Dawnay talks to Sir Gordon Borrie, head of Labour's social justice commission WITH his brown trilby, neatly furled umbrella and well-fastened mac, Sir Gordon Borrie might more easily be taken for a spruce version of Tony Hancock than Labour's latest intellectual eminence grise. But beneath a modest demeanor lies a Rolls-Royce brain and enough political surefootedness to enable him to survive as a reform-minded director-general of the Office of Fair Trading for 16 years - most under the icy glare of Mrs Thatcher. Mr Graham Mather, the prominent rightwing policy guru, concedes admiringly that his deftness at the OFT marked Sir Gordon out as one of the outstanding public servants of his generation. 'In what must have been literally hundreds of decisions, he never fumbled the ball once,' he recalls. Now, in the yet more treacherous world of progressive politics, Sir Gordon's capacity to keep goal will be tested to the full. Recently appointed chairman of Mr John Smith's Commission on Social Justice, he has already impressed his 15 colleagues with an ability to condense crisply lengthy discussions without reference to a note. That skill will undoubtedly be needed in the 18 months before he is due to publish his report. In the sepulchral gloom of parliament's central lobby yesterday, Sir Gordon made clear that he sees his brief as much broader than merely resolving the agonised debate over targetted as against universal benefits. In defining what is meant by social justice, he pledges not to dodge the pressing question of how to find the resources to provide it. So how will he re-concile leaping welfare demand with a limited resource base to meet it? Workfare, perhaps, or some other form of President Bill Clinton's 'tough love'? For the moment, he offers no clues beyond displaying a ready scepticism over cash benefits being the sole club in the government's bag. 'Public money may be better spent in kind rather than in cash,' he says, listing the provision of social infrastructure from childcare to crime prevention as essential as Giro cheques. The much-cited Pounds 8,000-a-year cost to the exchequer of every unemployed individual, he says, is a massive underestimate when ramifications of high joblessness are included such as crime, higher policing bills and insurance premiums. The Beveridge report dealt heavily with constructing a social security net. The Borrie report, acknowledging the funding constraints, intends to tackle head on the social injustice of long-term unemployment. Surprisingly perhaps, he also appears undaunted by the broad parameters he has set himself. In the first six months, grassroots opinion will supplement his own panel of experts, garnered in field-trips to Glasgow, Newcastle and Belfast. From this, Sir Gordon will chisel the outline principles upon which the report will be based. At this early stage, however, he will not be drawn on whether its conclusions will be a legislative blueprint or even prescriptive. Nonetheless, he is aware that for a listless Labour party - desperate for a Big Idea - a great deal of hope is riding on him at a time when the Tories too are conducting a parallel tax and benefits review. Indeed, some mavericks such as Mr Frank Field MP complain that their radical solutions are getting a fairer hearing with the government than with Labour's front bench. Sir Gordon is careful to stress that his commission is fully independent of Labour, refusing to become enmeshed in the squabbling between the party's 'moderniser' or 'traditionalist' camps. But after a career treading tightropes between conflicting interest groups, Sir Gordon appears now to be relishing the opportunity of ruffling feathers. 'I think certainly our report should cause some upset,' he concludes, fastidiously omitting to explain whether that 'should' is a mere prediction or, in fact, a goal.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 QUAKES SHAKE INLAND EMPIRE  </P> <P> Two mild earthquakes gave Inland Empire residents a slight shake Thursday  morning, but there were no reports of damage or injuries.  </P> <P> The first temblor, measuring 3.5 in magnitude, struck at 2:33 a.m. and was  centered three miles south of Redlands, said Paul Daily, a spokesman for the  California Institute of Technology's seismological laboratory.  </P> <P> About five hours later, a 3.0-magnitude quake rattled an area 10 miles north of  San Bernardino, Daily said. The epicenters of the two quakes are about 25 miles  apart.  </P> <P> The temblors were felt in several cities in Riverside and San Bernardino  counties. Authorities said they fielded dozens of phone calls from residents  jostled in their sleep but no reports of damages.  </P> <P> Caltech seismologist Steve Bryant said that the earthquakes appear to be  unrelated but that scientists may never know much about their origin.  </P> <P> "There are lots and lots of faults out that way, and they are fairly close  together and run every which way," Bryant said. "So it would take a lot of work  to determine precisely where these occurred."  </P></p>

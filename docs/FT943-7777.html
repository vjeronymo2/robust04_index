			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Books: Man who cried for his country - Woza Alan] JDF Jones reviews the life of South African novelist and politician Alan Paton ALAN PATON: A BIOGRAPHY by Peter F Alexander Oxford Pounds 25, 510 pages In September 1946 a middle-aged Borstal headmaster from South Africa was in Norway on a study tour. He visited Trondheim Cathedral, went back to his hotel and, homesick, began to write: 'There is a lovely road that runs from Ixopo into the hills. These hills are grass-covered and rolling, and they are lovely beyond any singing of it . . .' He was Alan Paton and he would take just three months to complete Cry, the Beloved Country, the novel which changed his life and, just conceivably, altered the world's perception of South Africa. It is - what? One of the finest novels of the century? Surely not. One of the most moving? Yes. One of the most memorable, powerful, effective, influential? Certainly. And what were Alan Paton's other achievements? Peter Alexander has written an excellent biography of an interesting and important man who died, in 1988, just a few years before the coming of the democratic and non-racial society for which he had fought and written. The story is told steadily (57 pages to get to varsity sex), respectfully, warts and all, and the judgment is well-considered and balanced. Mr Alexander liked and admired Paton, and owed him favours, but this is no hagiography. To get the warts out of the way, Paton had an unpromising Christadelphian background, hated his authoritarian father, had a sad, sexually unhappy marriage with an older woman, became in turn a bad parent, was feared and detested by his pupils when a schoolmaster, was a flogger of sadistic dimensions, and may even have drunk too much. All this for a man whose international image has for years been that of a Christian writer-hero defying the apartheid government to do its worst. It is a compliment to Alexander that, in Cromwellian style, the portrait proceeds from there. Paton was shaped by his childhood in Maritzburg; he carried from it a passion for the African landscape, an instinct to fight authority, a Christian faith which he was able to adapt to the less puritanical Anglican Church, and which gave him the biblical cadences of his distinctive prose style. His idealism led him from schoolteaching (the pupils cheered when he almost lost his sight in an accident) to the desperate job of rescuing the black reformatory at Diepkloof, a terrible institution when he arrived in 1935, and which was to give him 13 happy and inspired years as he learned about his country and discovered the necessity to build bridges across the colour line. After the instant, worldwide success of Cry, the Beloved Country he left government service and set out to write (he found it depressingly difficult to produce a second book) and then to move into politics. The story of the founding of the South African Liberal Party is not new but is told well, including Paton's anguish when the multi-racialism and non-violence of the Party came under pressure from within. There seems to have been happiness in the later years in the Valley of a Thousand Hills when he married a formidable second wife who became notorious among politicians and journalists for the rigour with which she guarded him. He did not write all that many books, partly because he gave so much of his time to politics, which included his journalism. There were only two other novels - Too Late the Phalarope (1953), which was probably overpraised when it appeared, and the rather odd Ah, But Your Land Is Beautiful (1981). There were some short stories and two biographies - of his friend, the flawed statesman Jan Hofmeyr, and his Archbishop, Geoffrey Clayton - neither of which, we can now see, cut to the bone with the instinct of the natural biographer. The two-volume autobiography had its areas of discretion. Alexander is enthusiastic about a slim volume of Christian meditation, Instrument Of Thy Peace (1967), which apparently was his second most popular book (and which reviewers like this one have never read]) Paton, in public, always looked like a Methodist lay preacher, and this biography does not contradict that aspect of him: it is true that he was a fine orator. There remains a touch of mystery in the transformation of a small-town schoolmaster with a cane in his hand to an internationally-celebrated figurehead of liberalism. Alexander does not go out of his way to deny that Paton wrote only one 'great' book. I suggest that he understates the sheer courage of the man in the face of constant harassment and vilification. He correctly concludes that, never mind the mean quibbling of the ANC and Black Consciousness, Paton's Liberalism kept alive for South Africa certain values in a time of great darkness; Paton then had the courage to close down the Party when it could not continue with integrity. Alexander has a nice final quote, supplied by Paton himself, from a certain Sir Robert Shirley, whose encomium was that he 'did the best of things in the worst of times, and hoped them in the most calamitous'. He kept the faith. Woza Alan]</p>

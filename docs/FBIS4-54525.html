			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski by </F> correspondent Beata Kostrzewska; place and date not given]    [Text] [Kostrzewska] You were supposed to be going to  Romania, but you stayed in the country. Was this to meet with  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak?    [Krzaklewski] I postponed my visit to Romania because of the  strike at the brown-coal mines, which is not only an internal  action within the mining sector but also a protest action on the  part of the entire trade union.    [Kostrzewska] What was the subject of your talk with Prime  Minister Pawlak several hours before the start of the strike at  the brown-coal mines?    [Krzaklewski] We discussed two things. First, the general  ways of tackling the "popiwek" [enterprise tax on  above-normative pay] act and, second, specific projects involved  in decentralization of the wage-regulation system. If we do not  create appropriate mechanisms in that sphere, we will never move  to the stage of civilized wage control. Appropriate acts  related to these solutions should be introduced with the same  speed with which the popiwek act is being processed at the  moment. I should also like to add here that Prime Minister  Pawlak approved our proposal in our talk. Unfortunately,  however, it seems that it is the chief accountant rather that  the state's chief administrator who runs the country at the  moment because yet another revised version of the popiwek act  has been submitted for parliamentary debate.    [Kostrzewska] What is Solidarity hoping for at the moment?    [Krzaklewski] We expect sensible and consistent action from  the prime minister. He must stress his position as head of  government. I cannot imagine a situation where a prime minister  hailing from a political configuration that commands the  parliamentary majority would be saying one thing while deputies  from coalition parties would be saying another altogether. If  this is a manifestation of a lack of political cohesion or an  internal conflict within the coalition, these things are bound  to come to the surface soon. If, on the other hand, it is a  deliberate strategy pursued by the prime minister, the  consequences will soon follow.    [Kostrzewska] What were your impressions from your talk with  Prime Minister Pawlak?    [Krzaklewski] It was a man-to-man talk. The prime minister  showed considerable knowledge of the subject, which is something  that does not happen too often in talks with government  representatives. I can see that Mr. Pawlak has studied our  project for decentralized wage-control mechanisms quite  conscientiously. However, this should oblige him even more to  fulfill the promises he has made to us. But it is quite obvious  that, as far as the prime minister is concerned, politics and  real life are two different things. On the other hand, we can  judge the prime minister not only on the basis of the talks we  have had with him and his public utterances, but also by the  actions undertaken by his government and parliament.    [Kostrzewska] Do you see a chance that your demands will be  met?    [Krzaklewski] Yes, in substantive terms. The system we have  presented to the government and that is to replace the popiwek  scheme is perfectly clear-cut, but the government regards its  possible introduction as a political decision. The authorities  in power in Poland now are probably afraid of the introduction  of a decentralized employer-employee communication system.  Officials in charge of the Finance Ministry are afraid of  losing the privilege of making centralized decisions regarding  wages--both in general terms and in individual enterprises. I  have seen very clear indications of mounting panic in the  finance sector.    [Kostrzewska] How long will the strike at the brown-coal  mines last?    [Krzaklewski] Until it has brought results. The miners are  most firmly determined, and I hope their example will make the  government realize the meaning of compromise with the trade  unions--that is, a will to step down part of the way and seek  solutions that would lie somewhere in the middle between the  most extreme positions. Until now, the government made  political decisions to ensure that there would be no compromise  with Solidarity. The popiwek act has come to parliament's  attention, but our other demands have not even been  considered--not even those the government was obliged to meet  because the previous authorities in power had undertaken to meet  them. Here I am thinking specifically of the agreements and  acts signed within the framework of the "Enterprises Act."    [Kostrzewska] Is the strike going to continue until you get  results? In other words, are you going to call it off after the  scheduled 48 hours, or will you carry on beyond that deadline?    [Krzaklewski] We shall see. The Brown-Coal Miners' National  Strike Committee can, under the terms of the approved procedure,  apply to the National Protest Action Headquarters to extend the  strike's proposed time span. That is why the 48 hours are not a  strict deadline marking the definitive end of this particular  protest action. We would like to have cut down the time of the  protest action, but Mr. Pawlak must first give us a certain  document. I told him myself what that document should entail;  unfortunately, I cannot discuss it at this moment because I am  bound by a promise I gave to the prime minister that I would not  divulge the substance of our talk.    [Kostrzewska] During your latest visit to Lodz, you said  that the Solidarity protest action would last until your demands  are met and implemented....    [Krzaklewski] And I do maintain that position because we no  longer believe any declarations or compacts. First, it is  announced in the TV News that the prime minister is opposed to  the popiwek act and intends to reject it, and then, two minutes  later, we hear in the same program that a parliamentary debate  on a new popiwek project is in progress now.    [Kostrzewska] Why have you come to Lodz? Is this only a  stopover on your way to Belchatow, or did you have any relevant  decisions to make here?    [Krzaklewski] We have important experts here. We came to  coordinate the union's position on the prime minister's project  of the ways in which we could depart from the popiwek scheme,  even though parliament is already debating the new popiwek bill  without waiting for our union's opinion.    [Kostrzewska] Is a meeting with the president very likely?    [Krzaklewski] Our invitation is still open, and I believe  that such a meeting should take place within the next two weeks.  We want to explain our demands, and ways of implementing them,  to the president in the obvious hope that, if we give him a  sufficiently extensive clarification of our position, he will  become an advocate of our stipulations. They are devised as a  stabilizing influence, and, at the same time, they propose the  introduction of a new system: the system of public dialogue.  Our country needs the implementation of these stipulations, and  I hope we will finally see the day when their provisions become  the law in our country.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN AND COMPARE  </P> <P> As a relative of a defense worker who lives and works in the 21st Congressional  District, I was dismayed to see that my congressman, Elton Gallegly, voted  against the bill that provided money to assist laid-off defense workers with  job retraining, job search assistance, extended unemployment and other  benefits.  </P> <P> There are many defense workers in this district who devoted many years of their  lives to protecting this country and bringing an end to the Cold War.  </P> <P> If this is how he represents the needs of those people, then we need somebody  else in that position.  </P> <P> I was told that his opponent, Richard Freiman, would have supported that bill.  I urge you to vote for the man who would protect the livelihood of the workers  in this district.  </P> <P> DEBORAH FORBES SUTHERLAND, Westlake Village  </P></p>

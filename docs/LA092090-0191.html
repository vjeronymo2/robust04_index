			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTING FEE OKD  </P> <P> The cost of fighting fires and responding to other emergencies would be billed  to people responsible for the incidents under an ordinance tentatively approved  by the City Council this week.  </P> <P> Fire Marshal Lyn LaRochelle estimated that the city would collect $7,000 to  $10,000 a year under the cost recovery program, which is already in use in a  number of other cities and counties. Under the plan, La Rochelle said, Pomona  could recover costs from arsonists, from people who illegally store hazardous  materials, from people who cause accidents while driving under the influence of  drugs or alcohol and from parents whose children cause property damage.  </P> <P> A final vote on the measure is expected Oct. 1.  </P></p>

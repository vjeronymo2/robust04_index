			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Foreigners make inroads into China - Lynne Curry reports on the country's rapidly modernising car market TWO decades ago, traffic jams in China consisted mostly of bicycles with the occasional bus, truck, or official limousine. Today, the country's roads are crowded with imported cars and lorries. Foreign manufacturers are scrambling to get a foothold in this large and rapidly modernising market of more than 1bn people. Foreign car sales are rising fast. Chinese car imports have risen from about 40,000 a year in the mid-1980s to 120,000 in 1992. The potential for growth is enormous. There are just 7m vehicles on China's roads of which barely 850,000 were produced at home last year. By contrast, the US produces more than 12m cars and trucks a year. In an effort to meet demand, joint ventures with foreign car groups produced about 200,000 cars in 1992 and are expected to turn out 305,000 cars this year. The market for cars made in China by foreign manufacturers is dominated by Germany's Volkswagen. Other big sellers are Peugeot of France, Chrysler of the US and Daihatsu of Japan. Western analysts predict that by the end of the century foreign car manufacturers in China will produce about 1m vehicles annually. That is half the output the government hopes the Chinese motor industry will reach within the next decade. In addition to attempting to satisfy consumer demand for cars, foreign manufacturers are seeking to break into the light duty truck and minibus market. VW is negotiating with the Chinese to produce a seven to nine-seater minibus. Chinese officials are having talks with Ford and Chrysler about similar proposals. GM produces a light duty pick-up truck in a joint venture with Jinbei, one of the country's's largest state-owned vehicle manufacturers, in Shenyang in north-east China. In Nanjing, Fiat has an operation that turned out 5,500 15-20 seater minibuses last year. In spite of these developments, foreign vehicle manufacturers face significant obstacles in reaching the level of volumes needed to make the Chinese motor industry competitive internationally. 'To be profitable, you need economies of scale to produce in a higher volume,' a US car manufacturer says. The Chinese vehicle industry is highly fragmented, with factories that produce components scattered across the country, far from the large state-run vehicle manufacturers. In addition, there are about 120 small individual vehicle manufacturers making about 10 vehicles a week. With this kind of minimal output and de-centralisation, these types of enterprises are unable to achieve the levels of efficiency and profit that come with producing in great volume. An inefficient spare parts sector makes developing cars difficult. 'A weak supply industry is the main hurdle in the way of a model change,' one European carmaker says. 'A model change costs about Dollars 200 to Dollars 300 per car. The Chinese want change, but they can't afford it at that cost.' In order to curb random car production and streamline the country's vehicle industry, Beijing announced it would ban all car production by small manufacturers not included in China's eighth five-year plan. This move is also an effort to help the industry focus on making more internationally competitive parts. To improve the spare parts industry, two Shanghai companies have signed letters of intent with Ford to establish joint ventures to manufacture car components. Ford plans to establish a joint venture with China's leading car makers to design and develop component systems that would be made in China. Because of the fragmentation of its industry and its inability to produce cheap, high-quality cars in large volume, China's ambitions to become a vehicle exporter, like its neighbours Japan and South Korea, have been thwarted. The 240 per cent to 300 per cent duties and other fees charged on all imported vehicles make the difficulties greater. While these charges are designed to protect the growth of the home-based industry they also shield the small, inefficient vehicle producers from competition and prohibit China from moving to high-volume production. However, Beijing is under pressure to lift these duties and tariffs to be able to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Chinese officials have said they would reduce some of the taxes on passenger cars, but at the same time they want foreign car manufacturers to reduce their profit margins.</p>

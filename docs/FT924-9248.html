			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Technology: Orange solvent in green crusade - Worth Watching An alternative to going 'green' is to go orange. This is the approach at Total Oil Great Britain which has launched a multi-purpose solvent cleaner made from oranges. Called Natural Degreaser, the product is formulated from a blend of highly-refined mineral oils and orange oils, and has been developed to replace chlorinated- and paraffin-based cleaners in a variety of industrial and commercial applications. Total says the product will safely remove everything oil-based - from creosote to chewing gum - in a way which will minimise damage to the environment since it is non-toxic. Where recovery is possible, the product is 90 per cent reusable by volume if filtered. Total Oil Great Britain: UK, 0977 673421.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Second Best Just Not Good Enough] </F>   [Text] The moment of truth has finally arrived. Almost a  year and a half after Governor Chris Patten outlined his plans  for political reform, the Legislative Council [Legco] is faced  with a real decision about whether to turn these reforms into  law. It would be a great pity if the decision is stalled once  again by the procedural manoeuvre which Councillor Elsie Tu has  in mind. Tu, a bitter opponent of the Governor and his reform  plans, is thinking about asking today's council meeting to  postpone discussion of the first stage of the reform bill. She  has every right to oppose, or indeed, amend the bill but she has  no real grounds for suggesting yet another postponement of  legislation. The uncertainty which swirls around the proposals  must be brought to an end. Legco has a duty to not only pass  legislation on the first stage of the reform bill but also on  the more controversial second stage which contains plans for  enlarging the franchise.    When the reforms were first proposed they appeared to  command  widespread public support. That, at any rate, was the verdict  of countless public opinion polls. A significant new poll,  published in today's paper, shows that support is ebbing.  Opinion is now evenly divided on even the modest reforms under  discussion in Legco today. We do not suggest that every new  opinion poll should cause the Governor to dash out and alter his  plans, nor that the members of Legco should respond like  Pavlov's dogs to every new poll finding.    However, there are clear indications that support for reform  is eroding. The reasons are probably complex but China's  campaign of opposition is evidently having some effect.  Previous polls have shown that even those who support the idea  of more democracy as a matter of principle are reluctant to see  it expanded in Hong Kong in the face of Chinese resistance. We  can understand a reluctance to foster confrontation and  increasingly sympathise with the Government's efforts to try to  achieve a negotiated agreement with China, even though the  negotiations disintegrated into something close to farce.    Nevertheless, the case for reform remains strong and the  need  for legislation to provide a framework for the coming elections  is pressing. Our poll shows the Governor still has support for  going ahead with plans for the 1995 Legco elections. However, a  small majority of those questioned believe in the retention of  ex-officio seats for members of the Regional Council [Regco] and  the district boards and opinion is evenly divided on the idea of  maintaining appointed seats in Legco. We find the reluctance to  dispense with appointed seats particularly bizarre because even  the Basic Law decreed that appointment to the legislature must  end. We are also sceptical about the virtues of small cabals  being empowered to elect members through Regco and district  boards. In sum, it is hard to find much which is really  objectionable in the bill before Legco today and we see few  merits in the amendments being advanced. Yet it cannot be  denied that the appetite for reform is fading.    If the public really want an electoral system riddled with  undemocratic and unrepresentative practices, they are quite  entitled to have precisely such a system. If they have taken  the apparently pragmatic view that this is the best that can be  achieved, given China's views on the subject, their assessment  is reasonable. However, there comes a time when principles  should be given precedence above pragmatism. People who pride  themselves on their pragmatic views of affairs tend to see  history as static. They argue that the realities of today will  be the realities of tomorrow. History rarely works out quite  like that. Chinese history, with its violent lurches from  regime to regime, is a perfect illustration of this point. It  therefore seems more realistic to start from a point of  principle and work backwards from there. If it is right for  Hong Kong to join other modern societies in having the ability  to elect its law-makers in a fair and representative way, then  Hong Kong should try to achieve such a system of elections. To  settle for less is to accept that the territory should always  settle for second best. Second best is not the Hong Kong way of  doing things, nor should it become so.</p>

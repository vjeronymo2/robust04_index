			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Technology: Astronauts on a flight of fitness - Worth Watching Astronauts on Nasa's space shuttle need to exercise. But often they can't work out as vigorously as they would like for fear of disturbing sensitive scientific experiments, writes Ian Holdsworth. Nasa and Lockheed think they have solved the problem with a new kind of platform which supports exercise equipment such as a treadmill or rowing machine yet cancels out any vibrations. The Isolated/Stabilised Exercise Platform will have its debut in June on the shuttle Columbia. Astronauts need hard aerobic exercise daily to prevent dizziness when they return to earth, says Dr Damon Smith, project leader at Lockheed. 'In the presence of microgravity research such as protein crystal growth, this amount of activity interferes. It's important that the shuttle astronauts get the exercise and the experiments be protected.' Lockheed: US, 408 742 6688.</p>

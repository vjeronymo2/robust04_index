			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova </F> and by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova]    [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- "Another round of local  elections in Russia confirmed once again that the popular  feelings are sharply turning left," leader of the Communist  Party of the Russian federation Gennadiy Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS.    In his opinion, the electors voted for "people with socially  oriented thinking, and the alliance between patriots and  supporters of a strong state is gaining in strength." Aman  Tuleyev's victory in Kuzbass, which was "the stronghold of  radical democrats quite recently", is convincing proof of it,  Zyuganov believes. In his opinion, the same trend became  prominent in Ukraine, which follows from the "convincing victory  of the left-wing forces in eastern Ukraine and a strong support  for state-oriented forces in the Crimea." Everywhere, with the  exception of western Ukraine, "the opposition is being  consolidated. Actually, it is the opposition to shock therapy  and the breaking of ages-long ties between the three great  Slavonic nations", Zyuganov continued.    Commenting on the situation in the Crimea, he pointed out  that although the public opinion poll, held there, has no legal  force, it does reflect people's feelings, and "both Moscow and  Kiev will have to take it into account."    The Russian Communist leader said that the Communist party  of  the Russian Federation favoured the closest possible  rapprochement of Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol, and not their  drifting apart. "We shall hold a well-considered stand, aimed  at improving relations between the Crimea, Ukraine and Russia...  Nobody is encroaching upon anybody else's sovereignty, but  there can be no real sovereignty, if economic relations are  disintegrating," Zyuganov said.    Moscow March 30 TASS -- Thirty four members of the Communist  Party of the Russian Federation were elected to representative  bodies in subjects of the Federation at the local elections last  Sunday. A total of 216 Communist candidates took part in the  elections, a spokesman for the department for work with the  territories at the president's administration told ITAR-TASS.    The activity of Communist candidates was rather high, but no  more than 16 per cent of them won the elections. Thus, only two  out of 27 Communist candidates got the needed number of votes in  the Voronezh region, and as many in the Rostov region, where 31  Communists were standing for election. One out of 20 Communist  candidates was elected in the Kursk region.</p>

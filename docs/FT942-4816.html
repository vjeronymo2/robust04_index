			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Beaches fail EU tests on hygiene Bathing water at popular beaches such as Blackpool and Morecambe is still below European hygiene standards, a European Commission report said yesterday. Of the 457 UK resort areas tested for pollution last year, 80 per cent reached the levels expected by the commission. That was one of the lowest rates in the European Union, along with land-locked Luxembourg, which was tested on its fresh-water bathing areas. The commission said, however, that the whole of Britain's holiday coastline was expected to meet the cleanliness standards by the end of next year. The EU has already arraigned the UK government at the European Court of Justice over beaches at Blackpool. The court was assured by government lawyers that the clean-up programme was on target for completion next year - 20 years after the bathing water directive was accepted by European governments and 10 years after the implementation deadline. Proposals for providing new feeding grounds for wading birds displaced by the Cardiff Bay barrage are inadequate, the World Wide Fund for Nature said yesterday, Roland Adburgham writes. It said research showed the new sites would only absorb 'a tiny fraction' of the dunlin and redshank on the Cardiff Bay mudflats. Work on the barrage started last month. WWF has written to Brussels to say the scheme will breach the European habitat directive. It calls on the EU not to approve it.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> CHILE JUNTA OKS REFORMS  </P> <P> Chile's ruling junta approved constitutional reforms negotiated with the  opposition that will lessen the role of the armed forces when a civilian  government takes office next year after 16 years of military rule. President  Augusto Pinochet, leader of a 1973 coup, is expected today to formally call for  a referendum in July or August to approve the reforms. The amendments to the  1980 constitution, which was written by the military government, lessen the  role of the armed forces in the civilian government that will assume office in  March, 1990. Meantime, toying with the idea of another term, Pinochet said he  might run in the December elections, "if the people want me to."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Ladeiro Monteiro, former head of </F> the Information and Security Service, by unidentified  corrrespondent in Lisbon on 25 May--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Dr. Ladeiro Monteiro, is your  conscience clear?    [Monteiro] Of course. I would like you to leave me alone,  because I do not want to make any statements.    [Correspondent] You have come out of all this rather badly.  Is your conscience clear that everything was normal?    [Monteiro]] Certainly. My conscience is clear, because I am  certain that we acted within the law and in keeping with  democratic rule.    [Correspondent] What happened in Madeira?    [Monteiro] What happened in Madeira was that two magistrates  accused SIS of watching them or investigating them. As you  know, the council.... [pauses] The government asked the  monitoring council to look into this, and the council dismissed  the accusation. [passage omitted] Therefore, it was not proved.    [Correspondent] In any case, irregularities were found in  SIS  work in Madeira.    [Monteiro] I do not want to say anything about that. What I  find strange, very strange, is that the original issue  disappeared while side issues have surfaced, remain there, and  are greatly exaggerated--issues that I consider to be minor and  that I partly blame on an unfortunate choice of words.    [Correspondent] But did SIS act outside the law in Madeira  or  not?    [Monteiro] I believe that in strict terms it did not. There  may have been a linguistic slip. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] In the last eight years, did you ever feel  that you were a tool of the government?    [Monteiro] Never. The government never asked anything from  me. All SIS activities were at my initiative and are my  responsibility. I would like you to see my resignation as  normal, because do not forget that the post of director general  is a temporary post that can end at any time. It is not a  lifetime position.    Throughout the last eight years, the monitoring council has  given SIS very favorable appraisals. I would go as far as to  say it has praised SIS. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] If it were not for this affair would you  have  resigned?    [Monteiro] Obviously in view of all this, and in view of the  accusations leveled at my former colleague in Madeira--in my  opinion a serious man, and therefore the accusations are  unjust--and because I believe I should give the government room  to maneuver to defend itself against the unjust accusations  leveled at it, I felt I should hand in my resignation. It is  above all a matter of dignity.</p>

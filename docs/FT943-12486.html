			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: High voltage The story that has been driving regional electricity company shares higher is largely one of dividend growth. Sure, the regulator Prof Stephen Littlechild will curb the companies' profits when he publishes his new price cap regime next month. But given that dividends are typically covered three times by earnings and balance sheets are debt free, the companies should have no problem delivering real dividend growth of 5 per cent or more. There is little wrong with this story as far as it goes. The professor has already softened his proposed regime once in response to determined lobbying from the companies. The betting is that he will give further ground, following another round of lobbying over the past few weeks. The most likely scenario is that the companies, currently massive cash generators, will end up in cash-neutral or modestly cash-negative positions. Any treated more harshly than this should appeal to the Monopolies Commission. It would have a good chance of winning. Electricity distribution is such a low growth industry that it is unreasonable to expect the companies to become substantially cash-negative. Whether they should react to a satisfactory regime by increasing real dividends at 5 per cent a year is another matter. Such a rate of increase would be not be in line with their ability to raise earnings. As a result, dividend cover would fall to two or less by the end of the century. Instead, they should be planning more aggressive moves to gear up their balance sheets than the small-scale share purchases so far envisaged. Investors would do better if cash was paid out of the businesses now and dividends were then raised in line with earnings.</p>

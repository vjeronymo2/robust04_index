			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Vote for Gonzalez as PM paves the way for coalition MR FELIPE GONZALEZ, whose Socialist Workers party (PSOE) was short of an overall majority in general elections last month, was yesterday returned to power for a fourth term thanks to the support in a congress investiture vote of the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties. The prime minister is expected to name a new government, which he said would combine 'experience and new faces', early next week. The cabinet will include a new economic team following the appointment of Mr Carlos Solchaga, the economy ministerfor the past eight years, as the PSOE's parliamentary leader. The backing of the Basque PNV and Catalan CiU in the congress vote paves the way for a coalition government, the first power-sharing experiment since democracy was restored to Spain following General Franco's death in 1975. The PNV's five representatives in congress and the CiU's 17 joined forces with the 159 PSOE members to give Mr Gonzalez an absolute majority of 181 votes in yesterday's confidence motion. The prime minister's nomination was opposed by 165 votes, which included the 141 members of the conservative Partido Popular and the 18 of the communist-led Izquierda Unida coalition. Conservative leader Mr Jose Mara Aznar nevertheless offered to support the government 'in any serious measure to solve Spain's economic problems and create employment'. Mr Gonzalez has now in theory a broad spectrum of support that should ensure the stability of his government for the next four years. 'I hope to achieve a stable government, but we'll see, it won't be easy,' he said after the vote. Mr Solchaga is chairing separate joint commissions between the PSOE and the two nationalist parties to establish common ground over key policy issues. Mr Gonzalez outlined his most liberal programme to date, pledging to decentralise power in favour of the regional autonomies  - a priority issue for the nationalist parties  - and said he would contain public spending and speed deregulation of the economy. Mr Gonzalez could appoint a representative of the PNV to head the Industry Ministry but the entry of Catalan nationalists, who are the more reluctant coalition partners, to the cabinet is likely to take place only after an autumn debate on next year's budget. The CiU is seeking to negotiate a measure of fiscal co-responsibility between Catalonia and the central administration, which would be reflected in the 1994 budget, before committing itself to power sharing. The reshuffled economic team is likely to headed by Mr Narcis Serra, the deputy prime minister in the outgoing government. Mr Serra  - an economist by training and a former mayor of Barcelona before he joined the government, originally as defence minister  - has close friendships with leading members of the CiU. Mr Solchaga's former ministry, which combined both economy and finance, is likely to split into two. Mr Gonzalez could switch agriculture minister Mr Pedro Solbes, a technocrat who is not a member of the Socialist party, to the economy portfolio and appoint Mr Oscar Fanjul, the re-spected chairman of Repsol, the public energy group, finance minister.</p>

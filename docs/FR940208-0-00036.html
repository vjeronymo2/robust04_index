			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The legal description shall include popular township, county, township, range, section, and the United States Geological Survey map identification by property owners. Section lines shall be marked and the sections shall be identified on the map. The total acreage of the proposed permit area shall be given to the nearest acre. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 773.13(a)(1) do not require such detailed information, in accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart provision exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director is approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.31(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 12. IAC 27&hyph;40.31(9), Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.31, to add paragraph (9) that specifies that the general word substitution of the term ``Act'' with the term ``Iowa Code chapter 207'' found at IAC 27&hyph;40.1(2) does not apply to 30 CFR 773.15(b), as incorporated by reference into the Iowa program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The incorporated Federal regulation, 30 CFR 773.15(b), requires that no permit be issued if any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant ``is currently in violation of the Act or any other law, rule or regulation referred to in [30 CFR 773.15],'' as indicated by any available information, including the list of violation notices submitted in the application. Among the specified violations are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Federal and State failure-to-abate cessation orders, unabated Federal and State imminent harm cessation orders, delinquent civil penalties issued pursuant to section 518 of the Act, bond forfeitures where violations upon which the fortfeitures were based have not been corrected, delinquent abandoned mine reclamation fees, and unabated violations of Federal and State laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred in connection with any surface coal mining operation.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble to the Federal regulation dated October 3, 1988 (53 FR 38868, 38886, clarifies that all unabated violations are included, no matter when they were issued: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires regulatory authorities to consider past conduct in the permitting process.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;In view of [sections 507(b)(4), (b)(5), and 510(c)] of the Act, it is clear that Congress both contemplated and authorized holding applicants accountable for past violations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, permit denial is based on violations of any State or Federal program. As explained in the preamble to 30 CFR 778.14(c) dated September 28, 1983 (48 FR 44344, 44389), the reference to ``the Act'' in SMCRA section 510(c), on which these Federal regulations are based, includes all State and Federal programs approved under SMCRA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (53 FR 38868, 38882&hyph;38883) October 3, 1988. Therefore, in the context of the State's incorporation by reference of the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 773.15(b), the term ``Act'' must be understood to have the same meaning that it has under the Federal program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director therefore finds Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.31(9) to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 13. IAC 27&hyph;40.31 (13) and (14), Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Time frame for permit application objections.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to revise its rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.31 that addresses comments and objections on permit applications by adding a paragraph (13) that would replace the phrase ``a reasonable time established by the regulatory authority'' in incorporated 30 CFR 773.13(b)(1) with the phrase ``60 days of the notification.'' This would allow those public entities identified at 30 CFR 773.13(b)(1) 60 days to submit written comments or objections with respect to the effects of the proposed mining operations on the environment within their areas of responsibility. OSM interprets the phrase ``60 days of the notification'' to mean 60 days from the date of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> receipt  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of the notification required to be given to specific public entities under 30 CFR 773.13(a)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

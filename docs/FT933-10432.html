			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / National Power in Pounds 250m bond offer NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, yesterday made its first foray into the sterling convertible bond market with a Pounds 250m offering. The deal is only the company's second offering in the international capital markets since its privatisation in 1991. The launch takes advantage of strong demand for sterling paper from continental European investors, fuelled by positive sentiment on sterling and by expectations that interest rates are set to fall. Lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston estimated that 40 per cent of the paper was placed in the UK and 60 per cent in continental Europe. Two recent convertible offerings by Coats Viyella and Warburg are now trading at a premium to their issue price of 3 1/2 and 6 1/2 points respectively. National Power has embarked on a programme of international expansion as its domination of the UK market dwindles. Last month it bought Dallas-based Transco Energy Ventures, its biggest overseas deal to date. Mr Brian Birkenhead, group finance director, said the company planned to spend 'about Pounds 1bn on equity stakes in overseas power projects this decade'. The company also hopes to have an opportunity to buy back some of the Pounds 350m of its debt still held by the government. Last year, the government sold Pounds 1.3bn of privatised company debt at auction, and there has been speculation that another such auction is being considered. National Power is paying interest of 12 per cent on the debt, which matures in 1998. If the government decides to sell off its remaining 40 per cent stake in the company, National Power hopes to list some shares on the New York Stock Exchange, which would give the company access to dollar funding in future and provide a hedge for US operations. Mr Birkenhead said the funding would also smooth cashflow, which 'has become much more seasonal'. The 15-year bonds carry a coupon of 6 1/4 per cent and can be converted into ordinary shares at Pounds 4.33, a premium of 19 per cent to the market level of Pounds 3.64 at the time of pricing yesterday. The shares closed at Pounds 3.60, down 11p. The bonds were quoted at 100 1/2, a 1/2 point premium to their par issue price.</p>

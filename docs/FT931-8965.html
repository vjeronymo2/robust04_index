			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Trade surplus up 39.4% to Dollars 5.3bn last month JAPAN'S trade surplus rose by 39.4 per cent to Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn) last month, the government announced yesterday, just days after the new US administration called upon Japan to boost domestic demand to increase imports. The sharp increase in the surplus, which was well above expectations, was mainly due to a 6.4 per cent fall in the value of imports which outweighed a 0.8 per cent rise in the value of exports. The Japanese government's sensitivity over the figures was underlined by a highly political delay in their publication. They had been originally scheduled for publication last Friday, when Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, met senior officials of the Clinton administration in Washington. The finance ministry blamed the delay on a discrepancy between computer figures from the customs department and findings of the ministry's survey of trading companies. The rise in the surplus will raise pressure on the ruling Liberal Democratic party to augment the 1993 budget with an emergency package to stimulate the economy. The sluggish state of both consumption and investment was underlined by figures showing a 6.5 per cent fall in Tokyo department store sales last month compared with January 1992, a 38 per cent drop in industrial machinery orders and a 35 per ent fall in orders received by the top eight manufacturers of machine tools.</p>

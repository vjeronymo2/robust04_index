			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: SHT cuts debts to Pounds 25m THE continuing efforts of Scottish Heritable Trust, the York-based conglomerate, to cut debt resulted in borrowings falling from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 25m over the six months to June 30. The prime objective remains debt reduction and since the period end, the sale of Fox Ridge Homes Inc has been agreed for Dollars 8.7m (Pounds 5.6m). For the six months to the end of June, pre-tax losses increased from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 6.33m after costs concerning the sale of businesses of Pounds 4.79m (Pounds 584,000 profits). Taking out the exceptional costs left losses of Pounds 1.5m which the company said was a significant improvement. The company blamed the losses on the high interest burden. The charge for the period was down from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 1.13m. Turnover was Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 2.44m) for continuing activities with a further Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 20.4m) from discontinued. Losses per share were 17.7p (8.1p). For the future the company, where Mr Roger Shute, formerly of BM Group, is temporary chief executive, said that its offshoots were still finding trading difficult. 'Unless there is a remarkable turnaround in the property market in the next few months, group trading results for the remainder of the year are unlikely to show any material signs of improvement.'</p>

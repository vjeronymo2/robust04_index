			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (7): Push-button service - Performance measurement Nothing has attracted more excitement than performance measurement in the search to find new value-added services to package into global custody services. Traditionally the domain of independent professional services who glean information from custodians before translating it into usable form for clients, custodians are moving into performance measurement with a vengence. 'Custodians were fools ever to let performance measurement go to third-party providers,' one banker said. Robert Ross, director of consulting at Frank Russell Associates in London, said: 'In theory, it could all be done at the push of a button. Custodians have all the data at their fingertips,' he noted. Frank Russell, which is active in the performance measurement market itself, has wasted no time in capitalising on this latest trend. The company is providing a software package to Chase Manhattan Bank, one of the world's largest global custodians, which is used by all its clients. The service will provide measurement and multi-currency performance attribution, helping clients to pinpoint which aspects of their investment strategy led to the out-performance or under-performance of a portfolio. Also, Frank Russell is providing its performance measurement software to a group of other banks who make it available to selected clients. According to Ms Laurette Bryan, senior vice-president in charge of performance and analytics at State Street Bank, says that the role of custodians in performance measurement is now so pervasive in the US that 'the consultants are almost getting out of the business here because we are taking over. 'We can do it much faster than they can,' she said, noting that full reports can be prepared for clients within three to five business days of the end of each month. State Street's performance measurement service has three elements; a pure calculation of total returns, a comparison of returns against various benchmarks, and performance attribution. The last of the three is particularly crucial to pension scheme clients, she says. Ms Bryan says that the particular style of US pension fund management lends itself to the type of performance measurement which custodians can offer. For one thing, US schemes are far more willing to use 'specialist' fund managers and may have as many as 30 or 40 different companies handling bits of their portfolio. These organisations need to know, for instance, how their portfolio managers compare against each other as well as how they performed against their respective benchmarks. Also, a global custodian for a client's portfolios will be able to spot some key elements of performance attribution at a glance. 'Sometimes a plan does well because all their managers have moved in the same direction at the same time and it turned out to be the right direction,' she said. However, that sort of 'tilt' in a client's porftolio ought to be pointed out because it can lead to serious underperformance in future years. Ms Bryan recalled one former client who had done exceedingly well in the mid-1980s with a portfolio tilted towards small energy-related companies based in Denver, Colorado, which not long afterwards collapsed. What clients really want, she says, goes beyond pure performance measurement. 'If you can consult and interpret, then clients are willing to pay for it,' she says. In the US, fund management styles and the absence of a single, universal performance benchmark have created a more hospitable market for custodial banks to make inroads into that market. But in the UK, the 'balanced' pension fund portfolio where the fund manager, not the client, decides the asset allocation, is the norm. For this reason, consultants conjecture, the UK has retained a performance measurement system which has been able to develop broad benchmarks covering a high percentage of all market participants. Unlike the US, it is possible to gain a fairly accurate picture of the achievement of the 'average' fund manager in total returns and the range of peformance. However, there are few asset-specific benchmarks making it difficult to learn, say, how the average international bond portfolio manager performed. Thus, in the UK there has been little sign of custodians making significant inroads into performance measurement. Pension schemes simply do not need the service custodians are offering. The UK market is dominated by two organisations: Combined Actuarial Performance Services (CAPS), owned by the four largest pension consulting firms, and WM Company, owned by Bankers Trust. Earlier this year, Bankers Trust replaced the long-time chairman of its WM subsidiary with a senior BT official, Charles Kiley, and said it would like to obtain better synergy between the service and its global custody operations. Mr Kiley acknowledges the differences between the two markets. 'We need to develop different products and services for the two markets. They want different things.' US clients 'want to get down to the performance of the individual securities, not just portfolio measurement'. They want to know what each stock or bond contributed to overall performance. WM does have several specialised products, including its new PerFx product which measures the contribution foreign exchange made to performance. Also, in the GlobeMaster product, WM does the performance measurement side of the custody service and WM markets its performance measurement capabilities to other custodians as well.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Marketing departments 'fail to sell themselves in-house' Marketing departments often lack accountability and are not involved in activities central to companies' success, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants and consultants, said yesterday. Managing directors 'are beginning to have reservations' about the marketing function, with a fifth of directors forecasting that it will have a declining influence on company success over the next five years, Coopers says. Marketing and managing directors in 100 of the largest companies in retailing, financial services, and consumer goods were questioned. The report finds fewer than half of all marketing departments responsible for the development of pricing strategies while only a quarter have responsibility for customer service. Only 42 per cent are involved in just-in-time programmes and 31 per cent are involved in total quality initiatives - activities identified by Coopers as important to companies' success. The study sees a gap between the perceptions of marketing directors and their bosses. In the area of strategic planning, 61 per cent of marketing directors said they made an important contribution. Only 44 per cent of managing directors agreed. Most procedures for measuring the effectiveness of marketing activity are irrelevant and result in a lack of accountability, says the report: 57 per cent of the companies surveyed use sales revenue, 53 per cent use market share and 39 per cent use net profit to measure marketing effectiveness. 'Since marketing has responsibility for few measurable outputs, it is difficult to justify using criteria over which it has only a potential or hypothetical impact,' the report says. The report concludes that the most effective marketing departments of the future will take on responsibility for all 'processes that contribute to managing the customer and consumer interface'. These could include handling customer complaints or devising payment procedures. Mr Rod Wilkes, chairman of The Chartered Institute of Marketing, said he was 'totally at odds' with the report. Most fast-moving consumer goods companies were marketing-led, and in any company 'it should be the marketing director who co-ordinates the business plan,' he said. Footballers who find themselves out of a job in their mid 30s are to get the chance of a second career in marketing. The Professional Footballers' Association is piloting a two-year part-time course in Warrington which will lead to a certificate from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. Seven footballers, including Everton's Matthew Jackson and PFA executive committee member George Berry, are taking part in the pilot. The aim is to help footballers who want to get a marketing job in sport or industry after they have given up playing. Marketing at the Crossroads.

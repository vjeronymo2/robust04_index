			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Rabin seeks to defuse land row Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, was last night seeking a way to climb down from the crisis generated by ground-clearing for a West Bank settler suburb on land claimed by Palestinian farmers. Mr Yassir Arafat summoned an emergency meeting of his Palestinian National Authority in Gaza last night to consider the issue. A spokesman for the PLO chairman demanded that Israel return the land to the villagers of Khader, south of Bethlehem. He warned that failure to do so might 'negatively affect' the peace negotiations. Earlier yesterday Mr Rabin asked Mr Michael Ben-Yair, attorney general, to clarify the legal situation. Bulldozers, meanwhile, are continuing to clear the hillside one mile from the settler township of Efrat. Hundreds of Palestinians mounted a protest vigil there yesterday and a large Israeli force still guards the site. Meanwhile, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia arrived unexpectedly in Alexandria yesterday for a meeting with Presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Hafez al-Assad of Syria. There was speculation in Egypt that Mr Assad had sought the meeting to express his concern about the pace at which Israel was establishing relations with Arab countries, particularly in the Gulf, while still occupying large areas of Arab territory.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS  </P> <P> In Washington, House members stay up all night making speeches about how much  they all love the flag. In Sacramento, a bill is introduced in the Legislature  requiring the phone to be answered at public agencies within 10 rings. Don't  these people have anything to do with their time? What we need is a law  requiring elected officials to wear warning labels that tell you that they are  dangerous when awake.  </P> <P> WILLIAM V. FERRARO  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

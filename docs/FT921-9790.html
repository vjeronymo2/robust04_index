			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Ashdown opposes tighter press curbs MR PADDY ASHDOWN, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday joined Mr John Major, the prime minister, in opposing tighter controls on the press, in spite of his party's anger last week at the treatment of the news of an affair he had five years ago. Weekend opinion polls showed a sharp rise in Mr Ashdown's popularity, calming party strategists' fears about the electoral impact of Mr Ashdown's disclosure, which was forced by the theft of documents from his solicitor. Although he believed his personal life was not a matter of public interest, Mr Ashdown said he would not vote for a privacy bill. He expressed alarm, however, at the apparent willingness of the media prepared to use papers obtained by criminal means. 'If the press will not even draw the line at the use of stolen documents, which in any other circumstances is a crime, we are in a very dangerous situation indeed,' he said on London's LBC radio. Mr Ashdown said the increase in his support said 'more about the decency and generosity of the British people than it does about me'. An NOP poll for the Independent on Sunday showed 47 per cent of voters thought Mr Ashdown was doing well in his job - his highest-ever rating and 13 percentage points higher than last month. Mr Major said that to inhibit the press would be 'a very substantial' change. He added: 'We have had a free press in this country for all its good points - and sometimes its excesses - for a long time.' Liberal Democrats will seek to bring the political agenda back to policy issues this week with a series of statements on constitutional reform. Meanwhile, as fears intensify about a 'dirty war' in the run-up to the general election, Mr Des Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' campaign strategist, is considering using the Data Protection Act to investigate Tory computer files on Liberal Democrat MPs and officials. His concern follows reports that Conservative Central Office used a credit agency for information on a Welsh Liberal Democrat activist.</p>

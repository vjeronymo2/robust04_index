			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Bites but no bark in a Vietnamese restaurant: Letter from Hanoi Quang Vinh's restaurant was the ideal place for the ordeal to come. The palm-thatched house near the West Lake, on the outskirts of the Vietnamese capital Hanoi, was far from the accusing eyes of fellow-Englishmen. It was dark outside. At one table, a Vietnamese couple were contentedly finishing their meal. At another, a man smoked a bamboo pipe. A television at the end of the room showed mildly pornographic Chinese videos. But then came the moment of truth: could an Englishman eat a dog? Could he do so without his stomach rebelling, without his thoughts turning to labradors snoozing by Kentish fireplaces, Staffordshire bull terriers collecting sticks for children, and Pekinese perched on the laps of grandmothers? One Englishman could: I ate roast dog, dog liver, barbecued dog with herbs and a deliciously spicy dog sausage, for it is the custom to dine on a selection of dog dishes when visiting a dog restaurant. The meat tastes faintly gamey. It is eaten with noodles, crispy rice-flour pancakes, fresh ginger, spring onions, apricot leaves and, for cowardly Englishmen, plenty of beer. I had been inspired to undergo this traumatic experience - most un-British unless one is stranded with huskies on a polar ice cap - by a conversation earlier in the week with Do Duc Dinh, a Vietnamese economist, and Nguyen Thanh Tam, my official interpreter and guide. They were much more anxious to tell me about the seven different ways of cooking a dog, and how unlucky it was to eat dog on the first five days of the month, than they were to explain Vietnam's economic reforms. 'My favourite,' began Tam, 'is minced intestines roasted in the fire with green beans and onions.' He remembered proudly how anti-Vietnamese protesters in Thailand in the 1980s had carried placards saying 'Dog-eaters go home]' During the Vietnam war, he said, a famous Vietnamese professor had discovered that wounded soldiers recovered much more quickly when their doctors prescribed half a kilogramme of dog meat a day. Dinh insisted I should eat dog in Hanoi rather than Saigon. 'I went to the south and ate dog, but they don't know how to cook it like we do in the north,' he said. I asked where the dogs came from. 'People breed it, then it becomes the family pet.' And then they eat it? 'Yes,' he said with a laugh. Something twitched in my brain, and then I remembered: years earlier, I had been eating roast lamb at a farmhouse in southern England when the farmer put down his knife and fork, turned to the children and remarked that Elizabeth was tender and tasty. 'Elizabeth?' I gasped. She was a lamb course that had been bottle-fed and become a family pet. In Hanoi I told myself that the urban British, notorious animal-lovers that they are, recoil particularly at the idea of eating dogs only because most of them never see the living versions of the pigs, cows, sheep and chickens that they eat in meat-form every day. And the French, after all, eat horses. Resolutely unsentimental, we put aside our dog dinner and went to Vinh's kitchen. Two wire cages were on the floor; there was one large dog in the first and four small dogs in the second. Two feet away, a cauldron of dog stew steamed and bubbled. Vinh told us about his flourishing business. The dogs are transported from villages in a nearby province. A 10kg dog costs him about 120,000 Vietnamese dong, or just over Dollars 10. At the end of the month - peak dog-eating time - his restaurant gets through about 30 dogs a day. The restaurant, he said, was popular with Vietnamese, Koreans and Japanese. Squeamish westerners were sometimes tricked into eating dog by their Vietnamese friends, who would entertain them at the restaurant and tell them afterwards what it was they had so heartily consumed. 'Groups of British people come here deliberately too,' he volunteered. 'One time we had four British women.' Intrigued by this glimpse into the dark, dog-eating side of the British character, my English companion and I looked around the kitchen. It was a mistake: a small black dog caught my friend's eye and looked at him soulfully. He felt guilty. He wanted to rescue the dog, which, he felt sure, must have smelled that this was a place were dogs were cooked. My friend is a true Englishman. He has a pet dog and loves dogs more than cows and pigs: bacon is all right, dog sausage is not. But he must remain anonymous. I recalled that during the meal he had barely touched the food. 'I am worried,' he said, 'that my friends in Halifax will think I want to eat their whippets.'</p>

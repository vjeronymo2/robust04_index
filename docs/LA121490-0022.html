			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Write or Wrong?: Even though sex and drug charges against gonzo journalist  Hunter Thompson were dropped earlier this year in Aspen, Colo., some still love  him and others fear and loathe him. Says Sheriff Robert Braudis: "I just hope  this place doesn't become so uptight that he feels he has to move away."  </P> <P> But newsman Bill Dunaway says: "People take him with a large grain of salt."  </P> <P> Four in One: One of Buckingham Palace's art galleries was transformed Wednesday  into a ballroom when Queen Elizabeth II invited 800 guests to celebrate four  royal birthdays. The ball marked the 90th birthday of the Queen Mother on Aug.  4, the 60th birthday of the queen's sister, Princess Margaret, on Aug. 21, the  40th birthday of the queen's daughter, Princess Anne, on Aug. 15, and the 30th  birthday of the queen's second son, Prince Andrew, on Feb. 19.  </P> <P> Of Note: Two handwritten letters between Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein  discussing the nature of war sold for $165,000 at an auction by Sotheby's in  New York. Einstein's four-page letter of July 28, 1932, asks: "Is there a way  to liberate man from the doom of war?" Freud's reply concludes: "There is no  prospect of getting rid of this aggressive instinct."  </P> <P> Prison Papers: Convicted Watergate figure Charles Colson is making news again  -- literally. He edits Inside Journal, a newspaper for prisoners in six states,  which premiered Wednesday. Colson himself spent seven months in prison.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Minor breaches of regulations to be decriminalised - Excise traders Minor breaches of excise laws, which can now be punished with fines of up to Pounds 5,000, are to be decriminalised. Breaches now classed as criminal include failure to comply with conditions under which excise traders have excise approval and failure to pay duty. These will be removed from criminal law, and fixed penalties, appealable to the new VAT and Duties Tribunals, will be introduced in place of the fines. The new civil penalties will be set at Pounds 250 for all offences, except failure to pay duty due, where the penalty will be Pounds 250 or 5 per cent of the duty, whichever is greater. It will be Pounds 20 for each day on which there is a continuing failure, such as failure to maintain accounts and records. These changes will be part of a package to simplify and reform excise law. They continue the de-regulation initiative and safeguard the interests of traders. Other proposed changes are: Powers to estimate duty due from excise traders will be replaced with a new power to assess. Excise officers will be required to exercise their best judgment in making assessments, and there will be time constraints. Assessments will be appealable to the new VAT and Duties Tribunals. The Customs &amp; Excise Department will have an option to treat fraudulent evasion of excise duties as a civil or criminal matter. When a civil evasion penalty is imposed it will be equal to and payable on top of the arrears due. But there will be powers to reduce or cancel the penalty if there are mitigating circumstances. At the moment, estimates of excise duty may be made at any time and there is no right of appeal against them. Failure to pay on demand is a criminal offence punishable with a fine of up to twice the estimated amount. The VAT and Duties Tribunal will be able to set aside or reduce assessments made by Customs &amp; Excise where the trader shows to their satisfaction that either the officer had not used best judgment, or that a lesser amount was due. Changes to the repayment supplement system were also proposed; Mr Clarke intends to complete the package of VAT reforms announced in the March Budget. The changes are largely to the benefit of businesses, and reinforce the principle that repayment supplement is an efficiency spur on Customs &amp; Excise. Three changes are being made: The length of time allowed for Customs &amp; Excise to investigate repayment claims before triggering supplement is being reduced. The minimum supplement which will be paid when a repayment claim has been unduly delayed by Customs &amp; Excise is being increased from Pounds 30 to Pounds 50. Repayment claims which are received late will no longer be eligible for supplement. The revised system is expected to come into effect next year, one month after the finance bill gains Royal Assent, and will apply to repayment claims received after that date. Repayment supplement becomes payable when Customs &amp; Excise unduly delay repayment of a legitimate VAT claim return by more than 30 days from the date of its receipt. It is the counterpart of default surcharge, which is paid by traders who are late in paying VAT due. Customs &amp; Excise receive some 2.4m claims for VAT refunds amounting to more than Pounds 24bn each year. More than 90 per cent of claims are authorised for payment within 10 working days. Access reform: Powers available to Customs officers for access to information from businesses involved in the import and export of goods are to be reformed. The chancellor's intention is to align Customs powers with those already in force for value added tax and excise. The new powers will therefore already be familiar to most customs traders and will allow them to benefit from an audit-based system of control. Controls exercised at the frontier against smuggling are not affected by the proposals.</p>

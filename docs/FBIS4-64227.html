			<p>BFN     [Text] The Berlin public prosecutor has decided to charge  a former Syrian diplomat, Nabil Chritah [name as received], with  carrying out the bomb attack on the French cultural center  Maison de France. DPA learned this from judicial circles today.  Chritah, who is being accused of aiding and abetting murder,  arrived in Germany under mysterious circumstances at the  beginning of January and was arrested and temporarily held. At  the same time, charges were brought against a Stasi official  from the department dealing with the fight against terrorism.  One person was killed and 23 injured in the attack, which took  place 11 years ago on 25 August 1983.    A Berlin justice spokeswoman, Uta Filster, confirmed that  two  defendants will be charged with aiding and abetting murder, but  she refused to go into detail.    As recently as in mid-April, a former Stasi lieutenant,  Helmut Voigt (51), was sentenced to four years imprisonment by  the Berlin court for aiding and abetting the attack. The court  considered it proven that Voigt at least passed on the order to  hand over the explosives for the attack to a suspected German  terrorist, Johannes Weinrich.    The Stasi official now facing charges is believed to have  passed on the explosives to Weinrich, as ordered by Voigt.  According to the public prosecutor, at the Syrian Embassy in  East Berlin Weinrich deposited the explosives with Chritah, who  is now being indicted. Weinrich, who is believed to belong to  the international terrorist group "Carlos," picked up the  explosives again on the day when the attack was carried out.    It has become known that Chritah was allegedly lured to  Budapest by the German authorities. A security official  reportedly made it clear to him that he cannot return to his  home country because of his participation in the attack. In the  trial against Voigt, Chritah testified amid tight security  measures -- he was protected by a screen. He stressed that  Syria is fighting terrorists.    However, according to findings by German security  authorities, Weinrich and "Carlos" lived in the Syrian capital  Damascus at least until the middle of last year. The Federal  Government has asked Syria several times to extradite the two  suspected terrorists against whom, because of the murder, an  arrest warrant was issued by the court in Berlin-Tiergarten 10  years ago.</p>

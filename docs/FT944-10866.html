			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Israel agrees powers transfer Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation agreed a series of measures yesterday to speed the expansion of Palestinian self-rule, amid growing concerns about the political and economic crisis in the Gaza Strip. After a meeting with Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel had agreed to complete transfer of administrative power to Palestinians over West Bank health, welfare, taxation and tourism by the end of the month under an agreement known as early empowerment which has already transferred education to Palestinians. Mr Rabin also said Israel would add talks on Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank and the transfer of authority to continuing negotiations about Palestinian elections and had agreed to ease Israel's closure of Gaza and the West Bank by increasing the number of Palestinian workers allowed to cross into Israel by 10,000 to 23,000. The package of measures completes the transfer after months of delay and growing mutual suspicion. Israeli officials said Mr Rabin appeared to have made a strategic decision to implement the Israeli-PLO accords despite opposition from senior military officers. They said Mr Rabin recognised that unless the peace process is implemented much faster Mr Arafat's fragile support base will collapse in the face of a resurgent Islamic opposition. Mr Arafat said the meeting had been very positive. 'We hope that in this atmosphere we will follow up and implement accurately and honestly what we agreed upon.' However, even with Israel's commitment to accelerating the process officials said it was unlikely that the Israeli army would leave Palestinian population centres before the middle of next year - a full year behind schedule. The pace of future negotiations, which Mr Rabin said would start within two weeks, will depend largely on what instructions Mr Rabin gives to the four-person Israeli negotiating team. But observers said the inclusion of two foreign ministry officials should help to speed the talks given the clear enthusiasm of the foreign ministry for quicker implementation. 'They will certainly be complex negotiations in which we, as Israelis, will have to ensure ourselves all the components of security. I cannot estimate how many months the talks will last,' Mr Rabin said. Mr Rabin also said early empowerment would depend on an agreement with donors to meet the additional funding gap the Palestinian authority will incur as it takes over responsibility in the West Bank. Israel, the PLO and donors are close to completing an accord under which Israel will assist the Palestinians with tax collection, tax training and the transfer of tax data in Arabic and donors will meet an estimated additional deficit of Dollars 27m (Pounds 17m) for the next six months. Donors have agreed to meet the financing gap but have warned they cannot continue funding Palestinian running costs indefinitely while Israel continues to collect millions of dollars of customs duties from the West Bank.</p>

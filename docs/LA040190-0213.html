			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MATER DEI STREAKING AGAIN, BUT NOT THE RIGHT WAY  </P> <P> It was a tough week for Mater Dei High School, Orange County's top-ranked  softball team. The Monarchs lost to Thousand Oaks, 2-1, Saturday in the 5-A  championship game of the Canyon Tournament of Champions.  </P> <P> It was the second loss of the week for Mater Dei, which started the season  12-0.  </P> <P> Mater Dei fell behind, 1-0, in the second inning on Saturday when Ericka  Gulbranson scored on a squeeze. Pitcher Terri Kobata fielded the bunt and made  a perfect throw to catcher Tracy Rice, but a forceful slide jarred the ball out  of Rice's mitt.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks scored again in the fourth, when Tricia Gregoire doubled and then  crossed the plate after a grounder glanced off first baseman Amy Moeller's  glove and into right field.  </P> <P> "It's a frustrating way to give up a run, but those things (errors) happen,"  Mater Dei Coach Kathy Quesnell said. "They came out aggressive and we have a  tendency, when we play aggressive teams, to take a step back. We had our  chances. We had the baserunners. We just can't get them across."  </P> <P> The Monarchs had five hits but left four runners on base. Jennifer Cline's  single drove in Theresa Conway with Mater Dei's lone run in the fourth.  </P> <P> Kobata (5-2) gave up only three hits and had nine strikeouts.  </P> <P> "Terri is a competitor. She wanted this game," Quesnell said. "Thousand Oaks is  a good team and they're aggressive, but it's too bad we couldn't back Terri  up."  </P> <P> Kobata, Rice and Cline were named to the all-tournament team and teammate Amy  Godwin was named tournament MVP on offense.  </P> <P> In other Canyon tournament games:  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 3, Simi Valley 2 (8 innings) -- Both teams waited until the  eighth inning to take advantage of the tiebreaker rule and the Barons took home  the third-place trophy. Fountain Valley's Rae Rice posted her fifth victory  (5-0).  </P> <P> Los Alamitos 2, Agoura 0 -- Shelley Smith had the game-winning RBI as Los  Alamitos picked up its 10th victory of the season in the seventh-place game.  Shannon Skoglund improved to 5-1.  </P> <P> St. Joseph's 5, Huntington Beach 2 -- Kelly Sparks of St. Joseph's went three  for three with five RBIs to help defeat Huntington Beach (2-7) in the  ninth-place game.  </P> <P> In nonleague games:  </P> <P> La Habra 2-1, Ocean View 1-4 (first game, 9 innings) -- Three Ocean View  pitchers combined for a one-hit victory in the nightcap. Marla Pickard got the  victory with relief help from Tami Dowlin and Jonna Lawson.  </P></p>

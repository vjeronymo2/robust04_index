			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Hardest Working Man?: Imprisoned soul singer James Brown was freed from prison  Thursday after 16 months to begin a work-release program. Brown will act as a  counselor with the Aiken and Barnwell Counties Community Action Commission in  Aiken, S.C. Brown, often billed as the "hardest-working man in show business,"  likely would be required to talk with children and adults in the largely rural  area and work to increase public awareness of the poor. He will spend nights  and weekends at a minimum security prison in Aiken County. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

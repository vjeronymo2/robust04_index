			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (20): New ways to protect vital information -  ..For Security COMPUTER security is entwined with the myth of the teenage hacker. The callow youth who cuts through acres of code and plants irreverent and destructive messages in a critical computer system. There are real threats to the security of information technology. They come from more mundane sources than the hacker, but can inflict more damage than conventional thieves. Robert Schifreen has carved out a respectable career for himself as a security consultant. Eight years ago he was in court charged with hacking into the Duke of Edinburgh's electronic mailbox and signing off as '. . . His Royal Hacker.' The authorities were not amused and Schifreen and his fellow hacker pursued the matter to the House of Lords before their exploit was dismissed as a harmless prank. Today, Mr Schifreen is in demand for solid commercial advice. But he stresses the practical side of security risks - 'telephone hacking is not as important as the fact that someone can walk up to your office, copy your files onto a floppy disk, wander out and read them at leisure,' he says. In order to protect information, everything connected to it must be secured. Encryption, hiding data behind a sequence of code-words, can lock out unwanted users. Restricting access to the office makes it less rewarding for a data intruder to chase up those code-words. But with the rise of local area networks and computer clusters built around one powerful processor acting as a central server it has become difficult to 'partition' data access. Keith Marsden is managing director of Braintree, a Cheshire-based software house specialising in security issues. He echoes Schifreen's view that security is about more than technology - 'it's not about hackers. The most dangerous person in a company is the one who's under stress and bearing a grudge.' Marsden believes security begins with an awareness of personnel, their problems and grievances and a knowledge of just how far they can delve into the company's data. Braintree produces Auditor Plus, a software security product for Digital Equipment computer networks. Costing upwards of Pounds 12,000 per installation, Auditor is not cheap. But it takes a novel approach to the issue of systems security. Installed on a network Auditor checks each user's level of authorisation to assess their potential access to data. The effect is to provide the user with a harsh remind er of just how many people can see confidential files. Marsden has found that demonstrating Auditor is an effective, if alarming, sales tactic - 'one potential user gave us the name of a file that only four senior staff could access officially. Auditor ran through the system and reported that 100 people could access it]' Auditor began life five years ago after the Cern nuclear research laboratory in Geneva was victim to unauthorised access. The perpetrator destroyed files and caused significant damage. The lesson was not lost on other sites guarding irreplaceable data. Auditor's second sale was to the European Space Agency. Reuters exists to sell huge volume of data. It uses Auditor to prevent unauthorised browsing into its huge reserves of historical market data. Paul Andrews, a Reuters systems manager, has instructed the program to trawl through his system every 30 minutes. It reports on whether individual authorisation levels have been changed to enlarge access. Given that information is the raw material his organisation thrives on, Paul Andrews has no trouble justifying the cost of IT security measures. And he finds that Reuters clients are well aware of the benefits of careful security planning - 'when I say we're using a dedicated security product it gives the clients an added sense of well-being.' A lack of adequate security procedures can have unexpected consequences. Bob Hay, a former police chief superintendent, is chairman of the Federation Against Software Theft. His organisation was established to highlight the issues involved in unauthorised copying of software. Bob Hay points out that computer security extends to protecting an organisation's reputation. If employees engage in widescale copying of software, the company will be held responsible. Both GEC Marconi and Mirror Group have found themselves on the receiving end of Fast investigations. The answer, says Hay, is to set up a software management charter. 'Register all software bought by the company and carry out regular audits of what copies are running,' he says. The European Security Forum is evidence of the weight that blue chip companies attach to data security. Including Barclays Bank and British Steel among its members, ESF organises workshops to pool opinions. In the past three years members have allocated Pounds 2.5m to the organisation. LESSONS LEARNED Alan Stanley is managing director of the ESF. He admits that the Virgin Atlantic-British Airways conflict highlighted a data security breach. BA is an ESF member, and it managed the computer data bank that contained passenger booking files for Virgin. Alan Stanley attempts to draw a positive lesson from the embarassing case of a prominent ESF contributor breaching recognised standards of confidentiality in pursuit of commercial gain. He believes Virgin failed to appreciate the vulnerability and value of its data. 'When you contract-out a service, security is not always the first consideration. You have to know who's doing what, and what risks the out side contractor is taking on board.' Virgin was livid that BA drew sensitive information from the booking system. The data was used to analyse the profitability of Virgin routes as well to approach customers. Virgin said it was poised to bring an action against BA under the Data Protection. Given the sharp rise in outsourcing of computer maintenance, it's worth assessing the loyalty of non-employees. They may be perfectly honest, but less inclined to understand the value of security. Contract staff can discuss sensitive passwords over mobile phones and leave identity codes written down for their colleagues. Cited by security consultants as common, these lapses prove that it pays to keep up a barrage of reminders on the vital subject of security.</p>

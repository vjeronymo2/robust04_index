			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "U.K." and "F.N.": "200 Billion Dollar Goal; </F> East-West Business Forum"]    [Text] Countries undergoing reforms should create  favorable conditions for foreign investors, while the West  should open up its markets to merchandise from the East -- this  is what was stressed during the first day of the meeting by  participants of an East-West Business Forum being held in  Warsaw.    The forum was organized in connection with a third  conference  by economy, industry, and trade ministers of the seven most  industrialized countries of the world (G-7) and of 10 countries  undergoing reforms (E-10) [E-10: Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech  Republic, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Romania, Slovakia,  Ukraine, Hungary], which begins on 6 May. "We are eager to see  the participation of foreign capital not just in bilateral joint  venture-type measures but also in multilateral ties. We are  counting on capital involvement in the amount of over $1 billion  per year. There cannot be a good economy without a stable  economic policy, and this is exactly the kind of policy that the  current government intends to implement, while creating the  right climate for conducting profitable business," stated Deputy  Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, who is participating in the  forum. According to Kolodko, Poland has already achieved  significant economic results while the economy has good  prospects for development.    During a discussion, the entrepreneurs were wondering what  must be done to make $200 billion worth of capital flow from the  G-7 countries to the E-10 countries by the year 2000. By that  time, the private sector in the countries undergoing reforms  should produce 70 percent of the national product while the  participation of these countries in trade exchange with G-7  should reach the level of 17-20 percent (right now, it is just  6-7 percent).    High customs duties, lack of stability of legal systems, and  weak promotion all make trade difficult, and they are not  conducive to investments which are required, among others, in  telecommunications, transportation, and road construction -- the  businessmen stressed.    NOWA EUROPA asked the U.S. Trade Secretary Ronald H. Brown  what he expects from the conference, which is to begin Friday.  "I expect," he said, "that this third conference on East-West  cooperation will concentrate primarily on working out strategies  within which the private sector will be able to contribute to  the region's development to a larger extent than now, and also  will contribute to the process of establishing new jobs. I  would like to emphasize that Central and East Europe remains a  very important and strategic region to us, particularly from the  standpoint of the transformations taking place in the  postcommunist countries. We think that the region also has a  huge economic potential which the countries of East and Central  Europe are trying to utilize in their striving for a market  economy. The United States and all highly industrialized  countries that are members of G-7 can help in this economic  transformation."</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (5): Barajas plans an 'airport city' - Madrid Barajas airport, which accounts for 20 per cent of Spain's air traffic, is scheduled to grow fast over the next decade as it becomes the focal point for economic activity in the area between Madrid and the satellite towns of Torrejon de Ardoz and San Fernando de Henares, both of which have become important light engineering centres. Access to the airport, which is 15km from the city centre, has been considerably eased by the completion of Madrid's second ring road and of two new direct approaches to the main terminals. A third ring road is planned as well a rail link. The expansion comes at a time when the airport remains below saturation point and it will avert any over-capacity in the future. Barajas handled a record 18.4m passengers in 1992, is forecast to be used by some 18m this year. The airport will have a capacity for 27m by the year 2,000. Over the past two years more rational use of the airport's two intersecting runways has raised the maximum number of flight operations from 33 to 55 per hour, the number of aircraft bays has been raised from 75 to 100 and additional space has been gained for the passengers by linking up the main domestic and international terminals. Such improvements allow the airport to absorb without undue strain a forecast annual increase of some 4 per cent in its number of passengers as it awaits the construction of a new runway and a new terminal that will come into service after 2000. The planned new facilities represent a quantum leap for Barajas and they form part of an ambitious plan to develop an 'airport city' that will incorporate large recreational areas, new office and service sector zones, and a greenfield industrial estate.</p>

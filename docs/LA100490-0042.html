			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> OPEN HOUSE IS MORE THAN JUST ASKING: 'HOW'S JOEY DOING?'  </P> <P> In the next few weeks, thousands of Westside parents will take part in a  classic autumn ritual: open house at their children's schools.  </P> <P> Open houses give parents the chance to sit in the room where their children  spend roughly 900 hours a year in grade school, and 180 hours a year in junior  and senior high school. It is also an opportunity to meet the teacher, who in  most cases spends more time with a child each day than the parents do.  </P> <P> There are several ways for parents to make the most of the open house at their  child's school. There's more to it than simply asking, "How's my kid doing in  class?"  </P> <P> Ask the teacher for a list of topics that are covered in class so that you know  exactly which novels, historical periods and mathematical or scientific  concepts your child is learning. Instead of always asking your child, "What did  you do in school today?" you can monitor his or her knowledge on specific  subjects.  </P> <P> Ask for a copy of the grading policy to learn the kinds of assignments given,  which ones count most heavily toward the final grade and the extra-credit  options that are offered.  </P> <P> Also find out how often report cards are given; many parents are surprised to  learn that grades are published at most Westside schools every six or eight  weeks, not just twice a year.  </P> <P> The grading policy should mention how often homework is assigned in an average  week; if not, be sure to ask the teacher. That way you'll know better if your  student constantly comes home without books and says there was nothing  assigned.  </P> <P> In addition to finding out the basic requirements of a class, also ask about  the extras. Is there, for example, a museum exhibit or television program that  would enhance and enliven a topic that your child is now studying in class? Are  there related magazines that he or she can read in the school library? If your  child is reading novels or plays, is there a videotape available for watching  at home?  </P> <P> Unfortunately, teachers usually don't have enough time to talk at length with  parents during the open house because the visitors are herded through too  quickly.  </P> <P> But there's still an easy way to reserve some quality time with your child's  teachers. Bring to the open house a note for each teacher that lists your phone  number at home and work, and the best time to reach you. List specific  questions or concerns you would like to discuss. Make sure you give the  student's last name if it's different from yours.  </P> <P> As you give the note to the teacher, ask when you can expect to hear from him  or her. Asking "Will I hear from you by Friday?" helps to ensure that you will.  </P> <P> What you see at the open house may tell you as much about your child's school  life as what you hear, so explore the classroom thoroughly.  </P> <P> Wall displays, maps, showcases of student work and a seating arrangement that  allows students to interact usually mean that the teacher inspires curiosity  and open discussion of ideas. Remember, though, that not all teachers -- no  matter how inspiring -- have wall space, floor space or funding to jazz up  their classrooms this way.  </P> <P> Make time to venture beyond the classroom, too. Visit the office to read  notices of school activities and meet your child's counselor, or inspect the  safety and versatility of the gym or playground. Getting a school newspaper  will also tell you a lot about the school's inner workings.  </P> <P> Above all, remember that examination of your child's academic world need not be  limited to the open house. It is your right to visit a public school on any  school day, and many teachers encourage parents to schedule visits to actual  classes.  </P> <P> If your work schedule makes a daytime back-to-school visit impossible, then  making the most of an open house is the best alternative.  </P> <P> Mary Yarber teaches English and journalism at Santa Monica High School. She  will write weekly about education for the Westside section.  </P></p>

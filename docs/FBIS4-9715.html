			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to El Salvador's run-off  elections scheduled for 24 April 1994.    Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate of the Democratic  Convergence coalition, said at the Presidente Hotel on 29 March  that, if the presidential run-off elections are to be held on 24  April, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] must correct all of  the mistakes made on 20 March to make the process legitimate.  Zamora said: "As the coalition's presidential candidate, my  position is that it is necessary, even essential, to make  changes in the electoral process in order that it makes sense to  hold the second round." Zamora decried the irregularities that  took place on 20 March, which, he said, prevented thousands of  Salvadorans from voting. He and his coalition have presented a  list of 11 things to the TSE that need to be changed in the  second round. He regretted that so far the TSE has failed to  respond. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 29  Mar 94)    On 29 March, Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate of  the Nationalist Republican Alliance, accused the FMLN [Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front] of delaying the final vote  count for the 20 March elections. He attributed the FMLN's  slowness to its lack of electoral experience and asked the party  to step up the final count. Calderon Sol said: "I am hereby  expressing my dissatisfaction over the slowness with which  members of the FMLN are conducting the final vote count. I know  they lack experience and I know this is their first election  following their recent induction into the Salvadoran political  and democratic process. This does not mean, however, that they  should have doubts and lack the resolve to abide by the law."  (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 29 Mar 94)</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Property: That horrible sinking feeling - Advice on subsidence Subsidence became a dirty word in 1989 and 1990. Few homeowners had minded the odd crack in the walls until those successive dry years introduced serious problems. The public took fright, especially if they lived on the clay beds of London and south-east England. Nearby trees were the cause of much subsidence - sucking the moisture out of the clay. In 1991 subsidence claims against members of the Association of British Insurers (excluding Lloyd's) reached Pounds 540m. They declined in 1992 to Pounds 259m, and last year to Pounds 134m. They should fall again this year since rainfall is back to normal, the clay is swelling and wall cracks should be closing. But homeowners' attitudes have not regained the same equilibrium - and probably never will now that subsidence has become so scary. Buildings are not wholly solid, inflexible objects. Many have had cracks for centuries and survive happily. Timber buildings are always moving. Cracks are not the automatic danger they are in aircraft wings. But owners who suffered in the 1989-90 drought had a bad fright, like the James's in Woodford Green, Essex, who had to appeal to the Insurance Ombudsman's Bureau before their 1930s house was mended. In 1989 they noticed an irregular tear in the wallpaper. A crack beneath one window in 1990 became by 1991 'a complex of cracks throughout the house', said Geoffrey James. The neighbours also had the problem, so together they asked a local surveyor to investigate. That led to an insurance claim. Loss adjusters were appointed who in turn instructed structural engineers. Early in 1991 they dug inspection pits beside the foundations. Their report in April diagnosed subsidence and recommended pollarding the adjacent trees and underpinning. It would be more efficient, and cheaper for the insurers, to do the work at both houses in tandem. Their neighbours' adjusters accepted the report and invited tenders. But the James's adjusters held back, wanting to test their theory that, if they felled the nearby trees and cleared the shrubs, the subsoil might recover over the next two years. They proposed waiting that long before authorising work - although the adjusters for next door had said 'go-ahead'. This was intolerable. The James's wrote to the ombudsman who advised writing to the chief executive of their insurer, Sun Alliance. Within a week he intervened and over-rode the adjusters. Work began in July 1992 and continued until December. The underpinning was a massive specialist operation, costing Pounds 14,500. Repairs and redecoration by a general builder came to Pounds 11,800. The structural engineers charged Pounds 3,000, a botanical identification service which examined the tree roots Pounds 120 and the James's surveyor Pounds 1,600. Except for a Pounds 500 excess in the policy that James paid, Sun Alliance paid everything and the house stands firm. The sole hitch is that, wanting to change his house contents insurance policy, Geoffrey James has approached four insurers who have all turned him down, he thinks because of a question about subsidence - which he finds hard to connect with contents. Subsidence does not occur on sandstone or limestone, unless there is clay nearby. Clay changes volume according to how much moisture it has, shrinking as it dries out and expanding if it gains water. As the clay contracts, building foundations may settle (subsidence). If it expands, it may push them up (heave). Insurance companies dignify the perils of Subsidence and Heave with capital letters, but heave is not such a danger. In the 14 years of his professional career Tony DeFries, of Savills Building Consultancy has 'never seen a building suffer' from it. One house can suffer subsidence while its neighbour does not - which makes the insurers' use of postcodes, combined with geological maps to assess risk and premiums, an inaccurate tool. The clay may be thicker or more viscous at a particular point, or the construction different. Cracked drains or water mains may be eroding the soil. Older houses with lime mortar ride movement better than new ones with cement mortar. However, trees are the biggest danger and the worst offenders are deciduous varieties such as oak, poplar and lime. And the shallow roots of the London plane look for water near the surface. Like lime, it is often planted close to a building and causes damage. The Building Research Establishment advises that trees should be the distance of their mature height from the building, although less thirsty trees may be half their mature height. If you think a tree is making your house crack, seek advice from a surveyor and from an arboriculturist. It may be wiser to prune the tree, to reduce its leafage, rather than cut it down. (If you are in a conservation area you may need permission from the local planning authority.) You can also trim the roots. If your house develops cracks, assess how bad they are and identify possible causes. Inform the insurers even if you are not making a claim. They may instruct loss adjusters, surveyors or engineers to inspect the house, soil and trees, and will ask how long the cracks have been there - in case you committed the sin of non-disclosure when you took out your policy. Experts will have to diagnose if it really is subsidence, or the cracks come, say, from differential rates of expansion and contraction of materials in the building. That may easily take a year, to see if the cracks close in wet weather. The BRE's table of damage runs from nought (hairline cracking) to five (structural damage, cracks over 25mm wide requiring major repairs, beams losing their bearing and the walls leaning badly and needing shoring). Causes other than foundation movement can produce cracks less than 3mm wide  -the thickness of a Pounds 1 coin. If the crack is wider, foundation movement may well be the cause. Category one cracks can be fixed using a simple filler. Category two cracks, up to 5mm, may need some internal wall lining and repointing outside to keep out the wet. Doors and windows may stick slightly and need easing. In category three, cracks are 5mm to 15mm wide, doors and windows stick and service pipes may fracture. In category four they are 15mm-25mm, and walls may need considerable breaking-out and replacing. Many old houses display some of this damage and are still sound. The regulations for new houses (with foundations on clay usually 0.9m deep, and up to 3.5m if there are trees around) are so strict that subsidence is uncommon. Those that have suffered have been mostly Victorian and from the first half of this century, plus some built after the second world war. And cracks can close, as DeFries has noted in a house in Hampstead, north London, where he has monitored cracks for two years for the occupier. It has now virtually recovered, and there is no need to underpin which is 'a horrendous major structural exercise'. Geoffrey James recommends retaining a surveyor of one's own as 'he knows the ropes and can advise on all the ensuing building procedures'. He says: 'If a neighbour has the same problem, work together - not least for support on the bleak days when the family home looks set to lose its value.' A useful book, Has Your House Got Cracks?, Pounds 9.95, by TJ Freeman, GS Littlejohn and RMC Driscoll is published by the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Building Research Establishment</p>

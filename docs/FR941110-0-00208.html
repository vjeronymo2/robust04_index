			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The provision is beyond statutory authority and should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be left to the States as to whether or not they wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recover reimbursement from the facilities for noncompliant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters asked that we amend this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsection to explicitly permit States to enter into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements with facilities to repay Medicaid funds if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies are not corrected according to the approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan of correction. Other commenters suggested that we only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold a State liable for repayment of Federal Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments to a noncompliant facility if the facility remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out of compliance and the State has not made full use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available intermediate remedies. One commenter wanted us to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broaden the rule used for Medicare (that is, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility agree to repay) to apply to Medicaid as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Absent a legislative change, we have limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choices when a State survey agency finds a facility out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance with Federal requirements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies only are the recommended enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response. For Medicare, we must obtain an agreement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repay from the facility or cease making payment to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. For Medicaid, we either obtain a repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement from the State or stop Federal financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation to the State for that facility. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State may terminate a NF. In response to the commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who worried about the State's liability for up to six months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of FFP, the Act does not prevent States from securing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement to repay from the facility before agreeing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repay monies to the Federal government. In fact, during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transition period between when the new nursing home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements became effective and the effective date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final survey process and enforcement rules, some States have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained agreements to repay from facilities before signing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements to repay to HCFA. However, we will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicitly include in regulation that States are permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to enter into repayment agreements with facilities, nor will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we broaden the rule for Medicare to apply to Medicaid. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State has the discretion to determine whether repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements between it and the Medicaid facilities would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also are not accepting the recommendation to only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold a State liable for the repayment of Federal funds if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State had not made full use of available alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies. Accepting this recommendation would limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's ability to implement the provisions of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that we replace ``of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the determination of noncompliance by'' with ``that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's provider agreement is terminated by'' at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.432(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amended language suggested by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter substantially alters the meaning of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, if accepted, would be contrary to the Act. Sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act permit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to continue payments pending remediation if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State, for Medicaid, and the facility, for Medicare, meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain criteria. If the State agency prefers alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies rather than termination and the criteria of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act are not met, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has no authority to make any payments to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility from the ``effective date of the findings,'' that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is, from the last day of the survey that found the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not in substantial compliance with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1819 (b), (c) or (d) or 1919 (b), (c) or (d) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, or both. If termination of a facility's provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement is sought, payments continue until the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of termination, which may not be more than 6 months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the last day of the survey. Substituting ``that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's provider agreement is terminated by'' would permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more payments to the State or the facility than the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows. In fact, such a policy would be no different than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-existing policies to stop Federal payments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of termination. For these reasons, we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not accepted this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter pointed out that &sect;488.432(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows continuation of payments for up to 6 months from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last day of survey. The commenter further stated that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA intends that the government can decide to give a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility less than 6 months of continued payments, HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should specify clear criteria in the regulations to guide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this decision. Because the proposed regulations do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain any such criteria, the commenter suggests that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delete the words ``up to.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are not accepting the commenter's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion, and we have not specified criteria as to when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA or the State would allow continued payments for less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 6 months. We do not want to in any way restrict HCFA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the State's ability to decide, on a case-by-case basis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the optimal amount of time for continuation of payment for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter offered alternative language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for &sect;488.432(d) to insert ``substantially'' before ``correct.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are accepting the spirit of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter's alternate language, and are revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated &sect;488.450 to say ``If the facility does not *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve substantial compliance''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Glaverbel in the red at six months GLAVERBEL, the Belgian glass manufacturer, blamed its first loss for more than a decade on the depth of the European recession, restructuring costs and recent 'competitive' currency devaluations within the European Community, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The group announced an operating loss of BFr665m (Dollars 19m) for the first half, further aggravated by the BFr1.09bn cost of restructuring US and Belgian operations. It recorded a net interim loss of BFr1.75bn against a profit of BFr673m in the first half of last year. Interim sales fell by more than 10 per cent to BFr15.44bn (BFr17.26bn). Mr Luc Willame, chief executive, said that excluding Glaverbec, the group's US subsidiary, sales had declined by 9 per cent.</p>

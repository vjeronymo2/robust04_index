			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Workers win claim on personal contracts THREE engineering workers who were denied pay rises of between Pounds 20 and Pounds 30 a week after refusing to sign personal contracts with Associated British Ports have won a discrimination claim against their employer. RMT, the transport union which represents the three dockers, is to press for the gap in earnings to be closed. It is to consider whether its members at other ABP ports should mount similar challenges. Although the decision of the Southampton tribunal does not set a precedent, it is likely to influence employers considering taking action similar to ABP's. The company said it was appealing. Last year a London tribunal made a similar ruling against Associated Newspapers in a case brought by a member of the National Union of Journalists at the Daily Mail who refused to sign a personal contract. The Southampton tribunal found that ABP had taken action short of dismissal contrary to section 23 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. It has yet to publish reasons for its decision. The case was brought after ABP offered its 170 dockers a pay rise in return for agreeing to individual contracts and more flexible working. Employees signing individual contracts relinquished all rights to union negotiation and representation. The three said they were prepared to work more flexibly but were not prepared to relinquish collective bargaining arrangements. Individuals agreeing to personal contracts received pay increases of 20 per cent. The three who rejected contracts were offered an 8.9 per cent rise through collective bargaining. As a result, the salary of the most senior of the three rose to Pounds 12,115, instead of the Pounds 13,650 he would have received on a personal contract. His overtime rate was also lower.</p>

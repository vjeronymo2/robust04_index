			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The new package of constitutional amendments have  been presented to the multiparty negotiating council in Kempton  Park by the government and the ANC [African National Congress],  who said the amendments were aimed at addressing the concerns of  the Freedom Alliance and enhancing the legitimacy of the interim  constitution. The tabled amendments confirm earlier versions of  the constitutional concessions announced last week. The  proposals include concessions on self-determination to address  right-wing demands for a volkstaat [homeland]. These are  supplemented by a proposal that a volkstaat council be  established by members of Parliament to pursue the concept of a  volkstaat after the election. No members of the Freedom  Alliance attended this morning's meeting of the negotiating  council. The concessions will also allow provinces to write  their own constitutions and to create their own legislative and  executive structures. A two-ballot system is also proposed.</p>

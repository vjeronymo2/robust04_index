			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Ziller: "Rexrodt Loosening Export </F> Controls"]    [Text] Bonn, 11 Apr -- FRG Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], wants to  "considerably" loosen the export controls for goods that can be  used both for civilian and military purposes (dual use). He  calls for reducing the list of countries for which a permit is  obligatory from the current 33 to only eight to 10.    Rexrodt's desire to reduce export controls takes the desire  of industry into account. At the moment there are 33 states on  the so-called Country List H; the fragmentation of Yugoslavia  has not yet been taken into account. On the fringes of a visit  to Egypt, Rexrodt had stated: "We will considerably shorten the  H List." He is inclined to reduce it to "eight to 10" states  and to also strike Egypt from this list. The FDP politician  pointed out that his "considerations" still require coordination  with his colleagues in the Cabinet.    The list contains nonallied countries that have not signed  the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, have biological or chemical  combat agents or carrier weapons, or are located in areas of  tension. The list includes, for instance, India, Brazil,  Argentina, China, Iraq, Iran, and many Arab states.    The background of the proposal is the necessary  harmonization  of export regulations within the European Union (EU). The  common single market forces coordinated dealing with the export  of such "dual-use goods," which are to be included in weapons  systems or are destined to the production of weapons. German  regulations are stricter than those abroad. A harmonization at  the high German level has been rejected by 10 EU countries.  Therefore, a regulation to permit Germany a stricter practice  is being discussed. The top associations of industry reject  solo action. A shortened country list could change that.    Following the negative worldwide headlines about the  participation of German companies in the construction of  poison-gas factories in Libya and Iraq, the liberal-conservative  coalition tightened the law. Since then, Article 5c of the  Foreign Economy Regulation says that the planned export of  dual-use goods must be approved by the Federal Export Office in  Eschborn, if the recipient is in a country that is on the H List  and the exporter knows that the goods are to be for a certain  purpose or are to be used for armament production. These  stipulations force German companies to ask their customers what  they intend to do with their goods. Industry considers this to  be a competitive disadvantage.    The number of 5c-cases is declining strongly. Last year, the  Federal Export Office rejected the export of goods with a total  value of 46 million German marks [DM] (the previous year DM50  million). According to information released by the office, the  export of dual-use goods to a value of DM71 million (previous  year DM220 million) that were to be used for armament purposes  was approved.</p>

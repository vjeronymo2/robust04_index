			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO DOFF A SUIT OF ARMOR;  </P> <P> PHYSICAL CULTURE BY HILLARY JOHNSON (POSEIDON PRESS: $16.95; 105 PP.;  0-671-67818-3)  </P> <P> "Physical Culture" is a novella about five days in the life of a middle-aged  man named John, the retiring accountant for a mattress factory in an  unidentified suburban town, who is an active masochist. John has a young  acquaintance named Stephan, a procurer, whom he knows from the "health" club  he's frequented in the city, Physical Culture. As the book unfolds, he also  develops a relationship with a young woman named Liann, an alcoholic who works  at the mattress factory and is the daughter of the woman he drives to work each  morning.  </P> <P> The novel is narrated in the first person by John, but, especially at the  beginning, it's an opaque, elliptical first-person, almost entirely preoccupied  with physical states and processes. In several sentences, for example, the  author assumes the narrative perspective of the male sexual organ, which, sans  sexual play, is something this reviewer can't remember seeing before in  expository prose.  </P> <P> This seems even more provocative in light of the fact that the author, Hillary  Johnson, as the publicity kit for "Physical Culture" announces with some pride,  is a 23-year-old woman born in Burbank, Calif., who now lives with her husband  in Portland, Ore., and Calcutta, India. If the author were a 45-year-old  ex-convict from Lompoc, would the reviewer have found the sentence more  plausible? Hopefully not. Still, there is an admirable boldness in this first  novel, which contains a grimly vivid portrait of the subterranean S&amp;M  world. John reports:  </P> <P> "The first person Stephan ever introduced me to was a man six-foot five, with  an orange beard that I remember distinctly because the hairs were twice as  thick as any human hair I had ever seen. They were curly, too -- tight, wide  curls. He took off my shirt and wrapped my upper body in barbed wire, under my  armpits and down my arms, then dressed me in a padded vest, a starched white  dress shirt, and evening jacket, and took me out dancing. . . .  </P> <P> "(Dancing) I could see little dimes, quarters, and pennies of blood fall to the  floor, as if through a hole in my pocket, and get scuffed into streaks by a  herd of feet."  </P> <P> At her best, Johnson commands a forceful, evocative prose ("a restaurant where  I can hear a whole flat of glasses shivering against each other in the  kitchen"), and she possesses a sure sense of how to play a scene for maximum  effect and then move on. As John and Liann, each with their separate shame,  grow closer, her touch is especially graceful, and these scenes, which might be  set into a far more conventional story, indicate a writer of real promise. On  the other hand, a stylistic "innovation" in which a line ends with a period  before the meaning is clear, and then is concluded in the first line of a new  paragraph, never grows into anything beyond distracting mannerism.  </P> <P> The jacket copy and several endorsements from writers promise a denouement that  will reveal the deeper personal reality that underlies John's masochism, and  it's certainly to Johnson's credit that she's written a novel on so  sensationalistic a subject that for the most part keeps its focus trained on  the minutely human, the quotidian. The emotional climax occurs when John allows  his naked body's visible history of abominations to be glimpsed by Stephan and  Liann, and finally, a little later, alone in front of a mirror, looks himself.  </P> <P> It's a powerful scene that promises further growth and change, but the book  begins to feel somewhat simplistic as it rounds into its final stretch. John  goes back in memory to being 9 years old in "a family full of wits and buffoons  and practical jokers enjoying the hideousness of the day. I wondered why my  body felt uncomfortable, as if I were clanking around in a suit of armor." Yes,  one wants to interject, welcome to the human race.  </P> <P> If physical pain can overwhelm emotional pain, Johnson indicates, then perhaps  the pain is less. Then too, there is the control exhibited in writing one's own  experience, decreeing the atrocities oneself. In the end, of course, it's a  closed circuit in which life, in any larger sense, has been edited out. What is  affecting in "Physical Culture" is that while John may have all but forgotten  it, even as he advances toward its graces, Hillary Johnson for the most part  keeps her eye steadily on that larger life.  </P></p>

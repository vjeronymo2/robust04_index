			<p>Involved   in Drug Trafficking   <F P=102> PA2605143594 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 24 May 94 p  1-10 </F>  <F P=103> PA2605143594 </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City LA JORNADA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Aponte and Gerado Rico] </F>   [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 23 May -- The new archbishop  of Guadalajara, Juan Sandoval Iniguez, said today that 40  percent of the personnel in the Attorney General Office's (PGR)  are "involved" in drug trafficking. This is why "no one has  gotten to the bottom" of the homicide of Cardinal Juan Jose  Posadas Ocampo and why the Arellano Felix brothers have not been  arrested.    He said that high-level PGR officials "told me" that they  are  not absolutely sure which Federal Judicial Police (PJF) agents  are trustworthy and honest, and which are linked to drug  trafficking.    This has complicated the capture of the Arellano Felix  brothers, chiefs of the Tijuana Cartel, "because when the police  are told that they are in a certain place by the time the police  get there they are already somewhere else." The police  themselves give them a heads-up, the archbishop said.    He said that the Catholic Church is not satisfied with the  results of the investigation because it has not gotten to the  bottom of the matter and the PGR has not arrested the real  killers.    There is no "room for percentages" in assessing how the  investigation is going, because we do not know who the real  killers are or their motives for the murder. The PGR has fought  drug trafficking, but "they have not had the answers" to  Cardinal Posadas' case.    In light of this, he said, Mexicans run the risk that  impunity "may become entrenched in our fatherland and that we  will end up with a violent society, a dangerous society," if the  homicides of Cardinal Posadas and Luis Donaldo Colosio are not  solved.    The archbishop called a news conference in the capitular  room  of the Archdiocese of Guadalajara on the day before the first  anniversary of the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.  Before beginning his remarks, he asked reporters from the  international, national, and local media to pray.    He then began: "We have always said that we still are not  satisfied, that the investigation has not gotten to the bottom  of the case, that we are not happy because no one has gotten to  the bottom of this since the real killers have not been  captured. All Mexicans wish--not just the Church--that  investigations will continue and that this crime will soon be  cleared up."    Question: What is your evaluation of the  authorities' behavior, especially that of the PGR?    Sandoval Iniguez: We have been in touch with  high-ranking PGR officials. They have assured me that they are  very interested in the investigation, that they are determined  to clear up the murder. In fact they want some assistance, some  of our help. This is why we have called on anyone who may have  some information... It could be that these people may supply  details that may have been misinterpreted by others.    "They face many difficulties on this road: first, because a  year has already passed and second, because all municipal,  state, or federal police forces in Mexico are either  contaminated a little or a lot. They were telling me, for  example, that 40 percent of the people who work for the PGR are  not to be trusted. They say that even they do not know who is  who; they do not know who the trustworthy and honest agents are.  They do not know who is involved with the drug traffickers or  with other groups who buy off these people's consciences.    "That is how the security forces are infiltrated and why  they  have people working there who are not trustworthy."    Question: Could this be blocking the  investigations?    Sandoval Iniguez: ...They (high-level PGR  officers) claim this is one of the reasons why this and other  investigations have not been wrapped up. They even told me that  when they go to arrest criminals, some people warn the criminals  in advance. When they arrive on the scene, the criminals are  gone. That could be one of the reasons.    The same is true of the Arellano Felix brothers, who escape  when they learn that authorities are coming after them. Drug  traffickers have plenty of money to corrupt and buy off people's  consciences and thus ward off any action against them, he said.    But the Catholic Church will not fight that kind of  corruption. There will be other ways for that. But it will not  stop insisting, as all citizens must, that the homicide should  be resolved even after the current six-year presidential term  ends, he added.    Surrounded by some of his aides in the room housing  paintings  of the archbishops of Guadalajara, Sandoval Iniguez recalled  that the president of the republic said the crime would be  solved and said that "he should be asked about it."    "I would also like to say in this forum that all society  should demand, each one of us must demand that justice be done.  A democratic country must not leave its hopes and dreams in the  hands of two or three people...this is a demand of all society,"  he said.    Question: Are we living in a country of  half-truths?    Sandoval Iniguez: I believe our truths are less  than half-truths. We can barely get to a half-truth, he said  ironically.    He mentioned that the PGR has not briefed the Archdiocese of  Guadalajara on the investigations since November 1993.    A journalist asked if he feared any possible reprisals for  his statements. The archbishop said: "I do not think I will be  the object of reprisals for what I am saying because I am not  offending or injuring anyone or telling lies."    Sandoval Iniguez said that on Tuesday, 24 May, the crypt  containing the remains of the late cardinal will be open from  1000 to 1800. During the evening, the archbishop will officiate  at a mass in memory of Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In paragraphs (f)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying various requirements regarding stability limitations for machines. Stability limitations of machines used in logging are determined by three factors: (1) load size; (2) what is done with the load when it is being handled; and (3) the physical environment in which the machine is being operated. These requirements address each of those factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (f)(2)(ii), OSHA is requiring that stationary logging machines and their components be anchored or otherwise stabilized to prevent movement during operation. The proposed standard contained a provision requiring that stability limitations of machines not be exceeded. The proposed standard also contained a provision specifying that truck and crawler mounted rigid boom cranes and other yarders meet the stability requirements of the ANSI B30.2&hyph;1983 ``Safety Code for Cranes, Derricks and Hoists_Overhead and Gantry Cranes'' or the ANSI B30.5&hyph;1982 ``Safety Code for Cranes, Derricks and Hoists_Crawler, Locomotive and Truck Cranes.'' The pulpwood logging standard required only that the operator be advised as to the stability limitations of the machine. Several commenters pointed out that machines referenced in those standards were not used for logging operations (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;25, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;67).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule OSHA has deleted reference to the ANSI standards because those machines are covered elsewhere in part 1910. Overhead cranes are covered in 29 CFR 1910.179 and mobile cranes are covered in 29 CFR 1910.180. OSHA believes that these standards adequately spell out the requirements for safe operation when operating cranes. OSHA finds nothing indicating that the use of cranes is different from the rest of general industry, therefore, the Agency does not believe a special provision is necessary to address the logging industry. In addition, most of the machines referenced in the ANSI standards, overhead and gantry cranes, crawlers locomotive cranes and truck cranes; either are not used or are infrequently used in logging operations covered by this standard. OSHA also has deleted the proposed provisions on reliability and stability of cranes for the same reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the rated capacity of any machine not be exceeded. As discussed above, OSHA has defined rated capacity as the maximum load a system, vehicle, machine or piece of equipment was designed to handle. This provision was not explicitly contained in the proposed standard. Rather, it was implied as part of the requirement that machine operators comply with the operating manuals or instructions. The pulpwood logging standard, however, did require that operators at least be advised about the load capacity of machines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that it is necessary to explicitly state this requirement in the final standard. When the rated capacity of the machine is exceeded, rollover and tipover accidents occur. As discussed above, many logging injuries and deaths are the result of machine rollover accidents. The State of Washington study showed that nine percent of the reported logging fatalities resulted from machine rollover accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;129). The OSHA FCI report also showed that 10 percent of fatalities were due to machine rollover accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;61). The Agency believes that it is not sufficient to merely inform operators of the machine's capacity, rather operators must be instructed that load capacities shall not be exceeded. As part of the training of machine operators, the operator also needs to be instructed on how to keep the load within the rated capacity and what foreseeable conditions or actions can affect the machine's rated capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stelian Damov: "Intercepting Political Traps, </F> the Opposition Declares War on the Scenario of the Ordinances"]    [Text]    -- Wishing to remain "uncommitted," the Left, supplementing  the tactic of stalling for time with political discussions at  Cotroceni Palace, is trying to sidestep Parliament in connection  with the approval of the IMF agreement, so as not to be forced  to give a clear "yes" or "no" to the economic reform envisaged  in this agreement.    -- The opposition refuses to give the government the  competence to adopt ordinances, seeking, instead of a  parliamentary recess, an extraordinary session for the open  discussion of the very issues in the area of which the Executive  claims to have authority. The draft law by which the government  seeks the authority to adopt ordinances during parliamentary  recesses has been the occasion for a new conflict.    -- Representatives of the opposition have withdrawn from the  Chamber of Deputies. The opposition does not think that this  authority should be given and has proposed that Parliament meet  in extraordinary session, as soon as 3 January 1994, to discuss,  in plenary session, all the regulations which the government  seeks the authority to issue. Nevertheless, the parliamentary  majority (based on the support of the forces on the left) really  wants a parliamentary recess. The real reason is not fatigue and  stress but a hidden reason, which our newspaper exposed long  ago: It wants the "approval" of the IMF agreement without going  through Parliament, even though the international organization  called for parliamentary approval. The political undertone is  very clear -- it is trying to avoid a strong "yes" or "no" from  the leftist forces. If they were to say "yes," then they could  be accused of being turncoats because the measures stipulated in  the IMF agreement are right-wing measures. This would mean an  ideological movement to the side of the opposition, despite the  fact that they "blew it" just this month in the vote on the  motion of censure against the government. If they say "no," this  means that they really do not support the government, which has  already signed the IMF agreement. It is impossible to resolve  this dilemma so the only solution is a "welcome Parliamentary  recess," during which all the responsibilities will rest with  the government, thereby absolving from responsibility the  political forces which support it.... This is only one problem.  More dangerous is the fact that it also affects things which  have nothing to do with the memorandum signed with the IMF. And  even things which are in conflict with this memorandum! For  example, the government wants to have the authority to:    -- modify the budget by sidestepping Parliament, which is  inadmissible;    -- carry out an operation (with tragic results for the  economy!) of total compensation for so-called arrears, without  the approval of Parliament. Thus, a concealed assumption by the  state of debts of bankrupt state enterprises which never could  be repaid. "By the state" actually means on the backs of the  people.    -- resume, through the back door, without transparency (a  study in opportuneness made available to Parliament),  investments in the nickel and cobalt combine in Cuba and a  thermoelectric power plant in the PRC;    -- attempt to provide legal basis for maintaining the  difference between wage increases and price increases;    -- contract for foreign credits, without mentioning the  sources (!), which, in the case of approval by Parliament, would  not be possible. If some of these things are necessary, it is  all right, but we should know about them also!</p>

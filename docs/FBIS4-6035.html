			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has again  proposed a grand national meeting that smacks of a mass rally in  an effort to solve inter-Korean problems.    The proposal was made by Supreme People's Assembly  (parliament) Speaker Yang Hyong-sop at a meeting of government  and political party leaders held in Pyongyang on April 11. Yang  offered to hold a grand national meeting in Seoul or Pyongyang  on Aug. 15, the 49th anniversary of Korea's liberation from  Japanese rule, to discuss ways of achieving grand national unity.    Among the big shots taking part in the April 11 meeting were  Premier Kang song-san, Vice Premier Kim Pyong-sik and Workers'  (Communist) Party Secretary Kim Yong-sun, to name but a few,  according to the official North Korea watcher here, NAEWOE press.    Yang also proposed that invitations be sent to leaders of  the  government, political parties and social organizations in South  Korea as well as well-known Koreans overseas asking them to come  to the grand national meeting.    The proposed meeting, in its style and agenda, is similar to  the all-Koreans' sessions the North Koreans have proposed in  their propaganda offensive against South Korea over the years.    Yang, saying the meeting should discuss achieving unity  among  all Koreans for national reunification, proposed the creation of  a preparatory committee comprising five figures apiece from  North and South Korea and overseas Korean communities.    Pyongyang's fresh offer on a grand national conference is  considered by many North Korea watchers here as an attempt to  renew its unification front scheme, with a view toward turning  its defensive position in inter-Korean relations to its  advantage.    Means of solving such inter-Korean problems as tension over  the nuclear issue must be discussed at government-level talks.  But the North Koreans want to hold an all-Koreans' meeting  smacking of a mass rally in an apparent move to confuse South  Korea, analysts say.    It should be pointed out that the proposal came after North  Korea ruptured the working-level inter-Korean dialogue on  exchanging special envoys by threatening to turn Seoul into "a  sea of flames" if war breaks out.    It should also be noted that whenever inter-Korean relations  reach an impasse, the North Koreans come up with a unification  front scheme disguised as an all-Koreans' meeting to change the  situation in their favor.    In May 1990, President Kim Il-song presented a five-point  unification program to the Supreme People's Assembly during its  plenary session. The program envisioned forming a unification  front, among other things, widely seen here as a scheme to cause  social confusion in a South Korea that was then in a fever for  unification.    And in April last year, North Korea's parliament adopted  President Kim Il-song's 10-point program for national  unification through grand unity, which also called for a  unification front.    The unification front scheme camouflages the North Korean  unification strategy to stir up revolution in South Korea. The  recent grand national conference proposal should be seen in the  context of this strategy because it came just a year after the  North Korean parliament adopted the 10-point unification  program. The proposal is thus seen by many analysts of North  Korean affairs here as a tactical variation of its unification  strategy.    The proposal may also be regarded as an attempt by the North  to solve its problems with the South and the United States over  the nuclear dispute, by seeking a consensus of all Koreans  around the world on the issue.    With the U.N. Security Council-set deadline for additional  inspections of its nuclear facilities approaching, North Korea  needs a breakthrough and the grand national meeting proposal may  be seen as a way out through unofficial dialogue with South  Korea.    Analysts say the North Koreans must feel the all-Koreans'  meeting will help solve the nuclear issue in their talks with  the Americans.    They observe that Pyongyang will intensify its propaganda  offensive against Seoul by publicizing its grand national  conference proposal.</p>

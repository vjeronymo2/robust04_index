			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (4): A particularly delicate phase - The Economy INDONESIA has moved from a centrally-controlled, bankrupt economy in the mid-1960s to a nation with a 20-year record of annual economic growth averaging more than 6 per cent. Attracted by a programme of economic deregulation, twice as much foreign investment has been approved in the past five years - more than Dollars 26bn - than in the preceding two decades. The country has benefited from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore which have perceived Indonesia, with its 183m population, as an investment opportunity. The political stability of the 'New Order' regime and the presence of western-trained government technocrats with at least one hand on the economic tiller, have engendered investor confidence. Despite these achievements, the jury is still out on the long-term success of the economy. Certain monuments to central control persist, such as the highly regulated sugar sector, and deregulation has sometimes meant little more than the transfer of a public monopoly to a private, politically-connected company. Serious infrastructural bottlenecks, such as a shortage of power and a grossly inadequate telephone system, threaten to restrict future growth. Bankers estimate Dollars 85bn of infrastructural investment is required by the turn of the century, but sources of finance remain uncertain. While Indonesia's great attraction is cheap labour - 2m people enter the employment market each year and annual per capita income is low at about Dollars 600 - there is a danger the country will become the mere repository of labour-intensive industries discarded by the newly-industrialised countries of the region. Of the 1992 budget of Rp56,100bn 59 per cent goes to routine expenditure, such as civil service salaries and debt servicing, and 41 per cent to development expenditure which includes infrastructure, education and health services. International donors, such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and western countries, are expected to provide Rp9,100bn toward this year's development budget. Budgeted oil and gas revenue assumes a price of Dollars 17 per barrel and is forecast at Rp13,900bn, down 7 per cent on 1991. The overall budget, however, is 11 per cent higher than last year and the extra revenue is to come from a 36 per cent increase in income tax revenue, and a 34 per cent rise in value-added tax receipts. Indonesia now has a more diverse economy than ever before. The role of oil and gas has fallen steeply in the past 10 years from 80 per cent to 39 per cent of export proceeds. The contribution of manufacturing was 14.9 per cent of GDP in 1990. Agriculture contributed 19.5 per cent. However, the world Bank estimates that manufacturing will soon overtake agriculture and by the year 2000 should contribute 22.8 per cent of GDP compared to 14.5 per cent for agriculture. Important export-oriented manufacturing industries include shoes, textiles and garments. The government's Investment Co-ordinating Board has approved more than 175 applications to build shoe factories with a total capacity of 600m shoes a year. Textile export earnings have risen from Dollars 806m in 1986 to Dollars 3.6bn last year. The country's non-oil and gas export drive has brought impressive results, with exports increasing from Dollars 6.5bn in 1986 to Dollars 17.56bn last year (itself an 18 per cent increase over 1990). The depth of Indonesia's agricultural and mining sector remains an important source of economic strength, despite generally low international commodity prices. In world rankings, Indonesia is in the top three producers of rubber, palm oil and coffee. It is among the world's largest exporters of shrimps and prawns. Exports of forest products totalled Dollars 3.35bn in 1990 and Indonesia is the world's leading producer of plywood. It is also an important producer of copper, nickel, tin and coal. But dreams of an economic 'take-off', the point where economists imagine growth becomes self-sustainable, received a knock last year when the government stepped in to cool an overheated economy. Money supply was tightened in February and ceilings on foreign borrowings were announced in October, as well as the postponement of up to Dollars 79bn worth of large-scale projects. The move was prompted by concern at Indonesia's public and private international debt, Dollars 50bn and Dollars 25bn respectively, which has grown 44 per cent in the past three years. A debt-service ratio of 31 per cent of export earnings - 24 per cent public and 7 per cent private - has led to a deteriorating current account deficit. The latter stood at Dollars 4.48bn last year but, government ministers concede, would have hit Dollars 8bn without immediate intervention. Donors are concerned at the level of debt and say that manufactured exports will need to rise 20 per cent a year for the next four years if the debt-service ratio is to be significantly reduced. They say that last year's government intervention to cool the economy should have come sooner. Bankers say the International Monetary Fund warned in early 1990 that, due to an explosion in bank credit, the economy was overheating. When the brakes were applied fully last September, a fantastic array of large projects had been lined up for government approval. These included 16 oil refining proposals worth more than Dollars 21.5bn and tabled for construction before 1996. The situation was an ugly reminder of the mid-1970s when debts built up by Pertamina, the state oil and gas company, threatened to scupper the economy. What appeared a firm government commitment to restrict borrowing has since been watered down with several postponed projects likely to go ahead, including the Dollars 2bn Exor-1 refinery and the Dollars 1.5bn Cilacap olefin plant. Others may proceed under foreign ownership, such as the Dollars 1.6bn Chandra Asri olefin plant and the Dollars 1bn Exor-3 refinery. Government ministers say loans raised by wholly foreign-owned projects will not count toward Indonesian debt, although the effect on the balance of payments will be the same as foreign loans raised by domestic companies. Donor agencies are concerned that projects supported by politically well-connected companies will proceed under the guise of foreign ownership and that a secondary debt, not recognised by government but serviced by the country's export proceeds, will be accumulated. Such a debt would undermine efforts at reducing the country's debt service ratio. It would also compound the adverse economic effect of other politically motivated decisions such as the granting in 1991 of a private monopoly for the buying and selling of cloves which last year cost the country about Dollars 350m. Donors forecast a slightly higher current account deficit of Dollars 4.8bn this year, increasing the country's reliance on aid from the donor community which will meet in Paris next month to discuss new commitments. Indonesia will be looking for at least as much as the Dollars 4.75bn committed by donors at their last meeting in March, 1991. Indeed, after 10 years of deregulation the economy is at a particularly delicate phase. Deregulation of the banking sector, of which the biggest tranche occured in 1988, led to a surge in the number of banks and a 122 per cent growth in credit between December, 1988 and the end of 1990. This restricted the government's ability to squeeze inflation which has risen from 6.2 per cent in 1989 to 9.2 per cent last year, although it is expected to fall to about eight per cent this year. The tightening of money supply in February 1991 sent bank lending rates to 30 per cent. Although money supply has since been relaxed, 12-month lending rates have remained relatively high at about 24 per cent, although deposit rates have fallen to 17 per cent. The higher cost of capital, combined with a relative downturn in export markets, has had a knock-on effect for companies. In the past year two companies, Bentoel and Mantrust, have defaulted on loans totalling Dollars 770m. Economists fear they may be joined by other groups which over-expanded when credit was easily available. At the very least companies, and the larger conglomerates in particular, will undergo a period of consolidation. The same applies to banks, many of which lent with poor, sometimes non-existent credit analysis. The seven state banks, which account for half the banking sector's assets, are in need of an immediate overhaul. Many banks in the private sector are little better off and a series of mergers is likely. A worst case scenario would see a string of company failures in the second half of the year exposing an ill-managed banking sector. But this would be to underestimate the ability of the government to manage what remains a dynamic, if volatile, economy. Most economists predict a continuation of a steady GDP growth of between 6 and 7 per cent, assisted by the coming on-stream of new export-oriented manufacturing capacity. Despite a significantly lower oil price, provisional total export revenue of Dollars 7.28bn for the first quarter of 1992 is down only 1.5 per cent on the same period of last year, reflecting continuing growth of non-oil and gas exports. Total imports for the period remained constant at Dollars 6.32bn. Equally, GDP growth of 6 per cent is unlikely to deliver the 'take-off' of which the optimists dream. Given the cost of infrastructural improvements, the uneven state of development in the archipelago and the flood of new labour, every step towards greater economic prosperity will be a hard-fought battle.</p>

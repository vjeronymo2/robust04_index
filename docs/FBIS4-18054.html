			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels 29 April TASS -- Russia and the European  Union have entered the home stretch in bilateral consultations  ahead of the signing of an agreement on partnership and  cooperation, Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin told  ITAR-TASS during a brief stopover in Brussels on his way from  back home from Washington.    Shokhin said a number of barriers have already been cleared,  but a final accord can be reached only after his meeting with  Deputy Chairman of the European Commission Leon Britten, during  which trade in enriched uranium will be discussed among other  things.    Russia has already tabled compromise versions which can be  finalised into an agreed upon text. If this is done, it would  be possible to initial the agreement before the end of June  while Greece is holding the chair in the European Union and sign  the agreement when Germany takes over.    Aleksandr Shokhin, the official head of the Russian  delegation which was conducting talks with the European Union in  Brussels, was appointed to represent Russia at the funeral of  the former U.S. President Richard Nixon and subsequently had to  cut short his stay in the Belgian capital to just one night.  His meeting with Leon Britten will take place in Moscow next  Sunday.    According to Shokhin, the preparation of the agreement with  the European Union took longer than expected because last autumn  in Russia, after President Yeltsin failed to attend the meeting  with the leaders of the EU countries in Copenhagen, rejected the  "lighter-weight" version of the accord proposed by the European  Union. That version was signed by Ukraine, whose economy was  described as "an economy with a state-run system of trade."  Russia continued to work towards greater benefits than those  provided for in the rejected version.    Speaking about his impressions from the trip to the United  States, where he led a delegation to a session of the  provisional committee of the International Monetary Fund and the  World Banks' development committee, Aleksandr Shokhin pointed to  an interesting peculiarity: These world financial organisations  are worried more by problems of security and crime than by  economic issues in Russia. It means that they no longer doubt  that Russia would pursue a normal economic policy and create a  favorable investment climate.    Shokhin also held a meeting in Washington with  representatives of the big seven. His previous meeting with  them in February was mainly in the nature of finding out more  about the situation in Russia, but in April "we got down to  business," Shokhin said. "We discussed the investment climate  and soliciting investments." The gathering also discussed  questions relating to the forthcoming G-7 Summit in naples.  During the funeral of ex-President Richard Nixon, the Russian  vice-premier had a conversation with President Bill Clinton, who  said Russia would not have any particular problems concerning  its participation in the "political Group of Seven." Problems  remain concerning the economic format, and these problems must  be discussed. The G-7 leaders are prepared to expand the agenda  of their meeting in Naples, and Russia proposed discussing not  only financial support of economic reforms but also global  economic problems in the solution to which Russia is interested  and can actually contribute. One is the creation of a  non-discriminatory trade order. Along with this the  normalisation of the situation on the commodity markets calls  for working out measures, on a multilateral basis and with the  participation of Russia, to take due account of mutual interests  of parties involved.    As concerns negotiations with the Paris Club, it was agreed  that in late May or early June it would consider a variant of  agreement with Russia for 1994 (the four-month extension of the  terms of the accord for 1993 is now in effect).    In the International Monetary Fund, Russia continues to work  in favour of the initiative calling for the additional issuance  of the fund currency (special borrowing rights giving access to  these resources to Russia and other countries, which did not  take part in the distribution of these funds earlier. If the  unfair approach is removed, Russia and other Commonwealth, east  and west European countries will be able to get about one  billion dollars.    Russia is working towards partnership relations in handling  with universal problems, it is not just asking for help but is  upholding universal rules with the help of which both Russia and  others can benefit. "This will be our leit-motif in contacts  with the Group of Seven and international financial  organisations," Shokhin stressed. "It is not aid in exchange for  reforms that we want, we want to create universal mechanisms of  partner interaction."</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sales at Nestle hit by strong Swiss franc Nestle, the world's largest foods group, said sales in the first nine months were down 1.5 per cent to SFr45.9bn (Dollars 35bn), mainly because of the strength of the Swiss franc. However, Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman, forecast an increase in net income for the full year, partly attributable to extraordinary gains, and further increases in sales and profit in 1995. Nestle's sales volume rose 2.8 per cent in the first 10 months, well below its 4 per cent target. Mr Maucher said the recession in Europe had affected important markets such as France, Spain and Germany. Acquisitions added 2.1 per cent to the value of sales and price increases a further 1.7 per cent. However, the effects of the exchange rate knocked off 6.9 per cent, and a change in accounting for sales in inflation-hit Brazil shaved off a further 1.2 per cent. The group will record a SFr620m after-tax profit this year on the sales of its interests in distributors of the French cosmetics group L'Oreal. Mr Reto Domeniconi, finance director, said SFr320m would appear as an extraordinary gain and the remainder would be transferred directly to the balance sheet. Mr Maucher said two-thirds of sales growth in the past decade had come from acquisitions, but he foresaw a reversal of the pattern as sales from subsidiaries in developing countries expanded. Capital spending was likely to be flat this year at SFr3.1bn. The group recently announced some 2,000 redundancies at three sites in the UK. Mr Ramon Masip, chief operating officer, said the cuts were 'all that are foreseen in this country for the next few years'. Mr Maucher said yesterday Nestle was interested in buying the European petfood activities of US breakfast cereal manufacturer Quaker Oats.</p>

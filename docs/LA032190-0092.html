			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS;  </P> <P> SO WHAT'S THE HURRY? ONLY 8 PLAYERS ATTEND FIRST REGULAR WORKOUT  </P> <P> Those spirited, champing-at-the-bit Dodgers charged into the official opening  of spring training Tuesday.  </P> <P> All eight of them.  </P> <P> "There's more writers here than players," observed pitcher Orel Hershiser, one  of the handful of Dodgers on the major league roster to show up for Tuesday  morning's first regular workout after the owners' 32-day lockout.  </P> <P> On a day when many major league clubs welcomed 20 or more impatient players --  opening-day opponent San Diego had 29 -- the Dodgers couldn't even field a  team. Batting practice consisted of three hitters. The pitchers threw one at a  time. During morning calisthenics, there were more photographers stretching  than players, perhaps explaining why Hershiser tackled one.  </P> <P> "I expected a few more people here," Hershiser said, and he was not alone.  </P> <P> If official projections are true that just 10 more Dodgers will arrive in time  for today's workout, with most of the remaining players planning to begin  workouts Thursday, the Dodgers will effectively have two fewer days of spring  training than most teams. Most years, that would be no big deal. This year,  with just 20 spring training days available, it's different.  </P> <P> Excusing the few Dodgers who live on the West Coast and must spend a day  traveling here, could it be that the rest of them did not know about the end of  the lockout?  </P> <P> "I called a lot of people when the lockout ended, but I got a lot of answering  machines," said Hershiser, who lives in Vero Beach. "And I thought I was tough  to get ahold of."  </P> <P> But he added: "I do understand how a lot of guys have family problems; they  have to get packed and pay bills and take care of all their stuff for the  summer. It's hard for some people, sure."  </P> <P> Hershiser was joined by pitchers Ray Searage, Zak Shinall, Mike Hartley and  Mike Maddux. Also in attendance were first baseman Eddie Murray, infielder  Lenny Harris and catcher Rick Dempsey. Two other members of the 38-man major  league roster appeared later in the afternoon, pitchers Dan Opperman and Pat  Perry.  </P> <P> The players were greeted with the usual hugs and headlocks and shouts by  Manager Tom Lasorda, who clearly could have used more company.  </P> <P> "It's not fair to compare anyone to me," Lasorda said, when asked if he was  among the first players at camp in his playing days. "But I would have been  here today."  </P> <P> Some of the absent players said their reasons have nothing to do with  enthusiasm, but logistics.  </P> <P> "I've got to close up my house for the summer in one day?" Jeff Hamilton asked  late Sunday from his Phoenix area home. "I can't do that, and I can't always be  leaving my wife alone to do it. I've got to take care of business; I can't just  throw stuff in suitcases and go. (The owners) keep us out so long, they have to  understand that."  </P> <P> Hershiser sighed. "There is going to be residue from the lockout," he said.  "There is going to be a fallout."  </P> <P> The Dodgers spent most of Tuesday addressing that fallout, figuring out  everything from exhibition games to pitching rotations. A summary:  </P> <P>  -- The Freeway Series will be held one week later than scheduled, with a  change in locations. The Dodgers and the Angels will play at Anaheim Stadium on  Friday, April 6, at 7:30 p.m., then move to Dodger Stadium for games on April 7  at 7 p.m. and April 8 at 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Tickets for the originally scheduled March 30 game will be honored for the  April 8 game. Tickets for the March 31 game will be honored for the April 7  game. Either ticket can also be refunded or exchanged for tickets to any game  during the 1990 season. Tickets for the April 1 game had not been printed.  </P> <P>  -- The exhibition season will begin next Monday against the Minnesota Twins at  Orlando, Fla. It will continue with one game a day until the Dodgers break camp  after an April 4 game against the Montreal Expos and return to Los Angeles for  an April 5 Dodger Stadium workout before the Freeway Series.  </P> <P>  -- There is a chance that the Dodgers will open the season on April 9 at  Dodger Stadium against the Padres before going to San Diego for a three-game  series. The date, previously an off day, was awaiting approval from the league  office.  </P> <P>  -- Ron Perranoski, Dodger pitching coach, hopes his starting pitchers will be  able to go four innings on opening day, with two starters pitching each game  until they can get stronger. This type of rotation would require six starting  pitchers, meaning that Mike Morgan would at least begin the season as a  starter, along with Hershiser, Tim Belcher, Fernando Valenzuela, Ramon Martinez  and John Wetteland.  </P> <P> The pitchers' biggest problem, according to Hershiser, could be not in their  arms, but in their heads.  </P> <P> "It's one thing to be careful in spring training, it's another thing to listen  to your body when you are pitching in front of 50,000 people in a big league  park and the adrenaline is hitting you," he said. "That's why that  three-innings-for-a-win rule is so good. If they didn't have that, I could see  guys going four innings, feeling good, trying to push it to five innings so  they could get a win, and then getting hurt."  </P></p>

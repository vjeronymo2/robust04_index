The idea of inevitability of the frustration of the  imperialists' anti-socialist moves and necessity of the victory  of socialism, which was elucidated by the great leader in his  New Year address, serves as an inspiring banner in smashing the  manoeuvres of the imperialists and vigorously struggling for the  accomplishment of the socialist cause, NODONG SINMUN today in a  by-lined article says, and goes on:    As in the past, so in the future, too, the anti-socialist  moves of the imperialists are bound to go bankrupt. This is  because the old cannot defeat the new, first of all.    The imperialists' moves to arrest the development of  socialism and obliterate it are an anti-historic scheme contrary  to the law governing historic development and, accordingly, it  is axiomatic that it cannot be realized.    In view of the course of the development of human history,  capitalism, the old one going against historic development, is  bound to give way to an advanced socialism as a slave society  gave way to a feudal society and the latter to a capitalist  society.    The moves of the imperialists to block the development of  socialism and stifle it cannot but meet a strong counter-attack  of the popular masses as they are anti-popular and against  history.    The struggle for socialism is the cause to realise the  aspirations and demand of the popular masses to live and develop  independently as full-fledged masters of the state and society  freed from all manner of exploitation and oppression.    The plot of the imperialists to block the development of  socialism and restore capitalism is bound to fail in face of the  rejection and protest of the popular masses.    The more viciously the imperialists pursue anti-socialist  strategy, the more vigorously the popular masses will struggle  against them, strengthening unity and solidarity.    Socialism is sure to win victory in the struggle against  capitalism thanks to the active support and struggle of the  popular masses. It is because socialism, an idea conforming  with the independent nature of the popular masses and the  requirement of social development, is daily growing in strength  with the positive support of the popular masses who are an  overwhelming majority of society.</p>

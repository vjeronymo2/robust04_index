			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Customs charter to cut costs BUSINESSES paying excise and Customs duties can expect their costs of compliance to fall and the efficiency with which claims are processed to increase under a charter launched yesterday by Customs and Excise. The Excise and Inland Customs Charter and the Value Added Tax Traders' Charter both lay down a number of measures to improve the speed and efficiency with which claims and inquiries are handled. Achievements against the targets will be published in the Customs annual report and there will be regular market research to help to improve the quality of service. The two new charters add to the framework established in the Taxpayers' Charter published jointly with the Inland Revenue last year. Sir Brian Unwin, chairman of Customs and Excise, said: 'There is enormous emphasis on reducing the burdens on business and a renewed commitment to reducing compliance costs. 'The biggest challenge is simplification,' he said. 'Traditionally we have had a confrontational culture,' he continued. 'We are trying to change to emphasis to being service-oriented.' However, the charters were criticised by the National Union of Civil and Public Servants and the Civil and Public Servants Association for not going far enough and for failing to set out service standards for the taxpayer. The unions said the VAT standard charter did not address service standards, and that the government had both reduced the number of VAT staff and cut the number of visits they paid to taxpayers. The VAT charter says that staff will wear name badges, be polite and considerate and send a written reply of any correspondance received. It emphasises that officials will show if tax due has been over-declared as well as under-declared. The Excise and Inland Customs Charter says the agency is committed to reducing the costs to business of complying with the requirements. It says local offices will also set out their own service-related objectives. Customs expects to have by November the findings of a market survey of travellers. It is commissioning another to survey excise and inland customers shortly, and plans another on VAT traders for next year.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RELIGION;  </P> <P> CURB DISSENT, THEOLOGIANS TOLD  </P> <P> The Vatican said today that open dissent cannot be tolerated and ordered  theologians to refrain from publicly challenging church teaching.  </P> <P> A major document issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith  replied in strong terms to Western theologians who have questioned the Roman  Catholic Church's ban on artificial birth control, stand on papal authority and  other issues.  </P> <P> "To succumb to the temptation of dissent . . . is to allow the leaven of  infidelity to the Holy Spirit to start to work," said the report, approved by  Pope John Paul II.  </P> <P> The document defended punitive action taken against dissidents and said  theologians must adhere to doctrine whether it is infallible or not. It  rejected the notion that the church should leave moral and sexual matters to  personal choice or conscience.  </P> <P> It warned dissenters against making their complaints in the media or trying to  influence public opinion.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KELLY MCGILLIS QUITS SHAKESPEARE TO HAVE BABY  </P> <P> Kelly McGillis, the Hollywood actress who put her film career on the back  burner to give a year's commitment to Shakespeare will leave the company at the  end of next week because she's expecting a baby.  </P> <P> McGillis, who is two months pregnant, has been advised by doctors not to work  during her term. Taking a hiatus from her film career, she is now starring in  the Shakespeare Theatre at the Folger's sold-out production of "Twelfth Night,"  which has garnered rave reviews. McGillis had signed a "seasonal" contract with  the theater through June but has been released from it.  </P> <P> McGillis, 31, who has been in such films as "Witness," "Top Gun" and "The  Accused," was set to play lead roles in "Mary Stuart" in February and "The  Merry Wives of Windsor" in April at the Shakespeare Theatre.  </P> <P> "I will miss everyone a lot, but some things are bigger than theater, like  taking care of another life," said McGillis this week. "I don't like having  things undone, but at the same time I am happy to be pregnant."  </P> <P> But she said she has regrets about leaving so soon after her much-publicized  move to the theater from California, considered risky for a top-grossing screen  star. "The reviews have been very nice, and I love the intimacy of playing  before a live audience, because you can't lie as an actress," McGillis said of  her current role.  </P> <P> McGillis, who married yacht broker Fred Tillman last year, declined to comment  on possible medical complications. She will finish the run of "Twelfth Night"  -- it closes Nov. 19 -- and then will return to Los Angeles in December.  </P></p>

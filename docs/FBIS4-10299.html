			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricia Uribe from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The peace process ended today in Flor del Monte,  Sucre Department, when members of the Socialist Renewal Movement  [CRS] -- a dissident faction of the National Liberation Army --  turned over their weapons to the government minister and the  presidential peace adviser.    Beginning today, more than 400 CRS guerrillas will lay down  their weapons and join in a new sociopolitical movement. Those  present at the ceremony included government representatives,  ambassadors, and, for the first time in the peace process,  international observers from the Netherlands. These 400 rebels  will turn over their weapons, some of which will be smelted and  others thrown into the sea. The two sides today agreed that 300  weapons will be turned over, even though a document being  finalized by the CRS states there are 450 weapons. One of the  important points agreed to between the government and the CRS  has to do with legal benefits.    [Begin unidentified official recording] Pardons for  kidnappers have been ruled out. We believe kidnapping is a  crime that cannot be justified, not even for political ends.  [end recording]    Meanwhile, according the CRS leadership, this process should  provide an example to the CNGSB [Simon Bolivar National  Guerrilla Coordinating Board]. A verification commission  comprising government and CRS representatives and international  observers will verify compliance with the peace agreement every  four months.    The signing of the peace agreement makes the CRS the fourth  rebel group that Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo has  convinced to join civilian life during his administration.</p>

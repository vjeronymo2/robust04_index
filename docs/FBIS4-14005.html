			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA) -- An official source in the  Arab League has stated that the League's Secretariat is awaiting  the member states' response to the Libyan request to hold an  emergency meeting of the foreign and defense ministers council.    The official explained that holding the meeting requires the  consent of 12 Arab states. However, he added, if two states  agree within 30 days of the request, the meeting will be held at  the level of permanent delegates.    Libya called that extraordinary meeting to discuss the U.S.  sophisticated weapons deal to Israel, in addition to other  topics.</p>

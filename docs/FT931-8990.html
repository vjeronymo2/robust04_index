			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Brussels split over curb on cheap steel imports from E Europe THE EC's trade and industry commissioners are split on how much protection to offer the Community steel industry from cheap east European imports. Sir Leon Brittan, responsible for external trade, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, will try to settle their differences at today's meeting of the European Commission, which will decide outline plans of commercial and financial support to end the EC steel crisis. The plan, which will be discussed at a special meeting of EC industry ministers next week, pits the Community's desire to save its steelmakers against its new policy of freer trade with struggling east European economies. Mr Bangemann warned that without a strong support package, as many as four or five leading Community steel-makers could go bust. But Sir Leon is worried that overreacting to manufacturers' demands for protection against non-EC imports could undermine existing free trade agreements with east European countries. EC steelmakers are complaining that a comparatively small volume of cheap steel imported from the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland has dragged down the EC market price, adding to problems caused by overcapacity and the sluggish economy. 'The present price level is disastrous for everybody,' Mr Bangemann said yesterday. He wants central and east European governments to impose minimum prices on exports over three years. If the countries breached those price levels the EC would impose anti-dumping duties on steel imports. Sir Leon is likely to insist that any safe-guard arrangements should be reviewed after a year. Commissioners will also consider extending volume restrictions on Czech steel imports to other east European countries. Sir Leon has already proposed amending the Czech restrictions to allow a greater volume of imports but harsher tariffs if limits are exceeded.</p>

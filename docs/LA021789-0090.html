			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WROLD  </P> <P> The leader of Colombia's most active leftist guerrilla group asserted that  insurgent groups control one-fourth of that Latin American nation. The claim  was made in a letter to former President Alfonso Lopez Michelson from Manuel  Perez, a former Roman Catholic priest who commands the National Liberation  Army. The letter, published in several Colombian newspapers, was received by  Lopez on the same day earlier this week that Perez's guerrillas reportedly  ambushed two river boats in northern Colombia, provoking a clash that killed 10  servicemen and 20 guerrillas.  </P></p>

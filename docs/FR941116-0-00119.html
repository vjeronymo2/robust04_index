The penalty per bushel for discrepancies will be the higher of the target price for the commodity or 1.5 times the market price for the commodity on the date of the inaccurate report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Example: corn target price = $3.00; market price on date of report = $2.90 per bu.; excess bushels of corn = 300 bu.; therefore, $3.00 times 300 bu. = $900.00.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers on a farm who are participating in an ARP or a land diversion program may market, barter, or use excess wheat or feed grains in a year subsequent to the year they were produced, in an amount that reflects what would be expected to be produced on acreage that the producers agree to devote to approved conservation uses (in excess of any acreage reduction or land diversion requirements) during a crop year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total current year production from enrolled wheat and feed grain crops shall be eligible for nonrecourse loans and entry into the farmer owned reserve (FOR) if the FOR becomes available.

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Sappi proposes Dollars 250m offering SAPPI, the South African pulp and paper company, plans to raise about Dollars 250m through share issues on the London, Paris and Frankfurt stock markets. The offer, the largest by a South African company since trade and investment sanctions were lifted, will go ahead in June. Gencor, one of South Africa's largest conglomerates and owner of a controlling interest in Sappi, will underwrite the issue for up to the South African rand equivalent of Dollars 115m. The offer will be partly used to finance Sappi's DM396.5m (Dollars 240.30m) acquisition of 90 per cent of Hannover Papier, a German fine paper group. Hannover had existing obligations of DM370m at the end of last year. The acquisition is part of Sappi's strategy of reducing its dependency on the South African market, Mr Eugene Van As, executive chairman, said. The group wants to move increasingly into European high-margin specialty papers, but this would be impossible without closer links to customers, he says. Sappi expects about half the shares to be taken up in South Africa and half in Europe. US investors may be put off by the continuing sanctions imposed by 13 states and 74 municipalities. The consequent losses in those markets may be greater than potential gains of doing business with South Africa. The issue is being lead-managed by SG Warburg.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: IMI shows 9% decline as recession bites - Shares drop 19p as margins in metals operations remain under pressure THE STOCK market yesterday cut more than 7 per cent from the value of IMI following the announcement of a 9 per cent reduction in interim profits. The diversified engineering group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 36.5m in the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 40.1m, as it continued to wrestle with trading losses on its titanium and copper alloy tube operations and sought rationalisation of its fluid power division. In a generally weak market, the shares lost 19p to 228p, reversing gains in the period shortly before the announcement, and reducing the group's market value to Pounds 742m. The profit outcome reflected the problems of the UK recession. Domestic sales accounted for 50 per cent of turnover of Pounds 515m (Pounds 496m), but the UK was the only geographical area where sales were lower than in the 1991 first half. Trading profit held up at Pounds 40.9m (Pounds 42.6m), supported by contributions from companies acquired in 1991. The drinks dispense business remained strong internationally, producing a rise in trading profits. The building products division held steady, sustained by strong demand for copper plumbing equipment in east Germany. However, markets for fluid power products were sluggish. The group has spent Pounds 3m rationalising plants and reorganising a business which in recent years has grown rapidly. 'The metals area had a very rough time,' said Mr Gary Allen, chief executive. Titanium selling prices have been low, battering margins, IMI's titanium operations should break-even by the end of the year, he said. Orders have been coming in and Rolls-Royce, the aero engine manufacturer, which is IMI's largest customer, has evidently finished its de-stocking. Difficulties with copper alloy tube are likely to take longer to resolve. There is a worldwide excess of capacity and Mr Allen did not expect break-even point to be reached this year. The group has been attacking the costs of these and other operations. Some 600 jobs were lost in the first six months of the year, half of them in the UK, and more could be lost in the current half. There have, however, been 300 recruitments in the drink dispense sector. Although the group noticed a pick-up in its US businesses, the relative optimism it exhibited about prospects for the UK economy at the annual meeting last April has evaporated and there is little hope of any recovery this year. Although order books have not slimmed further, 'there is a sense of disillusionment which puts a freezer on confidence,' Mr Allen said. The interim dividend is maintained at 4.2p, covered 1.7 times by earnings per share of 7.3p (8.1p). See Lex</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS TELL PROPOSAL FOR RENEWAL OF PLAZA  </P> <P> Anaheim residents and business owners have been given their first glimpse of  the city's proposal to redevelop Anaheim Plaza and surrounding retail and  industrial areas.  </P> <P> About 25 people came to the city's first workshop, held at the Anaheim Family  YMCA on Thursday, to hear plans to bring new life to the Plaza area. The plans  have yet to be finalized, but officials said no residential areas would be  included in the redevelopment project.  </P> <P> City officials hope redevelopment will boost retail activity in and around the  Anaheim Plaza, which has been losing stores and customers for the past several  years.  </P> <P> A consultant recommended last year that the city use its redevelopment  authority to lure businesses back into the area. Redevelopment allows the city  to use a higher share of property taxes to upgrade an economically blighted  area.  </P> <P> The proposed area to be redeveloped includes Anaheim Plaza, a nearby industrial  area bounded by Lincoln and Euclid avenues, the Santa Ana Freeway and Crescent  Way, and surrounding areas.  </P> <P> Additional public workshops and hearings will be held in the coming months to  help establish how the area will be redeveloped. For one merchant, it will not  happen soon enough.  </P> <P> "We're sitting here losing stores, losing retailers and losing customers," said  Chuck Cooper, 58, owner of the Hickory Farms stores at Anaheim Plaza.  </P></p>

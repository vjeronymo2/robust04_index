[Mamedov] Their conversation was conducted behind closed  doors, and the only exception was made for Ostankino TV company  correspondents. Judging from the large number of cigarette ends  [video shows full ashtray], the conversation was far from easy.  After all, many problems have accumulated over the six years of  confrontation. All the more encouraging that both men say the  meeting was very important, and moreover, positive.    [Guliyev] We have reached common understanding that all the  territories of Azerbaijan have to be freed. We have reached a  common view that some kind of buffer zone has to be created, and  that observers with an international status have to be placed  there. We have reached a view that after the freeing of the  territory of Azerbaijan, the opening of communications and other  things, we have to sit at the negotiating table and determine  the status of Nagorno- Karabakh.    [Ararktsyan] Our conversation today [as received] was very  brief, but on very important issues myself and Mr. Guliyev, and  I hope also the leaderships of our two states in general, have  some constructive and fruitful approaches, which, I hope, will  be put into practice.</p>

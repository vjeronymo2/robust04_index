			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS' QUINN, SEGOTA TO MISS TRIP  </P> <P> As if things weren't bad enough for the slumping Sockers (14-20), midfielders  Brian Quinn and Branko Segota won't make the trip for Wednesday's game with the  Dallas Sidekicks, Socker President Ron Cady said Monday.  </P> <P> Segota, who may be out as long as two weeks, suffered a groin strain during  Saturday's 6-1 loss to St. Louis, and Quinn is still recovering from a groin  injury suffered more than a week ago.  </P> <P> "I'm getting used to bad news now," said Socker Coach Ron Newman, who said  forwards Steve Zungul (arthritic hips) and Damir Haramina (right hamstring)  will also not make the trip. "I'm just taking every player that's left." DON  PATTERSON  </P></p>

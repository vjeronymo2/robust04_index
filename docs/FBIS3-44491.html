Yao Kaiwen  and Gao Xiaoliang were found guilty of "organising and leading a  counter- revolutionary group" by the Shanghai Intermediate Court  on December 23.    Meanwhile the authorities have released Yang Zhou, a member  of the Beijing-based peace charter movement after detaining him  without charge for 45 days in a centre for tramps and migrant  workers.    Sources in Shanghai said last night Yao, 53, a former  teacher, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and deprivation of  "political rights" for three years. Gao, 28, a former worker,  got a nine-year jail term in addition to a two-year suspension  of his rights.    The verdict said the two, who were detained last May, had in  late 1992 organised a counter-revolutionary ring called the  Mainland Headquarters of the Democratic China Front. A third  organiser of the group, Yao Tiansheng, was released last  September after a four- month detention.    The three-page verdict reportedly said that last September,  Yao Kaiwen drafted a 10-point manifesto whose aim was "ending  the dictatorial rule of the communist regime". The manifesto  allegedly said the front was ready to take "peaceful and bloody,  legal and illegal, domestic and foreign-aided actions" to  further their goals of promoting democracy.    Prosecution authorities in Shanghai also accused Gao and the  two Yaos of hatching an "anti-government" plot while meeting in  a small local park last November. The trio reportedly discussed  an action plan which included street demonstrations, forming  brigades of workers, occupying radio and TV stations, and  detaining municipal party and government leaders.    The verdict said: The three were the "core organisers" of  the front and that "they had decided upon their division of  labour". It also said the group had mapped out plans to publish  an illegal journal called Free China.    Summing up the Government's case, court officials claimed  that the accused had admitted their actions, which amounted to  "attempts to topple the administration of the people's  democratic dictatorship as well as the socialist order". They  said the heavy sentences were called for because the two had  committed their "crimes" less than three years after being  released from re-education through labour camps.    Yao Kaiwen, who was an individual entrepreneur upon his  detention, spent 18 months in a labour camp after having been  found guilty in early 1990 of trying to smuggle himself out of  China. And Gao, who used to work at a pharmaceutical factory,  was given a two-year term in August 1989 for taking part in the  pro-democracy movement.    Members of China's dissident community said last night they  were shocked by the severity of the sentences. Friends of Gao  and Yao said they belonged to the relatively radical fringe of  the democracy movement. "There is no evidence to suggest the  front has ever had more than four or five active members," a  Shanghai source said. "That adherents of the front do not seem  to have ruled out acts of violence in their theoretical  discussions does not mean they will actually commit them." The  source added that even if accusations made by the prosecution  were true, the punishment was severe because the organisation  had never put their ideas into action.    Meanwhile, on New Year's Eve, authorities in Shanghai freed  Mr. Yang, one of nine dissidents who put down their names to a  draft of the peace charter released in Beijing on November 14.  The so-called peace charter movement espouses "national  reconciliation" through a non-violent campaign for a multi-party  system.    Mr. Yang, whose activism dates to the late 1970s, was  detained by Beijing police hours after the release of the  document. The dissident was held in a centre for tramps and  transients in Beijing until December 5, when he was taken under  guard to a similar facility in Shanghai. However, another  signatory of the charter, Wuhan-based activist Qin Yongmin, who  was arrested together with Mr. Yang, is believed to be detained  in the central China city.    Mr. Yang, who said he lost a tooth and a few kilograms  during  his ordeal, said it was illegal for the authorities to hold him  in a centre for illegal migrant workers. "I had no recourse to  the judicial process and I was not allowed to contact my  family," he said in his Shanghai apartment yesterday. Mr. Yang  said he would continue his non-violent campaign for democracy,  warning that Beijing's continued refusal to tolerate the  peaceful expression of dissent could spawn acts of violence by  more radical factions of the movement.</p>

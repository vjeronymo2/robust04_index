			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HURTS BAD,' SAYS FATHER OF HEART RECIPIENT WHO DIED  </P> <P> The father of a teen-ager who died unexpectedly earlier in the week, three  years after receiving the heart of a young admirer, said Thursday that he knows  now what the donor's family went through.  </P> <P> "When you walk in and see your daughter dead, it hurts bad," said Raymond  Ashlock on the eve of the funeral of his daughter, Donna.  </P> <P> Donna, who would have been 18 on April 1, was found dead in bed by Ashlock.  </P> <P> "It was a shock," he said. "There were no signs of her being sick."  </P> <P> Hospital officials said that the death apparently occurred as a result of  irregular beating of the heart, a common complication in heart transplants.  Donna had experienced some rejection of the heart and was awaiting a second  transplant.  </P> <P> Ashlock said his daughter would not have lived the last three years without the  heart she received from high school classmate and admirer, Felipe Garza.  </P></p>

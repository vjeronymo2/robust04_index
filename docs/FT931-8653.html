			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Fantastic' without fantasy - London concerts on the South Bank At the end of a piece, the conductor Zubin Mehta likes to swing straight round to the audience even while the last chord resounds, with uplifted arms that mean something like 'Hey, WOW]] - yeah?' (We have to remember his 13 years with the New York Philharmonic.) He did it after his Berlioz Symphonie fantastique with the London Philharmonic at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday, and drew an instant 'Bravo]' from a voice in the usual place: rear right in the Terrace. Though there was some modest justification for that, there had been none earlier, at the close of the same composer's Beatrice and Benedict overture. The 'caprice written with the point of a needle', as Berlioz put it himself, was remarkable chiefly for the cautious tempo Mehta chose for the main material (almost unaccented, certainly without any glint of embattled wit) and the leaden glumness of the 'romantic' episodes. If one wanted to have Berlioz condemned to programme-filler status, a performance like this would reinforce the cause. The 'Fantastic' was better, but only by a few public degrees. Mehta engineered a thoroughly professional reading. There were stage-explosions in the right places, and they were properly led up to by purposeful developments - extrovert, candid, muscular. At the subcutaneous level, nothing happened at all. Berlioz's most original strengths can be detected only beyond the literal notes; here, hardly anything of his tremulous confessional vein, his sudden catches of breath or his abrupt violence made itself felt - just bold colours and professional energy. Not at all bad, but not very good: the visionary aspect of the score was reduced to newsprint photos. In Bartok's 2nd Piano Concerto there were more penetrating flashes, thanks entirely to Andras Schiff's account of the solo part. They were mostly confined to the lyrical piano intermezzi, however, on which he lavished quirkily elegant insights. In the rougher music Schiff's lack of percussive conviction, of forceful rhetoric, left him an easy prey to the devouring orchestra. In fact the LPO sounded raw, much less well rehearsed than for the 'Fantastic'. For the central Adagio the hazy, muted strings and timpani were evocative enough, but in the bright outer movements the whole band never achieved the leanness and tautness that the music demands. I had to put on the Philips recording, by Zoltan Kocsis and Ivan Fischer with the Budapest Festival Orchestra, to remind myself how much more is invested in Bartok's score.

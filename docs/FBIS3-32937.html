			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez] </F>   [Text] Communiques signed by the "Central Committee of the  Communist Party of Peru" (Shining Path) [PCP-SL] are similar to  the contents of the document published by LA REPUBLICA on 25  January in which Abimael Guzman Reinoso [President Gonzalo]  asserts that the peace agreement is a "strategic retreat," that  is "complex, difficult, but necessary," and that the objective  continues being to continue with the war "until we conquer  power."    The first communique is entitled "Hail Maoism!" It  transcribes the "resolution" of the Central Committee about the  commemorations of Mao Zedong's 100th birthday, stressing the  SL's support "for the leadership of President Gonzalo."    According to the document, "President Gonzalo" will make the  New State flourish with the help of the People's Liberation  Army, which through hard combat will eventually achieve the  immediate goal: To conquer power in the whole country and to  install the People's Republic of Peru." [no opening quotation  marks published]    The SL "resolution," which is just a party agreement at its  highest leadership levels, also envisages an increase in armed  actions against the Peruvian State.    "It is our duty to aim all our actions (....) and mainly to  develop the people's war with increasingly ambitious plans and  greater war actions, using all our forces to the maximum;  totally and strictly complying with the task established by  President Gonzalo."    Another SL communique, which includes the "speech" Guzman  gave when he was presented to the media in a striped prisoner's  uniform following his arrest in September 1992, states that "the  international, national, and party situation marks the arrest  (of Guzman) as an historical event and places on alert all  forces to comply with the IV Strategic Development Plan and the  VI Military Plan, according to what was established by the III  Plenum of the PCP-SL Central Committee."    Between Abimael Guzman's arrest until September 1993, the SL  has carried out the first guerrilla campaign called "Defend the  life of President Gonzalo!," and from November 1993 until the  present it is carrying out the second campaign called "In  Defense of the Leadership Against the Genocide Dictator!"    The two campaigns are part of the so-called Sixth Great  Military Plan to which the subversives refer.    This latter document includes the most recent decisions of  the leadership connected with the strategy and objectives of the  organization led by Guzman.    As for strategy, the Maoists state: "We reassert the three  strategies established by President Gonzalo: political strategy:  conquest of power; military strategy: the people's war, to  develop preparations for insurrection; strategy of construction,  to build the conquer of power amid the people's war."    Among the objectives of the SL -- which totally opposes the  contents of the letters Guzman sent to President Fujimori  praising the policies of his regime -- we find: "To combat the  treacherous genocide of the dictatorship of Fujimori, to defeat  his counterrevolutionary plan (and) to upgrade the people's war  by developing a strategic balance to conquer power in the whole  country."    Guzman's statements in his letters are not at all in keeping  with his strategies and objectives expressed in the SL  communiques or in the document published by LA REPUBLICA. On  the contrary, they show that Abimael Guzman is playing a double  game to "gain time" and to recompose his organization's  apparatus and thus guarantee the continuity of the peoples war  that he unleashed in May 1980.    In another PCP-SL bulletin entitled "Declaration" the SL  again stresses its decision to continue to combat the regime  "headed by the genocidal traitor puppet Fujimori, the most loyal  lackey of Yankee imperialism," whioch clearly contradicts  Guzman's statements that the government "has made real  accomplishments."    The document minimizes the efforts for pacification and  specifically refers to the "capitulation of the SL" to dialogue  which is labelled as "another lie which the reactionary  government periodically releases (....), a ridiculous and clumsy  lie that no one with even the smallest brain can consider  serious and which will evaporate, like the ones that came before  it, prior to an endless turmoil of the people's war."    Contrary to the spirit of the letters written by Guzman and  the unveiling of the real motive for his apparent willingness to  lay down his weapons, the PCP-SL Central Committee states: "The  people's war will triumph inevitably, marking an event that will  decisively contribute to the development of the international  proletarian revolution; the People's Republic of Peru will  become true thanks to the support and the combat trench of the  working class."    As for Guzman, the declaration states: "With his everlasting  light (....) he is leading us to the golden and shining  Communism with a firm and sure hand," which clearly shows that  the leadership of the self-proclaimed "President Gonzalo" is not  questioned and that his followers support his determination to  hold talks with the representatives of the regime, but only to  distract their attention because "we are sure and convinced of  the triumph of the revolution."    The most recent issue of EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL, the SL  mouthpiece that Luis Arce Borja, who is at large, publishes in  Brussels, reveals the real sense of the negotiations between  Abimael Guzman and the government.    The declaration states: "The people's war is not negotiable  and there is no room for talks with this reactionary and  criminal government. The revolutionaries have decided to  destroy the old state, and to finish with the police and armed  forces. We will definitively end this oppressive system and  imperialistic domination, " adding: "These objectives cannot be  conquered through agreements or `peace conversations.' The  struggle of the masses cannot be auctioned."    The viewpoint of EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL is based on the  attacks committed by the Shining Path in the last four months:  "The military attack that the Maoist guerrilla has been  promoting since last September and which brilliantly continued  in October, November, and December, is the argument against all  those who, based on the lies of the government, have tried to  discredit President Gonzalo and the war of liberation in Peru."    Arce Borja supports the "leadership" of Guzman and  acknowledges that he is the irrefutable leader of the PCP-SL,  therefore his criticisms of the peace talks are not aimed at  "President Gonzalo" but at demonstrating the existence of a SL  strategy to take advantage of the dialogue to "gain strength."    "It is clear as daylight that the PCP-SL is as compact and  strong organization as steel. It has been proven that its top  central, regional, and local leadership cadres are active and  healthy," states EL DIARIO.    Regarding the negotiations, the SL mouthpiece states: "It is  naive to consider the possibility of peacefully maintaining the  old state and the system of oppression."    Arce Borja asks: "What will a peace agreement serve for in  Peru?, and answers: "The only ones to benefit from any `peace  agreement' are exclusively the enemies of the Peruvian people,  especially the imperialistic forces."    The document published by LA REPUBLICA on 25 January clearly  states that the SL people's war will carry on until 2060,  stressing that it will be a "long" war. Arce Borja states that  "time is not a problem for the people's war but it is for the  Peruvian state."    Arce Borja concludes: "To acknowledge the letters of  Fujimori  is to disapprove the general political line of the revolution  established by Abimael Guzman and to deny the validity of the  program of the party whose strategic objectives aim to conquer  power in the whole country and to build the people's republic of  Peru."</p>

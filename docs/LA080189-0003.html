			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: OUT ON THE EDGE  </P> <P> "Where will I go? What will I do?"  </P> <P> The questions, asked in anguish, hang in the sultry air of Liz McVey's tiny  upstairs apartment on a Hollywood side street.  </P> <P> Outside, the owner of a produce truck blasts a horn to announce his presence in  the predominantly Latino neighborhood. Voices rise through an open window, like  snatches of sound from a distant world.  </P> <P> McVey is motionless, trapped inside her own thoughts, a tremulous half-smile  frozen on her face.  </P> <P> For a moment, she seems unreal, as though transformed suddenly into glazed  pottery.  </P> <P> Then, abruptly, without preamble, she speaks again. "I owe three months' rent,  I'm almost out of medicine, and I will be evicted next week. I have no money  and no income."  </P> <P> She sits on the edge of a daybed, prongs from an oxygen tube inserted into each  nostril. There is a wheelchair and aluminum walker nearby.  </P> <P> "How could this happen?"  </P> <P> McVey is 49 but, in this moment of despair, appears older. Her skin is pale and  her reddish-gray hair disheveled. It's hard to imagine her as successful.  </P> <P> "I used to wonder why homeless people couldn't just pull themselves up by the  bootstraps," she says. "I guess I'll find out."  </P> <P> She hesitates, fidgeting with the oxygen tube that winds like a silver snake  across the floor to a tank in another room. Then the realization comes to her,  stark and mean, the truth she has not wanted to face.  </P> <P> Liz McVey -- private investigator, restaurateur, once the privileged daughter  of a wealthy landowner -- is about to become homeless, and she's terrified.  </P> <P> How, indeed, could it happen? Is it possible that any one of us, burdened by  successive calamities, could end up suddenly on the edge, about to drop from a  world of the familiar into an existence as alien as life on another planet?  </P> <P> It's happening to Liz McVey.  </P> <P> Within less than a year, her health has deteriorated and her income has gone  from $10,000 a month to zero.  </P> <P> A born-again Christian, she clings to her faith like a climber to a rope, but  the rope unravels as hope thins. Her friends have given all they can, and she  has one week before eviction.  </P> <P> There are no miracles on Hollywood side streets.  </P> <P> McVey was raised in a gray stone mansion in a wealthy section of Chester, Pa.,  and numbered the DuPonts among her schoolmates.  </P> <P> A graduate of Bryn Mawr, she came to California in the mid-1950s as an Air  Force comptroller, then, intrigued by detective work, earned a private  investigator's license. By 1970, she owned two agencies.  </P> <P> Such was the success of her agencies that within 10 years she had opened a pair  of restaurants. One, a soul food cafe, became a hangout for black celebrities  and was grossing almost a million dollars a year.  </P> <P> Then the roof fell in. Cheated by her own employees, cleaned out by thieves,  both restaurants went under. McVey ended up losing an elaborate Westside home  and owing $100,000. She declared bankruptcy.  </P> <P> But through it all, she kept the detective agencies and worked hard to  reestablish her life. Two years ago, she won a large contract for undercover  work, but what seemed like a way back was only a prelude to disaster.  </P> <P> If it is true we are all fate's children, Liz McVey was selected for a  punishment beyond reason.  </P> <P> Moved into her current apartment as she rebuilt her life, she fell through a  back porch, injuring her knees, her hip and her back. Unwilling to sue, she  suffered the pain and went on with her career, but fell again, this time off a  curb.  </P> <P> What followed was seven months in a hospital, an attack of asthma she says was  caused by medication, pneumonia and a diagnosis of diabetes.  </P> <P> She has been bedridden since October. Doctors feel it will be at least three  months before she is able to work again.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, her savings have disappeared, she is three months behind in her  rent, and grief is at the door.  </P> <P> She is seeking other government assistance but has been told it will take at  least four months, if it is forthcoming at all.  </P> <P> Friends have been bringing her food and some have paid her telephone bill, but  generosity is tempered by priority. Liz McVey is not first on their list.  </P> <P> "I can't believe I'm where I am," she says, the fingertips of one hand touching  her cheek in a gesture of incredulity. "It doesn't seem that long since  October."  </P> <P> She shakes her head and asks the questions again, another of fate's children on  the precipitous brink of despair.  </P> <P> "What will I do?" she says. "Where will I go?"  </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / People: Bahl takes over from Foster at Equal Opportunities The Equal Opportunities Commission's new chairman from June 14 will be Kamlesh Bahl, 36, currently company secretary and manager of legal services with Data Logic, the computing services company. Bahl (right) takes over from Joanna Foster (far right), who has done the job since 1988 and is now off to run the UK's contribution to the United Nations Year of the Family. This was the first time the EOC appointment, which is for three years, has been openly advertised in the national press. The Department of Employment, which oversees the EOC, says Bahl was appointed from a strong list of over 80 candidates for the job. The post pays just over Pounds 30,000 for three days a week - for the remainder of the time Bahl will continue at Data Logic, but as a consultant, rather than in her current role. The EOC, which has its headquarters in Manchester, has a budget of about Pounds 5.8m and about 160 staff. The day-to-day running of the organisation and management matters are handled by the chief executive, Valerie Amos, while the chairman concentrates on policy issues and tends to present the EOC's public face. Bahl is well-versed in equality issues and the workings of committees of the great and the good; she is a member of the Law Society's council, sits on its race relations committee, and was the first woman to chair the society's commerce and industry group. Like many women in the crustier professions, she has sometimes had to deal with the accusation of being a 'token' appointee. Her other activities include being a council member of the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, and sitting on the race relations minorities advisory committee of the Lord Chancellor's judicial studies board. It is also widely believed that Bahl, through Law Society and BBC connections, is the model for Usha Gupta, the Asian lawyer in the Archers on Radio 4. Meanwhile, Joanna Foster, the departing EOC chairman, describes her five-year tenure as 'an extraordinary experience'. Her immediate priorities are 'to get fit, to unpack books from last year's house move, and to do what I have spent much of the past five years expecting everyone else to do - get a good balance into my life between work and family'.</p>

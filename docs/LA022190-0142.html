			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> BREA-OLINDA GIRLS WILL PLAY THURSDAY  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda's second-round game in the 3-AA girls' basketball playoffs has been  postponed until Thursday at the direction of the Southern Section office,  Associate Commissioner Dean Crowley said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda will meet Foothill, which defeated Rim of the World, 64-47, Tuesday  night at Foothill.  </P> <P> The Foothill-Rim of the World game had been scheduled for Saturday night, but  snow prevented Rim of the World from traveling through the Cajon Pass to  Foothill. The game was rescheduled for Monday, but the weather forced another  postponement.  </P> <P> Foothill's game with top-seeded Brea-Olinda was moved to Thursday to give the  Knights (15-9) a day of preparation, Crowley said.  </P> <P> A coin flip will determine the site of Thursday's game.  </P></p>

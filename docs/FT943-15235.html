			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Junior ministerial aides suspended pending inquiry Two junior ministerial aides were last night suspended from their departmental duties following newspaper allegations that they had been willing to accept money for tabling parliamentary questions. Downing Street said Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, planned to tell Mr David Tredinnick and Mr Graham Riddick that they were suspended as parliamentary private secretaries - the lowest rung on the ministerial ladder - pending the outcome of 'any inquiry which may be instituted by the committee of privileges'. If there was no inquiry by the privileges committee, the two would be suspended while 'an internal inquiry' was conducted, Downing Street said. Mr Tredinnick, the MP for Bosworth, is parliamentary private secretary to Sir Wyn Roberts, a Welsh Office minister. Mr Riddick, MP for Colne Valley, fulfils the same role for Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. The speed of Downing Street's reaction was interpreted as a sign of the government's continuing sensitivity to any suggestion of impropriety in the wake of a series of embarrassments this year. Yesterday's move followed newspaper allegations that the pair had been willing to table official questions in the House of Commons in return for Pounds 1,000. The two men, who both deny wrongdoing, were among 10 Conservative and 10 Labour MPs selected at random and approached by a Sunday Times reporter posing as a businessman. Mr Riddick - who the newspaper said had returned his Pounds 1,000 payment - said yesterday he decided it would be 'inappropriate' to accept the fee because the amount of work was very small. He said he was taking advice 'with a view to consideration of legal action'. Mr Tredinnick said he refused to accept payment 'and in any case if I had agreed to do so, providing I had registered that interest, I would not have been in any way contravening regulations'. He said he resented 'very much' that the newspaper had 'gone out of its way to try and set up members of parliament'. Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for Workington, said he was planning to ask Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, to investigate the allegations, which left him 'aghast'.</p>

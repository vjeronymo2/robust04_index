			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] fully  supports the position of the NATO states with regard to military  intervention in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According  to Jerzy Chmielewski, of the MSZ European Department, the  current situation, which has arisen after the expiry of the NATO  ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, should be used to consolidate  the ceasefire and resume peace talks between the parties  involved. Chmielewski's opinion is that as a transition stage,  new areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be incorporated into the  security zones.</p>

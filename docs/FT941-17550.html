			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / PLO leaders reject conditions set for peace talks PLO leaders yesterday rejected conditions set by Israel for the resumption of talks on implementing their agreement on Palestinian self-rule, Reuter reports from Tunis. 'We reject the Israeli diktat and we wait for Israel's response to our amendments to its proposals,' PLO executive committee member Suleiman Najab said. 'They (the Israelis) are responsible for the halt in negotiations,' he said after an executive committee meeting chaired by Mr Yassir Arafat. The two sides had hoped to meet in Taba, Egypt, today to thrash out issues holding up the start of an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Under the September peace accord Israel was to have started its withdrawal on December 13.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUDGET CRUNCH MAY HIT ANTI-TRUANCY AIDES;  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOLS: TEN ATTENDANCE COUNSELORS FACE LAYOFFS IN FEBRUARY BECAUSE OF THE  DISTRICT'S FINANCIAL CRISIS.  </P> <P> Kim Bertram recalls the rodent-infested, urine-stained garage she discovered  the day she visited the home of a 7-year-old Huntington Park girl who was  chronically absent from school.  </P> <P> As an attendance counselor for the Los Angeles Unified School District, Bertram  frequently made house calls to check up on truant pupils. But this was no  hooky-playing student. Huddled on the cold concrete floor lay a sick and hungry  little girl. Her mother, confined to a wheelchair and dying of kidney failure,  was unable to care for herself, much less get her daughter ready for class each  morning.  </P> <P> With help from Bertram, the family began receiving assistance from the Los  Angeles County Health Services agency and the little girl returned to school.  When the mother died later that year, Bertram counseled the student as she got  settled in with a foster family. The Huntington Park incident was just one of  600 cases handled last year by the 26-year-old Bertram, who has a master's  degree in social work.  </P> <P> Come February, however, Bertram and nine other attendance counselors at Los  Angeles schools may find themselves out of a job. The school board is  considering eliminating their positions because of a continuing financial  crunch.  </P> <P> The proposed cuts have thrown the spotlight on a little-noticed program that  school officials say is responsible for persuading hundreds of students to  remain in school each year. There are 185 attendance counselors for the 625,000  students in the district, or one for about every 3,380 children.  </P> <P> But their numbers are dwindling. Earlier this year, the district eliminated 14  attendance counselor positions as part of sweeping cuts in which $220 million  was slashed from its $4 billion annual budget.  </P> <P> "Children need to be in school to succeed, and if these positions are lost, it  is the children who will suffer," says Bertram, who divides her time among five  elementary schools in South Gate and Boyle Heights.  </P> <P> Several of the counselors, who appeared before the school board recently to  argue their case, also pointed out that their jobs actually make money for the  district, because schools receive state funding based on student attendance.  </P> <P> School Supt. Bill Anton has said he hopes to find a way to avert the cuts, but  district officials said last week there is no guarantee the jobs can be saved.  </P> <P> "There is a shortage of funds," said Tom Killeen, a district administrator of  personnel services. However, he called the positions "a priority," adding that  attendance counselors "perform a very valuable service, they help get kids . .  . who are at risk get back into school."  </P> <P> About 10% of the students in the system are absent every day, and the figure  rises to between 15% and 20% on Mondays and Fridays," said Cheryl Fayson, a  district specialist who works with truants. Dropout rates approach 50% at some  high schools.  </P> <P> While each school handles absences differently, Bertram is usually brought in  after a student misses three days and teachers have been unable to reach  parents at home. At that point, Bertram usually visits the family of the truant  child at home.  </P> <P> During her three years on the job, Bertram has been threatened with physical  harm, chased by dogs, had doors slammed in her face and found parents drunk or  strung out on drugs at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> In response, she has set some ground rules for home visits. She won't enter  unfamiliar neighborhoods in the late afternoon. If she is uncertain, she checks  with the local police first. If the area is indeed dangerous, she visits in the  morning, sometimes bringing a friend along for protection.  </P> <P> "Most activity in dangerous areas doesn't start until afternoon, because in the  morning, they're still sleeping from the night before," Bertram says.  </P> <P> If parents refuse to cooperate, Bertram may turn the case over to a panel  composed of police officers, county children's services representatives, school  counselors and members of the community to hear testimony and make  recommendations. If parents still fail to comply, the district may turn the  case over to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office for prosecution.  If found guilty, parents can be fined up to $500 and sentenced to attend  parenting classes.  </P> <P> As a vital link between the school and home, attendance counselors work closely  with Los Angeles County child welfare and public health agencies, probation  officers and local police. If they detect evidence of physical or sexual abuse,  they notify the proper authorities.  </P> <P> Bertram says that success stories, such as that of Francisco and Jesus  Alcauter, make her work worthwhile. She first heard about the boys last spring,  when an anonymous caller reported two children living in a South Gate motel.  When she knocked at the room, a woman in her late 20s opened the door a crack,  then slammed it shut when Bertram tried to talk to her in Spanish.  </P> <P> But she persisted, and after several weeks, built up a rapport with the mother,  Catalina Alcauter, who had just arrived from Mexico six months before. "She  didn't know about the school system, she didn't know there was free schooling  or that school was a good place for her children to be," Bertram says.  </P> <P> Bertram helped get the children clothes and canned food. Then she drew the  woman a map of the school, which was two blocks away, and walked with the  family to school that first day.  </P> <P> At first, the children "didn't have any of the social skills needed to sit at a  desk," Bertram recalled. Today however, the two boys, aged 7 and 8, have  perfect attendance and are improving their grades. Bertram is now working to  get their mother enrolled in adult school.  </P> <P> Attendance counselor Laura Orenstein, by contrast, works with junior high  school students, who are more prone to drop out as they get older. Orenstein,  whose job may also be eliminated in February, often works with students who are  bused into the San Fernando Valley from more crowded schools elsewhere in the  district. One case that tested her mettle last year involved a 13-year-old girl  from Los Angeles who was bused into a junior high school in Granada Hills. The  teen-ager, who had been physically and sexually abused, had been removed from  her family and placed in a foster home. Traumatized, she reacted by ditching  school and running away to a boyfriend's house.  </P> <P> But Orenstein, who had won the girl's confidence during earlier discussions,  said the teen-ager called from her new hide-out to assure the counselor that  she was all right.  </P> <P> When Orenstein drove out for a visit, she found the girl living with her  16-year-old boyfriend, who also was a truant. After long talks, including meals  at a local fast-food restaurant, she persuaded them both to return to class.  </P> <P> And when school let out for the summer, Orenstein received an unexpected  letter.  </P> <P> "You . . . make me proud and happy . . . you're like my family," the  13-year-old girl wrote to Orenstein.  </P> <P> "I'm really going to miss you. I hope you come visit (during) summer. It was  nice and wonderful riding in your car, you taking me to McDonald's. I hope God  pays (you for) all these things you have done for me."  </P></p>

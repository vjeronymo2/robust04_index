			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioners point out that, since publication of the final rule, new locations have been discovered for several of the species, most notably the Tooth Cave ground beetle and the Bone Cave harvestman. The Tooth Cave ground beetle was known from two caves about 2.5 kilometers (km) (1.5 miles (mi)) apart in Travis County, Texas, at the time of listing. It is currently known from about 27 locations (24 confirmed, 3 tentative) along a 14-km (9-mi) distance in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. Only 10 of these caves are provided any degree of local protection (James Reddell, Texas Memorial Museum,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993). Seven of these caves are located in the small TSNL preserves discussed above, one is in a small preserve owned by the City of Austin, and two are in small preserves acquired as mitigation for a development project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bone Cave harvestman was not described at the time of the original listing, but was thought to be the same species as the Bee Creek Cave harvestman. The Bone Cave harvestman is currently known from about 69 locations (60 confirmed, 9 tentative) along a 40-km (25-mi) distance in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. Of the 69 caves recorded as locations of the Bone Cave harvestman, only 9 are provided any local protection. Three are TSNL caves, two are in City of Austin preserves, two are in City of Georgetown preserves, and two were acquired as mitigation for a development project. In addition, this species exhibits considerable geographical variation and loss of a significant number of locations within a part of its range would result in a loss of genetic diversity within the species (Reddell,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993). Few caves are provided any protection other than that now provided by the Act and their distribution is disjunct and at the extremes of the species' range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of caves in which the other five endangered karst invertebrates have been found or tentatively identified has increased slightly for three of the species, remained the same for another species (although its range has decreased), and decreased for the fifth species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, known at the time of listing from Tooth and Amber caves, within a 1.3-km (0.8-mi) radius in Travis County, remains confirmed only from the two original caves. The species has been tentatively identified from Stovepipe Cave and Kretschmarr Double Pit, lying within the original range. Stovepipe Cave is located on private property that the City of Austin has approved for development. The three remaining caves are located in the small TSNL preserves discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Tooth Cave spider, known at the time of listing only from Tooth Cave, is now also confirmed at New Comanche Trail Cave and tentatively identified from Gallifer and Stovepipe caves, all lying along a 4.5-km (3-mi) distance in northwest Travis County, Texas. Tooth and Gallifer caves lie within small TSNL preserves, Stovepipe Cave is on private property approved for development, and New Comanche Trail Cave is not protected and may be adversely impacted by a planned realignment of New Comanche Trail Road.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coffin Cave mold beetle was not described at the time of listing, but was thought to belong to the same species as the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle. The Coffin Cave mold beetle is currently confirmed from four caves and tentatively identified from one cave, all occurring along a 17-km (10-mi) distance in Williamson County, Texas. Off Campus and Sierra Vista caves are located in a small preserve surrounded by a subdivision; the adequacy of the preserve for long-term protection of the species at those sites is uncertain. On Campus Cave lies on a high school campus. The status of the type locality (Coffin Cave) is unknown; recent attempts to locate the species in Inner Space Cavern were unsuccessful (Reddell,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle was believed to occur in four caves in Travis and Williamson counties at the time of listing and is currently known from four caves in Travis County. A specimen from Coffin Cave was redescribed as the Coffin Cave mold beetle and a new location for the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle was discovered at Stovepipe Cave. The range of the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle has consequently decreased since the original listing from a 45-km (28-mi) distance in Travis and Williamson counties to a 2-km (1.2-mi) distance in Travis County. Stovepipe Cave lies within a proposed subdivision and the other three locations for the species, Tooth, Amber, and Kretschmarr caves, lie within small TSNL preserves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

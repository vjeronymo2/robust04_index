			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Secretarial pay up by almost 7% Average salaries of secretarial and clerical staff in the private sector have increased in real terms since 1992, says a survey by Alfred Marks, the employment bureau. Salary increases averaged nearly 7 per cent - about twice the average rate of private sector pay increases - in the year to November 1993. In London, salaries of personal assistants in the City fell 10 per cent over the 12 months, bringing the average wage down to Pounds 15,500. In the West End salaries of PAs remained static at an average of Pounds 15,500. City secretaries saw an increase in real terms of 4 per cent, bringing the average to Pounds 14,400 compared with a fall of 1 per cent for secretaries in the West End. The west Midlands was the best-performing region in 1993 with salary increases of 6 per cent for PAs and 5 per cent for secretaries. Alfred Marks said differentials between secretaries in London and elsewhere had been eroded.</p>

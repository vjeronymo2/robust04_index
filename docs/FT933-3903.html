			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / 'We're making history here': The possibility of peace is dawning in Jerusalem FOR years it has been illegal to demonstrate in East Jerusalem; to wave a Palestinian flag was an act of defiance. It still is. But yesterday the Israeli army just stood by. Soldiers did not fire tear gas and Palestinians did not throw stones as several hundred youths unfurled the red, green, white and black standard of Palestine over the stone battlements of Jerusalem's old city. The demonstrators, many in military fatigues and black and white Palestinian scarves, clapped, danced and chanted songs in praise of Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Their chanting echoed across a city built by King David and his son, Solomon, nearly three millennia ago and which has provoked religious conflict, political rivalry and foreign conquest in an almost uninterrupted flow ever since. Posters of Mr Arafat were carried high above the crowd gathered outside the old city's ancient Damascus gate. The change in climate is electrifying. 'I have never seen this before,' said Mr Abed Alloun, a student representative. 'We are making history here. We are taking our political rights from the Israeli occupiers and soon we will have our own state.' As the significance of the peace accord dawns on both sides of the Green Line which divides Arab and Jew in this holy city, support for the agreement is growing. Opinion polls of Palestinians show a clear 60-65 per cent in favour of the deal. 'People are excited and happy about it. Most feel it is the first step to a Palestinian state after 45 years of hell,' said Mr Nabil Feidy, a money-changer on Salahadin Street in east Jerusalem. 'People aren't dancing on the rooftops yet. There are a lot of questions to be answered like what will happen to us in east Jerusalem. A lot of people still have their relatives in jail. Mothers and fathers have lost their children in the intifada (the Palestinian uprising). It will take time.' As fear wanes, support is also mounting among Israelis, despite vociferous protests by Jewish settlers and other rightwingers against what they term the 'treachery and foolishness' of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister. An opinion poll in yesterday's Hebrew newspaper Yediot Ahronot found 57 per cent of Israelis supported the accord, with 41 per cent opposed. A week ago only 53 per cent backed the deal, with 44 per cent against. The survey also found, however, that a large majority - 68 per cent  -want Mr Rabin to hold a referendum on the agreement. Many of Israel's toughest generals who have faced Arab armies in four major wars and countless small ones endorse the agreement. Mr Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the minister of construction, who spent 27 years in uniform, said: 'For most of my life, I battled against the PLO.' Making peace with the organisation, he said, 'was a dream come true. I am glad that my generation, which carried the burden of all those wars, is trying to save the next generation.' Mr Mordechai Gur, deputy defence minister and former head of the paratroop division which captured Arab east Jerusalem in 1967, added simply: 'This is what we fought for.' Even relatives of victims of PLO attacks on Israel have been speaking out in favour of the accommodation. Ms Ilana Romano, widow of one of the 11 Israeli athletes murdered at the 1972 Munich Olympics, said she had been in 'a state of inner turmoil' since news of the talks with the PLO broke. She could never forgive Mr Arafat but she said: 'I want peace very much. If even one life is saved, it will be worthwhile.' The peace may be signed and is about to be sealed but it has yet to be delivered. No two peoples are so divided by mutual hatred, while at the same time united in the absoluteness of their claims to God-given sovereignty over the same piece of land. Yesterday, on the holiest day of the week for both religions, Jews and Arabs prayed 100 yards from each other in the old city. Pious Palestinians kneeled in submission to Allah at the Dome of the Rock Mosque while Orthodox Jews prostrated themselves before the Wailing Wall. Both are united in their belief that the mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel, concluded yesterday by Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin, is a sell-out and a sin against God. 'This land is our land, our Islamic land,' said Mr Souhail Abed, clad in a Palestinian kafiyeh, as he left the stone-walled city through the Damascus gate. 'Arafat has no right to give up our holy land,' he said. 'My country is in Jaffa (a suburb of Tel Aviv) and nobody will give this back under the agreement. I don't accept it.' Mr Gerson Friedman, an orthodox Jew, has similar feelings. 'God gave this land to us. Giving up even a small piece of it is like giving up your finger or your heart,' he said, as he stood in his black suit and hat in front of the Wailing Wall, the most holy religious site in Judaism. 'When the Jordanians had control of the old city they spat and pissed on the Wailing Wall. It will happen again when Arafat comes. He is a murderer of Jews. He is Hitler's right hand and this agreement is against the people and against the Torah (the Old Testament). 'We are praying against the agreement and praying for the Messiah to come and solve these problems.' Clinton hails accord; Israelis asked to trust old enemy, Page 3 Editorial Comment, Page 8</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to Mr. Jackson's petition, ATF published a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 783, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57764), proposing the establishment of the Hames Valley viticultural area. The notice requested comments from all interested persons by December 27, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment was received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking (Notice No. 783). The comment was from Mr. Robert H. Denney and Ms. Shelley B. Denney of Robert Denney &amp; Associates, one of the petitioners for the establishment of the Hames Valley viticultural area. This commenter states that the existing Monterey viticultural area covers a vast geographic and climatic area, from the cool Salinas Valley floor area close to Monterey Bay to inland valleys and foothills seventy miles to the south.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Mr. and Ms. Denney, these southern valleys exhibit vastly different coastal influences and growing conditions. As a result, the varieties grown, their yields, quality characteristics and flavor components vary widely from Soledad on the north to Hames Valley on the south.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. and Ms. Denney state that, as growers and small business people, it is important to their economic well being to be able to differentiate the wine grapes they grow in Hames Valley from those produced in the cooler regions of the Monterey viticultural area. They further state that by being able to differentiate their grapes and, ultimately through their own efforts, the wineries that purchase their grapes, as well as the consumer, can identify and seek out their product for its unique character.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Evidence That Viticultural Area Name Is Widely Known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The name Hames Valley has been associated with this area since the latter part of the nineteenth century. The petitioner cites Donald T. Clark,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monterey County Place Names <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , p. 201 (1991), which states that the valley was named for John Hames who had extensive land holdings in the area. In addition, the name Hames Valley appears on the U.S.G.S. Bradley Quadrangle, 15 minute series, map of Bradley, California, and also appears on the U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute series map entitled Hames Valley. Additionally, the petitioner notes that there is a creek which runs through the valley named Hames Creek.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza Rosales] </F>   [Text] The Guatemalan Government Peace Commission and the  Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity on 17 June in Oslo,  Norway, signed the Agreement for the Resettlement of People  Displaced by the Armed Conflict, which focuses on the creation  of a technical commission.    As for the institutional arrangements detailed in  Paragraph 2, Chapter 5 of the agreement, it is established that  the commission will be made up of two government  representatives, two representatives of the displaced persons,  and two representatives of the donor and friendly countries and  of international cooperation agencies, who will serve as  advisers.    The agreement indicates that the Commission will be  formed within 60 days after the signing of the this agreement.  To this effect, the Guatemalan Government will issue the  corresponding regulatory decree.    The agreement, signed before negotiations on mechanisms for  the historical clarification of the past, introduces the  definitions, principles, and objectives of general resettlement  strategies. It also touches on guarantees for the same, the  productive integration of displaced persons, development of  resettled areas, international resources and cooperation, and  institutional arrangements.    This last issue also contemplates the creation of a fund for  the implementation of the resettlement agreement. The fund will  be created with international community contributions, and the  UNDP [United Nations Development Program] will manage the  resources allocated for each project.    There is a paragraph on the security of people resettled in  areas affected by the armed conflict, which recognizes the need  to immediately remove all mines and explosive devices planted or  left behind in these areas and for cooperation in these  activities.    The parties agreed to request that UNESCO draft a plan to  meet the educational needs of these people and to help them get  their personal identification documents in order.    In conclusion, it is worth noting what the agreement  stipulates on the land issue. We will seek to give greater  facilities for the use of these lands to ensure their better use  as established in the support, agricultural development, and  other guidelines.</p>

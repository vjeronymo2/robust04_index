			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ER FANS GET LAST LAUGH AT COLUMNISTS  </P> <P> 30-3! Well, I guess Bob Oates was only half right in his column of Jan. 4. The  Rams did win in the Meadowlands.  </P> <P> However, they never stood a chance against the 49ers.  </P> <P> In his column, Oates just about handed the Rams the Super Bowl trophy, but he  forgot that the Rams' inside track led through San Francisco.  </P> <P> Psychologically, the Rams may have read Oates' column and thought that all they  had to do was show up to beat the 49ers. Physically, the Vikings barely touched  Joe Montana, and neither the Vikings nor the Rams recorded a sack against the  49ers.  </P> <P> The Rams, and especially Jim Everett, had a great season, but Oates' column  read better as fiction.  </P> <P> MARK A. FROIO, Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

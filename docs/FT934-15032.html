			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Sharif abandons attempt to be PM MS Benazir Bhutto's chances of forming a government in Pakistan have strengthened after an apparent decision by Mr Nawaz Sharif, her arch rival, to abandon his attempt to seek office. Instead, Mr Sharif has intensified his efforts to form the government in the Punjab, Pakistan's largest and wealthiest province, which is widely regarded to be crucial for the smooth functioning of the central government. Concentrating on the Punjab, which is Mr Sharif's home province, would strengthen the position of his Pakistan Moslem League (PML) party. Punjab is also crucial for the success of the future government. Mr Sharif took office as the chief minister of the province in 1988 when Ms Bhutto became the prime minister. However, he was able to force the dismissal of her government 20 months later, partly because of intense conflict between the centre and the Punjab. The PML won 106 seats in Saturday's provincial elections, against the 112 by the PPP and its allies. Both sides are now trying to win the support of independent members and representatives of non-Moslem minorities to gain a majority in the 248-seat house. Despite Mr Sharif's latest efforts, Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party claimed last night that it continued to have the largest number of seats in both the centre and the Punjab, and could form both governments.</p>

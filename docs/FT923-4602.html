			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: At a Glance - House prices fall again House prices fell again in August according to the Nationwide and Halifax price indices this week. Nationwide recorded a 0.2 per cent fall in prices compared to the previous month, while Halifax found a 0.7 per cent fall. UK house prices have fallen by over 5 per cent over the 12 months to August, according to both indices. Tim Melville-Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, said concern about the economy was continuing to depress the market. The reintroduction last month of stamp duty would 'act as a further brake on the market in the short term,' he said. Halifax also had a gloomy prognosis, foreseeing no upturn in the market this year and only muted recovery next, unless the economy recovers.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RSVP;  </P> <P> PASADENA UNVEILS NEW HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Pasadena opened its big Christmas present -- the new Huntington Hospital --  early. On Friday night, lights outlined the Mediterranean edges of the  $75-million three-story replacement structure at 100 W. California Blvd.  One-thousand (at $200 a ticket) dined and danced to Wayne Foster for a "Pre-Op"  party and first views of the elegant structure. Another 3,000 Huntington  Hospital staff and their relatives toured Saturday and 300 more partied at the  "Operation Party" Saturday night. Sunday afternoon the public swarmed in for  the "Post-Op" party, a community open house.  </P> <P> "Yes, lots of comparisons to the Ritz Carlton," said hospital president Dr.  Allen Mathies, greeting guests with his wife, Weta.  </P> <P> The Friday night crowd meandered through admittance offices, and oohed and  aahed over the gift shop, the newborn nurseries, 13 operating suites and the  emergency department (including the San Gabriel Valley's only trauma center).  </P> <P> The old core hospital building was erected in 1921. This evening was a goodby  to grunginess. And hello to fresh paint and partying. In the huge white tent on  the hospital parking lot, party co-chairs Katie Tuerk and Weta Mathies directed  Cuisine Cuisine from Newport Beach to serve an antipasto salad, hot chicken and  a fudge dessert. Ivy topiaries in the shapes of wreaths and Christmas trees  dotted tables.  </P> <P> Pride was showing. Dinner co-chairs William K. Doyle and Dr. James P. Blitz  said thank-yous, hosting tables with their wives, Cheryl Doyle and Pam Blitz.  Doctors were in abundance: Popular Dr. Millard McLain, now retired, got more  hugs than a teddy bear. There were Dr. Morgans galore -- Dr. George Morgan and  his son, Dr. Edward Morgan, and daughter-in-law, Dr. Karen Morgan, as well as  Dr. Stan Morgan, not related. Dr. Bill Corey was on call; his wife carried his  cellular phone.  </P> <P> Glitter was rampant. Shining in the masses of beads, bangles and diamonds were  Pasadena-area leaders Verne (Huntington board chairman) and Sarah Orr, Stan and  Marcia Hayden, Jane and Kris Popovich, Joan and Dean Schneider, Lorna and Chuck  Reed, Dr. Bob and Jan Tranquada, Cornelius and Marjorie Pings, Patty and Davis  Pillsbury, Bob and Louisa Miller, Dr. Bill and Susie Lattin, Dr. Mary Lee and  Shelby Coffey III, Betsy and Frank Ulf, George and Chris Benter, Bill and  Eileen Zimmerman, Henry and Nancy DeNero, Spike and Debby Booth, Bruce and  Susan Seidel.  </P></p>

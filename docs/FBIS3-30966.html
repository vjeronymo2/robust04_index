			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Michal Strak, head of the Council of Ministers  office, has denied that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak allegedly  consulted with the president on his decisions concerning  personnel changes in the top posts at the Finance Ministry.  Minister Strak said during the "Morning Signals" program that  any suggestions that the prime minister succumbed to pressure  from outside were untrue.    [Begin recording] [Strak] I can say that the prime minister  is conducting an entirely independent policy, and any suspicions  that he is guided by anyone from outside are simply  preposterous. I am surprised that these suspicions appear at all.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is the coalition agreement  going  to be renegotiated?    [Strak] I think that the coalition agreement is a good  document, and I think the political part is being implemented.  The economic part should be implemented as well, although the  matter is much more difficult. There is great difficulty in  reconciling what is necessary for maintaining a certain  macroeconomic balance, which has been achieved in Poland and  which is appreciated by the government, with the necessity to  meet the most severe and urgent public needs.    Public expectations in this domain found their expression in  the demonstration. We are treating this event with full  seriousness because people who took part in it carry the burden  of economic change in Poland on their backs. There is  undoubtedly a need to reduce the burden, to make it lighter,  although this is an extremely difficult task. I think this  government has been aware of the difficulties. Some decisions  are made within the government's abilities, but we are fully  aware that these decisions do not resolve the issue. [end  recording]</p>

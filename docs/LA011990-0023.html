			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MARCACCINI TO COMPLETE SUSPENSION  </P> <P> G. C. Marcaccini, the second-leading scorer for Notre Dame High, has decided to  complete a one-month suspension from the basketball team and remain enrolled at  the school.  </P> <P> Marcaccini said that he was suspended after he tampered with a fire  extinguisher, setting off a smoke alarm in the Palo Alto hotel in which the  team was staying during a December holiday tournament.  </P> <P> An entire floor of the hotel was evacuated.  </P> <P> Marcaccini, a junior who is averaging 18 points a game, said that he will  resume practicing with the team Wednesday.  </P> <P> Notre Dame Coach Mick Cady was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Transferring to Taft was an option Marcaccini said he had seriously considered.  </P> <P> "That would have been if things were really bad," he said. "I was pretty close.  . . . I talked to the junior varsity coach and he said I fit in. I'm a decent  athlete and I like to run and gun."  </P> <P> Marcaccini said that he has resolved his differences with Cady.  </P> <P> "I really like him a lot and he really likes me," Marcaccini said. "He's a  free-spirited guy." SAM FARMER  </P></p>

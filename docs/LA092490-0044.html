			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> ABUNDANT RICHES BY FLANAGAN TRIO  </P> <P> Employing the majestic lyrical sense and not-one-note-wasted fluid style of  improvisation that has been mesmerizing audiences for years, pianist Tommy  Flanagan stole into town over the weekend. The premier living exponent of  be-bop piano and his sidemen -- bassist George Mraz and drummer Larance Marable  -- made a much-too-brief three-night stand at the Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill  in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Riches were in abundance during Friday's opening set. Flanagan, a Balzac at the  piano who can make anything sing, started with silence -- or the closest thing  one could find to it in a packed nightclub -- and wove marvelous tales. Using  line after enchanting line for his dramas, he took the audience on a journey to  another world, prestidigitally describing a land of beauty, grace, strength and  humor.  </P> <P> The wonderful writer and arranger Tadd Dameron was represented by "Our  Delight," Charlie Parker was heard in his lovely "Quasimodo" (also heard was  Gershwin's "Embraceable You," on which Bird's opus was based), and Thelonious  Monk was present in a medley of four of his memorable melodies, "Ruby, My Dear"  and " 'Round Midnight," among them.  </P> <P> Dizzy Gillespie's "Tin Tin Deo" was Flanagan with the heat turned way up. A  series of exchanges between the leader and his bandmates led to a melody  reading replete with energized, chordal movement, ideas that twisted and curved  and stopped on a dime. The performance wouldn't have been what it was without  the extraordinary Mraz, Flanagan's partner for nearly a decade and a musician  with a gorgeous, full sound and the keenest of ears. One example of their  teamwork was on J. J. Johnson's "Lament," where a Flanagan ascending left-hand  line was suddenly picked by the bassist, who extended it another six tones as  the pianist enriched the proceedings with dulcet chords.  </P> <P> Marable proved to be a worthy replacement for the trio's regular drummer, Louis  Nash, crackling throughout while not falling victim to the Drummers' Curse:  playing too loudly.ZAN STEWART  </P></p>

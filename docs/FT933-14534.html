			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Surveyors warn of 'suicidal' prices INTENSE competition is forcing construction prices down to suicidal levels, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned yesterday, Andrew Taylor writes. It said that contractors' tender prices had fallen 3 per cent in the first three months of this year - the lowest level since 1986. But contractors' construction costs were expected to rise 5.5 per cent in the next 24 months. The institution added that spare capacity among contractors meant that tender prices were unlikely to rise until well into next year. Its tender price index had fallen 25 per cent since 1989.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low prices force 16-day closure of zinc-lead mine AFTER zinc fell to its lowest price for 9 1/2 months in London yesterday, Curragh Resources said low prices were forcing it to close the Faro zinc-lead complex in the Yukon for 16 days over the Christmas period. The Canadian mining group said this would cut output by about 25,000 tonnes, two-thirds of which is zinc, and affect about 300 staff. It said it was setting budgets for 1993 and Faro, with an annual output of about 500,000 tonnes of metal, might have to shut down some capacity next year. Analysts suggested Curragh's action was unlikely to raise zinc prices. 'This won't turn the market,' said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. 'Zinc will need a much bigger shock than this. Production cutbacks so far have been pretty tentative but this price of about 50 cents a lb will force producers to make more cuts.' However, he said the market should note that labour contract negotiations were in progress at three big zinc smelters - Cominco's Trail and Sullivan smelters (245,000 and 190,000 tonnes a year respectively) and Noranda's Valleyfield (220,000 tonnes). 'But the ball is not exactly in the union's court at the moment.' Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out that the zinc market was likely to experience another supply surplus this year - of about 150,000 tonnes following one of 85,000 tonnes in 1991. On the London Metal Exchange yesterday, zinc for delivery in three months touched Dollars 1,110 a tonne at one point. This sparked some consumer interest and the price recovered to close at Dollars 1,118.50 a tonne, down Dollars 14 from Tuesday's close. London Metal Exchange stock figures were misleading because not all the metal was immediately available, Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's marketing director pointed out yesterday. Unlike producers' stocks, those in LME warehouses had been bought by someone for some good reason and the owner might not be a ready seller. He said metals producers and consumers were carrying minimal stocks so any recovery in industrial activity was likely to see LME stocks evaporating quickly.</p>

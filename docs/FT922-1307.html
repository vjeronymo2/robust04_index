			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour tries to heal its European wound / Examining the party's division over Maastricht MR Gerald Kaufman is enjoying a characteristically combative swansong as Labour's outgoing shadow foreign secretary. Last weekend, he again challenged the government to come to the Commons and spell out its plans for the future of the bill ratifying the Maastricht treaty. Speaking in his Manchester, Gorton, constituency, he warned that Ireland's firm 'yes' in its referendum last week would do nothing to solve the quandary on how to proceed without splitting the Conservative party. 'Unless and until a clear way through is shown for the treaty, it will be improper for the government to ask parliament to pass the Maastricht Bill,' Mr Kaufman said, comfortable in the certainty that no such 'way through' is likely before his return to the back benches. If his invitation to debate is declined, it is not impossible that Labour will use some of its own time allocation to table a suitably caustic European motion of its own. But the wording will have to be delicately chosen. There is now plenty of evidence that the Danish referendum result has left Labour quite as divided over the future of the Maastricht accords as the government. In the past 10 days alone, Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader, has had to decline the presidency of the Confederation of Socialist parties and hint that Labour just might support a national referendum on Maastricht. Both moves are indicators of the deep ferment on the Labour benches as the old leadership ebbs away. 'Gerald is demob happy, Neil is buckling under the pressure and John Smith can't say anything as he's not yet elected,' one worried party disciplinarian commented yesterday. That mood is beginning to alarm longstanding Labour 'Europeans' who fear that the party is now risks sacrificing its hard-fought struggle for credibility on the Continent for a short-term tactical victory in Westminster. Mr Giles Radice, the Euro-phile MP for Durham North, appears to have had a premonition of such a danger. His new book, Offshore: Britain and the European Idea, published next week, warns against Labour being a 'reluctant European' party or even reverting to an anti-European stance. Yet there are probably no more than 25 anti-Europeans in the parliamentary Labour party. The real threat now comes from a pro-European faction, driven by the newly reformed Tribune group led by two prominent soft-left backbenchers, Mr Peter Hain and Ms Clare Short. They are arguing that the Danish referendum outcome offers an opportunity to re-open the treaty negotiations to address Labour's demands for, for example, more democratic accountability of Community institutions and British adhesion to the social chapter. Such arguments provoke despair among longstanding Labour Europhiles who say that any short-term gain from defeating the government on ratification would be paid in lost credibility abroad. As Mr Radice points out, if France approves Maastricht in its own plebiscite, Labour opposition to the treaty - on whatever grounds - could end up scuppering the social chapter it publicly espouses. The Tribunites counter that factors such as the highly-monetarist convergence criteria for economic union are so flawed as to justify rejection of the Maastricht terms. 'If Britain voting it (Maastricht ) down led to a renegotiation, I might go for it,' Ms Short said. In part, this owes much to a growing appetite for confrontation - both with the government and, arguably, the party leadership - provoked by the frustrations of opposition. Yet fellow socialists in Brussels - Labour MEPs included - say it demonstrates an historic unreliability and general lack of seriousness over the European project. For Mr John Smith, a month away from his coronation as leader, the European question will be his first test. So far, as an impeccable European, he has delicately endorsed the Tribunites' criticisms of Maastricht as 'not enough,' but stressed the need to work closely with Labour's European allies. Opposed to using a referendum as sticking plaster over party divisions, his instincts will be to back another neutral abstention when the treaty comes to a vote. Yet with Labour in its current mood there is a danger that, just months after taking office, he may face one of the party's biggest rebellions since the bad old days of the early 1980s.</p>

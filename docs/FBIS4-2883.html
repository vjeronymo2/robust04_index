			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "U.S. Urged To Keep GATT Re-Entry Promise"] </F>   [Text] The Foreign Ministry yesterday called on the U.S.  to stand by its pledge to support China's re-entry into GATT and  criticized the British parliament for 'erroneous' legislation  regarding Hong Kong.    Spokesman Shen Guofang said negotiations are being held with  the U.S. about resuming China's status in the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade.    However, although the U.S. is an important nation in GATT,  it  is only one of the 105 signatory countries, Shen said during the  ministry's weekly news conference.    Shen said that China is willing to keep friendly relations  with Britain on the basis of equality and mutual respect.    But he criticized the recent report released by a committee  in the UK House of Commons.    Shen said the report defended the "erroneous" attitudes of  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and disregarded basic facts  about the HK issue.    Also, he said China maintains that the crisis over  inspecting  possible nuclear sites in the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea should be settled through talks.    This message has been delivered to U.S. Assistant Secretary  of State Robert Gallucci, the spokesman said.    In other news from the briefing, Shen said:    --The government does not want the recent ship fire on  Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang, that killed 24 Taiwanese and eight  mainlanders to damage the cultural ties across the Taiwan  Straits;    --A National People's Congress (NPC) delegation headed by  the  Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun of the Standing Committee will leave  for New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Australia on Monday.</p>

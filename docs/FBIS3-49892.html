			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "From Yesterday's Briefings" </F> column: "Christian Democratic Movement: Nagorno Karabakh in  Slovakia?"]    [Text] According to Frantisek Miklosko, deputy chairman of  the Christian Democratic Movement, the course of the Hungarian  ethnic minority's rally in Komarno [on 8 January] was controlled  by the Coexistence Movement. He also said that the Hungarian  language enclave to the south of Nitra was reminiscent of  Nagorno Karabakh. Whereas in 1990 7 percent of Hungarians in  southern Slovakia advocated political autonomy, in September  1993 this had increased to 45 percent, and the latest polls  indicate that this percentage is growing. "If the Government of  the Slovak Republic acts without a concept in its ethnic policy,  without talks, and irrationally, a political ghetto and a  scarcely controllable situation will arise in southern Slovakia,  which will ultimately evolve into an irredentist movement. The  borders of this irredentist movement were mapped out in Komarno  on 8 January," Frantisek Miklosko declared.</p>

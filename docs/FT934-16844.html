			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Bank deputy calls for 2.5% upper limit on inflation target AN UNDERLYING inflation rate of 1 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent should be regarded as the 'true target' of Britain's counter-inflation policy, rather than the 1-4 per cent target range announced last year, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, Bank of England deputy governor, said last night. Addressing the Cardiff Business Club, Mr Pennant-Rea, who moved from being editor of The Economist to the deputy governor's post at the beginning of July, said it was only through progressive reductions in the inflation rate that people would come to believe that a new surge was not around the corner. Mr Pennant-Rea is known to support a more independent Bank of England and his speech yesterday was notable for the way he unilaterally clarified a target set by government. In a passage that may cause some irritation among Conservative leaders in Blackpool this week, he also gave a brutally frank assessment of how high inflation had caused the recent recession. 'The fundamental cause of the recession we suffered in 1990-92 was not recession elsewhere in the world, or membership of the exchange rate mechanism, or any other diagnosis that relies on coincidence of timing,' he said. 'We had recession in 1990-1992 because we had rising inflation in 1989-90; and we had rising inflation in 1989-90 because we had allowed demand to grow too rapidly in 1987-89.' A year ago, Mr Norman Lamont, as chancellor, announced that the government intended to keep underlying inflation - defined by the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments - within a 1 to 4 per cent range 'for the remainder of this parliament'. He added: 'I believe that by the end of the parliament we need to be in the lower part of the range'. Yesterday, Mr Pennant-Rea, giving his second public speech since joining the Bank, refined the more distant goal as a range of 1-2 1/2 per cent, and in the process underlined that he, like Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, is a convinced inflation fighter. 'In my view, this second bit of the target matters more than the initial 1 to 4 per cent range,' Mr Pennant-Rea said. 'It is right that 1 to 2 1/2 per cent should shortly come to be seen as the true target, and 1996 or 1997 as the true timetable.' Only through lower inflation, he said, would the full benefits of stability appear in the form of better investment decisions, greater equity between savers and borrowers, and significantly lower long-term interest rates. But he warned that further reductions in underlying inflation, which at present stands at 3.1 per cent, would be difficult. 'Getting inflation down by a couple of percentage points is much harder to achieve when the rate is already quite low than it is when inflation is at 10 per cent or so. We have had the easy bit. Now we must prepare for the hard part,' Mr Pennant-Rea said. Economic statistics, Page 11 Rise in borrowing eases fears of stall in recovery, Page 20</p>

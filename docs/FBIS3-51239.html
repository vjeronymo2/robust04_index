			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colonia, 17 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos Menem today  criticized the region's businessmen and said "there are  companies" in Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member  countries "that, safeguarded by an internal growth policy, were  protected more than necessary."    "They lost their spirit of initiative and market  sensitivity,  which should be their essence, so competing in a broader market  is a difficult challenge for them," the Argentine president said.    Menem's statements were interpreted as a reply to the  demands  made by some industrial groups in the region, especially the  Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), which repeatedly has requested  the postponement of the deadlines to establish Mercosur.    The Argentine president, however, said his government "is  clearly concerned with this situation because behind each  company there are capital and jobs of people whom we cannot  forget."    Menem made these statements during the official opening  ceremony of the fifth Mercosur Council meeting that is being  attended by the presidents of Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, and  Bolivia in the El Mirador Hotel convention hall. Bolivian  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada attended the meeting as a  special guest since his country is not a Mercosur member. ?  With Mercosur, Menem said: "We have begun to change the  continent's history and I would even say that we have taken a  qualitative step toward our maturity as a nation."    "Interrelation has become so important that currently not  even the major world powers can avoid political, economic, and  cultural associations with other countries. The European Union  and NAFTA are eloquent evidence of this."    He said: "The economic benefits our four countries currently  are obtaining through Mercosur are evident," adding that one of  the most evident accomplishments has been the increase of trade  in the region.    When referring to the troublesome subject of common import  duties, the Argentine chief of state praised the fact that the  member countries have so far agreed on a considerable amount of  items, although he recognized that "there is still much to be  done."    "In 1994 we must make a renewed effort to improve the basic  instruments that will guarantee fluid trade in Mercosur as a  free trade zone and as a customs union," Menem said.    In turn, Brazilian President Itamar Franco said efforts in  the past three years to establish Mercosur "were greatly  compensated for by the positive results already attained."    Franco agreed with Menem that in 1994 the member countries  will go through a decisive stage because they must define a  common import duty to consolidate the integration process.</p>

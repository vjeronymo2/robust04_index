			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has sought  cooperation from the Geneva-based U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) through formal diplomatic channels on  relocating North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian camps, a  Foreign Ministry official said Saturday.    Seoul's mission in Geneva explained about the human rights  conditions at the Pyongyang-run logging camps and about those  escapees reportedly seeking defection to South Korea to the U.N.  body, requesting its support for their resettlement in the  South, the official said.    The government told the UNHCR that it was willing to accept  all logging refugees wishing to live in the South as well as  others in the future after discussions with the Russian  Government.    Out of an estimated 25,000 loggers, some 170 escapees are  said to want to settle in the South.    The government also instructed its embassy in Russia to  protect North Korean loggers seeking help and to assist them in  coming to the South after confirming their identification and  choice of future residence together with the Russian Government  and the UNHCR, the official said.    The Ministry, meeting on the matter Friday, decided to  support the loggers' resettlement according to the protection  law for North Korean defectors if the number is low.    But if too many wish to live in the South, the government  will revise the law and reduce the available funding for them.    A team comprising officials from the Economic Planning  Board,  the Labor Ministry, the Agency for National Security Planning,  the Health and Social Affairs Ministry and the National Police  Agency will be formed to assist the loggers.</p>

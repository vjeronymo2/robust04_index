			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: NWA offers staff equity for wage concessions NORTHWEST Airlines, the indebted US carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines holds a minority share stake, has offered its employees a 20 per cent equity interest in the company in return for substantial wage concessions. Northwest said the proposal was 'the company's best offer for a revised compensation plan'. The lack of progress in talks with unions prompted speculation that the airline might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but Northwest has denied this. It asked labour leaders to agree to the plan by March 10. The company is asking contract employees - including its pilots, flight attendants and mechanics - for cost savings of about Dollars 883m over three years. Management and non-contract employees would contribute Dollars 92m. The savings would come from wage reductions, employee contributions to medical and dental insurance plans, and holiday accrual rate reductions. In return, Northwest is offering employees a 20 per cent equity stake and three seats on a 15-strong board of directors. This would match the three representatives appointed by KLM, which would see its share stake diluted pro rata. Once the employee wage concessions are in place, Northwest will attempt a financial restructuring. If it has not obtained Dollars 500m of new permanent capital by the end of June 1995, the employees' stake could increase to 51 per cent of the equity.</p>

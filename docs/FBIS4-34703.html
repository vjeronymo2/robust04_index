			<p>BFN     [Text] Herreraist presidential candidate Juan Andres  Ramirez yesterday launched the idea of "promoting popular  capitalism," proposing the creation of a "capital fund, and  making public savings really useful, encouraging investment, and  through this boosting productivity."    Ramirez listed several bills destined to implement his  proposal, among which he mentioned the laws for issuance of  bonds by state enterprises, for regulating the capital market,  for amending the corporations law, for regulating investment  funds, and the bill on domestic holdings.    Ramirez called on young people to join political parties and  to vote with responsibility.    The candidate delivered a speech at the third Uruguayan  Marketing Forum at the Municipal Palace yesterday afternoon. In  the evening he addressed more than 200 youths at a meeting in  the Herreraist faction headquarters.    To the marketing executives, Ramirez used the word "popular  capitalism," a model that the Christian Democratic Party used in  Germany after World War II, and which gained publicity during  Margaret Thatcher's government.    The Herreraist candidate explained that there are four basic  conditions "without which competitiveness and prosperity are  impossible to achieve." He said the first such condition is that  "the state should not become an obstacle, with utilities setting  prices as monopolies and with a heavy tax burden underwriting  inefficiency."    He added that "the laws should not promote inequality, which  is arbitrary and discretionary" and, as the third condition,  that "the country cannot be exposed to the ups and downs of  international trade."    He said the fourth condition was "to preserve freedom and  equality on the market, which are constitutional principles."    At the evening meeting with the youths, Ramirez said that  "the country will not reverse its course, and no one has  proposed a serious alternative to what we have begun in this  administration."    He added that "beyond the model that the country might  promote, everyone agrees that the first requirement concerns  stability and the balance of accounts of the government, which  should not spend anything over revenues and should not fuel  inflation needlessly."    He claimed that "in no other Latin American country is life  better than it is in Uruguay," emphasizing that under the  current administration "the number of people who cannot meet  their basic needs has dropped 50 percent."    Ramirez upheld individual freedom, but warned that "there is  an ethical foundation for everything, and justice is the first  objective of society. We must achieve justice," he emphasized.</p>

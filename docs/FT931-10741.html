			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways By doing the noble thing and bowing out early, Lord King has helped dispel the lingering anxieties caused by the Virgin imbroglio. The market nodded its approval yesterday by lifting BA's shares 3 per cent. It was obviously also pleased to see Sir Colin Marshall retain his dominant role by effectively combining the two top jobs in one. Strict adherence to the principles of good corporate governance would have required the appointment of a non-executive chairman and a chief executive. But, given the City's admiration for Sir Colin, it has been prepared to settle for a compromise which, in the wake of the Virgin affair, looks a trifle lame. The most important consideration is whether effective checks and balances have been restored. BA tried to reassure by giving the deputy chairman, Sir Michael Angus, specific responsibility for monitoring executive directors. That rather begs the question of what he thought he was doing before. One hopes the promised appointment of another non-executive director will mark a further step towards credible supervision. That leaves BA's ambiguous trading outlook. Margin gains from sterling's depreciation may offset sticky traffic figures for premium seats. But, by aggressively increasing capacity by 14 per cent this summer, BA threatens to dilute its yields. Coincidentally or not, this move will severely squeeze Virgin.</p>

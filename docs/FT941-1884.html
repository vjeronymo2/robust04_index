			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Czechs repurchase CSA stake The Czech authorities yesterday ended months of negotiations by announcing that they had agreed terms for a deal to buy back Air France's minority stake in CSA, the Czech airline, for Dollars 27m. Air France, which two years ago paid Dollars 30m for its 19.1 per cent holding, had initially resisted the Czech government's attempts to force it to sell the shares. However, the Czechs persisted, anxious to exert greater control over the management of the airline, which fell into the red last year and is on course for further losses this year. Air France will sell its entire CSA stake to Konsolidacni Banka, the state-controlled Czech banking group. The negotiations were complicated by the role of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which acquired an identical 19.1 per cent holding in CSA at the same time as Air France. EBRD has already written off 30 per cent of this investment, but the remainder was guaranteed by the French group. The bank has maintained throughout the negotiations that, although it hoped to retain its CSA stake, it would only do so if the Czech authorities took over the guarantee. The Czechs have reached a compromise whereby Konsolidacni Banka will have a put option over the EBRD stake which is not exercisable until August 1997. The EBRD board will meet tomorrow to endorse the agreement and the bank is then expected to sign a formal accord in Prague. Air France said it could not comment on the sale until it was finalised. However, the Czech transport ministry yesterday said that the five Air France representatives on the CSA board had resigned on Monday. The Czechs now intend to wait for a year before bringing a new international investor into CSA.</p>

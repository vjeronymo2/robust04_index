			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / French insurance group increases stake in AMB ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), the powerful French state-owned insurer, yesterday announced it had increased its stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-largest insurer, to just over 25 cent, further complicating relations between the two. AGF's move, which makes it the biggest shareholder in AMB, is regarded as unfriendly by the German company and could unsettle its efforts to develop an alliance with Fondiaria of Italy, and Royal Insurance of the UK. In response, AMB yesterday bought Fondiaria's 25 per cent stake in Volksfursorge, the Hamburg-based life and property insurer (in which the two companies had shared a controlling interest), releasing funds which could strengthen ties with the Italian insurer in other areas. Fondiaria intends to use the DM600m (Pounds 209m) proceeds from the transaction to help fund a new European joint venture into which Fondiaria, AMB and Royal aim to pool their European subsidiaries. Discussions on the formation of the joint venture are currently underway. Analysts are speculating, however, that Fondiaria could also use some of the money to increase its own stake in AMB. Fondiaria holds an option on an 18.8 per cent stake in AMB sold by Royal for Pounds 250m to Credit Suisse late last year. The French group, which has so far spent FFr3.2bn (Pounds 320m) on buying AMB shares, said yesterday it did not plan to increase its stake, but that it would negotiate with the German group's management to get full voting rights for its shares. AGF has 9 per cent of the voting rights and needs to register the rest of its 25 per cent with the AMB board to acquire full voting rights and a board seat. But last year, AMB warned that it was not prepared to register the French holding. Subsequently both Fondiaria and AMB have cold-shouldered AGF - although Royal, which already operates a co-operation agreement with AGF in the US - appears less hostile. Mr Peter Matthiesen, AMB spokesman, said that AGF was merely seeking to 'obtain a foothold' in Germany for its own advantage, and the European joint venture would be of mutual benefit to the other three parties.

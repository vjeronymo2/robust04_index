			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CNG contends Standard E should be modified to permit disclosure of sales and marketing information: only the sharing of transportation related information would be prohibited. CNG recognizes the Commission took a contrary position in Order No. 497&hyph;E, but urges the Commission to reexamine that conclusion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CNG argues that the transmission of sales and marketing information is unrelated to the pipeline's exercise of market power over transportation, which is the only legitimate basis for restricting disclosure. CNG also claims Standard E may work to the disadvantage of non-affiliated shippers. For example, it states that, during the recent cold weather, it received requests for help in locating gas supplies that, due to Standard E, it was unable to pass along to its marketing affiliates, which may have been able to assist those customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 497&hyph;E, III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs. Preambles at 30,985 &amp; n.19.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission reaffirms its decision in Order No. 497&hyph;E to retain the Standard E restrictions on disclosure of all information (including sales and marketing information) received from non-affiliated shippers. Unlike sales and marketing information that the pipelines obtain from the public domain (and can provide to affiliates under Standard F), sales and marketing information obtained from non-affiliated shippers (Standard E information) is directly related to the pipelines' control over transportation service. While public domain information is available to all, the information pipelines obtain from their customers is not, and Standard E prevents the pipelines from favoring their affiliates by providing them with non-public information that the pipelines have obtained as result of providing transportation service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG contends the Standard prohibits disclosure of information to affiliates when such disclosure may benefit the non-affiliated shipper providing the information to the pipeline. The Standard is intended to protect a non-affiliated shipper against the disclosure of confidential or commercially sensitive information to marketing affiliates. If the non-affiliated shipper finds such disclosure to be in its interest, it can waive its Standard E protection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  El Paso Natural Gas Company,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  67 FERC &para;61,016 at 61,043 (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Standard F_Disclosure of Transportation-Related Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Panhandle Eastern Pipelines and Tenneco contend Standard F should be deleted. They contend even the remaining requirement to disclose transportation-related information needlessly inhibits competition, because the pipelines are uncertain what information they need to publicly disclose and, therefore, may act cautiously by withholding beneficial, legitimate information from affiliates. They assert that with the advent of capacity release, the pipelines' monopoly over transportation has been lessened, so that the rationale for the regulation no longer exists. Further, they contend that all important information related to transportation is now required to be made publicly available on the pipelines' EBBs. Tenneco observes that a less intrusive means of preventing abuse would be for the Commission to specify the transportation information that could provide competitive advantages and require that this information be posted on the EBBS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will retain Standard F. By requiring contemporaneous disclosure of transportation information provided to affiliates, Standard F ensures equal treatment of non-affiliates and affiliates, without undue burden on the pipelines. Not all transportation related information may be disclosed on pipeline EBBs, yet advance knowledge of such transportation information could be of value to an affiliate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission fails to see how capacity release justifies deletion of the Standard. The potential to acquire released capacity does not mitigate the harm to non-affiliates that could result from selective disclosure of important non-public transportation information to affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, a pipeline's future plans to add facilities, such as new receipt or delivery points or additional capacity is not currently disclosed on EBBs, but advance knowledge of such transportation information could be of value to an affiliate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, the Commission is not in the best position to determine all the types of transportation information that may be of competitive significance. The more general requirement of Standard F to post any information pipelines provide to affiliates permits the market itself to determine whether the information is of value. The Standard, therefore, strikes a reasonable balance between the need to protect against undue favoritism to affiliates and the need to permit pipelines to transact business with their affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KGPC also requests clarification of what transportation information must be contemporaneously disclosed. It asserts that in Order Nos. 497 and 497&hyph;A, the Commission stated that specific transportation, sales, and marketing information related to the affiliate's request need not be disclosed. It claims that although the Standard was difficult to interpret even before Order No. 497&hyph;E established different requirements for disclosure of sales and marketing information and transportation information, the distinction between these categories of information has made the determination of what information must be disclosed even more complex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

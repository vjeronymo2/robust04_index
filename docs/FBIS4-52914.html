Regarding this kind of warning by the United States, the  Foreign Ministry said: "If the ROK Government does not take  appropriate measures, such as compensating those who suffered  loses, the United States will exercise Super 301, a retaliatory  measure, against the ROK in September."    Chang Ki-ho, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, stated: "The  government will take resolute measures against the unilateral  measure by the U.S. side, but at the same time we must gather  examples from advanced countries regarding foodstuffs to enhance  the level of our system in this field to the level of advanced  countries."</p>

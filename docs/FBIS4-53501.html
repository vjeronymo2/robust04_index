			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kim Tae-chung, former South Korean </F> opposition leader, by Philippe Pons; place and date not given:  "An Interview with Kim Tae-chung"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pons] The partition of the  peninsula is a problem that obsesses Koreans. You suggested the  creation of a confederation. Do you think that remains a  realistic proposition today?    [Kim] More than ever. When the generals were in power, they  paid no attention to the notion of a confederation, as they  envisioned reunification as a mere takeover. This is the wrong  solution, for two reasons: First of all, there is the German  example; second, such a solution is rife with dangers. It would  give Pyongyang good reason to build nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, China would never accept it. Beijing has vital  interests in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).  Geographically, these two countries share a border over  1,000-km long. In addition, North Korea provides China with  access to the Yellow Sea as well as protection for Manchuria and  the new industrial areas in Northeast China. Should we pursue  such hegemonic ends, I am convinced that China would intervene  directly in North Korea and would provide military support to  Pyongyang if necessary. We must remember that, in the early  1950's, China entered the Korean war to protect North Korea,  which represented vital geostrategic interests for Beijing. The  United States took no account of China's warnings. Moreover,  the German example convinces us to proceed gradually.    In my hypothesis of a confederation of the two Republics,  the  first step would entail maintaining two independent governments  for defense, foreign affairs, and domestic affairs. The  confederation would have one joint body made up of delegates  from the North and the South, it would be in charge of promoting  trade and cooperation, and through restored mutual trust, pave  the way for the ultimate establishment of a federal state,  within 10 years or more. At first North Korea was favorable to  a direct shift to a federation, then its leaders, including  Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, stated they were ready to discuss  my proposal.    [Pons] What do you think the Pyongyang regime is trying to  achieve through its strategy of a nuclear threat?    [Kim] Kim Il-song's objective is not to possess atomic  weapons but to normalize relations with the United States and  the rest of the international community. He uses the "nuclear  threat" as just another asset in negotiations. Let's face it,  even with one or a few bombs, what can he do? North Korea's  economic situation is terrible. If he does not secure some  external aid, economic problems will ultimately topple the  regime. Currently, North Korea's GDP amounts to one-tenth of  South Korea's. Tomorrow, it will fall to one-fifteenth or  one-twentieth. Should North Korea initiate a military conflict,  it could probably destroy part of South Korea, but it could  never win. I believe there is a logic to Kim Il-song's attitude  and that he would not choose a suicidal course of action. He is  looking for an honorable way out.    The DPRK changed its view on reunification three times in  the  last 50 years: Until 1953, Pyongyang attempted to turn the  South into a Communist stronghold through military means. It  failed. Afterward, and until the collapse of the USSR, North  Korea's preferred tactic was subversion. This was a failure as  well. From 1991, North Korea made an about-face, agreeing to  simultaneous entry of both Koreas in the United Nations (which  it had rejected for 40 years). Furthermore, since 1973 when Pak  Chong-hi pushed for cross-recognition of the two Koreas (both by  the United States on the one hand and China and the USSR on the  other hand), Pyongyang has asked Washington to normalize  relations. In practice, only Seoul has benefitted from this  recognition so far, by establishing relations with Russia and  China. On the other hand, no Western country has done the same  with Pyongyang. North Korea can only feel isolated, or even  betrayed, since it has gained nothing in exchange for the de  facto recognition of South Korea as part of the 1991 North-South  agreement.    As far as I am concerned, I can see changes in the position  of North Korea's leaders (a case in point being the statements  made by Kim Il-song on China's successful reformist policy in  September 1993), and I think that we must help them transform  North Korea, rather than backing them against a wall. I believe  in persuasion rather than force: The Cold War did not change  the USSR while detente gradually led to the internal collapse of  the system. The same goes for Vietnam: France and the United  States failed. Another example is Cuba. As for China, change  began when Richard Nixon recognized Beijing. Today, I believe  that China is no longer a threat to the rest of the world.  These lessons from history should make us approach the problem  of North Korea in a more realistic and flexible manner, so that  the country may start changing.    [Pons] How do you explain the current crisis?    [Kim] On the surface, there is confrontation. However, I  think that what is at stake is clear. North Korea is ready to  give up its nuclear program as soon as it is allowed to  normalize relations with the United States. On the other hand,  Washington wants North Korea to give up its nuclear program so  that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty can be extended more  easily in 1995.    [Pons] Is not this the very "deal" the Americans and North  Koreans have been haggling over for months?    [Kim] I believe that mutual stakes and benefits have not  been  identified clearly enough. In other words, the solution can  only be a political one. However, the United States has only  pursued an objective of a technical nature: inspection of  nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  [passage omitted]</p>

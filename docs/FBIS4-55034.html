			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Assets Management Joint Stock Company  [AVRT] has stopped the implementation of privatization deals.  Agnes Papp reports on the background to this decision:    [Papp] The AVRT has suspended its sales activities and has  confined its work until the formation of the new government to  preparing privatization deals for decisions. This is what AVRT  Managing Director Lajos Csepi told this program's correspondent.  He explained his decision by saying that it is clear from the  result of the first round of the parliamentary elections that  the composition of the new government will be different from the  old one and it is conceivable that the new government will  choose a different privatization strategy, and potential new  sales could limit this new concept.    On being asked why he did not respond to similar requests by  the large parliamentary parties in the past, Lajos Csepi said  that he needs government authorization to do it, and the  government and the minister in charge of privatization have  still not ordered the AVRT to suspend sales.</p>

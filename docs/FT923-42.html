			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (1): A time for bargains - Evidence for the profound changes sweeping the industry has emerged with PCs moving to centre stage. But the revolution, which this year has also seen prices tumbling, is presenting problems for the manufacturers THE turnaround in the computer industry is as shattering as if the earth had finally been revealed as the true centre of the galaxy, circled by the sun, moon and planets. In the past year, the lowly personal computer has emerged as the mainstay of the computer business. In just over a decade it has been responsible for carving a new profile for the industry while destroying a market infrastructure built up over 30 years. Some will argue that this has been inevitable since the Apple II made its debut in 1978, despite the refusal of many in the mainframe business either to see or accept the decline of the traditional industry. Nobody now doubts, however, that the future of data processing lies with PCs and workstations linked in powerful networks rather than with mainframes, minicomputers and data centres. Mainframe computers will increasingly be relegated to a peripheral role as network servers, in contrast to their former position at the hub of corporate data processing empires. A number of remarkable developments over the past 12 months or so have signalled the industry's acceptance of the PC in its new role. First, PCs have become commodities. Traditional computer manufacturers and PC vendors have made a dash for the lower ground this year, launching new ranges of PCs at astonishingly low prices. Computer users therefore have the choice between 'value for money' or 'premium' products. Some manufacturers, such as International Business Machines (IBM), have tried to disown their bargain basement products: in Europe, IBM has established a separate, wholly-owned company to sell Ambra PCs. Others, including Compaq, the US-based leader in high performance PCs, and Zenith, the PC arm of Groupe Bull of France are trying to establish the two distinct categories of product within the same range. Hewlett Packard, on the other hand, is opting only for the low-price approach. The large manufacturers have been driven to adopt these strategies by the continuing success of 'no-name' or clone manufacturers who now hold close to half the global PC market. This is powerful evidence that customers are quite prepared to buy on price alone, with the assumption that quality will be acceptable; the success of Compaq's low priced range suggests, however, that the combination of a low price and recognised branding is irresistible. The impact of no-name vendors on the market share of established players has been considerable. In Europe and elsewhere International Data Corporation figures show IBM remains the market leader but its 19.1 per cent share by value is far removed from the greater than 40 per cent share of the market it once held. Compaq and Olivetti at 7.4 per cent and 5 per cent respectively are not surprises, but the German no name vendor Vobis sells more machines in Germany than IBM, and has a 2.1 per cent share of the European market. Figures from the marketing consultancy InfoCorp suggest the European PC market will grow 10 per cent in units this year but decline by 12 per cent in value, a clear indication of the move towards lower priced machines. All of which makes IBM's launch last month of a range of higher priced premium machines for 'power' users something of a gamble. Second, PCs will be portable. The industry has already created a new expression, 'nomadic computing', to describe the latest in small, lightweight computers. The growth of the market for 'notebook' PCs has been spectacular, but it is already diverging. At the upper end are conventional notebook computers weighing only a kilogramme or so; these have been made possible by advances in disk drives as well as liquid crystal display technology. They use the same 32-bit chips as their desk-top counterparts and can do virtually everything the larger machines can do. With such power in a easy-to-carry package, it is hard to justify using desk-top machines. There is, however, a need to link into office networks and manufacturers such as Compaq are catering for this with fully wired desktop docking stations into which a portable computer can be clipped. Zenith has reduced the docking pod to a simple backplate, a forerunner, perhaps, of a time when computing power and information will be accessed through a wall socket. At the other end of the scale are tiny computers which compress much of the functionality of a full scale computer into a package which will fit into a pocket. Hewlett Packard has had success with a pocket computer which has Lotus 1-2-3, the most popular spreadsheet, already installed. Psion, a UK-based manufacturer, is collaborating with Motorola, the world leader in cellular radio, to develop a handheld computer with an inbuilt radio modem. The devices will be able to transmit data over public switched data networks, enabling, for example, a sales representative to maintain constant contact with head office. Much of the excitement in nomadic computing, however, is focused on Apple's yet-to-be launched 'Newton' personal digital assistant. The prototype is about 7 by 4 inches, a black plastic box with a screen but no keyboard. Communication with Newton is via an electronic stylus, used to write on the screen. The idea is that the user scrawls notes, records appointments or draws diagrams. Newton automatically orders and files the information. Mr John Scully, Apple chief executive believes the market for personal digital assistants will be enormous by the end of the century. Somewhere between fully-fledged computer and pocket machine comes Olivetti's 'Quaderno', an innovative cross between an electronic organiser and a notebook, complete with integral digital sound recording facility. Third, PC marketing has become more important than technology. The PC did not evolve from the traditional computer industry, but is a product of the semiconductor business. Early PCs had hundreds of silicon chips but integration is steadily reducing the number. Eventually, a PC may well comprise a single chip in a plastic box. It is hard for traditional manufacturers to add value to such a product. Intel, which dominates the market for the microprocessor chips used in IBM-compatible computers and Microsoft which makes the MS/DOS operating system used in most of these machines, have won the lion's share of the market's gross profit, with everybody else fighting for the rest. This explains the diversity of low cost channels now used to distribute PCs. The list includes mail order, 'off-the-page' (magazine) advertising, and business superstores. Although the PC has established itself as the centre of the computing galaxy, it is by no means certain which technologies will prove to be shooting stars and which will vanish into black holes. At a recent industry conference in Vienna, Mr Scott McNealy, the combative chief executive of Sun Microsystems, one of the fastest growing workstation companies, picked his winners in processors, operating systems and distributed objects (a new programming technology). Not surprisingly, Sun technology was among the winners in each category along with Intel and IBM in processors, IBM and Microsoft in operating systems and IBM, Apple and Microsoft in distributed objects. Apple's unique technology has a place of its own in Mr McNealy's firmament. But he consigned to the dustbin of computing history IBM's 3090 mainframe and AS400 processors along with Digital Equipment's VAX and Mips reduced instruction set processor. He was equally dismissive of operating systems such as IBM's mainframe MVS and VM and newcomers such as OSF/1 and Steve Jobs' NextStep. The industry is in such a state of ferment that the accuracy of Mr McNealy's predictions should be apparent within the next 12 months.</p>

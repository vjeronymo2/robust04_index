			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Toru Kunimatsu] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 27 Apr -- A diplomatic source disclosed  on 27 April that the EC Commission has proposd that Japan create  an arena where experts from Japan and the European Union (EU)  can hold discussions on deregulation on a regular basis.    Earlier, the commission gave Japan a 31-point list  requesting  improvements in its regulation system, including liberalization  of financial and other markets, investment stimulation, and  import expansion. These matters were supposed to be discussed  at the Japan-EU ministerial talks starting on 22 April, but the  talks have been postponed due to the political chaos in Japan.    Japan included deregulation in a guideline for external  economic reform adopted last month, and plans to work out  concrete measures for it by the end of June. By securing a  channel of dialogue on deregulation, the EU appears to want to  "monitor" Japan in making certain that its deregulation program  is put into practice.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Bundesbank support for Kohl solidarity pact RAPID agreement on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's proposed government-employers-unions solidarity pact will provide a sound basis for cuts in Germany's leading interest rates, Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's central council, said yesterday. This week's changes in money market rates demonstrated that the central bank was persisting with its relaxation of monetary policy, he said, although lower lending rates alone would not revive the economy. Mr Jochimsen's remarks, made in a television interview yesterday, stepped up the pressure on political, industrial and union leaders to make firm commitments on pay, investment and public spending cuts to aid recovery in the east. The offer of rate cuts as an incentive for success came as the Chancellor's office promised that negotiations, hampered by disagreement over social spending cuts, would be speeded and the pact finalised this month. The intervention from Mr Jochimsen, president of the North-Rhine Westphalian state bank, followed a series of broad hints from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, that reductions in the Lombard and discount rates would not be possible without a pact and consequent cuts in budget deficits. It coincided with the start of crucial negotiations on public sector pay at which government representatives offered the 2.3m members of the oTV union a 2.5 per cent rise this year. This matches the federal government's target for overall spending growth this year. Regional governments, for which pay bills are the biggest single budget item, are under pressure to keep expenditure increases to 3 per cent. West German inflation is expected to average between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent this year. Although public service unions have claimed average increases of 5.5 per cent, they are expected eventually to settle for a figure close to or under the inflation rate. This would be an important indicator, both for the success of the solidarity pact and for the chances of action from the central bank. Negotiations ended without result yesterday and are expected to resume on January 22. Mr Jochimsen criticised the popular 'fixation' on the Lombard and discount rates as creating the impression that nothing had changed, while short-term money market rates had fallen about one percentage point since September and long-term rates had dropped 1.3 points.</p>

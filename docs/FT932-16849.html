			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: A recipe for more stable small business financing Sir, Your editorial, 'Bankers and small business' (March 1) reported the view of Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, that 'the system of financing small business should be fundamentally rethought'. I agree. However, his prescription is flawed. Neither tax breaks nor interest subsidies would have prevented the small business lending disaster which UK banks experienced. Preventing its recurrence rests in part with banks adopting three policies leading to more conservative small company management. First, all long-term lending should be as term loans with fixed amortisation schedules providing for full repayment of the sum borrowed. This will reduce the likelihood that the bank will find itself providing permanent capital in the form of short-term debt. Second, all overdrafts should require that the borrower not use the overdraft for 90 consecutive days in each business year. This will help guarantee that overdrafts are for seasonal purposes or infrequent occurrences only. Third, businesses should be required to increase their principal repayments pound for pound with owners' increases in their personal compensation. This will speed debt repayment, reduce balance sheet leverage and guarantee earnings retention. Without any other actions by banks these three steps will lead to stronger smaller company balance sheets and will mandate more conservative company management. That is what is required to survive a severe recession - not government subsidies to banks. British banks have a special advantage. Their first fixed and floating charge stands ahead of all other claims. The result is they 'enjoy' the benefit of a shift of liabilities to the Treasury when struggling companies do not pay tax liabilities in response to banks' pressures to reduce loans outstanding. That is subsidy enough. Leon H Liebman, 2 Neville Terrace, London SW7 3AT</p>

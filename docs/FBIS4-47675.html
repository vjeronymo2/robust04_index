			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 29 SAPA -- A 19-year-old police  constable, held up by a motorist he confronted at Jan Smuts  Airport, had a narrow escape on Friday [29 April] morning when  the motorist produced a gun and pulled the trigger while  pointing it at the policeman's stomach. The gun failed to fire.    Constable Stephan Botha had been manning a roadblock at the  airport's entrance when a yellow Toyota Hi-Ace [minibus],  bearing the registration NYY301T showed no signs of intending to  stop, according to a police report. After the failed attempt  had been made on the policeman's life, Constable Botha managed  to hit the motorist in the face with the butt of his firearm  after which the man ran away. Two other occupants of the  vehicle also tried to run away. "But Constable Jaco Botha, also  19, and Sgt Michael Brennen, 25, managed to arrest them," said  the report.    Two 9mm pistols, magazines and ammunition were recovered  from  the vehicle which had been robbed from its owner in Isando  shortly before the incident.</p>

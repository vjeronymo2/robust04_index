The proposed regulations revise certain requirements in the current regulations to maximize agency discretion in using these flexibilities. The 3 R's were authorized by the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before August 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments may be sent or delivered to Donald J.

These regulations finalized interim regulations that were published on March 28, 1991 (56 FR 12833). Overall, use of the 3 R's has been limited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a memorandum to the Interagency Advisory Group on October 24, 1991, OPM advised agencies to consider using the 3 R's before requesting new or increased special salary rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305. In most situations, the use of the 3 R's to solve staffing problems will be less expensive than special rates. Special rates are basic pay for such purposes as retirement benefits, premium pay, and promotions, whereas the 3 R's are not basic pay for any purposes. The 3 R's are also generally less expensive than superior qualifications appointments. Superior qualifications appointments, like special salary rates, have a lasting effect on future pay entitlements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When necessary, the 3 R's may be used in combination with special salary rates and superior qualifications appointments. However, payment of one of the 3 R's alone may be the most appropriate solution for a staffing problem. For example, a candidate may prefer a lump-sum payment to address his or her immediate needs instead of an increase in basic pay that would be received in relatively small amounts over a long period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies have found it difficult to use the 3 R's and have requested changes in the current regulations. OPM also has approved variations to the requirements bonus regulations. (This is discussed below under appointments required for recruitment bonus purposes.) OPM is proposing the regulatory changes discussed below to increase agencies' discretion in administering the 3 R's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recruitment Bonuses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Candidate quality. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;&sect;575.101, 575.104(b)(2), 575.104(c)(1) and (c)(2) (i) and (iii), and 575.108(b), the current regulations allow payment of a recruitment bonus only when, in the absence of such a bonus, agencies would encounter difficulty in filling the position with a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> high quality candidate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Same agencies' recruitment needs are not limited to high quality candidates. Therefore, they have not considered offering recruitment bonuses before requesting approval of special salary rates. (OPM approval of special rates is not dependent upon the recruitment of high quality candidates.) The proposed regulations would allow an agency to pay a recruitment bonus to any qualified candidate the agency wishes to recruit for a difficult-to-fill position. The agency would determine the level of candidate quality it needs to target. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Length of appointment and service agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.103, the current definition of ``employee'' for recruitment bonus purposes requires an appointment of at least 2 years. The proposed regulations would delete the language regarding the minimum length of appointment; however, since, in &sect;575.106(b), the proposed regulations require a service agreement of at least 6 months, any appointment would have to be at least that long. Currently, a minimum 12-month service agreement is required. Reducing the requirement to 6 months would give agencies more flexibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Break-in service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To meet the current definition of ``newly appointed'' in &sect;575.103, a candidate with prior Federal Government service must have a break in service of at least 1 year. The proposed regulations would reduce this break-in-service restriction to 90 days. This parallels the 90-day-break-in-service restriction for superior qualifications appointments in &sect;531.203(b)(2). It allows agencies to consider paying a recruitment bonus in more circumstances as an alternative to paying advanced in-hire rates for superior qualifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations add two authorized exceptions to the break-in-service rule in &sect;575.103. The first is a permanent appointment that follows a provisional appointment (as defined in &sect;316.403). The second is an appointment that follows a temporary appointment, provided the temporary appointment was neither full-time nor the principal employment of the candidate. This would allow agencies to pay recruitment bonuses in situations like those approved by OPM as variations to the current regulations. Under the variations, bonuses were paid to medical officers who served in temporary appointments prior to being offered permanent appointments. The medical officers did not meet the break-in-service requirement under current regulations. OPM determined that payment of recruitment bonuses was appropriate because the temporary positions were neither full-time nor the candidates' principal employment. Also, the inability of the hiring officials to take advantage of such opportunities would have resulted in lengthy recruitment efforts to find qualified candidates with the required specialized skills. (These variations were reported in former Federal Personnel Manual Bulletins 575&hyph;4, April 20, 1993; 575&hyph;5, October 25, 1993; and 575&hyph;6, November 12, 1993; and in OPM's Provisional Notice No. 575&hyph;1, May 25, 1994.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.104(c)(1), the current regulations for recruitment bonuses require a written determination made on a case-by-case basis for each employee. The proposed regulations would allow an agency to make a single written determination applicable to a group of candidates for positions that the agency targets as difficult to fill. This would not require OPM's prior approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.108(b), the current regulations for recruitment bonuses require an annual written report by each agency on its use of recruitment bonuses. The proposed regulations would remove this requirement. However, each agency would retain responsibility for monitoring its use of recruitment bonuses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

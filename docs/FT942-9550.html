			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Motoring: Car for a soft day - Stuart Marshall tests the Saab 900 convertible in the Irish rain The Irishman and I looked out at the Atlantic rollers breaking on a rocky beach. 'Sure, 'tis a nice soft day,' he said. I knew what he meant. It was fine rain, but it would have soaked through a shirt and sweater in about two minutes. Yet, the wipers of the Saab 900 convertible on slow setting easily kept the screen clear. Many might have thought that Ireland, where all those soggy Atlantic fronts first hit land, was an odd place to hold the international press launch of a convertible. I would not disagree. But there was method in the sensible Swedes' apparent madness. The 900 convertible is not one of those fair-weather soft-tops. The hood is thick and triple-layered, with a proper glass back window incorporating defroster elements. And all you have to do to turn a virtual saloon into a completely open car is release two clips and press a button. Then, with a whirring of electric motors, the hood folds behind the back seats and disappears under a hard panel, flush with the body top. Lowering it takes about 25 seconds. Irish weather being what it is, I was relieved to discover it went up again just as quickly. The 900 convertible really is a car to use confidently when the forecast is bright periods and frequent showers, heavy at times. There is a choice of three multi-valve engines: a 150 horsepower, 2.3-litre; 185hp, two-litre turbo; and 170hp, 2.5-litre V6. Five-speed manual transmission is standard. A four-speed automatic is a Pounds 995 optional extra on the 2.3i and 2.5 V6, but not the 2.0-litre turbo. Compared with the three-door 900 hard-top coupe, of which more in a moment, the convertible has slightly softer suspension. The ride was excellent on the nearest thing to a motorway you can find in south-west Ireland. But on the rough switchbacks that pass for country roads, it was not difficult to make the V6 automatic's front suspension touch the bump stops. To be fair, I was driving it much harder than a typical owner would and the manual gearbox 2.3i and two-litre turbo - lighter at the front end than the two-pedal V6 - were less inclined to use up their suspension travel. Saab has gone to great lengths to make the convertible body as rigid as possible; it is 70 per cent stiffer in torsion than the previous one, itself a standard-setter for freedom from shake. It would be too much to expect the 900 convertible to be as rock-solid as a 900 hard-top coupe, but it was only when driving on the roughest stretches that I felt a suspicion of sideways movement through the steering column. (As a passenger, it was not noticeable.) At moderate speeds, there is little noise or wind buffeting with the hood down and side windows up - not much more when all four side windows are retracted by the single touch of a button. Full-sized people can sit comfortably in the rear seats and the boot is of practical size, with an opening like a cat flap in the back seat allowing skis to be carried. Seats are leather-trimmed. The driver's air bag is standard and the front passenger's an optional extra, although both have belts that pre-tension on impact. The front screen pillars - stout enough to support the car's weight  -inevitably are a bit awkward to see round. And, like those of all soft-tops, the 900's hood does create a small blind spot in the rear quarter. Unquestionably, the most joyous one to drive is the two-litre turbo. Saab says it is good for 143mph (230kph). Much more importantly, it is by far the quickest from 40-60mph in fourth gear and 50-75mph (80-120kph) in fifth. Safe, rapid pick-up, not tyre-smoking standing starts, is what matters in the real world although, for the record, the turbo's 0-60mph (0-96kph) time is an impressive eight seconds. At fairly low revolutions, the turbo produced enough torque (pulling power at a given engine speed) to amble gently through villages in fourth or fifth gears. Given its head on the open road, the twin balance shafts kept the engine as smooth as a six at high revolutions. The 2.5 V6's performance is quite close to the turbo's, while that of the less powerful 2.3i is more than adequate for most 900 convertible buyers. The firmer suspension of the coupe might have made for a joggly ride on Ireland's crumbling byways but, on the smooth roads of Italy, the hard-top was a delight. 'You will,' said Saab's veteran rally ace, Erik Carlsson, as I set off that morning, 'find our new 900 coupe is a real Saab.' Prices will be Pounds 23,995 for the 2.3i, Pounds 27,895 (2.5 V6) and Pounds 27,995 (two-litre turbo) when they reach British showrooms next month.</p>

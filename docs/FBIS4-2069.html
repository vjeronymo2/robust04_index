			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 5 (XINHUA) -- A pension insurance  system has just taken shape in Shanghai, marking the largest  city as the leader among all Chinese regions in reforming the  old retirement system.    Official sources here said four million workers of some  20,000 enterprises and government organs, i.e. about four-fifths  of the city's entire workforce, are now covered by the pension  insurance.    Whereas pensions were paid to retirees solely by their  employers under the old retirement system, the new premiums for  pension insurance are shared between the government, employers  and retirees.    This is believed to have saved a huge sum of pension money  for those old state-owned enterprises with many retirees on the  rolls. The city had about 1.66 million retirees at the end of  1992, requiring a payment of 4.27 billion yuan in pension a year.    While this number of retirees already is equal to 32.5  percent of those in employment, it is predicted that the city's  pension budget would have to face a sharp rise in retirees in  the coming 20 to 30 years.    The new system also makes pensions adjustable by the  previous  year's living costs index, thus reducing the risk of  inflationary effects, the sources said.    From April 1 last year when the new pension system began to  prevail, each retiree in Shanghai got 21.5 yuan a month as a  compensation for price rises, which has resulted in total  pensions in 1993 increasing by 19 percent over the total for  1992.    The new pension system also removes or reduces an obstacle  in  changing jobs, for in the old days, since the length of  employment was a primary factor in deciding one's pension money,  job changing often risked pension decreases.    The premiums for pension insurance are now calculated at  three percent of one's monthly salary in the previous year, the  sources added.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DICKINSON WATCHES SISTER'S CARE  </P> <P> Angie Dickinson says she and her two sisters were never close while trying to  survive life in North Dakota with an alcoholic father.  </P> <P> But all that has changed for the 59-year-old actress now that she's taking care  of her sister Mary Lou, 61, who has Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> "I'd made my own diagnosis of Alzheimer's. I'm a news junkie, and I read a lot  of medical stories," Dickinson said in the Nov. 12 issue of People magazine.  "In 1986 I told Mary Lou that I thought she might have Alzheimer's. I hope I  didn't frighten her."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based actress oversees the care required by Mary Lou, who has  lost the ability to bathe, dress and feed herself.  </P></p>

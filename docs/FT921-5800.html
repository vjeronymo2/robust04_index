			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Loophole continues to disrupt poll tax cases TENS of thousands of court cases for poll tax non-payment are still disrupted because of the confusion over the use of computer evidence before magistrates, according to local authorities. At a seminar last week organised by local authority associations, councils reported that many cases had been withdrawn or adjourned until later this month or beyond. This followed the ruling by magistrates in Coventry, upheld by the High Court, that computer evidence was 'hearsay' and not admissible. Ministers have emphasised that summonses could be issued for a date after the legislation which will allow computer evidence is passed. The bill ensuring this is due to become law in the next week or so. The councils, however, suggest that in some areas the summonses have been put off for longer than ministers advised. Tory-controlled Croydon Borough Council decided not to issue 25,000 summonses, scheduled to be heard about now, after advice from the local magistrates' clerk. These will not now be issued until next month for hearing in May. Labour-controlled Birmingham withdrew 10,000 cases last week and is issuing no more summonses 'until the law is clear'. The government said last month that it would legislate to put the admissibility of computer evidence beyond doubt - and decided to do so through the bill to replace the poll tax with the council tax. It refused to accept Labour's offer of co-operation on an emergency bill to clear the Commons in a single day. The difficulties will be highlighted on Wednesday, when the council tax bill returns to the Commons and MPs get their first chance to discuss the issue in detail. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'The figures illustrate the devastating impact of the government's delay in closing the computer-records loophole. Government dithering has brought poll tax debt enforcement to a virtual standstill in many areas.' He condemned as 'a travesty of the truth' ministerial attempts to blame councils for difficulties in collecting the poll tax.</p>

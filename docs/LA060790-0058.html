			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION ILLUSTRATES THE POWER OF INCUMBENCY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: IN LIGHT OF A LONG LIST OF CONTROVERSIES THIS YEAR, SOME OBSERVERS  ARE WONDERING JUST WHAT IT TAKES TO UNSEAT AN OFFICEHOLDER.  </P> <P> The day after several embattled San Diego legislators carrying especially heavy  political baggage easily survived bruising primaries, a plaintive and somewhat  sobering question was being asked Wednesday in local political circles:  </P> <P> If sexual harassment charges, criticism over living out of town, questions  about alleged bribes or payoffs, acceptance of huge self-approved pay raises,  using state-paid employees as a kind of private chauffeur service and  sub-mediocre records are not enough for a challenger to dislodge an  officeholder, then what exactly does it take to beat an incumbent?  </P> <P> "You can't do it," political consultant Jim Johnston said emphatically. "Forget  it -- you're wasting your time."  </P> <P> "Obviously, that's a question that I don't know the answer to," said consultant  Tom Shepard, wryly referring to his efforts in Celia Ballesteros' unsuccessful  campaign against Assemblyman Peter Chacon (D-San Diego). "I'd say it's close to  impossible."  </P> <P> Many consultants, political activists and candidates themselves drew the same  message from Tuesday's primary, in which a handful of San Diego congressional  and state legislative incumbents mired in ethics-related controversies easily  turned back challenges from within their own party.  </P> <P> Even as the primary results were analyzed, attention shifted to November -- in  particular, to what lessons or impact Tuesday holds for the general election.  </P> <P> With many predicting that the fall's campaigns will be lackluster by comparison  to what was the most competitive primary season in recent San Diego political  history, one of the few contests that may be a race in more than name only is  the 78th District rematch between GOP Assemblyman-elect Jeff Marston and former  Democratic San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch.  </P> <P> Marston's narrow three-percentage-point victory in their special runoff to fill  the vacancy created by Democrat Lucy Killea's election to the state Senate,  combined with the district's relative partisan parity, presage a potentially  compelling showdown for the two-year term at stake in November.  </P> <P> Republican Randall (Duke) Cunningham also is expected to run an aggressive,  well-financed campaign against Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) in their 44th  Congressional District contest, a race likely to focus on the by now well-known  sexual harassment charges lodged against Bates by two former female staff  members.  </P> <P> "Bates is just another MiG, and an unethical one," Cunningham, a much-decorated  Navy fighter pilot who served in Vietnam, said on Election Night. The  Democrats' 54%-34% registration edge in the district, however, significantly  lessens Cunningham's chances of shooting down the four-term congressman.  </P> <P> Indeed, though several incumbents were kept on the defensive by a barrage of  criticism from their primary opponents, the consensus is that Tuesday's winners  will be even more politically secure in November, in large measure because of  their lopsided voter registration advantages in their districts. Primary  challengers, while still having to overcome incumbents' name-recognition and  fund-raising advantages, at least do not have those problems exacerbated by the  demographic hurdle that confronts opponents from the opposite party.  </P> <P> A vivid illustration of how the dynamics of the campaigns change dramatically  from June to November can be seen in the 76th Assembly District, where  Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita) survived by the narrowest margin -- 52%  to 48%, with some absentee ballots remaining to be counted -- of any state  legislator from San Diego County.  </P> <P> As she prepares for her November race against Democratic nominee Stephen  Thorne, however, Hunter can take comfort in the knowledge that the GOP holds an  intimidating 55%-32% registration advantage in her North San Diego  County-Riverside County district. (Hunter's primary opponent, anti-abortion  activist Connie Youngkin, still clung to hope Wednesday that the uncounted  absentee ballots could change the primary's outcome. In order to offset her  2,500-vote deficit, however, Youngkin would have to receive an overwhelmingly  large percentage of the remaining absentees.)  </P> <P> "If there were going to be any upsets, they would have come in the primary,"  said lawyer Byron Georgiou, who heavily outspent U.S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San  Diego) but still lost by a more than 3-2 margin in their 44th District  Democratic primary. "General elections usually are pretty much foregone  conclusions."  </P> <P> With statistics showing that, historically, more than 95% of incumbents are  reelected, the difficulties inherent in trying to unseat an officeholder hardly  rank as a new or startling conclusion. Between 1984 and 1988, for example,  incumbents lost only five of the 495 congressional and state legislative races  in California. Before Tuesday, the only congressman defeated this year was Rep.  Donald (Buzz) Lukens (R-Ohio), who was convicted on morals charges involving a  16-year-old girl.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, several incumbents' victories came amid the kind of debilitating  controversies that often end political careers.  </P> <P> Bates, Chacon and Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), for example,  have faced official investigations into their conduct. In Bates' case, the  probe ended with a reprimand from the House Ethics Committee on the sexual  harassment charges, while Mojonnier paid a $13,200 fine for double-billing the  state and her campaign committee for business trips.  </P> <P> Mojonnier and Chacon also faced questions over their acceptance of large  honorariums -- $10,000 and $7,500, respectively -- from groups with a direct  interest in legislation before them. Both also ranked very low in the  California Journal's evaluation of state legislators' overall effectiveness --  in Chacon's case, next-to-last. The incumbents' other liabilities include  Bates' vote to increase congressional salaries from $89,500 to $120,750,  Mojonnier's use of state-paid sergeants-at-arms for private tasks and the fact  that Chacon's primary residence is in Northern California.  </P> <P> Any one of those factors, consultants argue, would represent a major "negative"  in any campaign. The fact that Bates, Chacon and Mojonnier handily won  renomination while having to deflect criticism over multiple negatives --  Mojonnier's 11 percentage points was the closest victory margin in the three  races -- offers sobering evidence, strategists add, of incumbents' virtual  political invincibility.  </P> <P> "If this stuff wasn't enough to take out at least one of those guys, then I  don't know how much more it takes," said consultant Johnston, who observed  those races from the sidelines. "What it tells challengers it that they're  taking up a lost cause, and the message it sends to incumbents is that they can  pretty much do anything they damn well please and not have to worry about it."  </P> <P> "The picture is not an encouraging one for challengers," said consultant Bill  Wachob, who worked on Bates' campaign. "We were outspent about 2 to 1 by a  strong opponent who ran a technically good campaign, and that still wasn't  nearly enough."  </P> <P> Explanations for Tuesday's results go beyond the visibility, fund-raising edge  and other traditional advantages of incumbency. In most races, a strong case  can be made that factors peculiar to that contest also figured prominently in  the outcome.  </P> <P> Mojonnier, for example, clearly benefited from having the anti-incumbent vote  in the 75th District splintered among three challengers, allowing her to win  the primary with only 39% of the vote. In a one-on-one race against her major  opponent, former Del Mar Mayor Ronnie Delaney, Mojonnier might easily have  lost, many consultants say.  </P> <P> Ballesteros' challenge to Chacon, meanwhile, proceeded haltingly until a change  in campaign management with only about three weeks remaining in the race. And  Bates was able to chip away at Georgiou's own credibility by emphasizing the  challenger's decision to move into the district after dropping out of the  special 78th Assembly District contest.  </P> <P> In addition, with so many competitive primaries vying for attention, none of  the races attracted the kind of saturation news coverage that can help a  challenger effectively compete with a better-known, usually better-financed  incumbent.  </P> <P> Despite the controversies swirling around them, the incumbents' popularity --  or at least longtime familiarity -- among their constituents also cannot be  underestimated.  </P> <P> "Jim Bates has put to rest the notion that he can ever -- ever -- be challenged  on his home turf," said Larry Remer, another of Bates' consultants. "People  have heard Jim Bates called every name imaginable, but that didn't cause them  to forget that he's represented the district well for a long time. This was a  real vote of confidence."  </P> <P> Others suggested that the sharply negative campaigns waged by many of the  challengers provoked a backlash among voters. Though the incumbents' woes all  but dictated such an approach, voters' growing disenchantment with "hit" pieces  may have neutralized the anti-incumbent sentiment that many had predicted would  be seen this year in reaction to recent scandals in Sacramento and Washington.  </P> <P> "It's not enough anymore to just tell voters, 'He's a dirt bag and I'm not, so  vote for me,' " said Marston consultant Sara Katz. "The mistake some of these  people made was in spending too much time telling people why not to vote for  their opponent and not enough about why they should vote for them."  </P> <P> To bring the issue into focus, however, one must ask one other question: If all  of this hindsight advice had been available and acted upon before the primary,  would the outcome have been different?  </P> <P> "Hell no!" consultant Johnston said. "Incumbents are lifers."  </P> <P> He paused, then added: "Well, maybe a felony arrest the week before the  election would help. But I doubt even that would change things."  </P></p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Fowler joins Major in tax warning SIR Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, yesterday joined Mr John Major, the prime minister, in cautioning against growing calls for the government to increase taxes to tackle its mounting deficit. In an ITV television interview the Conservative party chairman appeared to side with the growing number of Tory MPs who have expressed disquiet at arguments by Lord Howe, the former chancellor, that tax rises may be necessary and inevitable. 'The Conservative party is and remains the party of low taxation,' he said. Mr Major last week also appeared to reject increases in income tax or value added tax in an BBC interview with Sir David Frost. Sir Norman's comments came after the end of Mr Norman Lamont's traditional two-day brainstorming session at the Kent country house of Chevening where the chancellor met officials to discuss options for the coming budget. The party chairman was en route to a similar meeting at Chequers where Mr Major was yesterday holding talks with senior Downing Street policy staff. The meeting reviewed ways of adding momentum to the government's programme and finding ways of highlighting its underlying philosophy. Senior Conservative Central Office officials are due at Chequers today to discuss a radical reorganisation of the party and plans for tackling an overdraft nearing Pounds 20m. Two reviews of the party's organisation - one of professional employees, the other of the voluntary section - are also on the agenda. An announcement of a comprehensive restructuring of the party is due early in February. Under plans announced last week by Mr Paul Judge, the new Central Office director-general, annual overspending running at Pounds 5m is to be brought into balance by 1996. The reforms include the loss of up to 60 professional staff at the Smith Square headquarters and regional offices. A scheme devised by Sir Basil Feldman, chairman of the National Union of Conservative Associations, the party's voluntary wing, also envisages the creation of a new board of management for the party as part of an overhaul of its command structures. Members of the Charter movement, a pressure group for more internal democracy in the party, have campaigned for constituency associations to have the right to elect the chairman of the board. A senior official said last night there was no likelihood of the suggestion being adopted as it was crucial the party chairman be appointed by the party leader and had his or her confidence. 'There are only about two Charter supporters on the National Union executive. That amounts to about 150 people in all,' he said.</p>

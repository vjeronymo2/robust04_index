			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Pakistan raises tax base to cut budget deficit THE Pakistani government yesterday announced an annual budget containing new taxes to narrow its deficit while claiming that it intends to carry on with liberalisation of the economy. The measures did not appear to hit ordinary poor Pakistanis directly, as costs for domestic consumption of basic needs including food, electricity and water were untouched. Among measures announced to raise additional revenues of PR6.8bn (Pounds 152m) under the central excise budget, telephone call rates were raised by some 30 per cent. A 5 per cent duty was also introduced on unprocessed fabrics exported from Pakistan. An additional tax was announced for owners of cars of over 1,000 cc to encourage use of smaller vehicles. Mr Sartaj Aziz, finance minister, said in his budget speech that the government intends to widen the sales tax net to include items such as air-conditioners, ammunition and photographic equipment. Computerisation is to be used to improve efficiency of the tax system to broaden the tax base. Successive Pakistani governments have been unable to prevent large-scale tax evasion due to widespread corruption in assessment and collection systems. The government hopes for an additional PR3.62bn annually from improvements in collection of income, wealth and property taxes. Some incentives were also announced for the private sector, in an effort to continue with liberalisation of the economy. The budget provided details of a five-year plan under which a tax rate of 66 per cent for banking companies would be reduced to 55 per cent, and for publicly held companies from 44 per cent to 30 per cent. Tariffs ranging up to 90 per cent were reduced by 10 per cent on import of refrigerators, televisions and washing machines. Yesterday's budget appeared to be an attempt by the two-year-old government of Mr Nawaz Sharif to avoid measures which would be unpopular among the majority of the population. Most Pakistanis are not likely to be hit by such measures as increased telephone costs or car tax. But the government appeared to have made no headway on difficult decisions such as cutting the large defence budget.</p>

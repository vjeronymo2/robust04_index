			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Mauricio Flores] </F>   [Text] Tegucigalpa -- National Congress deputies yesterday  approved a resolution permitting the Banco Central de Honduras  [BCH] to auction off exchange as a means of stabilizing the  lempira. The resolution compels assembly plants to sell to  authorized exchange brokers the dollars needed for financing  costs and operational expenses.    The Finance Ministry forwarded this proposal to Congress on  Wednesday. The proposal suggests amending Article 1 of the Law  on the Entry of U.S. Dollars From Exports because in the past  few weeks there has been a tendency toward a rapid depreciation  of the national currency caused mainly by speculation.    The congressional session was attended by BCH President Hugo  Noe Pino, who briefed the deputies on the purpose of the measure  and the BCH's reasons for it. U.S. dollars have been exchanged  on the black market in several industrial zones, thus  contributing to speculation's harmful effects.    Pino said the aggregate value of the assembly plants  fluctuates between $70 million and $100 million. When  corporations need lempiras, they have been exchanging some of  this amount on the black market rather than through registered  brokers.    It was reported that the changes are aimed at eliminating  legal obstacles so that if necessary the BCH can auction U.S.  dollars for as long as deemed advisable to try and stabilize the  lempira, a mechanism that has been used in other countries with  satisfactory results.    Article 1 used to forbid the BCH to auction U.S. dollars.  But the amendment permits use of this instrument of monetary  policy.    The amended article states: Foreign exchange from exports is  a national economic property. Persons or legal entities that  export goods must report to the BCH in advance every export, the  amount, value, and destination of the goods to be exported, the  probable date of the export, and the type of currency in which  payment will be received.    "Export of goods originating in free zones, industrial zones  of processing for export, retail exports, and those made by  assembly plants according to the regulation of this law shall be  excepted. Nevertheless, the foreign exchange transacted by  persons or legal entities in free zones or industrial processing  zones, including operators and assembly plants, to defray costs  or expenses in local currency, will have to comply with BCH  instructions."    At the outset, Carlos Kattan, National Party deputy for  Cortes Department, who almost never attends congressional  sessions, opposed a proposal to exchange foreign currency  through brokers, who would then report to the BCH. Arguing for  his position, Kattan said this procedure scares away investors  because it could be regarded as state interventionism.    The motion was ultimately withdrawn. Congress President  Carlos Flores Facusse said that this measure will help stabilize  local currency.</p>

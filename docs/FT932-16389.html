			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Trustees try to protect coal pension fund surplus TRUSTEES of British Coal's staff pension scheme have asked the company to set aside nearly a third of the scheme's Pounds 1bn surplus to guarantee inflation-proofed pensions for members indefinitely. If British Coal agrees, it will make the scheme much more expensive for the government to fund if, as believed, its privatisation plans for British Coal include an offer to take over funding of the scheme for current and deferred pensioners, in exchange for receiving its assets. A similar proposal has been made to British Rail's pension scheme. In recent years, pensions have been increased in line with inflation but scheme rules do not require that trustees automatically approve such increases. Following the staff scheme's most recent actuarial valuation, the trustees proposed that Pounds 300m from the surplus be set aside to fund index-linked pensions and to cover the scheme's loss of dividend income due to advance corporation tax changes. They also proposed that Pounds 470m be spent on improving pension terms for scheme members. The rest of the surplus will be earmarked for further British Coal contributions holidays. Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that British Coal has offered to make the trustees a temporary interest-free 'loan' of a disputed Pounds 452m sum, intended to represent a deferred payment to cover enhanced pensions for redundant members of the staff scheme. Trustees had agreed several years ago to allow British Coal to defer making the payment until it actually became necessary to pay pensions, although the sum is recognised as a liability in British Coal's latest accounts. But six weeks ago, the Department of Trade and Industry asked British Coal to consider taking the payment out of its share of the scheme surplus. British Coal, after consulting its lawyers, has tentatively agreed. After the current contributions holiday ends in 1997, the payment would use up all British Coal's share of the surplus. Trustees say they will challenge the move in court on the grounds that the trust deed bars British Coal from taking funds out in any way other than through a contributions holiday. Yesterday Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow energy spokesman, said he had asked the DTI to explain its involvement in seeking to strip the staff scheme of its surplus.</p>

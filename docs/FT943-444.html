			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Arts: National Power Piano final - Concert On Tuesday the National World Power Piano Competition - no, sorry: the National Power World Piano Competition - came to its finals in the Royal Festival Hall. The label does not trip off the tongue, and it sounds curiously displaced, which may be a negative asset in promoting it as a world-class contest. It was being held for the second time, after a 1991 start which culminated with four deeply unremarkable finalists. For the final 1994 event the Competition fielded not only Dirk Bogarde (as languid presenter) but the Princess of Wales (among the audience), which might seem like missing the point; on the other hand, this year's jury was properly laden with real pianists, not the multi-national pedagogues of 1991. On the strength of this last concerto-round, they identified more promise - though I do not know what the whole field of candidates was like, nor did I hear the crucial semi-final solo recitals. Each contestant had to be ready to play either of two concerti, one to be selected by the jury. Whether its choice was determined by programme-desiderata or by guesses about what each pianist might play best, we were not told. The eventual result seemed to exclude the first possibility, since it crowded the programme with three of the longest concerti in the standard repertoire. Evgene Mursky, the 19-year-old Uzbekistani who won, played Tchaikovsky No. 1 with spirit, flair and much brilliance - hit-or-miss: there were a lot of wrong notes, too many for the patience of most recording engineers. Naturally enough, he cannot yet stamp every fustian passage with authority, and relied upon his conductor Jean-Claude Casadesus to guide the Philharmonia firmly through the piece. Popular opinion takes this concerto for grand pianism, but it is not very pianistic at all - not in the sense in which master composer-pianists write 'pianistic' concerti, with idiomatic piano trouvailles. Tchaikovsky borrowed and devised a lot of ingenious, mechanical colour-effects for some abstract pianist's fingers, hoping that a real pianist might bring them off. Mursky's fingers brought off many of them. Paul Lewis, 22 and British, played Rakhmaninov no. 3, another warhorse, with more calculated assurance and a modicum of brilliance. Unfortunately nearly everyone - perhaps the judges too - remembered the performance by Artur Pizzarro that won him the last-but-one Leeds, and for fluent, committed passion Lewis was not in the same league. The American Jeremy Denk, 24, delivered Brahms One tidily and in modest, decent taste, without intruding any fresh thought upon it. His semi-final recital must have been much better.

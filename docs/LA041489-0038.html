			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKER LOSS TO BALTIMORE ENDS REGULAR-SEASON TITLE CHANCE  </P> <P> Picture an MISL game as a chess match, with San Diego Socker Coach Ron Newman  and Baltimore Blast Coach Kenny Cooper as masters.  </P> <P> And then imagine a game in which the difference between victory and defeat is a  lowly pawn unwittingly assuming the role of a major player.  </P> <P> That's what happened Thursday when the Blast ended the Sockers' slim hopes of  winning the Major Indoor Soccer League regular-season title with a 3-2 overtime  victory, Baltimore's fifth in eight tries against the Sockers this season.  </P> <P> It wasn't a bold move or a cunning defensive strategy that saddled the Sockers  with their 10th loss in 12 overtime games. The game was ultimately decided by,  of all things, a botched line change.  </P> <P> Domenic Mobilio scored his 36th goal of the season 7:33 into sudden death  overtime as the Blast (28-19) reduced the Sockers (25-21) from a would-be title  contender to a team fighting to remain in second place.  </P> <P> Mobilio sneaked behind Socker defender Kevin Crow at the right goal post and  poked Carl Valentine's crossing pass past goalkeeper Victor Nogueira for the  game-winner with three seconds remaining in a bench penalty assessed the  Sockers for having too many men on the field.  </P> <P> "It was a stupid penalty," said Newman, who was deprived of his 200th career  MISL victory. "They didn't win the game; we gave it to them. We gave the goal  away and we gave the game away."  </P> <P> With two games left in the season, San Diego is only a game-and-a-half ahead of  the third-place Dallas Sidekicks (23-22). The Sockers play at Kansas City  Saturday before returning to the Sports Arena Sunday for the regular season  finale against Tacoma.  </P> <P> Zoran Karic caused the bench penalty 5:36 into overtime. He reached the bench  at the end of his shift, but turned around and crossed the touch line on his  way back onto the field when Blast midfielder Kai Haaskivi corralled a loose  ball in front of the bench.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Sockers, Karic's replacement, Alan Willey, was already on  the field. When Haaskivi heard a whistle for a foul and saw four blue shirts  surrounding him, he instinctively threw up his hands pleading with referee Gino  Dippolito for an illegal procedure call.  </P> <P> "I raised my hand when I heard a whistle and started screaming 'six," Haaskivi  said. "I didn't know whether they had six players (on the field) or not, but  with four of their guys standing around me, it was worth a chance."  </P> <P> "I was already on the field when I heard someone yell, 'Get off," Karic said.  "But it was too late."  </P> <P> Karic, however, could have shared the blame for the loss with Crow, whose  defensive lapses were just as costly and more evident.  </P> <P> Besides not paying attention while Mobilio snuck behind him to score the  game-winner, Crow's inability to trap a ball against his chest allowed the  Blast to tie the game at 2-2 1:08 into the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Byrne intercepted and attempted back-pass to Crow when the ball bounced off  Crow's chest. Byrne then split Crow and Gus Mokalis at the top of the penalty  area and beat Nogueira to the right post with a 20-foot shot for his 25th goal  of the season.  </P> <P> Tim Wittman gave the Blast a 1-0 lead with a shorthanded goal 2:41 into the  second period. It was Wittman's seventh shorthanded goal of the season, an MISL  record.  </P> <P> But the Sockers didn't retreat. Newman patiently moved the offense up a notch  at a time and the offense finally clicked when Karic and Waad Hirmez scored  just 2:27 apart in the third period.  </P> <P> Karic tied the game when his shot off the crossbar hit Blast goalkeeper Slobo  Ilijevski in the back and bounced behind him and into the net 7:28 into the  third period. It was Karic's 33rd goal of the season.  </P> <P> The Sockers took their first lead of the game at 9:55 when Hirmez scored his  26th goal of the season.  </P> <P> But Baltimore came back to score the final two goals for the victory.  </P> <P> Newman had a warning for Cooper, whom he brought to the United States from  England 21 years ago to tend goal for the Dallas Tornado of the North American  Soccer League.  </P> <P> "Just because they won the (regular season) championship doesn't mean a thing,"  Newman said. "It doesn't guarantee them a thing come the playoffs."  </P></p>

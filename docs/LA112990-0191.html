			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PARKER TO LEAD RBV;  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL: THE LONGHORNS ARE STILL LOOKING FOR A CENTER, HOWEVER.  </P> <P> The runover of the high school football playoffs always seems to upset the  early part of the boys' basketball season, and this year is no different. Five  of the top 10 basketball schools -- Rancho Buena Vista, El Camino, Morse, Chula  Vista and Kearny -- are still active in the football playoffs as the basketball  season gets under way this weekend.  </P> <P> The fact that a number of key basketball players are football players as well  illustrates the kind of athletes the county has to offer. There are some  talented, multi-skilled athletes, though not much height to speak of.  </P> <P> Darryl Parker of Rancho Buena Vista is one such player. Parker and a strong  supporting cast make up The Times' top-ranked preseason team.  </P> <P> Another factor to consider is geographics. The North County has three of the  top four teams, and the city leagues have five schools represented.  </P> <P> The Times' boys' basketball San Diego Section preseason top 10:  </P> <P> 1 RANCHO BUENA VISTA  </P> <P> 1990 Record: 15-10  </P> <P> League: Palomar  </P> <P> Coach: John O'Neill  </P> <P> Four starters return and one of them is super-talent Darryl Parker, who was  being recruited by Georgetown when he signed a national letter of intent with  UC Santa Barbara. Parker (6-6) can do it all, but the Longhorns lack a true  center. That doesn't bother O'Neill's outlook on offense, but concerns him  defensively. Fred Aliipule, who clogged the middle on defense last year, is a  football player who will spend the winter selecting a university instead of  playing basketball. Brad Grubaugh (6-4) averaged 19 points last year and is  joined by junior point guard James VanderVeer (6-0) and Bond Schoeffel (6-4),  who lacks the flash of his teammates but provides steadiness inside.  </P> <P> 2 EL CAMINO  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 23-7  </P> <P> League: Avocado  </P> <P> Coach: Ray Johnson  </P> <P> Starters Shaun Scurry, a 6-5 forward who averaged 14 points per game last  season, and Jeff Reeves (6-2 guard, 11 points per game), return from last  year's Division II championship team that lost to Ed O'Bannon and Artesia by  four points in the Southern California Regional tournament. Also returning is  5-11 point guard Heath McCoy, who came off the bench to score 14 points against  Artesia. Johnson said McCoy could become one of the top guards in the county.  Junior Russell White, a 6-6 center, played sparingly last year, but Johnson  said he is much improved. Bryant Westbrook, a 6-1 leaper, rounds out the  starting five.  </P> <P> 3 MORSE  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 12-14  </P> <P> League: City Eastern  </P> <P> Coach: Ron Davis  </P> <P> There was nothing spectacular about this team last year, but eight players  return. The Tigers are experienced and tall. Center/forward Darnell Cherry  (6-10) started last season and averaged 14.2 points a game. Jamar Lavender, a  6-5 guard, has started the past two seasons and averaged 12 points and eight  assists last year. Brothers Gary and Cary Taylor should provide a boost when  they're finished with football. Morse has a tough schedule, particularly at the  the beginning. The Tigers open with Crenshaw, the second-ranked team in the  state, and then play Banning, a highly regarded Los Angeles team. "I'll play  anybody, anywhere in order to get a good game," Davis said. "I may be the only  coach in San Diego to go out and try and get the best games. I'm only concerned  about my record in the end."  </P> <P> 4 POWAY  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 18-7  </P> <P> League: Palomar  </P> <P> Coach: Doug Wealch  </P> <P> Key players are back, but the big man on the bench is not. Former coach Neville  Saner, who won four titles in seven years, resigned after another successful  season last year. Replaceing Saner is the man he succeeded, Doug Wealch, who  has a full cupboard, including three returning starters: junior center Kyle  Milling (6-7), and seniors Bill Rarity (6-3) and Frank Garrett (6-3). Forward  Matt Fletcher (6-2), last year's three-point specialist, point guard Mark  Wuchner (5-10), Kirk Hipple (6-5) and five players from a 22-2 junior varsity  team should make Wealch's transition easier.  </P> <P> 5 LINCOLN  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 22-9  </P> <P> League: City Central  </P> <P> Coach: Ron Loneski  </P> <P> Don Ballard, last year's workhorse on the boards, was injured in an auto  accident and Anthony Miller, a promising transfer from Morse, may be  unavailable, but Loneski always seems to come up with a strong team with the  pieces available to him. Berry Randell, a transfer from Crawford, is a rarity  at Lincoln -- a true basketball player. Loneski always laments the lack of  basketball players at Lincoln, saying he puts together a team of great athletes  with few basketball skills. Loneski will be counting on two other transfers,  Alex Davis and John Akridge, both from Hoover. Lincoln has no returning  starters. Akridge and Steve Edens are the only seniors. The rest are juniors.  </P> <P> 6 UNIVERSITY CITY  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 23-5  </P> <P> League: City Western  </P> <P> Coach: Tom Medigovich  </P> <P> The Centurions will lose a lot of explosiveness and scoring ability with the  graduation of all-county point guard Anthony Hill as well as Chris Whitehead  and Jerome Price. But they have 6-5 forward Ray Hooper (19.0) and a talented  replacement at point in Ian Krebs (6-1). Look for center Elliott Alexander  (6-5) to blossom. One of University City's strong points last year was depth,  which should provide a solid starting lineup.  </P> <P> 7 CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 21-8  </P> <P> League: Metro  </P> <P> Coach: Mike Collins  </P> <P> The loss of all-county guard Carnell Penn, who moved to Virginia, will hurt  Chula Vista, as will graduated starters Derek Chapman, who is playing  quarterback at Southwestern College, and Trenell Hicks. The Spartans will also  be without a number of football players for at least a few more days. What is  Chula Vista doing in the top 10? "We've still got some good talent," Collins  said. "I like the way we're going to be." Shane Howell, a 6-5 senior, and  Jermome Green, a 6-2 sophomore, will be counted on most until football players  Donnie Edwards (6-3), Ken McDuffy (5-9), LaMar Bailey (5-8) and Allan Delos  Reyes (6-0) are available.  </P> <P> 8 KEARNY  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 14-8  </P> <P> League: City Western  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Peterson  </P> <P> Some say Kearny had the most talent of any team in the league last year. That's  saying a lot, considering City Western champion University City reached the  Division II final. Back are 6-3 forward Darnay Scott, who averaged more than 16  points and 13 rebounds last year and should be even better, and 6-7 center Mike  Oviedo. Damion Victor, James Curtis and Derrick Hotchkiss move up from a junior  varsity squad that lost only one game last season.  </P> <P> 9 SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 19-5  </P> <P> League: City Central  </P> <P> Coach: Dennis Kane  </P> <P> San Diego will miss the graduated Clark James, but Kane says he will make up  for the absence by putting several players on the floor who can all score 10 to  15 points a game. They are 6-5 forward J.R. Greer, a standout as a sophomore,  who did not play last year; 6-2 guard John McKenna, a 20-point scorer for  Madison last year; 6-4 forward Mike Watson, who averaged eight points and 10  rebounds last year as a junior; Marlon Wells, last year's top junior varsity  player who averaged 18 points; Brian McGowan, a 6-3 transfer from Arizona; 6-2  guard Marino Bowman, who averaged seven points last season; and Jeff Smith, the  starting point guard.  </P> <P> 10 MT. CARMEL  </P> <P> 1988-89 Record: 23-6  </P> <P> League: Palomar  </P> <P> Coach: John Marincovich  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel reached the Division I finals but lost its nucleus, including  all-county center Shane Knight. Still, two starters return -- point guard Dana  Pope (6-2), the team's offensive and defensive catalyst, and Ryan Wootton  (6-4), who showed steady improvement and is the Sundevils' strongest rebounder.  Bill Landry and Jon Young are also back. Chris Goode (6-5), a transfer from  Oxnard Channel Islands, and sophomore Scott Schoenwald (6-6) solidify the front  line. Dan Kirby (6-0) and Andy Shantz (6-3) -- up from the junior varsity with  Aaron Harmon (6-3) -- and Young are outside scoring threats.  </P></p>

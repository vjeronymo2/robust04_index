			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: If you have a problem . . . You should try first to sort it out with the trustees or managers of your pension scheme, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. If they cannot resolve it, then write to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas), which is free. The pensions ombudsman will not investigate your case until Opas has screened it first but the two bodies do share the same offices. Opas has published two free leaflets designed to answer questions asked most often about occupational schemes. Where is My Pension? looks at problems faced by people who have moved jobs and have lost track of any pension entitlement they might have. Winding Up a Pension Scheme covers some of the most common problems raised by members when their scheme is in the process of being wound up. Complaints about personal pensions are not handled by the pensions ombudsman but by the insurance ombudsman. But the new Personal Investment Authority, the self-regulating body which has replaced Fimbra and Lautro, has set up an ombudsman's scheme as well. Its remit is somewhat unclear but it should handle some areas of private pensions, particularly marketing and sales. The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the chief regulator for the financial services industry, can direct investors to the correct ombudsman and outline the complaints procedure of each. The Pensions Ombudsman and Opas, 11 Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB (PO: 071-834 9144; Opas: 233 8080). The Insurance Ombudsman, City Gate One, 135 Park Street, London SE1 9EA (071-928 7600 or 928 4488). PIA Ombudsman, 1 London Wall, London EC2Y 5EA, (071-600 3838). SIB, Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8RA (071-638 1240).</p>

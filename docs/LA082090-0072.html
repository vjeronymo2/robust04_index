			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN SEIZED AFTER 2 GUNFIGHTS IN 1 NIGHT  </P> <P> An off-duty sheriff's sergeant driving home from a gathering with his wife  escaped injury early Sunday during a gun battle in the Florence area with an  alleged would-be robber who was later captured after a second shoot-out with  other deputies, authorities said.  </P> <P> Michael Turner, 34, of Los Angeles, was arrested on suspicion of attempted  murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted armed robbery, said Sgt.  Joaquin Herran, a Sheriff's Department spokesman.  </P> <P> Turner was being held without bail at County-USC Medical Center's jail ward,  where he was treated for three gunshot wounds to a leg, deputies said.  </P> <P> The sheriff's sergeant and his wife, who were not identified, were driving home  about 1 a.m. when a fast-moving car approached them from behind. When they  pulled over to let it pass, the other car also pulled over and the driver got  out and approached them, Herran said.  </P> <P> "We don't believe he knew it was a police officer," Herran said.  </P> <P> When the sergeant saw the man was carrying a handgun, he pulled out his weapon  and shots were fired, Herran said. It was not known if the gunman was wounded  then. The assailant returned to his car and sped off and the sergeant ran to a  nearby house to call police.  </P> <P> Deputies in a patrol car spotted the fleeing gunman five minutes later and  chased him for eight blocks before the man's car crashed into a wall, Herran  said. The gunman tried to run from the area, firing at the pursuing deputies.  They returned fire and wounded the man, who was then captured, Herran said.  </P> <P> Herran said the car that Turner was driving was reported stolen in Los Angeles  on Saturday.  </P></p>

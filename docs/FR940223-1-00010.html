			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amended orders will contain definitions for a skim milk price, a butterfat price, a nonfat dry milk price for Order 124, a milk protein price for Order 135, and the usual class and producer prices. The ``skim milk price'' will be used to determine the value of the skim milk portion of producer milk that is allocated to Class I. Value adjustments for determining payments by handlers for milk used in Class II and Class III, and to producers, will be made by prices per pound for the butterfat and nonfat dry milk (for Order 124) or protein (for Order 135) contained in the milk. The skim milk price, the butterfat price, the nonfat milk solids price, and the milk protein price will be derived from the Class III price and the butterfat differential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Payments to producers for deliveries of milk will be determined through the operation of two marketwide pools for each order. Both orders will contain a ``differential pool'' which will be used to determine producers' share of the Class I and II market. A second pool_the ``skim milk nonfat milk solids pool'' in the case of Order 124 and the ``skim milk protein pool'' for Order 135_will be used to determine the price to be paid producers for the nonfat solids or protein in their milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each handler's net obligation to the pool (i.e., the handler's payment to the producer-settlement fund) will be determined by subtracting the differential and nonfat solids (or protein) values due to the handler's producers from the differential and nonfat solids (or protein) values of the producers' milk used by the handler. The value of butterfat in each producer's milk will not be pooled, but will be paid directly to the producer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The differential value of each handler's receipts of producer milk assigned to Class I and Class II will be calculated by multiplying the hundredweights of producer milk allocated to these classes by the difference between the respective class prices applicable at the location of the plant and the Class III price. In addition, the adjustments to the class values of producer milk that currently are included in determining a handler's obligation would be included in the differential value. The adjustments include the values of overage, beginning Class III inventory allocated to a higher class, other source and filled milk receipts allocated to Class I, certain receipts from unregulated supply plants that are allocated to Class I, and receipts of bulk concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are reconstituted for fluid use. Each handler's differential value will be combined and then divided by the hundredweight of producer milk in the differential pool to determine the ``weighted average differential price.'' An ``estimated uniform price'' can be derived by adding the weighted average differential price to the basic formula price for the month. Although the uniform price would not be applicable to producers under the component pricing plan, it is of value for price comparison purposes with other Federal orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each handler's skim milk-nonfat milk solids value for Order 124 and skim milk-protein value for Order 135 will be determined by combining the skim milk value of the handler's producer milk in Class I with the nonfat solids value (or milk protein value) of the handler's milk in Class II and III. The skim milk value will be determined by multiplying the skim milk in producer milk assigned to Class I by the skim milk price. The nonfat milk solids (or protein) value will be determined by multiplying the nonfat milk solids (or protein) in producer milk assigned to Class II and III by the nonfat milk solids price (or the milk protein price). The amount of nonfat solids or protein in each class will be determined by multiplying the skim milk portion of producer milk allocated to each class by the nonfat solids (or protein) content of all of the handler's producer milk. The price to be paid to producers for the nonfat solids (or protein) in their milk will be determined by combining the individual handler values of skim milk in Class I milk and nonfat solids (or protein) in Class II and III milk, and dividing the resulting total by the pounds of nonfat solids (or protein) in all producer milk. The resulting price will be the ``producer nonfat milk solids price'' (or the ``producer milk protein price'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the order amendments described, payments to producers will be based on three factors: (1) The weighted average differential price for all of their milk; (2) the nonfat milk solids or protein contained in their milk multiplied by the respective producer nonfat milk solids price or producer protein price; and (3) the butterfat in their milk multiplied by the butterfat price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adoption of multiple component pricing plans requires amending provisions of the orders dealing with handler reports, shrinkage, computation of class and component prices, the computation of a handler's obligation to the pool, computation of a weighted average differential price, and the computation of a producer nonfat milk solids price for Order 124 and a producer protein price for Order 135. These changes have already been discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / British Airways: Customers show no signs of leaving BA Correction (Published 26th January 1993) appended to this article. BRITISH AIRWAYS staff might feel angry and humiliated by the publicity surrounding the Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' campaign, but the company's customers show no sign of abandoning the airline. At Heathrow airport yesterday Ms Yvonne Kirk, a retail consultant, said: 'If you've got a nine or 10-hour flight ahead of you, you're more worried about service than anything else.' Ms Kirk, who was waiting to board her club class flight to Japan, said 'looking after myself' remained her top priority in choosing flights. BA staff said they had received no complaints from customers about the events. Ironically, it has been Virgin which has remained most nervous of publicity. Airport staff at Gatwick airport yesterday refused to allow Virgin passengers to be interviewed in the airport. According to the airline this was to avoid charges of 'profiteering' from the events. Some BA passengers at Heathrow expressed disappointment with the airline's behaviour but said it would not affect their choice of carrier. A senior manager flying club class to Chicago with BA said: 'There's been a lot of discussion among my colleagues about it. We are all surprised that British Airways would do this.' But she added: 'I normally fly British Airways, and I don't intend to change.' Even customers of Virgin Atlantic interviewed at Heathrow said the 'dirty tricks' campaign would not stop them flying BA in future. Mr Marvin Goodman, an American businessman waiting to board a Virgin flight, said he would continue to fly with BA 'whenever convenient'. He added: 'I wouldn't change my travel plans because of this kind of brouhaha.' Ms Louise McDonald, a transatlantic economy passenger with Virgin, said there were still good reasons for flying BA. 'All the stories reflect badly on them, but you've got to look at the safety.' Travel companies booking flights for corporate clients said they had no evidence that disaffected customers were preparing to abandon BA. So great is the airline's power in the travel business, however, that some felt they should say even that anonymously. A manager with one large business travel chain said: 'We're uncomfortable talking about it. BA is a very big business partner of ours and we also have strong business links with Virgin.' He added: 'This story might have caused a lot of controversy, but the bottom line is that BA have a very loyal customer base that they've developed over many years. It's bad publicity for them, but whether it will result in any downturn in their business I very much doubt.' Mr Alan Coles, vice-president of business travel operations at American Express, said companies would hesitate before changing airlines. 'A lot of our customers have corporate policies with particular airlines.' Mr Coles said American Express had had experience in the past of business travellers wanting to change airlines, but that was usually because of rumours that the carrier was in financial difficulty. Mr Bruce Shepherd, the company's retail sales director, said: 'It's sad that we have two major airlines airing their differences publicly, but at the end of the day both of them have a good following. It's the fare level and the quality of service that determine what airline people fly.' CORRECTION SOME editions of the FT on Saturday mistakenly gave the impression that Mr Bruce Shepherd was retail sales director of American Express. Mr Shepherd holds this position at AT Mays.</p>

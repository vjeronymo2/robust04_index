			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (21): The shape of things to come  -Telecommunications IN a few years you may only have to leave your office chair for coffee or a call of nature. The modern trend in telecommunications is to put more and more power on your desktop. Meetings will increasingly become unnecessary as more and more work is conducted by electronic mail, fax and video conferencing. The limiting factor in these is the rate at which data can be transferred. Technically it is known as 'bandwidth' and is measured in 'baud' which roughly equate to bits per second. The current bandwidth of a telephone circuit limits the data rate to a maximum of around 14,400 baud. This data rate means that a fax takes around a minute per A4 page. While fine for a quick, scribbled memo, it is far too slow for a 140-page document. Around 70 per cent of all faxes originate on computers - usually they are printed and then manually fed through the fax machine by a secretary. At the other end, they are often photocopied to avoid handling the thermal paper which is unpleasant to touch and fades with time. In the next few years, this will change as PCs connect to fax lines via fax modems. In addition, many documents will be sent as electronic mail and then printed locally if required. Electronic mail transfer is far more efficient than fax for textual documents. Although the speed of new modems (which pass data across telephone connections) has increased steadily, they are rapidly approaching a performance ceiling. New technologies are facing the laws of diminishing returns. Data compression techniques have allowed the data rates to increase further but these are largely unsuitable for video images. Some might claim that B's videophone is more of a 'toy' than a serious video-conferencing tool. It provides little more than blurred snapshots rather than a face-to-face meeting. It is severely hampered by the bandwidth available on a conventional telephone line. The next step forward has been ISDN (integrated data sevices network) which provides two channels of 64,000 baud down a single telephone wire. This opens up whole new areas of applications. Video-conferencing becomes more of a reality as the pictures are much better at the higher bandwidth. Using an ISDN channel, a fax takes only a few seconds per page. In addition, fax machines capable of using ISDN have improved data compression and error correction to remove the smudges that plague current faxes. The beauty of ISDN-2 is that is incredibly cheap. While installation costs and line rental are higher, call costs are the same as for a standard phone connection. Companies using data transfer or electronic mail may see considerable savings. The increased rental costs are soon recovered because of the decreased call times. ISDN is totally digital so modems become much simpler to build. Sadly, volumes have not risen quickly enough to persuade modem manufacturers to reduce their prices accordingly. ISDN-2 opens up further possibilities because it can provide two separate channels down the same wire. Feature phones can therefore offer voice on one channel with simultaneous video or data transfer on the other. One exciting possibility is the concept of a 'whiteboard.' Participants in a teleconference use one channel for voice and the other channel for data exchange between PCs. Each PC runs a simple drawing package which allows the person sitting at the screen to draw as if on a whiteboard. As they draw an image, the same image is transmitted simultaneously to all the participants in the conference. They can then comment on and change the image by drawing on their own PCs. Again, these changes are reflected on each person's screen. Value-added services are also becoming increasingly prevalent in regular telephones. BT's 'Star Services' have introduced many to the joys of call-forwarding, call-waiting and so on. While many large companies have had these facilities supplied by their internal exchanges, the digitilisation of the UK networks has brought these facilities within the reach of small businesses. But the new features are a mixed blessing. Call-waiting, for example, means that if there is an incoming call during a conversation, you get an annoying bleep in your ear. The person you are talking to perceives a hiccough as you talk - in time with each bleep. Research has indicated that 75 per cent of calls are less important than what they interrupt. While important calls may no longer be missed, a million dollar deal could be interrupted by a 'junk call' which previously would have received an engaged tone. Features to come will reduce this possibility. Already, some areas have caller identification where the exchange supplies the caller's telephone number to the telephone. Devices are readily available which can use this information to screen calls or re-route them - say, to a secretary. As travelling to meetings, or even going into a meeting room becomes a thing of the past, the only exercise you may get is going to and from work. As teleworking (working from home via communications networks) takes off, even that may cease. Perhaps then, the growth area will be executive chairs with inbuilt multi-gyms.</p>

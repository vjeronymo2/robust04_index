			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Northern motor retailers merge Two of north-west England's best known motor industry retailers, Ron Stratton and Company, based in Knutsford, Cheshire, and Ian Anthony, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, have merged. Ron Stratton concentrates on low mileage specialist cars such as Ferrari, Rolls Bentley, Mercedes and Porsche, while Ian Anthony is a BMW dealership. Mr Stratton and Mr Jon Crossley, his sales director, will join the expanded Ian Anthony (Holdings) board of directors headed by Mr Ian Blenkinsop, founder and managing director of Ian Anthony. Mr Stratton and Mr Blenkinsop are equal partners in the merger. Their current operations have a combined annual turnover of Pounds 25m. Montague Private Equity has taken a minority shareholding in Ian Anthony (Holdings) and will help to fund a new showroom offering the range of cars in which Stratton specialises, alongside Ian Anthony's existing Bolton BMW showroom. The Knutsford operation will continue to trade under the name Ron Stratton and Company. Over a period of 20 years Mr Stratton, whose past customers include the Al Fayeds, Mr Eddie Shah and ex-Beatle George Harrison, built up the largest Ferrari and Rolls Royce dealership outside London before selling out to Pendragon in 1991.</p>

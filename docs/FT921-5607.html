			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Computer software research wins Pounds 25m THE government is putting more money into research on ensuring that computer software does what it is supposed to do and does not do anything that could endanger life or the environment. Yesterday it said an extra Pounds 6m would be made available to the four-year Safety Critical Systems Programme run by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Science and Engineering Research Council. The funds are part of a Pounds 25m package announced yesterday to improve software technology and applications, and brings to Pounds 36m the value of the safety-work scheme. Computer software is notoriously difficult to test for errors because of its complexity and the number of different ways a computer can react to differing circumstances. Fears that software controlling sophisticated machinery may contain undetected errors have been highlighted by the crash in January of an A320 Airbus, controlled by complex computer systems, even though no errors were found in the software. The DTI announced yesterday that Pounds 11.7m would be made available for research into 'co-operative' working - allowing people in different locations to work on the same information at the same time. A further Pounds 7.5m was pledged to work on open, or industry-standard systems to make different manufacturers' computers compatible. These are increasingly seen as the pattern of the future.</p>

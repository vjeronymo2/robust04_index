But the two sides skirted Seoul-Beijing route, leaving it  unsettled and agreeing to continued charter services.    South Korean Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae said these  agreements, reached at working-level contact last week, will be  made final at the aviation talks next month in Beijing.    Because the Seoul-Shanghai service is unsettled, the  aviation  agreement would have to be a temporary one, officials explained.  The two countries also left untouched the number of airlines to  service the Seoul-Beijing route and the beyond rights, putting  them aside until next month's aviation talks, they said.    The aviation agreement is expected to be signed during  President Kim Yong-sam's Beijing visit late March, and the  Seoul-Beijing service may commence as early as April.    The control transfer point had blocked a successful  agreement  when Beijing insisted on ignoring the 124 degrees longitude  drawn by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  and moving it to 125 degrees.    China conceded on the Beijing route at 124 degrees but  insists on 125 degrees for Shanghai. The charter flights will  have to keep using the corridor set up by Japan-China aviation  agreement until further negotiations.    The 124 degree agreement for Seoul-Beijing will hopefully  set  precedent for flights linking South Korea with northern China  such as Qingdao and Shenyang, officials said.</p>

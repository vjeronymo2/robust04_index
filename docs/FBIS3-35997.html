The contract materialized as a result  of an international contest for nuclear waste disposal projects  that the production association had to organize in view of the  relevant governmental bodies' obvious indifference, inaction,  and incompetence.    The contest reportedly drew participants and tenders from  Germany, Britain, France, Canada, the United States, Spain, and  [word indistinct]. The Zaporizhye nuclear power plant  management chose the project drafted by the Duke engineering and  service affiliates of the Duke Power company (?as specially)  following the Ukrainian nuclear power industry's technological  [word indistinct] and requirements. The project reportedly  provides for storing used nuclear fuel cases in armored concrete  cylinders. Despite their relative simplicity and cheapness,  they are said to be both durable and reliable for storing  fissionable materials, nuclear safety experts maintain.  Currently, ecological and feasibility studies are under way in  these sites. If everything goes well, the first storage  facility is expected to be completed by late 1995. Similar  storage facilities are being contemplated for construction at  other Ukrainian nuclear power plants.</p>

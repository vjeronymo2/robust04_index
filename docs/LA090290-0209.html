			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS: 'ISAAC IN AMERICA'  </P> <P> Amran Nowak's illuminating and imaginative 1986 ocumentary (airing as part of  "American Masters") offers a warm portrait of Nobel Prize-winning writer Isaac  Bashevis Singer and his times, drawn largely from his own words as Singer goes  about his daily routines. Best of all is an excursion to Coney Island, where  Singer lived upon coming to America from Warsaw in 1935.  </P> <P> (KCET at 10 p.m.; KVCR Friday at 10 p.m.)Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

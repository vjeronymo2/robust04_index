			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation in Rwanda is complicated by the fact  that the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels have given a  warning to France and to other Western countries. They have  asked them to be neutral in this ethnic war. Francois  Rutayisire, the RPF representative in Paris is quite unambiguous:    [Begin Rutayisire recording] Three years ago, France sent in  its troops, saying they were there to protect and evacuate  French nationals. They ended up staying for three years. We  hope this is not going to be the same.    [Unidentified correspondent] If on their way to Kigali, RPF  troops come into contact with French troops barring their way,  will they react violently?    [Rutayisire] One of our spokesmen has already answered this  question. If anyone gets in the way of the RPF forces, who are  fighting to eliminate the presidential Guard, the RPF will not  hesitate to fight.    [Correspondent] Including against French troops?    [Rutayisire] Against whoever gets in its way. [end  recording]</p>

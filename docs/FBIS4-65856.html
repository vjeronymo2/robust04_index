			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 24 (AFP) -- Russia signalled here  Tuesday [24 May] that it would sign NATO's Partnership For Peace  initiative only if at the same time it is also given a separate  accord on closer Russia-NATO relations.    Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said he or Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev intended to travel to NATO  headquarters here at an undetermined date to sign both documents  at once.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been pressing  Russia to join the Partnership For Peace (PFP) programme of  military cooperation between NATO and former communist countries.    But Moscow has indicated it will sign the partnership  programme only if NATO agrees to a parallel accord of political  cooperation between Russia and the Western Alliance.    Grachev said he would be presenting Russia's proposals for  the partnership, plus "concept" proposals for a bilateral  relationship, to NATO here Wednesday.    "In principle we are ready to sign (the partnership) even if  it is not a Russian initiative," he said, but suggested strongly  that Moscow would not accept the PFP without the separate  bilateral accord.    Grachev was speaking ahead of a meeting with the NATO  defence  ministers to present Russia's long-awaited new military doctrine  to replace the security blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union.    NATO has said it is particularly anxious to find out how  Russia intends to treat its "near abroad" -- other republics of  the former Soviet Union with Russian minorities.</p>

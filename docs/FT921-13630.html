			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Property companies lead record bankruptcies in Japan THE collapse of more than 1,000 property companies in Japan last year helped push corporate bankruptcies to a record high, according to reports published yesterday by two private credit agencies. Figures from Teikoku Data Bank and Tokyo Shoko Research show that corporate liabilities of bankrupt companies last year reached roughly Y8,000bn (Pounds 35bn). This is about four times higher than in 1990, and nearly double the record set in 1985. The figures are for corporate bankruptcies of more than Y10m. The sharp rise in insolvency was a direct result of the Bank of Japan's high interest rate policy, which was aimed at reversing a steep rise in asset prices in the last decade that the central bank saw as unhealthy. The high rates, which the bank began to ease last July, have also sharply slowed the economy. Central bank economists have nonetheless repeatedly expressed confidence that underlying economic activity remained at healthy levels, and that commercial banks would be able to withstand the steadily rising level of bad debt on their books. The conflicting pressures on the economy were underscored by an analysis by Teikoku Data Bank, showing the second biggest cause of insolvency was the inability of companies to hire sufficient labour. This accounted for 548 bankruptcies, with debts of Y110.5bn. The central bank has kept interest rates high in part to combat wage inflation caused by a labour shortage. Bankruptcies caused by the downturn of property prices accounted for 1,036 cases, with Y2,980bn in liabilities. The number of insolvencies, while rising from 6,468 cases in 1990 to 10,723 last year, fell well short of the levels of the early 1980s. The number of bankruptcies with liabilities over Y1bn, however, hit a record 713 cases, with ll cases over Y10bn. Teikoku Data Bank said little relief was in sight. December bankruptcies reached more than 1,200 cases for the first time since March 1987. Total liabilities of bankrupt companies during the month reached Y868.2bn, the second highest following the record of Y957.2bn set in August. The number of property companies filing for bankruptcy in December reached a monthly high of 119 in spite of recent cuts to the official discount rate and moves by the government to lift restrictions on property-related lending.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Berezovskiy report: "Kyrgyzstan: Eve of </F> Referendum"]    [Text] Tashkent -- Kyrgyz sociologists are foretelling a  heated political struggle over the upcoming 30 January  referendum on confidence in President Askar Akayev. Recent  polls conducted by the "Sotsiomarket" Research Center show that  the people are by no means delighted with the state of affairs  in the republic. Some 46.4 percent of respondents in principle  do not approve the very idea of a referendum. Almost a quarter  of them are prepared to vote against the incumbent head of state.    The reason is plain to see: 38.9 percent of respondents  believe that the republic is rushing headlong into a crisis,  while 29.3 percent are convinced that disaster has already  struck. You can understand their viewpoint. The average wage  in the republic is under 150 soms (around 20,000 rubles). While  unemployment is putting more and more "surplus" manpower out of  work at plants and factories.    The newspaper VECHERNIY BISHKEK has reported that the  opposition wasted no time in holding a "Last Supper" to discuss  the possible situation: What is to be done if Akayev does not  win the people's support? It was decided then to "nominate" for  president Feliks Kulov, a 44-year-old militia general and head  of the Tashkent Oblast Administration, and offer the post of  parliament speaker to 75-year-old Turdakun Usubaliyev, the  former "top man," who ruled the republic for almost 25 years.    Interestingly, the latter seems to be already prepared to  take on this role. When asked whether he would cope with the  workload, Usubaliyev calmly remarked; "Gaydar Aliyev is doing  OK...." Kulov, however, quickly rejected the "honor" he was  accorded by the opposition and said that he is convinced that  Askar Akayev will be victorious.    There is every indication that the president has no  intention  of letting the referendum take its own course. Local observers  assessed Askar Akayev's recent statement of his readiness to  grant dual citizenship to Russians and Germans as a desire to  win their votes -- and they represent almost one-fourth of all  voters.    But the president immediately met with opposition.    Communists, republicans, and social democrats who think that  dual citizenship will halt the wave of Russian migration and  strengthen ties with Russia as Bishkek's strategic partner side  with Askar Akayev.    Political circles do not hide the fact that Askar Akayev is  very much counting on Boris Yeltsin's support; the latter is  expected to visit Kyrgyzstan on the eve of the referendum.</p>

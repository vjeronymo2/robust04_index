			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW MAN FOR A NEW ERA  </P> <P> A somewhat obscure California bureaucrat suddenly has an opportunity to direct  national water policy in a bold new direction of sound resource management and  environmental protection. He is 44-year-old Dennis Underwood, a civil engineer  who has spent the past 11 years on the staff of the Colorado River Board of  California, based in downtown Los Angeles. Underwood has been chosen by  President Bush to be chief of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the agency that  once ruled western water resources with virtually an iron fist as an act of  beneficence for powerful senators and congressmen.  </P> <P> Going back to 1902, the bureau had one basic goal: to build mighty dams and to  make the western desert and brushlands bloom with the magic of irrigation water  sold cheap to the farmers who repeatedly reelected the congressional water  giants like California's Bernie Sisk and Colorado's Wayne Aspinall. But times  have changed. The Sisks and Aspinalls are gone from Congress. All the easy dams  have been built. The new cities of the West are competing for the water. A  strong environmental ethic has entered the water debate. The political trend is  running against any more costly, subsidized irrigation projects.  </P> <P> Sensing this, federal officials formally changed the mission of the Bureau of  Reclamation to one of better management of water resources. But the  4,000-person agency has drifted the past half dozen years under weak leadership  and with no apparent interest at the White House or Interior Department in the  development of a coherent national water policy. Now is the time to write one.  </P> <P> Is Dennis Underwood the man to direct such a conversion? Perhaps. Those who  know him credit Underwood with being pleasant, bright and knowledgeable on the  issues. Underwood has worked with water officials throughout the Colorado River  Basin and with the federal reclamation workers who oversee the Colorado's  operations. But there is some question as to whether he has the political  skills and stomach for battling an entrenched reclamation bureaucracy that has  been shorn of its glamorous dam-building tradition and uprooted from Washington  to Denver in recent years. And there is some question whether Underwood will  have the support or mandate for doing so from the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> But Underwood and the Administration now have an unsurpassed opportunity for  turning the dispirited bureau into a model of modern water management. The  bureau should be given responsibility for developing ground-water management  programs to safeguard aquifers that serve both cities and farms. The bureau  should work to reverse some of the damage done over the years by reclamation  projects, such as contamination caused by irrigation drainage problems  throughout the West. The bureau can play an important role in easing the  inevitable transition of water supplies from farms to the cities in some areas,  and in developing water conservation programs.  </P> <P> Should Underwood and his superiors choose to take such a leadership course,  they are certain to have strong support in Congress from the new water leaders  like Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) and Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.). Should  they fail to rid themselves of the old irrigation-project mentality, they will  not find much sympathy. Even California's San Joaquin Valley no longer has a  congressional champion who can be counted on to pass wanted legislation or kill  unfavorable regulations with a whisper to a colleague or a phone call to the  White House.  </P> <P> The new water age is here. The Bush Administration must decide now whether it  will seize a leadership role, or be pulled along by the flow.  </P></p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / BA launches Pounds 80m investment programme BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday launched a Pounds 80m investment programme aimed at improving its transcontinental business class and Concorde services. The revamp, which is the first for five years, will include eight-channel personal video screens, more spacious seats and better lounge facilities for those travelling business class. BA, with other large airlines, has been hit during the recession by companies sending their executives by economy class rather than business class. BA's passenger numbers have risen by 8.7 per cent this year compared with figures for last year, which were hit by the Gulf war. However, the growth has been mainly among economy-class passengers. Many of these passengers are on heavily discounted tickets. Under the re-launch, BA plans to refit all 6,000 of its business-class seats on its fleet of 71 long-haul aircraft over the next year.</p>

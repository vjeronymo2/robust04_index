			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Nukes and taxes the legacy of attempts by successive governments to promote particular types of fuel. The nuclear levy is one of the most costly such distortions, and it was right of Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to draw attention to it last week. At Pounds 1.3bn a year, it amounts to a large hidden tax on electricity consumers in England and Wales, and puts a questionable burden on industry. But it is not so easy to argue that it should be abolished. Virtually all of it goes to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which operates the 12 nuclear power stations in England and Wales. The money will pay for the decommissioning of stations when they come to the end of their lives. The essential question is whether decommissioning costs are a legacy of bygone policies and should therefore be borne by the government and so by all taxpayers or whether they should be treated as a direct production cost of electricity for which the present-day consumer should pay. It is evident that the Treasury will not rush to replace a levy which few people even know about with a more open tax, so reform will be resisted in that quarter. Furthermore, there are already plans to phase the levy out by 1997, so there is a case for leaving existing arrangements undisturbed. But there are other considerations, not least the imminent privatisation of British Coal. The ending of effective subsidies to the coal mining industry through artificial long-term coal contract prices will leave Nuclear Electric with very special advantages which are hard to justify. Aside from the levy, NE enjoys priority access to supplying the electricity grid because nuclear generators cannot be switched on and off as easily as other sources. Far better to draw a line under old policies and reconstitute Nuclear Electric in such a way that it can operate as a free-standing commercial enterprise. This would entail making a distinction between the declining Magnox power stations which Nuclear Electric inherited and those which form part of its new commercial strategy. The cost of decommissioning the former would be borne by the exchequer, the latter out of NE's operating profits, which are growing. Proposals for new nuclear stations would be assessed economically on the basis of all their costs, including decommissioning. Aside from creating a more level playing field in the energy market, this arrangement would also shape the right setting for a government review of the nuclear power industry in 1994. Scottish Nuclear, which owns Scotland's two nuclear power stations, does not benefit from the levy. The sooner Nuclear Electric can be viewed as a commercial rather than a subsidised concern, the more likely that sensible decisions about the longer-term prospects for nuclear power can be made.</p>

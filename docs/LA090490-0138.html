			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SAMARANCH SAYS SOUTH AFRICA COULD BE IN OLYMPICS IN '92  </P> <P> The president of the International Olympic Committee said it is possible that  South Africa could be back in the Olympics as early as 1992.  </P> <P> "The finishing line is getting nearer" for South Africa's return to  international sports, Juan Antonio Samaranch said at the opening ceremony of  the fourth International Conference Against Apartheid in Sport.  </P> <P> South Africa has been banned from the Olympics since 1970 because of its  apartheid policy of racial separation.  </P> <P> "Maybe 1992 is too early, but if they solve the problems it's possible,"  Samaranch said. "Something important is happening for the first time in South  Africa. We hope it's the beginning of the end (of apartheid)."  </P> <P> Samaranch said that the solution to the problem must originate within Africa  and that the IOC would not move to end South Africa's isolation from  international sports until black African sports leaders approve.  </P> <P> The freeing of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and other moves  by the South African government led to talks about the country's possible  readmission to the Olympic movement.  </P></p>

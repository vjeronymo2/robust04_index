			<p>BFN     [Text] Ruling parties have begun to informally sound out  the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] about its  return to the ruling coalition after all Hata cabinet members,  with the exception of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, resign en  masse to pave the way for the formation of a new coalition  government. This was disclosed by several senior members of the  ruling parties and the SDPJ on 10 June. The ruling parties  intend to make the SDPJ come back to the ruling coalition by  moving closer to a voluntary general resignation by the Hata  cabinet, which has been sought by the SDPJ. Rightists in the  SDPJ, who have a close relationship with Secretary General  Wataru Kubo, and trade unions are speaking highly of moves by  the ruling parties to bring the SDPJ back to the ruling  coalition. They are calling on the SDPJ to return to the  coalition government after seeking an agreement on policies.  However, Chairman Murayama, centrists, and leftists of the SDPJ  are poised to press the Hata cabinet to resign en masse.  Whether or not the SDPJ will decide to return to the ruling  coalition remains unknown.    During a recent Central Committee meeting, the SDPJ called  for a voluntary general resignation by the Hata cabinet and the  formation of a new coalition government. During the meeting,  the SDPJ also announced that it would not hesitate to submit a  no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet and  call for dissolving the House of Representatives and holding  general elections.    On 10 June, the ruling parties told a senior rightist member  of the SDPJ that it would be difficult for the Hata cabinet to  voluntarily resign en masse because Prime Minister Hata has had  no political flaws. But they informally asked the SDPJ to  accept a sweeping reshuffle of the Hata cabinet as a general  resignation and to then return to the ruling coalition. This  request has been endorsed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, and Komeito [Clean Government  Party] Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa.    Commenting on the request by the ruling parties in a 10 June  YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Takashi Yonezawa, ruling Democratic  Socialist Party chairman, said: "A sweeping reshuffle of the  Hata cabinet is one of our options." An influential senior  member in a ruling party said: "There will be a sweeping  reshuffle of the Hata cabinet or it will resign en masse if the  Diet approves a no- confidence motion. If the Diet votes down  the no-confidence motion, the Hata cabinet will talk with the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the SDPJ about how to replace  the current coalition partners." However, he indicated that for  the time being, the ruling parties would aim to bring the SDPJ  back into the ruling coalition through a sweeping reshuffle of  the Hata cabinet.    In response, a senior rightist member of the SDPJ has  insisted the: "SDPJ hold talks with the ruling parties to look  for areas of compromise in a bid to return to the ruling  coalition rather than merely asking the Hata cabinet to  voluntarily resign en masse." Expressing his intention to  respond positively to the ruling parties request, he indicated  the possibility of Kubo and Ozawa holding talks.    On 10 June, in a separate YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Kubo,  while indicating his eagerness for the SDPJ to return to the  ruling coalition, stated: "At the present stage, if our party  accepts the request from the ruling parties, it would become a  hurdle to new developments." However, Chairman Murayama stated:  "If the Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse, we can do  nothing with the ruling parties. We cannot accept the idea that  the SDPJ will return to the ruling coalition after the Hata  cabinet undergoes a sweeping reshuffle."    If the idea is surfacing within the SDPJ that the party will  rejoin the ruling coalition after the Hata cabinet undergoes a  sweeping reshuffle, this will inevitably spark an intra-party  confrontation. Consultations between the SDPJ and the ruling  parties on forming a new coalition government are expected to  face rough sailing because of the issue of North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons development. There is a strong view  that it will be difficult for the SDPJ to return to the ruling  coalition. The ruling parties intend to look for a way to forge  an alliance with the LDP, while urging the SDPJ to return to the  ruling coalition.    In the 10 June YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Kubo proposed that  if a new coalition government is formed, a "general council" be  created as the ruling parties' supreme decision-making body to  replace the current meeting of representatives, and that the  body be composed of plural representatives sent by ruling  parties and parliamentary groups in proportion to their  parliamentary seats. Kubo's proposal is one of the conditions  for the SDPJ to participate in a new coalition government, and  the proposal is aimed at getting rid of the traditional  back-door negotiations by running the new coalition government  democratically and making its decision-making process more  transparent.</p>

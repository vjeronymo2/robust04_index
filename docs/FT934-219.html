			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Management: The quality gospel according to Deming - A man revered for his influence on corporate competitiveness in the US and Japan One of the most influential figures in modern industrial management theory, W. Edwards Deming, once remarked - with typical antagonistic bluntness - that he would like to be remembered in his native US as 'someone who spent his life trying to keep America from committing suicide'. When he died in Washington, DC, last week at the age of 93, that wish was amply fulfilled, as some of the largest companies in the US paid tribute to his role in improving their competitiveness. Ford, the country's most efficient car manufacturer, said Deming had been instrumental in guiding it to a 'sharp focus on quality, not only in its manufacturing processes, but in all of its operations'. There is no small irony in this, for Deming, who first made his name in Japan, where he was revered by industrialists for four decades, was largely unknown in the US until the start of the 1980s. That was when a television documentary on the US's diminishing industrial competitiveness described his key role in formulating those quality control techniques which have played such an important part in Japan's industrial achievements. As the US stampeded after Japan, Mr Deming suddenly found himself in great demand, along with a handful of other experts, as a consultant in a set of business theories, pioneered by the Japanese, which have come to be known as total quality management (TQM). Ford was one of Deming's earliest converts. TQM, which is now being embraced by European companies, has become perhaps the most influential management theory of the late 20th century. It has many variants, but at its heart lies an unremitting focus on maximising quality in every aspect of a company's work, involving all employees in the process and trying to achieve the complete satisfaction of a customer's demands. But there is a danger of over-emphasising the cantankerous Deming's importance in all this. He has certainly been the most visible and charismatic advocate of the quality movement, but he did not start it, and a motley collection of cooks from around the globe have contributed to the TQM soup. Man has been tracking quality, in one form or another, for generations, but the modern movement's origins are often traced to Walter Shewhart, an American Telephone &amp; Telegraph executive. In the 1920s he devised a method of using statistics to control the quality of telephones manufactured at the company's Hawthorne Works in Chicago. The plant's employees included Deming and Joseph Juran, who became disciples of Shewhart's statistical methods and went on to be the two most influential members of the quality movement. Juran, aged 89, is now on his last speaking tour before retirement. Both men had a profound impact on Japan as it tried to rebuild its shattered industries after the second world war. Deming, the first to visit Japan, so impressed its businessmen with the importance of statistical quality control that in 1951 they created a Deming Prize for companies which had shown impressive quality advances. It took 36 years for the US to do likewise, with the Baldrige Award. Juran, who first toured Japan in 1954, is widely credited with teaching the country that statistical techniques needed to be backed up with a complementary management commitment to quality in general. But in a recent interview Juran maintained: 'If neither I nor Deming had gone to Japan in the early 1950s, the Japanese would still have achieved world quality leadership.' Deming, for one, may have learnt almost as much from the Japanese as he taught them: he only formulated his celebrated 14 Points - the crux of his mature quality theory - in the 1970s, after two decades observing Japan's unique management culture, which tries to involve all employees in making decisions. The 14 points involve a much more philosophical approach to quality than the practical advice handed out by most consultants. Deming suggested that a successful company needed to undergo a revolution in thinking. The elements included 'constancy of purpose' - a knowledge of what business it is in and a strategy for staying ahead; 'profound knowledge' of subjects such as statistical theory and group dynamics; and a constant striving to improve. Arguing that bad management was generally responsible for 85 per cent of a company's problems, he urged executives to 'drive out fear' and encourage creativity among junior workers by giving them more responsibility and treating them as colleagues. He deplored performance ratings and inter-departmental competition as inimical to co-operation. Juran, by contrast, places less emphasis on the importance of statistics and suggests that the Juran Trilogy - quality planning, control and improvement  -can be mastered without philosophical transformations. Other prominent US experts, such as Phil Crosby, offer still different approaches. David Garvin, a Harvard Business School professor who has written extensively on quality issues, says Deming's theory may be better for some kinds of companies - it seems to have worked well in the mass production vehicle industry - while Juran's tack may suit others, such as engineering-driven technology businesses. But he adds that 'anyone who tries to say Deming is more important than Juran, than Crosby, misses the point. Each has staked out important pieces of the terrain'. Only when you put them all together, he says, do you come up with the very demanding quality criteria laid down for the Baldrige award  -and they are in themselves no guarantee of success. 'Anyone who tells you quality is the answer to all of your competitive problems is being very misleading,' says Garvin. 'There's no simple solution.' Deming would have thoroughly agreed with that hard-nosed judgment - despite his elevation late in life to the pantheon of management gurus.</p>

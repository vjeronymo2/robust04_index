			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Trust will offer the following twelve separately managed portfolios: the MFS OTC Series; MFS Growth Series; MFS Research Series; MFS Growth With Income Series; MFS Total Return Series; MFS Utilities Series; MFS High Income Series; MFS World Governments Series; MFS Strategic Fixed Income Series; MFS Bond Series; MFS Limited Maturity Series; and MFS Money Market Series. The application states that, except for the MFS OTC Series, the MFS Utilities Series, the MFS World Governments Series and the MFS Strategic Fixed Income Series, each of the portfolios of the Trust will be diversified. Applicants incorporate by reference into the application the registration statement (File No. 33&hyph;74668) on Form N&hyph;1A of the Trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. MFS serves as the investment advisor to the portfolios of the Trust. MFS is a subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.), which is a subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants state that once the order requested in the application is granted, the Trust intends to offer shares of each of its existing and future portfolios to separate accounts of insurance companies in addition to the separate accounts established by Century Life of America (``Century Life'') or its affiliates (the ``Accounts'') to serve as investment vehicles for variable annuity and/or variable life insurance contracts (the ``Contracts''). The Trust may also offer shares of its portfolios directly to the Plans outside of the separate account context. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The application states that each Participating Insurance Company will have the legal obligation of satisfying all applicable requirements under both state and federal law. Applicants state that it is anticipated that Participating Insurance Companies will rely on Rule 6e&hyph;2 or Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act, although some may rely on individual exemptive orders as well, in connection with variable life insurance contracts. Applicants further state that the role of the Funds, in so far as the federal securities laws are applicable, will be limited to that of offering shares to the Accounts and meeting any conditions that the Commission may impose upon granting the order requested in the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The application states that, due to changes in the tax law, the Funds have the opportunity to increase their asset base through sale of shares of the Funds to the Plans. The Plans may choose any of the Funds as the sole investment option, or, as one of several investment options. Shares of any of the Funds sold to a Plan would be held by the trustee of that Plan as required by Section 403(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''). MFS will not serve as investment advisor to any of the Plans that purchase shares of the Funds. There will be no pass-through voting to participants in the Plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. In connection with the funding a scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust (``UIT''), Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The relief provided by Rule 6e&hyph;2 is available to a separate account's investment advisor, principal underwriter, and sponsor or depositor. The exemptions granted by rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) are available only where the management investment company underlying the UIT offers its shares ``exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company.'' The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of a single insurance company (or of two or more affiliated insurance companies) is referred to as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred to as ``shared funding.'' ``Mixed and shared funding'' denotes the use of a common management investment company to fund the variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of other affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies. The relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same company or of any other affiliated or unaffiliated life insurance company. Therefore, Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) precludes mixed and shared funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants state that the relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is not affected by the purchase of shares of the Funds by the Plans. Applicants note, however, that because the relief under Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is available only where shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts, additional exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the Funds also are to be sold to Plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: A rich and raunchy western - David Murray on Greenaway's first foray into opera, 'Rosa' In Amsterdam the Netherlands Opera has scored yet another up-to-date success with Rosa, a 'horse opera' by Peter Greenaway and Louis Andriessen. Greenaway is of course the controversial film-maker, here engaging with opera for the first time; Andriessen is the senior Dutch contemporary composer, who has tried opera (or music-theatre) before, but never perhaps with a co-author so exacting. For Greenaway has not only directed Rosa in the most precise and rigorous detail; just as with his films he has written it too, with the essential visual imagery already prescribed. That would seem to reduce the composer's role to supplying a 'film music' accompaniment to order. So it might, with a composer less truculently himself than Andriessen; but in fact the Andriessen persona (abrasive, quasi-minimalist and hard-hitting, but with warm feelings) is stamped all over the score. Though it answers to Greenaway's exact demands, it goes beyond his text by infusing it with red blood - something that Michael Nyman's scores for all but his most recent films hardly did, despite their wayward appeal. Here the story is in his characteristic mode: tantalisingly intricate and incomplete, lubricious but beady-eyed. The gist of it is that young Esmeralda, wedded to a composer-cowboy who prefers his horse, strives ecstatically to become one herself. Since this erotic fantasy is told from various times and points of view, and furthermore the wild West films for which the composer writes all his music soon invade the stage and even the action, the built-in visual opportunities are rich and raunchy. Naturally Greenaway misses none of them, and his results are no less striking than candidly reminiscent of his films. Terrific projections, fluid interplay between film (period monochrome, modern colour, purpose-made sequences too) and live-action, everything coolly stylised; economical with props - but the rehearsal costs, including the hi-tech element, must have been fearful. As it happens, some of the principals also spend a lot of time in the nude, with or without splodges of black ink, and some of the busy octet-ensemble are bare-bottomed throughout. Par for the course: as I said, this is an up-to-date success. Andriessen's score throbs relentlessly, as is his wont. His principals are chiefly required to sing very loudly, clearly and rhythmically, in various states of undress, but Marie Angel, Lyndon Terracini and Miranda van Kralingen all do much more than that, and Roger Smeets, Christopher Gillett and Phyllis Blanford make something crisp of their near-puppet roles. The only part of the piece that remains flat is the mock investigation into the murder: absurd to taunt the audience about getting the clues, when so few of them were audible anyway. Contrariwise, Andriessen's pastiches of film-Western triumph and rescue are funny and stirring. Another British arrival in Amsterdam was John Eliot Gardiner the next night  -not by any means his first visit, but his first to conduct the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in their own splendid hall, where they usually sound even better than elsewhere. They sounded particularly beautiful in Debussy's three orchestral Images; they hardly needed Gardiner to teach them the music, but his attention to delicate, unfamiliar detail was constantly rewarding. Whimsically, the Images were strewn through the programme, interlarded with Hungarian scores. The temperate Dutch players were slightly short of snap in Bartok's Dance Suite and Kodaly's Psalmus Hungaricus (with Keith Lewis a lusty soloist), but these were sumptuous, well-balanced performances. The sharpest impression was left by Gyorgy Kurtag's four-minute elegy, Grabstein fur Stephan. A guitar gently strums basic chords as if tuning up, changing one note from time to time, while around it the orchestra sketches sighs and whimpers over a doomy bass tread. Less minimal than much Kurtag, and poignantly heartfelt. Nine more Rosa performances at the Musiektheater between tonight and November 28; Concertgebouw concert repeated November 6</p>

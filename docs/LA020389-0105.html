			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PENGUINS WIN AT PHILADELPHIA FOR FIRST TIME SINCE '74  </P> <P> Goaltender Wendell Young, who was traded by Philadelphia to Pittsburgh last  summer, turned back 39 shots Thursday to help his new team beat the Flyers,  5-3, and end the Penguins' 42-game winless streak at Philadelphia's Spectrum.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh had lost 39 games and tied three since its last victory at  Philadelphia, Jan. 20, 1974. The victory was Young's first against the Flyers.  </P> <P> "Now we can just concentrate on playing hockey," said Pittsburgh's Mario  Lemieux. "If we meet them, we know we can beat them in the playoffs here. . . .  This was one of the barriers we had to overcome as a team."  </P> <P> Bob Errey gave the Penguins a 3-1 lead in the second period on a short-handed  goal when he tipped in a shot by Lemieux, who had two assists in the game. Rob  Brown's goal gave the Penguins a 3-goal advantage going into the third period.  </P> <P> Mike Bullard and Pelle Eklund scored for the Flyers in the final period, but  Dan Quinn ensured the victory for the Penguins with his 29th goal of the  season.  </P> <P> Calgary 3, Detroit 2 -- Joe Nieuwendyk scored at 1:45 of overtime to give the  Flames the victory over the Red Wings at Calgary.  </P> <P> Calgary's Gary Roberts had tied the game midway through the third period. Hakan  Loob scored the other goal for the Flames, who are unbeaten in their last six  games with five wins and a tie.  </P> <P> Steve Yzerman and Gerard Gallant scored for the Red Wings, who are winless in  their last three games and 2-6 in their last eight.  </P> <P> Montreal 6, Quebec 1 -- Gillies Thibaudeau scored twice and Stephane Richer  added a goal and two assists to lead the Canadiens to victory at Quebec.  </P> <P> The Canadiens had lost three of their first four meetings against the Nordiques  this season.  </P> <P> St Louis 7, Buffalo 3 -- The Blues won back-to-back games for the first time  since Dec. 6 and took over second place in the Norris Division with the victory  at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Tony McKegney scored at 0:21 and again at 14:08 to give the Blues a 3-2 lead in  the opening period, which featured three goals and 26 shots in the the first  1:47.  </P> <P> Rick Vaive, Dave Andreychuk and Mike Hartman scored for Buffalo.  </P> <P> Toronto 4, New York Islanders 1 -- Tom Fergus scored the tie-breaking goal late  in the second period to lead the Maple Leafs past the Islanders at Uniondale,  N.Y., in a meeting of the teams with the worst records in the National Hockey  League.  </P> <P> Toronto went ahead, 2-1, on Fergus' goal, and added two goals in the last  minute of the game.  </P></p>

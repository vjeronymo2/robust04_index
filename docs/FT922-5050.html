			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Police case Alison Halford, an assistant chief constable for Merseyside, arrives at an industrial tribunal yesterday. Ms Halford told the tribunal that she endured 'years of misery' among senior police officers. She is claiming sex discrimination against the present chief constable; the home secretary; HM inspector of constabulary for the north-west; and Northamptonshire police authority. Ms Halford claims that, of nine applications for senior posts, she was shortlisted only twice and was never successful because she is a woman. The hearing continues today.</p>

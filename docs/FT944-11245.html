			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (2): Services provide the jobs - Exports are leading the region out of recession As the UK pulls haltingly out of recession, there is more confidence around in the West Midlands, which, as home to a large concentration of manufacturing industry, is particularly encouraged by the strength of exports. In the last few years, unemployment has fallen more quickly than in the UK as a whole because of inward investment, which to some extent diluted the region's dependence on a small group of large producers. The region also boasts highly competitive wage rates, and the differential with the rest of the UK is growing. But the optimism is tempered by concern about that continuing dependence on manufacturing. It has exaggerated the impact of the last two recessions in the region, with unemployment rising more sharply at the start of each, and recovering more quickly at the end than in the UK as a whole. Mr David Ritchie, regional director for the Government Office of the West Midlands, insists that manufacturing has to be underpinned: 'No advanced economy has survived without a manufacturing base. If this country is going to become competitive, it has to have a manufacturing base.' Birmingham alone still has 128,000 people working in manufacturing, in spite of diversification. There have been huge improvements in competitiveness among the region's larger companies, such as the big vehicle assemblers - which represent 30 per cent of the region's GDP, against 8.5 per cent for the UK as a whole. But there is still a long way to go among the small and medium companies - the foundry industry is seen as a sector where improvement is particularly needed. The close ties of much of the region's economy to the motor industry promise a challenge to the region in the longer term, with increasing competition from the Far East and from other parts of Europe. As Mr Martin Booth, chief economist at the West Midlands Enterprise Board, points out, manufacturers are always going to look at where they can get the best deal in assembling new models. The UK has done well in this respect, aided by the low level of the sterling exchange rate and the competitive work practices stimulated by Japanese transplants. But, says Mr Booth, as eastern Europe develops, countries such as Hungary and Poland could compete for new car plants. And since the sale of Rover Group to BMW of Germany, there is no large UK-controlled car maker, and all strategic decisions are taken outside the UK. Current growth is also benefiting the components sector. with the big assemblers working increasingly closely with first-tier suppliers. The relationship, dependent on quality and price, is based on component prices continuing to fall, which is less easy to achieve if volumes stop growing. Mr Chris Tillett, a principal with accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Birmingham, says that West Midlands industry is more vulnerable than the rest of the UK to the effects of increased competition within the European single market, revisions to Gatt and to changes in the distribution system. As an example, he cites the increasing internationalisation of retailing, with companies such as household products group, Ikea, able to supply its growing market share in ceramic products - an important industry around Stoke-on-Trent - from a range of international suppliers. West Midlands companies, which tend to be small, are less well placed to compete in international markets. Some of the forecasts are enormously depressing. Ereaco, the European research organisation, says employment in manufacturing will drop by 6.4 per cent a year until 1997 in the West Midlands. But research also shows the region doing well in services and with a location quotient - a measure of how desirable it is perceived to be as a business location - above the UK average. There is also a growing pocket of electronics companies around Telford; and Wolverhampton and parts of Birmingham are competitive in what they can provide in regional assistance. Most commentators expect any employment growth to come in services such as retailing, and that therefore the region's economy will become more dependent on lower-waged and part-time jobs. A recent report from the Birmingham Economic Information Centre - run by the city council and the training and enterprise council - said starkly: 'Relatively high levels of unemployment, leading to serious social and economic deprivation in some parts of the city, are likely to persist for many years to come. These problems represent a further constraint on local economic growth as they depress levels of consumer spending power.' There may be less help available from diversification which, says Mr Booth, was helped in the 1980s by service companies moving out of London - for instance, the TSB head office move to Birmingham and Barclays Bank's back-office functions to Coventry. The property and labour cost pressure for such moves has now eased. Mr Booth also points to the region's shortage of greenfield sites - he doubted whether any site available in the West Midlands could have taken the Toyota plant which went to Burnaston in Derbyshire. A number of 'brownfield' sites are being reclaimed, but some investors, notably those from the US, are wary of sites whichthey fear could bring nasty surprises. The region also has a poor recent record in new company formation. The number of VAT-registered businesses in the UK rose 33 per cent between 1979 and 1990 - the figure for the region was 24 per cent and for Birmingham just 9 per cent. There are bright spots in the region. Coventry, says Mr Tillett, is 'holding its own,' as is Solihull; while Warwickshire is forecast to have one of the fastest growth rates in the UK over the next few years. Also doing well are the smaller centres to the south and west of Birmingham  -Redditch, Kidderminster, Worcester, Telford. Like Birmingham, Stoke is struggling and Burton has suffered from a shakeout in the brewing and food industries. The region faces considerable challenges in its drive towards urban renewal. New manufacturing needs to be attracted, local companies need to gear up to win contracts from the inward investors who are setting up plants in the region and, perhaps most importantly, local industry must invest and develop to meet the increasing competitive pressures from elsewhere.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage change in employment: 1981-1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  W Midlands        Great                    Birmingham        Region      Britain  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Manufacturing         -43.5%           -31%       -22.1% Services                6.2%          16.1%        13.1% Self-employment        37.8%          39.4%        34.6% Total                 -11.2%          -0.7%         5.0%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: 1981, Census of Employment; 1992, Employment Gazettwe &amp; BEIC estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

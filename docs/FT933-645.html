			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Severn Trent denies board split SEVERN TRENT yesterday denied allegations that a boardroom split had resulted in the retirement of Mr John Bellak, its outspoken chairman and the man who has guided the company from government-owned water authority to quoted utility. The company said Mr Bellak's retirement on March 31 followed board discussions about management succession, begun in October last year. Mr Roderick Paul, the chief executive, is due to retire in 1995. Mr Paul said rumours of a row over strategy were 'completely untrue'. The board had been anxious to put a management succession in place so 'we did not have the chairman and chief executive retiring at the same time,' he said. Mr Bellak yesterday reinforced Mr Paul's denial. 'It's a load of balls,' he said. 'I do not recall a single disagreement. The strategy . . . has always had the support of a united board.' Severn Trent is expected to announce Mr Bellak's successor within the next two months. It is believed that nine potential candidates have been approached, while the company's deputy chairman, Mr Richard Ireland, finance director at Wolseley, is thought to be a strong candidate. Some analysts and investors dismissed Severn Trent's attempts to project an image of a unified board. 'It looked more like push than walk,' said one. He suggested that perhaps Mr Bellak was paying the price for an aggressive, but less-than-successful diversification strategy. In 1990, Severn let its Pounds 74m hostile bid for Caird, the waste management group, lapse leaving it with a Pounds 10m write-off and a 29.9m per cent stake which it sold for less than the Pounds 16m it paid. Severn has come under further criticism for its Pounds 212m purchase the following year of Biffa, the waste management group previously owned by BET. It is widely acknowledged that Severn overpaid for Biffa, and onerous financing arrangements mean that a sale is currently unthinkable. The company yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to Biffa, saying it had no intention of selling the business. 'The problem really is that there is no easy way out,' said one analyst. Mr Bellak has long been an enthusiastic advocate of diversification. A Czech-born refugee from Nazi Germany, he was appointed chairman 10 years ago. He is widely regarded as a colourful character whose direct manner often sparks vigorous discussion. A keen sportsman, Mr Bellak said yesterday that he intended to go shooting when he retired. 'April Fool's Day is no day to start anything new,' he said. It was also announced yesterday that Mr Victor Cocker, who has been tipped as Mr Paul's replacement, will become deputy chief executive.</p>

Lake, Regional Administrator, State rules comparable to 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 6403) on February 24, 1992, and subsequent corrections published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 7847) on March 4, 1992.

The State had adopted Federal and State-initiated corrective amendments on October 20, 1993, effective November 1, 1993, under Administrative Order 93&hyph;06. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to Federal standards changes, the State submitted by letters dated March 3, 1993, from Mark O. Brown, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, State standards comparable to Federal standards 29 CFR 1910.19, 1910.1050, and 1926.60, Occupational Exposure to 4,4 Methylenedianiline (MDA); Final Rule, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 35666) on August 10, 1992. The State's standards were adopted on February 3, 1993, effective March 15, 1993, under Administrative Order 92&hyph;15. They are contained in WAC 296&hyph;56&hyph;60001(2), WAC 296&hyph;62&hyph;076, and WAC 296&hyph;155&hyph;173. The standards are identical to the Federal except for one minor difference: The sampling and lab analysis procedures in 29 CFR 1910.1050 Appendix D and 29 CFR 1926.60 Appendix D were developed for the OSHA Tracer 222 Gas Chromatograph. The State of Washington uses a Hewlett Packard 5880 Gas Chromatograph. Therefore, the State needed to change the analytical procedures to reflect the Hewlett Packard procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to Federal standards changes, the State submitted by letters dated April 21, 1992, and January 4, 1993, from Joseph A.

Lake, Regional Administrator, a State standard comparable to the Federal standard 29 CFR 1910.1030, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 64175) on December 6, 1991, and corrected (57 FR 29206) on July 1, 1992.

The State's corrections were adopted on December 11, 1992, effective January 15, 1993, under Administrative Order 92&hyph;15. The State standard, at WAC 296&hyph;62&hyph;080, contains some minor differences: At 29 CFR 1910.1030(b), the State's comparable standard WAC 296&hyph;62&hyph;08001(2) adds the word ``contaminated'' before the last word ``sharps'' in the definition for contaminated laundry; punctuation changes have been made; editorial changes have been added to incorporate the State agency title and the State's numbering system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to Federal standards changes, the State submitted by letters dated January 25, 1989, and November 30, 1992, from Joseph A.

The State's second submission, dated November 30, 1992, was adopted on November 10, 1992, effective December 18, 1992, under Administrative Order 92&hyph;13. This submission incorporated the corrections. Regional Office review revealed discrepancies, and the submission was returned to the State for correction on December 18, 1992. On October 22, 1993, the State re-submitted its standard, as revised September 22, 1993, effective November 1, 1993, under Administrative Order 93&hyph;04. The State had changed the 750 volts requirements to 600 volts, as requested by OSHA. The State standard in contained in WAC 296&hyph;155 part I. Minor editorial changes were made which did not change the meaning of the standard. The State added provisions for construction site precautions to make open wiring inaccessible to unauthorized personnel. Also, provisions were added concerning attaching, bonding, and grounding clamps or clips; receptacles for attaching plugs and temporary outlet boxes; skirted-typed attachment plugs for equipment at more than 300 volts; hard usage electrical cords for temporary lights; trailing cables protection; and electrical barriers. The State added definitions for Hazard, J-Box (Junction Box), Shock Hazard, and Transformer. OSHA has determined that these changes are minor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above program change supplements have been incorporated as part of the State plan.

OSHA has also determined that the State standards and amendments for Machine Guarding, Portable Powered Tools, Benzene, Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout), Stairways and Ladders in Construction, Scaffolding in Construction, Floor and Wall Openings in Construction, Floor Openings and Stairways in Construction, Presence Sensing Device Initiation of Mechanical Power Presses, 4,4 Methylenedianiline (MDA), Bloodborne Pathogens, and Subpart K Electrical are at least as effective as the comparable Federal standards as required by section 18(c)(2) of the Act. OSHA has also determined that the differences between the State and Federal standards and amendments are minimal and that the standards are thus substantially identical. OSHA therefore approves these standards and amendments; however, the right to reconsider this approval is reserved should substantial objections be submitted to the Assistant Secretary. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

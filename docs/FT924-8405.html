			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Observer: Old model At first sight, Lawrence Klein, the 72-year-old Nobel economics prize-winner, would not seem the most obvious person to advise China on how to reform its economy. After all, Klein, author of The Keynesian Revolution and founder of Wharton Econometrics, has been associated with the sorts of economic policy and instruments which have not been an unqualified success in Western economies. By contrast, China's private sector is booming and the economy is growing at an annual rate of 10 per cent plus. Now might not seem the best time for the powers-to-be to start tinkering with the sort of micro-economic management that has failed elsewhere. However, China is no stranger to stop-go economic policies and Klein, who has made eight trips to the country, is no novice on the country's problems. Even fast-growing countries have to manage their growth, especially if this involves dismantling the complex structures of socialist bureaucracy. Econometric modellers may be out of fashion, but few industrialised nations dare dismantle their economic models, however flawed.</p>

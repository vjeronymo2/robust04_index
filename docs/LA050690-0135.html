Dingell (D-Mich.) charged that the manufacturer of the Navy's new  $1.2-billion guided-missile destroyer is hampering congressional investigators  examining allegations of contract fraud. Dingell, in a letter to Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney, said Bath Iron Works of Bath, Me., has refused to  provide the congressional General Accounting Office with documents or allow  investigators to interview employees unless the GAO promises to withhold the  information from Congress.  </P></p>

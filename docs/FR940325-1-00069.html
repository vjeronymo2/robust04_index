			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.1&hyph;1&blank;Acquired Lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would revise this section to clarify that existing grazing permits and leases on lands acquired by the BLM are subject to the permit or lease terms and conditions that were in effect at the time of acquisition. Upon expiration of the preexisting permit or lease, grazing management of the acquired lands would become subject to the provisions of 43 CFR part 4100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.2&hyph;1&blank;Base Property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be amended by clarifying that base property is required to be capable of serving as a base for livestock operations but it need not be used for livestock production at the time the authorized officer finds it to be base property. A provision has been added to the amendments presented in the advance notice to make clear that the permittee's or lessee's interest in a base water previously recognized as base property shall qualify as base property. Where authorized water developments on public lands that have been previously recognized as base property require reconstruction or replacement in order to continue to service the same area, and the reconstructed or new development has been authorized through a range improvement permit or cooperative range improvement agreement, the permittee's or lessee's interest in the new or reconstructed water development would be recognized as base property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.2&hyph;2&blank;Specifying Grazing Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be renamed ``Specifying permitted use'' to reflect the redefinition of the term ``grazing preference,'' and would be amended to replace the term ``grazing preference'' with ``permitted use.'' Also, the section would be amended to clarify that levels of grazing use on ephemeral or annual ranges are established on the basis of the amount of forage that is temporarily available pursuant to vegetation standards prescribed by land use plans or activity plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.2&hyph;3&blank;Transfer of Grazing Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be amended to reflect the new requirements of &sect;4110.1&hyph;1 pertaining to the applicant's history of performance and by adding a new paragraph (f) to require that new permits or leases stemming from transfer of the base property be for a minimum time period of three years. These provisions are necessary to provide for stability in meeting the objectives of these regulations for protection and improvement of the rangelands and resources and to reduce the administrative work in processing transfers. Currently about 1,850 of the BLM leases or permits, approximately 10 percent of the total number, involve leased base property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.2&hyph;4&blank;Allotments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW TRIAL ASKED IN ROCK HUDSON CASE  </P> <P> Lawyers for actor Rock Hudson's estate and personal secretary requested a new  trial in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday, alleging a jury was excessive in  handing down a $21.7-million verdict against their clients for Hudson's not  telling his former lover he had AIDS. Lawyers also said a new trial was  warranted because of alleged errors by the judge and misconduct by jurors.  </P> <P> A jury of seven women and five men awarded Hudson's former lover, Marc  Christian, $14.5 million on Feb. 16, deciding that the late actor conspired  with his secretary, Mark Miller, to keep his acquired immune deficiency  syndrome infection a secret from Christian so they could continue having sex  together.  </P> <P> The jury then awarded $7.25 million against Miller in exemplary and punitive  damages to punish him for his "despicable conduct" in helping Hudson hide his  illness.  </P></p>

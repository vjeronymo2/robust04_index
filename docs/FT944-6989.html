			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lifted by upbeat Wall Street return An upbeat return by Wall Street lifted bourses in the afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Francois Langlade-Demoyen at CS First Boston thought that US weakness could resume next week, and that European equities offered better potential returns than their US counterparts. FRANKFURT seemed short of motivation on the session, the Dax index trading narrowly between 2057.51 and 2051.12 before closing 4.35 lower at 2,051.62, 2.4 per cent down on the week. In the afternoon, the Ibis indicated Dax recovered to 2,056.27. Turnover fell from DM5.1bn to DM4.5bn. There were some biggish falls in blue chips: Henkel, lacking the charms of more cyclical chemical stocks, shed another DM12.50 to DM564.50; VW produced its five-year review and dropped DM9.50 to DM446.50 as analysts said that brokers' forecasts for 1995 earnings had been considerably higher than the DM890m pre-tax expected by the carmaker. Retailers saw more weakness, Karstadt losing DM12.50 at DM554.50 on its bearish 1994 outlook, and Kaufhof DM6.40 at DM451.60. However, there was brighter news among second liners, noted Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf: Krones put on DM40 to DM900 after the engineer's UK presentation this week; and Kampa Haus, the prefabricated housing company which had suffered from a UK analyst's downgrade, recovered DM66 to DM895 after a television interview with the chairman put a better view of prospects. PARIS reversed early losses after Wall Street's opening and the CAC-40 index eventually closed 11.21 higher at 1,945.89 for a 1 per cent gain on the week in turnover of FFr2.8bn. Alcatel Alsthom recovered another FFr5.40 at FFr445.60, professionals noting that it was still more than 50 per cent below its year's high; Generale des Eaux staged a technical rebound, FFr24, or nearly 5 per cent higher at FFr510. On the losing side, DMC fell FFr13.10 to FFr305 after analysts cut their estimates for the textiles company; and CCF by FFr6.30 to FFr229.10, on disappointment after the bank projected second-half profits similar to those of the first six months. MILAN remained vulnerable to the fraught political situation and the Comit index fell 3.48 to 623.17, 3.2 per cent lower over the week. Politics also spilled directly into business as concern grew that the country's second cellular telephone licence, awarded to an Olivetti-led consortium, could be delayed by lingering opposition inside the governing coalition. Olivetti gave up L34 or 1.8 per cent to L1,868 while Cir, Mr Carlo de Benedetti's industrial holding company, lost L45 at L1,769. Credito Italiano lost L51, or 3 per cent, to L1,638 after reports that the bank appeared to be winning over leading shareholders in Credito Romagnolo to its L2,000bn takeover offer, but that it might have to pay a higher price and would take more than the 48 per cent originally proposed. Romagnolo gained L493, or 3.0 per cent, to L17,096 amid speculation that another bank, or banks, might enter the fray. ZURICH edged ahead in quiet trading, supported by the better tone on Wall Street, and the SMI index finished 3.9 higher at 2,572.5, for a 1.3 per cent decline over the week. UBS bearers reversed some of the sharp losses seen after Tuesday's extraordinary shareholders meeting, picking up SFr17 to SFr1,135 while the registered were SFr4 ahead at SFr252. SBC continued higher, adding SFr2 to SFr364 and CS Holding bearers were up SFr4 at SFr550. Swiss Re registered gained SFr4 to SFr792 after the group forecast markedly higher net profits for 1994 before accounting for extraordinary gains for direct insurance sales. AMSTERDAM was lower in lacklustre trade, the AEX index giving up 0.36 to 406.45 for a 0.8 per cent fall on the week. Ing rose 80 cents to Fl 80.80 after Thursday's better-than-expected nine-month results prompted a number of analysts to upgrade earnings estimates. CSM dropped Fl 1.60 to Fl 65.80 with Thursday's nine-month figures falling short of some expectations. KPN put on 50 cents to Fl 54.20, with investors still said to be encouraged by the company's cost-cutting plans.

Last year saw Fujian's gross social product quadruple,  fulfilling its goal set for the end of this century seven years  ahead of schedule, and its industrial output value rise by 48  percent over the previous year.    According to Yang Mingyi, director of the provincial  Environmental Protection Bureau, the province removed, closed  down or merged 83 industrial enterprises discharging heavy  pollution last year. In addition, it spent more than 50 million  yuan on transforming 265 projects.    The bureau approved the building of more than 100 projects,  which will install pollution-control facilities and release  little pollution upon completion.    To help rural industrial enterprises solve pollution  problems, the Environmental Protection Bureau has set up the  "Dabao Industrial Pollution Control Center" in Shishi, a boom  town in southeast Fujian.    The director noted that Fujian will focus on pollution  treatment at 89 key state enterprises and nine units discharging  serious pollution this year, while urging overseas-funded and  rural industrial enterprises to exert more efforts to clean up  pollution.</p>

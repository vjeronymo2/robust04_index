			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Hounded out by fiction and foes: History will be kinder to Norman Lamont than the tabloid press has been Norman Lamont must go down as one of the unluckiest chancellors. I hope that history will also see him as a brave man who took unpopular decisions in the best interests of the country. It is no credit to our governance that he was ultimately brought down by the mob, led on by the popular press. When he took office in November 1990 the chancellor inherited a double-digit rate of inflation, which he hated, and an economy moving rapidly into recession. He decided to make the elimination of inflation his main policy aim and in this he was outstandingly successful. The headline inflation rate fell from nearly 11 per cent to just over 1 per cent during his stewardship. But the price was high. The recession proved much longer and deeper than mainstream forecasters had expected. A recovery, originally expected well ahead of the April 1992 election, was still not in the bag by last Christmas. In the meantime an alarming deterioration in the public finances had become all too visible. A chancellor committed to cutting taxes had to introduce a tax-raising budget. It was, of course, none of these problems that brought him down. Everybody will remember Norman Lamont as the man who had publicly defended an exchange rate policy for which, as the cabinet's leading Euro-sceptic, he had little affection, and then clung to office when the policy collapsed. He was filmed on the Treasury steps in late August saying there was no scintilla of doubt that the pound would stay in the ERM. Three weeks later, from a nearby spot, he announced the suspension of ERM membership. If he had gone then, the reasons for his departure would have been clear. But his senior colleagues agreed that the ERM debacle was not his fault. He stayed, and on balance I believe he was right to do so. Those who cite the precedent of Jim Callaghan's resignation over the sterling devaluation of 1967 are drawing a distant and misleading parallel. They should look at what other countries have done following the many realignment crises that have dogged the ERM at roughly two-year intervals since its birth in 1979. They have not found it necessary to change their finance ministers along with their ERM parity. Should Mr Lamont have ducked the fight to stay in? That would have been a breach of faith with all in Britain who supported ERM entry and with Britain's partners in the EC. Should he have devalued rather than float? The countries which chose that option have had an uncomfortable time, with interest rates still high and the risk of another realignment crisis never far away. By fighting to stay in until he was forced out, the chancellor sent a very clear signal of his determination to defeat inflation with a strong pound and high interest rates. He also underlined the government's commitment to the ERM, keeping open the option of rejoining the system. That option seemed more important then than now. But when re-entry comes back on the agenda, Mr Lamont's dogged defence of sterling's ERM parity will stand us in good stead. Once out of the ERM Mr Lamont swiftly cut short-term interest rates, bringing them decisively below German rates, as they needed to be. His Autumn Statement contained further measures to bolster confidence, notably the abolition of the car tax. The UK is now enjoying a recovery while the rest of the Community is in deepening recession. Mr Lamont also put in place a new framework for the conduct of policy. He set, for the first time, an explicit inflation target, buttressed by indicative ranges for broad and narrow money. He announced that progress on inflation would be monitored in regular monthly meetings with the governor of the Bank of England, on a pre-announced timetable. He ordered the publication of the internal documents on which that assessment was based. He also gave the Bank of England a new quasi-independent role in monitoring the inflation performance and publishing a quarterly report on the subject. The new policies were outlined, in a speech to the International Monetary Fund, the weekend immediately after exit from the ERM. Over the next few weeks further details were announced in a letter to the Treasury committee, in the Mansion House speech and in the Autumn Statement. This measured pace was considered too slow by some. But policies made on the hoof are followed all too often by U-turns. The verdict of the financial markets on all this is clear. The long bond rate, the acid test of inflationary expectations, is more than 1 percentage point lower than in September. The exchange rate has held steady. So why did we keep on reading that the City had lost all confidence in the chancellor? Perhaps it was because the tabloids turned on him. Having hounded David Mellor out of office for some over-enthusiastic socialising in a Chelsea strip, they attempted to bring down Mr Lamont by character assassination. They produced a mischievous story about his party conference hotel bill. They dug up another about his Access bill (lost when building works drove him temporarily out of Number 11). They kept digging and found that some of the costs of evicting an unsuitable tenant 18 months earlier had been met out of public funds. Worst of all, when Lamont stopped at the Marble Arch Threshers (on the way home from Dorney Wood) to pick up some wine for dinner the incident was turned, by false witness, into a fictitious purchase of champagne and cheap cigarettes in Paddington. He survived it all and went on to present his third Budget - a delicate balancing act. Public borrowing needed to be reduced but the recovery was still very fragile. The chancellor solved the problem by announcing a programme of delayed tax increases. The innovation received good reviews (as had both of his previous Budgets) and the economic data published since then suggest the economy is still on the path to recovery. So during the Easter recess it looked as though, for once, all was set fair. Growth had resumed; inflation, both prices and wages, was hitting record lows; the problem of the public finances had been addressed. It was a fair bet that Mr Lamont would present the first unified Budget, his fourth, and bow out with honour shortly after. Then came the Newbury by-election. The government suffered a huge defeat, and suddenly the papers were again full of calls for the chancellor's resignation. This time he lost the support of his closest colleagues and was obliged to depart, to a gleeful tabloid chorus of 'Lamont humiliated' headlines. The departure of a cabinet minister is an important political event. It is usually the result either of a scandal or a big disagreement within the government over policy. Mr Lamont's departure does not fit that pattern. The change of policy occurred nine months ago and has proved rather successful. The scandals dominated the headlines six months ago, and were either fictitious or not very scandalous. The chancellor nevertheless had to go because word came back from Newbury to the party managers that he was unpopular. The voters mentioned the hotel bill, the Access bill, the lawyers' bill, the Threshers bill. Nobody mentioned the Finance Bill. That reflects the coverage accorded to Mr Lamont by the tabloids. Politicians are judged by the quality of their decisions. Mr Lamont took some good ones and leaves the economy in much better shape than he found it. The history books will be kinder to him than his contemporaries have been. The author was special adviser to the chancellor and former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies</p>

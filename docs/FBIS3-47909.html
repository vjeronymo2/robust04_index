Mun Ik-hwan, a pro-reunification patriot.    This was disclosed in a telephone message sent today by Paek  In-chun, chairman of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon,  to Yi Yong-tok, "minister of the Unification Board" of South  Korea.    The message said:    The late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan enjoyed the love and respect of  the  nation as a reputed pro-reunification patriot for his many  years' patriotic activities for the democratisation of society  and the reunification of the country against the interference of  outside forces.    Particularly, he visited Pyongyang at the risk of his life  in  1989 and was received by respected President Kim Il-song, and  went back after discussing the reunification question of the  country with the North sides officials concerned with  reunification, thus not only instilling the conviction of  national reunification into the South Korean people but leaving  unforgettable impressions to the people in the northern half of  Korea.    It was to be regretted that when the Rev. Mun Ik-hwan was  put  under illegal detention after his visit to Pyongyang, we could  not pay a consolatory visit to him owing to the obstructive  moves of the military authorities of your side.    Love and sympathy of our people for him are getting stronger  today when he passed away without seeing the day of  reunification for which he longed so ardently in his lifetime.    We inform you that we decided to send a mourners' group to  Seoul in order to convey the most profound sorrow of our people  for the deceased.    I propose to have a contact between working officials of  both  sides at the conference room of the Neutral Nations Supervisory  Commission at Panmunjom at 10:00 on January 21 (Friday) to  discuss practical matters concerning the visit of our group to  Seoul.    I express the hope that your side will take a corresponding  measure as our side plans to send two liaison officials of the  North-South liaison office.</p>

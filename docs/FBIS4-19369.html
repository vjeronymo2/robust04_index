			<p>BFN     [Text] In yesterday's elections for local authorities in  five municipal areas and 253 communities, four out the five  mayors elected were AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working  People] candidates while most of the community heads elected  were independent candidates.    The following mayors were elected: Panikos Louroutziatis in  Yermasoyia, Varvara Perikleous in Ayia Napa, Florendia Ioannou  in Dherinia, Menelaos Khristodhoulou in Yeroskipos, all AKEL  candidates, and Dhimitrios Kappetzis, who was supported by DIKO  [Democratic Party] in Peyia.    Some 13 AKEL candidates became municipal councilors--three  in  Yermasoyia, four in Dherinia, and two each in Ayia Napa,  Yeroskipos, and Peyia. Some eight DISI [Democratic Rally]  candidates were elected as councillors--two each in Yermasoyia,  Dherinia, Yeroskipos, and Peyia. And four DIKO councilors were  elected--one each in Yermasoyia and Yeroskipos and two in Peyia.  The DISI-DIKO partnership had two candidates elected as  municipal councilors in Ayia Napa. EDEK [United Democratic  Union of Cyprus] got one municipal councillor in Yeroskipos  while two independents became Ayia Napa councillors.    In the community elections, 164 independent candidates were  elected as community heads, 22 from the DISI-DIKO partnership  were elected, 22 AKEL, 10 DISI, three DIKO, and two EDEK. Five  community heads were elected by ballot because they received the  same number of votes as their nearest rivals. They are the  community heads in the villages of Perapedhi, Ayios Dhimitrios,  Episkopi, Kato Moni, and Philousa Kedharon.</p>

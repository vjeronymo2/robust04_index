			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLLSTER FINDS 'POSITIVE FEELINGS' ABOUT THE BIBLE  </P> <P> Americans have very "positive feelings" about the Bible, says a Glendale  pollster whose national survey of adults this month showed that 73% agreed with  the statement that "it is important for people to read the Bible."  </P> <P> Six of 10 people interviewed by phone also agreed either strongly or moderately  that the Bible "is the written word of God, and is totally accurate in all that  it teaches," according to George Barna, president of the Barna Research Group.  </P> <P> However, 57% of the respondents -- out of a representative sample of 602 adults  -- admitted that they do not read it except at church services. That figure was  slightly higher than the response to the same question from a similar survey in  1987, Barna said. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4%.  </P> <P> Only 10% believed that the Bible was "out of date," but 31% said that the Bible  was "too difficult to understand" -- regardless of whether they were speaking  of the 17th-Century King James Bible or other translations. Even among regular  Bible readers, 24% said it was difficult to understand.  </P> <P> "Until people see the Bible as a practical guidebook for their everyday  existence, it will probably continue to remain on the shelf next to 'The  Complete Works of William Shakespeare' and 'War and Peace,' " Barna said in  announcing the results.  </P> <P> "There is nothing wrong with people using it as a reference work," Barna said  in an interview.  </P> <P> "I personally come from a conservative Protestant philosophy that suggests part  of our . . . relationship with God is knowing the Word," he said, adding that  he questions whether one who occasionally reads the Bible could have "a growing  relationship with God."

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Latin America, lost and found CAPITAL IS once more flowing into Latin America. One estimate suggests more than Dollars 40bn in private capital flooded into the region last year, three times the 1990 inflow. Although undoubtedly encouraged by low US interest rates, a main motivation for the returning funds is the transformation of economic and trade policies in the region. Latin America now boasts some of the most open trade regimes in the world. Its governments are seeking, and often succeeding in, reductions in budget deficits and are shedding the millstone of state-owned industries through privatisation programmes. Much of the inflow takes the form of returning flight capital, money sent abroad in the 1970s and 1980s to shield it from government irresponsibility, of which a country's own citizens are often the best judges. This pool of capital, according to the head of the InterAmerican Development Bank, represents 'the largest savings account in the developing world'. The region's potential has been enhanced by the Brady plan, the 1989 debt reduction initiative named after the US Treasury Secretary. The first and third most indebted nations in the region - Brazil and Argentina - should soon follow Mexico into a comprehensive Brady accord with commercial bank lenders. They may reach agreements in principle next month, although the deals probably will not be completed by the 10th anniversary of Mexico's announcement on August 12 1982, which marked the start of the region's debt crisis. Past crisis Provided economic reform continues, the accords should allow Argentina and Brazil to put their debt problems behind them. This is not a foregone conclusion - and smaller countries are still labouring under excessive debt  -yet the debt crisis, in the sense of a problem blighting the whole region, is past. These improvements mean that the last decade has not been entirely 'lost' as some have suggested. Gone are most of the morally and financially bankrupt military regimes that featured in the region a decade ago. The inadequacy of the old protectionist model of Latin American economic development has also been laid bare. Although economic reform still has a long way to go, there is optimism that what has been done so far has established a basis for sustained gains in living standards in a good part of the region. But these improvements will not be sustained simply on the back of economic reform. Popular support Indeed, this is the message of the abortive February coup attempt in Venezuela. President Carlos Andres Perez had moved ahead with certain aspects of economic reform but had failed in a crucial respect: to secure popular support for his programme. Popular support has aided both the Mexican and the Argentine economic reform programmes. It was lacking in Venezuela partly because the provision of goods provided by the public sector - health care, education, public housing, clean water - was deteriorating. At the same time, while most sectors of the economy were being forced to forego traditional privileges, politicians were jealously preserving their own. The Perez government was unable to dispel the aura of corruption of Venezuelan politics. Since the coup, the president has announced initiatives to tackle corruption and alter the political and judicial system that foster it. This is belated but essential. Mr Perez will not solve his problems by rolling back his economic reform programme. But in Venezuela, and elsewhere, the programme will only succeed as part of a series of changes. These should seek to improve the effectiveness of a social safety net for the poor and increase the credibility of government institutions. The aim should be to secure a proper role for government. Government should not be seen as the source of wealth: rather, it should be trusted as an arbiter, policeman and provider of public goods. Moving towards that ideal will not be easy. In some countries, there will be reverses such as that which almost overtook Venezuela. But rather like old age, difficult as that is, the alternative is a lot less attractive.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Swissair dividend passed as profits dip Swissair, Switzerland's shareholder-owned national airline, announced Wednesday that its net group profit fell 48 per cent in 1993, to SFr59m (Dollars 40.9m) from SFr113m in 1992, AP-DJ reports from Zurich. It also said it would pass its dividend on the 1993 results. As previously reported, the company posted a first-half 1993 group net loss of SFr65m. Swissair indicated a month ago that full-year 1993 group results would be positive. At the airline level, 1993 net profit fell 68 per cent to SFr6.7m from SFr20.8m in 1992. The company blamed fare erosion and said it would ask shareholders to agree to omit a dividend. Last year, the airline paid a dividend of SFr10 a share, down from SFr20 the year before. Group cash flow from operations rose 10 per cent in 1993 to SFr518m from SFr471m in 1992. Group revenues rose 3 per cent to SFr6.4bn from SFr6.2bn. Group operating profit rose slightly last year to SFr216m from SFr214m in 1992. Swissair also announced an offer to minority shareholders in its Balair-CTA charter airline unit to swap their shares for shares in Swissair and cash. Swissair said the offer will use Swissair shares which the company already has in reserve. The company will offer one Swissair registered share plus SFr79 in cash for five Balair-CTA shares, and one registered share and SFr112 in cash for six Balair-CTA participation certificates. Based on closing prices of March 31, the offer represents a 23 per cent gain for shareholders and a 31 per cent gain for owners of participation certificates, Swissair said.</p>

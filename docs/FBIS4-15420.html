			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said that  only about 180,000 people can realistically be conscripted into  the armed forces in spring 1994. Speaking at the Defense  Collegium in Moscow, he said that for the country's defense  capability to be maintained, a minimum of 700,000 new recruits  should be inducted into the army and navy. Grachev said the  clause in the law on defense that says the number of people in  the armed forces is restricted to one percent of the population  of Russia should be changed. A million and a half is not an  army but a military formation capable of undertaking local  combat activity, the minister believes.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Terry Wogan continues his bid for heavyweight status by wandering among a studio full of young people (that's right, just like Kilroy) and urging them to ask questions of a panel of Liberal Democrats in Wogan (7.00). Last week he did Labour, next week, presumably, the Tories. People who burn poundsworths' of petrol in their Volvo Estates taking little packets of newspapers to the recycling dump do not thank you when you tell them that most of the paper ostensibly collected for recycling in Britain is actually used for landfill. (Fact). They will probably be deeply upset by tonight's Horizon which, instead of blithely accepting the sentimental middle class view that Red Indians are the original environmentalists and the guardians of mother earth, sets out to check whether this is true (8.10 BBC2). There is a three-way choice at 9.00. ITV starts another run of El Cid, the tale of cops and robbers on the Costa Brava, now minus Alfred Molina. BBC2 screens Arena on the 50th anniversary of 'Desert Island Discs'. And, my choice, C4 shows the third of an excellent four-part documentary on The Falklands War.</p>

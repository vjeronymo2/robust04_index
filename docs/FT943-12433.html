			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Frankfurt Worries about tomorrow's results from Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank made for nervous trading in the sector at the end of last week, writes John Pitt. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the country's banking sector remains attractive to a number of brokers. Paribas Capital Markets expects the sector to outperform the market over the next six months, following a period of underperformance - over the past year banks have lagged behind by 12 to 18 per cent 'Over the last six months, sentiment has suffered from adverse publicity concerning the banks' involvement in various scandals,' said Paribas. It rated Deutsche a buy, arguing that the Metallgesellschaft and Schneider involvements were likely to prove 'special cases in the German recession, rather than the rule'.

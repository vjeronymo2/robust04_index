			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Property: Positive vetting IT IS A few years since one of the 96 chambers at the Albany in London came on to the open market. In offering the 'freehold' on one seven-room apartment in the buildings, Richard Crosthwaite of the Mayfair office of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) explains that it is an executors' sale. Otherwise, outsiders would be unlikely to hear of it. 'There is a strong tradition of owners making private arrangements, assigning leases, renting apartments; keeping it in the family wherever possible,' says Crosthwaite. Albany, lying behind private courtyards off Piccadilly and Savile Row, has strong claim to be the most exclusive of London's apartment blocks. Historically, the main house on Piccadilly dates from 1774 when it was completed, to Sir William Chambers' designs, for the first Viscount Melbourne. It was not until 1802 that the building was converted into bachelor apartments, and substantially extended at the back on each side of the garden. Two centuries on, and the Albany's residents' lists groan with the weight of the Great and the Good, ranging wide across the talents. Gladstone and Graham Green, Dame Edith Evans and Aldous Huxley, Sir Thomas Beecham and JB Priestley have, at various times, enjoyed the quiet of what Crosthwaite describes as 'a very club-like atmosphere.' A freehold asking price of Pounds 475,000 for 'Set E5', on the second and third floors of one of the rear garden buildings, does not look too demanding given the rarity of the sale. Servants' and storage space on floor three have been converted into a dining room and kitchen, leaving a drawing room, master bedroom and bathroom plus a potential second bedroom or dressing room on the lower floor. It may take more than money to buy at Albany. As in a New York condominium, residents' trustees have to vet and approve the purchaser. Even then they have to accept rules accumulated since the Regency, including no resident children under 13 and no pets. The current estate charge is Pounds 2,994 a year. The freehold rights of individual apartment owners predate Commonhold by two centuries. The system applied here, of a freehold and a parallel Deed of Covenant committing purchasers to the usual common costs of a multi-occupied block, clearly works with occupier-selection of prospective new residents.</p>

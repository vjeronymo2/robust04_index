Nor was there a promise to Turkey to put an end to the party's  activities in Germany, states the government response to a  parliamentary inquiry of the Party of Democratic Socialism,  which was published on Tuesday [8 March].    Even though Turkey had "repeatedly expressed" the desire for  a PKK ban in Germany since the mid-1980's, the measure ordered  by FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic  Union) on 26 Noveber 1993 was "not" implemented "upon the desire  or request of other governments." The ban was based  "exclusively on German laws as well as on the principles of  necessity and reasonableness," the government response stresses.</p>

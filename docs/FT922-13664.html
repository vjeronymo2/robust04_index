			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Rizzoli buys controlling stake in Majestic Films MAJESTIC FILMS, the British film distribution company that put up half the finance for the hit film Dances With Wolves and has been involved with more than 20 feature films, including Henry V and Driving Miss Daisy, has sold a majority stake to RCS Video of Italy. RCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rizzoli-Corriere Sera, the large Italian publisher which has been expanding in the European media. The London company - to be renamed Majestic Films &amp; Television International  -plans to expand, particularly in the production and distribution of television programmes. Its latest project is Maxwell: The Outsider, a two-hour film for television based on Mr Tom Bower's biography which will be shot during the summer for showing at Christmas. Mr Guy East, the former head of sales at Goldcrest and founder of Majestic in 1988, will become chief executive and will retain a significant minority stake in the venture. He declined to say what the deal was worth or what his residual stake would be, but he said it was wise to have a relationship with one of the most powerful groups in European media. Mr Paolo Glisenti, managing director of RCS Video, becomes Majestic chairman. The deal will give Majestic an entree into Italy and the London-based company will also distribute films and television programmes in which RCS has an interest. RCS also has small minority stakes in Carlton Television, which won the London weekday ITV licence, TF1, the French broadcaster, and Carolco, the independent US film studio.</p>

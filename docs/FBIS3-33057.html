			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Manuel D'Ornellas] </F>   [Text] The contents of the "directive" sent by Abimael  Guzman to Shining Path [SL] members living in Sweden -- which  was published yesterday as an exclusive by EXPRESO -- are worth  studying. It is also interesting how that "directive" found its  way out of Guzman's cell in the Callao Navy base -- where he is  supposed to be isolated -- and how it got to Stockholm.    As for the contents of that directive, several issues must  be  studied. First, "President Gonzalo" at no time says he will  give up his objectives or ideology; he simply expresses in other  terms what in other letters he described as a "retreat."    Second, he establishes a date on which the "peace agreement"  will end and when hostilities will resume: "The 21st Century as  a decade," he states. Guzman thus believes that at the  beginning of the next century his organization will have  completely recovered its capability to attack and destroy the  Peruvian State, or that he will by then be freed through an  amnesty of some administration.    Guzman states in his letter to his comrades in Sweden that  the main problem of the "people's war" which "cannot develop" is  found at the level of the "proletariat leadership" which "cannot  be solved on time." This means that as long as he and his close  aides are imprisoned, everything must be paralyzed. (It must be  pointed out that he has not even considered replacing his  leadership with other members.)    To summarize: This is not an authentic surrender. It is just  a tactical capitulation to recover from some wounds and to  regain forces which, Guzman estimates, will take a minimum of  six years until the beginning of the first decade of the next  century.    Nothing justifies having allowed Guzman to violate his  isolation and send the letter to Sweden -- which obviously  happened with the consent of the authorities, unless otherwise  proven.    We hope that the government is not giving a better treatment  to the man responsible for the most atrocious years of Peruvian  history in exchange of epistolary offerings. A Justice Ministry  report explaining the conditions of the imprisonment of Abimael  Guzman would not go amiss.</p>

Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, called for Japan to increase its fiscal stimulus and for 'further substantial reductions' of European interest rates to promote faster growth. His thinly veiled call on the Bundesbank to cut its interest rates was backed by the European Commission. Mr Henning Christophersen, commissioner for economic affairs, said further reductions in short and long-term European rates were needed. All European Community states could do more, he added.

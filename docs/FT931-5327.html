			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Eight years of wrangling yield results IN 1985 Mr John Whittaker, now chairman of Peel Holdings, saw that the potential of the Manchester Ship Canal owed more to its land along the canal banks than its stevedoring operations at Ellesmere Port and Runcorn. The 300 vacant acres of land at Dumplington, near Barton Lock, was the jewel. More than 7m people lived within an hour's drive, making it perfect for a retail and leisure centre. Mr Whittaker spotted a weakness in the canal company's share structure. There were 8m shares, split evenly between the ordinaries and the much less valuable preference shares, but they carried equal voting rights. He bought preference shares and in 1986 was forced to bid when his total holding passed 30 per cent. By this time institutional investors had woken up to the potential and the price of the ordinaries rocketed from Pounds 7 to about Pounds 18 each. After months of struggle Mr Whittaker's stake passed 50 per cent and he took control at an emotional meeting in 1987. He immediately sacked the chairman, Mr Nicholas Berry, then chairman of Harrap, the publisher, who had been brought in only months before to lead a rearguard action against Mr Whittaker. But Mr Whittaker did not have a majority of the ordinary shares and six years of wrangling began. The end of the 1980s property boom strained Mr Whittaker's personal resources and forced him to transfer ownership of the canal from his private family businesses to Peel Holdings, a quoted company. He kept trying to buy out Mr Berry and his allies but, as property markets faltered, could not manage their final price of Pounds 25 per share, plus a bonus of Pounds 5 per share if the scheme for a retail centre at Dumplington ever got planning consent. Also in the way stood Regatta, a group of several rival property companies which had similar land on the other side of the M63. Planning inquiries, however, found for the Dumplington scheme, provided the canal company would pay to widen Barton Bridge, a 1 1/2 -mile, high-level viaduct carrying six lanes of the motorway over the canal. The Department of Transport felt the retail centre would create a traffic bottleneck. This was in 1991, but everything stalled because Salford, which owned the land needed for the pillars that would carry the wider bridge, refused to co-operate with the project. The canal company retaliated by challenging the traffic assumptions on which the bridge-widening order was based. By winning its argument planning consent had to be given yesterday, nearly eight years after Mr Whittaker entered the fray. Mr Berry, minority shareholder in the company, said the decision vindicated his patience. He said it removed uncertainty about the shares' value and might prompt further discussion between himself and Peel about the sale of his holding. In the last month Peel raised its stake in the company to 82 per cent by buying a 6 per cent stake from the British Coal pension fund. The importance of planning permission to the company's value was demonstrated by yesterday's Pounds 3.20 jump in the canal company shares to Pounds 20 and a 31p rise in Peel's share price to 200p. In 1990 valuers considered that the land, which has a book value of Pounds 15m, would be worth an extra Pounds 35m with permission.</p>

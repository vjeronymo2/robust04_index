			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Digital radio wins support THE GOVERNMENT has signalled its support for the next stage in radio technology - digital audio broadcasting - and wants UK manufacturers to be first into the market. DAB uses digital technology to transmit sound of compact-disc quality to car or other portable radios and might also lead to many new national and local radio stations. Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, said the government was working to ensure a leading position for the UK in the introduction of DAB. Discussions were in progress to ensure that suitable frequencies were set aside for the new form of radio. Mr Brooke appealed to UK manufacturers to take the opportunity of DAB to make new sets at reasonable prices, as existing sets will not be able to receive DAB. He said: 'UK manufacturers could be the first into both the UK and international markets.' The first DAB car radio is expected to be introduced by 1995, with other sets likely two years later. The government, Mr Brooke has said, would want a flexible framework 'for innovative and creative radio' covering national and local services. The desire for 'innovative services' contrasts with the approach being put forward by the Radio Authority for the introduction of DAB. The authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, argued in a policy document this month that existing radio services had to be simultaneously re-broadcast on digital services for a number of years. The envisaged blocks of frequencies would allow 10-12 national channels between the BBC and the Radio Authority, with five or six local channels almost everywhere, and with 10 or 12 in a few main markets. That, the Radio Authority argues, would allow for one or two new national channels. Mr Brooke would appear to have something more radical in mind.</p>

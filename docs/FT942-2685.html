Big, strong Rashidi Yekini, a 30-year old centre forward, will be the focus of attention for opposing defences, but he cannot carry Nigeria far on his own. The form of the young Eagles, has helped Nigeria to win the African Nations Cup and to reach their first World Cup finals. Okocha can score from midfield and is a threat from free kicks. He holds the key to Nigeria's progress in the US and beyond. - Key Game: Argentina v Nigeria (June 25 - Boston) Argentina have a chance to exorcise the ghost of their opening defeat to Cameroon in Italy four years ago when they meet the most-fancied of the African nations in this World Cup. Nigeria are appearing in their first World Cup but their ambition is to go further than Cameroon did in 1990. They do not lack experience, their team is packed with men who play in European football. They are big, strong, fast, skilful and every bit as rough as Cameroon. Argentina have a better attack than they did in 1990 but their greatest strength is still their uncompromising defence. This will be a severe test of both teams' pretensions and of Fifa's directive to referees to punish overly physical play and tackles from behind. Penalty king: Sergio Goicochea of Argentina Stupendous power: Rashidi Yekini of Nigeria</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AFTER TRAVERS SUPPLIES THE KICK, EL TORO SCORES 66-41 VICTORY  </P> <P> To put it mildly, El Toro High School basketball Coach Tim Travers wasn't  pleased with the Chargers' first-quarter play Friday night in a 66-41 victory  over Mission Viejo at El Toro.  </P> <P> After watching his team fall behind, 14-13, and fail to get a shot off at the  end of the quarter, Travers jumped off the bench, spun and kicked a folding  chair into the scorer's table behind him.  </P> <P> Bob Knight would have been proud.  </P> <P> "I was just mad because we had blown an assignment on that last play," Travers  said. "Maybe I got their attention with the chair.  </P> <P> "My foot's still hurting from that. I thought I cut it, but I probably just  wound up with a nice bruise. I learned that from my soccer coach back at Santa  Monica High."  </P> <P> It also taught his players something.  </P> <P> The Chargers, ranked No. 2 in Orange County, outscored No. 9 Mission Viejo,  21-5, in the second quarter. They led, 34-19, at halftime and Mission Viejo  came no closer than 12 in the second half.  </P> <P> El Toro's Rob Johnson, who scored a game-high 25 points, said his coach had  reason to be upset after the first quarter.  </P> <P> "He really went off," Johnson said. "He got in our faces after the quarter was  over, but we responded."  </P> <P> Johnson led the way, scoring seven points as El Toro opened the second quarter  with a 15-1 streak.  </P> <P> "It just takes us a little while to get going," Johnson said. "We're always a  little shaky in the first quarter. I don't know why. I guess it's just a bad  habit we have to break."  </P> <P> But El Toro did continue a good habit -- three-point shooting. Johnson made  five of six three-pointers as the Chargers were 10 of 11 from three-point  range.  </P> <P> "We're a good shooting team," Johnson said. "We had something to prove after we  played so bad (in a loss to Dana Hills) on Wednesday night."  </P> <P> More importantly, the victory kept the Chargers in the South Coast League race.  They improved to 14-3 overall and 2-1 in the league; Mission Viejo is 12-5 and  2-1.  </P> <P> "I was just glad to see us bounce back," Travers said. "We got our lunch handed  to us on Wednesday night, but we came back."  </P> <P> Travers said he was pleased with El Toro's defense. The Chargers forced 12  turnovers and the Diablos made only 17 of 55 shots.  </P> <P> "I have no excuses," Mission Viejo Coach Bob Minier said. "They were ready and  we weren't. I have to give them a lot of credit on defense, but our offense was  terrible too."  </P> <P> Just ask Eric Cramer, Mission Viejo's leading scorer. El Toro's Greg Everett  held Cramer to five points, 10 below his average. Greg Amaya led Mission Viejo  with 13 points.  </P> <P> "Everett can do the job on defense," Travers said.  </P> <P> Johnson agreed.  </P> <P> "Everett shut down the lane," he said. 'Cramer was frustrated the whole game."  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley 62, Irvine 47 -- Scott McCorkle scored 27 points and Chris  Kostoff had 17 to lead Capistrano Valley (11-7, 2-1). John Molle had 16 for  host Irvine (10-9, 1-2).  </P></p>

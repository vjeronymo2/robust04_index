			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Optimism for DM TOUGH talking out of the Bundesbank is expected to offer some support to the D-Mark this week. After a depressing end to last week for the German currency, the Bundesbank may set new parameters for the D-Mark at its central council meeting on Thursday. Some analysts believe that the German central bank could widen its targets for M3 monetary growth next year from this year's 3.5-5.5 per cent range to a band of 3-5 per cent. Most analysts are agreed that the Bundesbank will not announce an interest rate cut. The German central bank is likely to stand firm, despite last week's signs of an accelerating German economic downturn and evidence of an easing of inflationary pressures on the wages front in Germany. The dollar, meanwhile, is expected to maintain a robust tone following last Friday's better-than-expected employment data from the US. 'The figures are consistent with a steady recovery in the US and should keep the dollar well underpinned this month,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London. Other analysts warned against expecting that last Friday's 1.65 cent gain against the D-Mark presaged a particularly strong performance for the dollar ahead of Christmas. 'I'm not sure this is the start of a big improvement,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank. After Christmas, he said, investors were more likely to allocate their cash for 1993 and the US currency might then profit further. Sterling is not expected to perform quite as strongly as last week. Many analysts were beginning to feel that the currency's heady rise last week - almost 8 pfennings against the D-Mark in five days - had been somewhat overdone.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DARN TOOTIN', THIS WASN'T ANY CAKEWALK  </P> <P> At the command of the drum major's whistle, the bowed heads of Spring Valley's  Mount Miguel High School marching units snapped up, and hand-held fans flew  open to spell the school's mascot name -- Matadors.  </P> <P> Then, to the strains of "British Eighth," the baton-twirling soloist, the  mascots with matador capes, the flag corps and band members clad in black and  red marched Saturday past the 12 judges, hoping to retain the band sweepstakes  award won last year at the annual California Band Review in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> One by one, bands and marching units from 17 state high schools filed by the  reviewing stand at the 19th annual competition sponsored by the Santa Ana Winds  Youth Band. In addition to the marching contest held around the Civic Center, a  separate field show of halftime performances featured 10 of the 17 competitors.  </P> <P> The field show sweepstakes trophy went to Foothill High of Santa Ana, the only  Orange County school to win a top award.  </P> <P> Crooked lines, sour notes and dropped batons were taboo in the first stage of  judging for each of the units, such as percussion squads, I.D. units (marchers  with signs spelling out the schools' names), rifle teams, drill teams, twirlers  and drum majors.  </P> <P> Each unit offered sharp salutes as it passed the reviewing stand. The Los Banos  I.D. unit danced as it performed a routine with letters spelling the school  name.  </P> <P> Members of the Montebello drill team performed shoulder-high kicks as they  marched down the street. Montebello went on to win the drill team sweepstakes  award; the school's entire marching ensemble captured the directors' award for  overall showmanship.  </P> <P> "It's better, it's a lot better," Mount Miguel junior cymbalist Jennifer Horn  said after the first round of judging, comparing this year's performance to  last year's.  </P> <P> But Mount Miguel would not keep the championship trophy, which was awarded this  year to Riverside's Rubidoux High. The latter's precision and performance of  "March of the Mitten Men" was solid enough to win the top rating.  </P> <P> Then the military marches gave way to showmanship on the field, where some  schools abandoned traditional school colors to add pizazz. The Claremont High  dance team, for example, changed from their gray-maroon-and-white marching  uniforms to white-and-turquoise costumes for the field show based on the  musical, "Starlight Express."  </P> <P> Claremont band director Gary Iida and drill team director Michele Allen said  the contest helps them learn the latest trends in halftime shows, including the  increased use of stationary backdrops, colored flags and costumes.  </P> <P> "That's real exciting, but of course it puts a lot of pressure on groups to  start raising more money to try to keep up with the Joneses, so to speak,"  Allen said.  </P></p>

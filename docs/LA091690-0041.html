			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WEEK: 'ICE CREAM' GETS SCORE WITH NEW FLAVOR  </P> <P> Sci-fi master Ray Bradbury ventures into the other-worldly regions of musical  theater in his 16-character romantic comedy, "The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit"  (with book by Bradbury, music by Jose Feliciano, lyrics by Feliciano and his  wife, Susan), opening today at the Pasadena Playhouse.  </P> <P> The play itself is not new goods. Bradbury adapted his story for the stage over  two decades ago -- with musical accompaniment that included such popular fare  as "La Cucaracha" and the habanera. Then a year ago, original cast member Henry  Darrow suggested that Bradbury enlist Feliciano to write some original tunes.  The result is a 12-song score, what Bradbury describes as "every kind of  Hispanic style -- all the Mexican music you can think of in the last 40 years."  </P> <P> The author sees the music as an organic addition. "I learned my lessons from  Emily Dickinson and William Shakespeare: When you write (in) metaphor, you're  writing poetry; you're writing music. I write for the musical stage without  knowing I'm doing it." Two other Bradbury works have already made the  transition to musicals: "Dandelion Wine" and "Fahrenheit 451," an "aria about  book-burning" which made its bow last year in Fort Wayne, Ind.  </P> <P> The story of "Ice Cream Suit" was born during Bradbury's leaner days, when,  from 1941-45, he lived downtown in a one-bedroom apartment on the corner of  Temple and Figueroa. Such is the dwelling for the play's suit-owners, a quintet  of Latino men who take turns donning the magical garment -- and the good vibes  it engenders. "Wearing it changes their lives," Bradbury explained. "As they  share it, their friendship grows . . . till the suit owns them and they become  one."  </P> <P> The author himself claims to enjoy such creative partnering. "I'm a good  collaborator," he said unequivocally. "I enjoy that process." Nor does he  resist editing -- even at this late date. "We had a preview last night, and at  the end of it, I said to the director (Charles Rome Smith), 'There are six  lines in Act 1, Scene 1, I think we can cut.' You must be able to do that, or  you're no good. It comes down to two things: You have to know how to write, and  you have to know how to cut without hurting it."  </P> <P> JEROME ROBBINS' ALUMNI: The producers of "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," opening  Oct. 10 at the Shubert, are looking for anyone who has appeared in the original  run of any of the shows featured in the dance musical or other Broadway shows  that Robbins directed or choreographed. If you qualify, call (213) 655-0103 to  reserve a free pair of tickets to opening night and the subsequent reception.  </P> <P> THEATER BITS: It's an eclectic bit of goods upcoming this month at Highways  Performance Space in Santa Monica. Following this week's multimedia program,  "Incest: A Celebration of Recovery," comes Susan Franklin Tanner's  autobiographically-inspired "Journey to Singapore: The Infertility Play" (Sept.  27-29) and the Emma Goldman Gypsy Players' take on modern gay life in "Radical  Faeries" (Sept. 30).  </P> <P> Michael Kearns, who recently wrapped his staging of "AIDS/US II," gets even  busier than usual next month with the Oct. 6 opening of his and Darien Martus'  "Homeless" (billed as a "street opera") at Theatre/Theater, followed closely by  "more intimacies" at LATC's Theatre 4 on Oct. 9. Kearns will alternate  performances of the original "intimacies" (a gallery of AIDS characters) with  the follow-up show and six new characters.  </P></p>

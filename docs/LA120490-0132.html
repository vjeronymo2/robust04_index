			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK AIRPORT OKS PLAN FOR VALET PARKING  </P> <P> Burbank Airport officials on Monday approved a 90-day test of valet parking at  the airport, saying they hope that it will increase patronage while reducing  congestion in the drop-off area outside the terminals and in the crowded  short-term parking lot.  </P> <P> The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority unanimously approved the plan,  under which airport visitors can have their cars parked for a minimum of $6.  </P> <P> Those who valet park for more than three hours will pay the 24-hour rate of  $18, the same fee paid by those who self-park in the airport's short-term lot,  which is closest to the two terminals.  </P> <P> Parking attendants will place the cars in a nearby long-term lot, which charges  a $10-per-day fee for self-parked cars and generally fills up after the  short-term lot is filled, officials say. Officials expect the parking plan to  begin by Dec. 15.  </P> <P> "It's our hope that this will free up some space in our short-term lot," said  Elly Mixsell, airport spokeswoman, "because that is always the first lot to  fill up."  </P> <P> Officials also said they hope that those picking up or dropping off people at  the airport will use the valet service rather than circling until they find  curb space outside the terminals.  </P> <P> "This is also part of our long-range effort to convince the flying public that  this is a convenient airport that is easy to use," Mixsell said.  </P> <P> She said the fee to be paid to Valet Parking Service for operating the service  is being negotiated.  </P> <P> "Our goal is not necessarily to make money with this program," she said. "If if  breaks even, we'll be happy. What we want to do is to make the airport work  better."  </P></p>

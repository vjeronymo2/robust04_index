			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Finnish banks deteriorate sharply FIVE FINNISH banks yesterday revealed a sharp deterioration in performance for the first eight months, reflecting the severe Finnish recession, high credit losses and narrow margins. Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP) disclosed a FM2.53bn (Dollars 546.43m) loss, after credit losses jumped to FM2.4bn and profit from financial operations fell 32 per cent to FM1.6bn. In the corresponding 1991 period it made a FM318m loss. The bank said write-offs for the full year would total FM3.6bn and its overall loss would exceed FM3bn. It also noted that non-performing loans totalled FM7.2bn at the end of August, FM2.2bn more than at the start of the year and equivalent to 8 per cent of total lending. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chief executive, said: 'The financial difficulties experienced by customers will continue to cause problems in the form of non-performing loans and lending write-offs over the next few years.' He warned that if losses continued at the current pace, the bank would need to raise new capital early next year, possibly by tapping the FM20bn state guarantee fund. The bank has already strengthened its capital this year through a USDollars 200m subordinated note issue and a FM1.7bn injection from the government. Unitas, the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, disclosed a FM1.5bn loss before extraordinary items for the eight months, against a FM131m profit in the comparable period. It was hit by FM1.29bn in credit losses, and a 25 per cent fall to FM1.18bn in net income from financing operations. Non-performing loans totalled FM7.8bn at the end of August, around 6 per cent of total lending. Unitas expects a significant worsening in its performance in the final four months, leading it to estimate a year-end loss of FM3bn. In particular, the group expects to be hit by a further FM1.7bn in credit losses, of which FM800 relates to the Pomi group. Mr Kurt Stenvall, chief executive of the Union Bank of Finland, said the group would be prepared to resume talks to buy Skopbank from the government guarantee fund, providing the terms were similar to those being discussed last week. Skopbank was initially rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991. Skopbank announced a FM2.2bn loss for the period, compared with a FM475m loss in the first eight months of 1991, after credit losses jumped to FM1.5bn from FM344m. Consolidated income from financial operations fell to FM68.9m from FM452.9m. The bank is expecting a further FM1bn in losses in the final four months, and has warned it will need additional financial support. It has already received more than FM4bn in state support since being rescued. Among the smaller banks, Okobank disclosed a FM1m profit for the first eight months, down from FM199m in the same 1991 period. It warned it was likely to make a loss over the whole year. STS Bank posted a FM281m operating loss, reversing a FM44m profit in the comparable 1991 period.</p>

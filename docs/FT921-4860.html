			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pentland triples annual dividend PENTLAND GROUP, which made its fortune from an investment in Reebok, the US sports shoe maker, yesterday tripled its dividend for the year after announcing higher-than-expected profits. The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.6m for 1991. The figure is not comparable with 1990 because of the disposal of the Reebok stake in February and December. The sale raised about Pounds 388.9m and contributed to extraordinary profits of Pounds 207m. Because of the sale, the company restated its accounts for 1990, treating Reebok as an investment. Following this change, 1990 pre-tax profits on continuing operations were reduced from Pounds 55.3m to Pounds 8.7m. Earnings per share were 4.71p (2.36p). A recommended final dividend of 1.3125p makes a total of 2.25p (0.75p). The company had net cash of Pounds 273m at December 31 and in 1991 earned Pounds 6.3m in interest income (charge Pounds 7.9m). Mr Stephen Rubin, chairman, said: 'It really is good to be cash rich in the current climate.' Pentland completed two acquisitions last year and is continuing to look for targets. In August, it paid Pounds 46.1m for a 20.05 per cent stake in Adidas, the German sporting goods company controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, the French entrepreneur. Mr Rubin said Pentland had an option to take a further 5 per cent between 1993 and 1996. The stake has not been equity-accounted and is being treated as an investment. Pentland would probably like to increase its stake further if the chance arose, for example if Mr Tapie needed to sell another tranche. But Mr Rubin admitted the matter was outside his control. Speedo, the swimwear brand of which Pentland bought the worldwide rights and various distributors, is being built up. Distribution has been extended to eight new countries. Pentland's shares gained 4p to 101p.</p>

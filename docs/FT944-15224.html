			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Rautaruukki in profit for first eight months Rautaruukki, the Finnish steel group, yesterday reported a return to profit in the first eight months of the year, posting a pre-tax surplus of FM361m (Dollars 78m) after a (restated) loss in the same period last year of FM143m. The group, the Nordic region's second largest steel producer, said the increase in demand and prices in Scandinavia and elsewhere in Europe that fuelled the turnround were expected to continue for the rest of the year, yielding a further improvement in profitability. Group sales rose to FM4.86bn from FM4.57bn. Rautaruukki said steel prices rose faster than the cost of inputs, with prices rising especially sharply for hot and cold-rolled products. Operating profit jumped 35 per cent to FM624m from FM463m and would have been greater but for a FM60m loss run up by the group's engineering division. However, net interest costs fell to FM309m from FM364m and there was a FM46m extraordinary surplus, compared with an extraordinary charge of FM77m last time, due to changes in inventory values. Rautaruukki raised FM792m earlier this year in a global share offering that led to a drop in the Finnish state's shareholding in the group to 68.7 per cent from 81.1 per cent.</p>

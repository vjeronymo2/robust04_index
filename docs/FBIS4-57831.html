			<p>BFN     [Text] The Dominican Republic has decided to respect the  almost total embargo imposed on Haiti by the UN Security Council  on 21 May. According to Fabio Herrera Cabral, the Dominican  Government intends to deploy soldiers in the border areas to  prevent leaks. Herrera added that Dominican Navy troops will be  sent to prevent any and all Haitian initiatives to stock pile  fuel via the sea. Haitian vessels that may try to reach the  Dominican coasts to buy gasoline will not be authorized to pull  into any Dominican port.</p>

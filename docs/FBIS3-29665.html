			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Kang-tok from the Integrated Government Building in </F> Seoul]    [Text] A government official said that right after the next  U.S.-North Korean working-level contact--likely to be held  tonight in New York--the government will propose to North Korea  holding a South-North working-level contact for the exchange of  special envoys.    He said: The government expected that North Korea would  suggest that we hold a dialogue first. However, as North Korea  demanded through a news conference held by its Foreign Ministry  spokesman yesterday, that our side propose first that South and  North Korea hold a contact for the exchange of special envoys,  the government has decided to make such a proposal first.  Accordingly, the government will hold a meeting of offices  concerned to decide on a date for the South-North working-level  contact. It is now considering a method for holding a  working-level contact with North Korea next week.    According to the government, in the forthcoming U.S.-North  Korean working-level contact in New York, the United States will  state, in particular, when to hold the third round of U.S.-North  Korean talks and will announce the conditional suspension of the  Team Spirit exercise, meeting North Korea's demands without a  snag. North Korea is also expected to give an available date  for the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection  team's entrance to North Korea.    The government anticipated: There is no big problem for the  IAEA inspection team to enter North Korea next week.  Accordingly, South-North working-level contacts will begin  sometime next week without problem according to our proposal  because the South-North dialogue must begin upon the inspection  team's entrance to North Korea. South and North Korea held  three working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys  last year, and have held no more contacts since then because of  North Korea's refusal.</p>

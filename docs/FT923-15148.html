			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok extends trading INVESTORS gave a lacklustre welcome to the Stock Exchange of Thailand's (SET) new afternoon trading session, with turnover reaching only Baht 4.43bn and the SET index closing 4.51 lower at 746.94. SET officials say the extended hours - from 10am to 12.30pm and 2.30pm to 4pm - will allow Europeans to pay more attention to Thai stocks because trading hours now overlap. But foreign interest remains muted following the violence in May. Dr Asavin Chintakananda, SET executive vice-president, said: 'We do not expect the volume to increase significantly in the near future.' 'It hasn't really galvanised investor enthusiasm,' commented a broker, noting that most foreign investors were institutions who do not follow Thailand minute-by-minute. Local speculators, who used to gamble on the market in the morning, and do other business in the afternoon, were also unenthusiastic.</p>

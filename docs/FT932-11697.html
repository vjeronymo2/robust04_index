			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cost control helps Aetna to exceed expectations AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, one of the biggest US composite insurers, yesterday reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, due to strong cost-control efforts which reduced the impact of continuing weakness in its property-casualty division. Stripping out discontinued operations and the impact of accounting charges in the 1992 quarter, Aetna's earnings slipped to Dollars 191.3m in the first three months of 1993 from Dollars 201.3m last year. Net income was Dollars 166.3m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, on revenues of Dollars 4.29bn. A year earlier, the company had net earnings of Dollars 118.7m, or Dollars 1.07, on revenues of Dollars 4.52bn. Earnings included catastrophe losses of Dollars 31m in the latest quarter, against Dollars 4m a year ago. Net realised capital gains totalled Dollars 22m, against Dollars 75m a year earlier. The company increased additions to reserves for troubled mortgage loans and property losses to Dollars 70m, from Dollars 41m a year earlier. This was offset by gains of Dollars 94m, largely from the sale of bonds, compared with Dollars 117m in the 1992 quarter. Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said the company continued to be hurt by adverse conditions in commercial real estate markets. Operating expenses fell 10 per cent, and earnings benefited from gains in the group health, individual life and annuities businesses. Aetna's personal property-casualty business made a loss of Dollars 8m, compared with earnings of Dollars 14m a year earlier. Although the company has withdrawn or reduced its exposure to markets in which it could not earn an acceptable profit, the benefits were partly offset by reduced net investment income. Earnings from commercial property-casualty insurance operations slipped to Dollars 40m from Dollars 46m a year ago, reflecting lower charges for additions to loss and loss expense reserves for prior accident years, as well as lower operating expenses. Financial services income rose to Dollars 31m from Dollars 20m due to investment gains on futures contracts and strong annuity earnings, which helped offset weak conditions in commercial real estate markets. The life and health business made a profit of Dollars 76m compared with Dollars 70m last year.</p>

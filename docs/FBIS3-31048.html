			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Reis Cico] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Our correspondent Reis Cico has just  arrived in the studio from the Palace of Congresses, where  Presidents Berisha and Tabone held a news conference. Let's  hear from him:    [Cico] Thank you Tefta. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.  As announced by our colleague Radi, both presidents have just  ended their news conference in the Palace of Congresses.  Without waiting for the last news edition, we thought we would  provide a summary of the news conference.    At the beginning of the conference, both presidents made a  short statement. First, President Sali Berisha took the floor.  He stressed that Albanian-Maltese relations are very good and  that both countries are determined to further develop the  political, economic, and cultural cooperation in the future.  President Berisha continued saying that we will cooperate in  the field of tourism, petroleum, and agriculture.    Regarding foreign policy, Berisha said that we explained to  our Maltese friend the goals of our policy, which are: the  integration of Albania into Europe; the solution of the national  question; and the prevention of the conflict [in former  Yugoslavia] from extending to the south of the Balkans. Berisha  also attached special attention to the problem of Kosova, saying  categorically that there is no Balkan solution without the  resolution of the Kosova problem. In this aspect, we request  assistance from Malta and the whole international community.    A very important statement by President Berisha was the one  I  will now cite: The option of the division of Bosnia is  absolutely hopeless in ending the war. The last massacre in  Sarajevo best testifies to this viewpoint. Today, more than  ever, it calls for the use of punitive blows against its Serbian  authors, President Sali Berisha declared.    On his part, Maltese President Mr. Tabone publicly showed  gratitude for the invitation and the hospitality he found in our  country. The Maltese president said that we are united by the  same humanitarian aims as well as security issues. Mr. Tabone  assessed that bilateral relations are very good and that they  will be strengthened in the future, because this is a desire of  both countries and our two politicians.    Further, Mr. Tabone pointed out the fields of cooperation.  At the end, according to the statements they made, both  presidents were of the opinion that, beside the defined fields,  other fields of cooperation exist, which will be studied by  experts in the near future.    Later they answered questions. Questions and answers were,  of course, numerous. We have set apart some of them.    A reporter asked Mr. Tabone about air strikes in Bosnia. Mr.  Tabone replied that the question of air strikes in Bosnia is  very complex and belongs both to NATO and the United Nations.  That is why, he said, I cannot give you any kind of opinion  regarding this problem.    Another question addressed to Mr. Berisha was: What will the  Geneva regional conference, in which our Foreign Minister Alfred  Serreqi will participate, bring about? Mr. Berisha said that  this is a consultative conference and it will serve to sensitize  all institutions, and particularly NATO, to undertake actions  that have been trumpeted for a long time ago, such as selective  air strikes against Serbian positions in Bosnia.    Another question was addressed to Maltese Foreign Minister  Guido De Marco. The question was this: You have been to  Albania three times. Do you see any political and economic  changes? He answered very categorically: Yes. I see great  political and economic changes. This is the desire of the  Albanian people, De Marco continued, who have reached these  great progresses due to democracy.    Another question, which seemed important to us, was that  addressed to Mr. Berisha regarding the siting of two U.S. planes  in Albania. Berisha gave this answer to the question: We have  cooperated and continue to cooperate with NATO, the United  Nations, and we have signed a memorandum of cooperation in the  military field with the United States. Berisha said there is  nothing new, because NATO ships that patrol for any violation of  the embargo imposed against Serbia and Montenegro have sailed,  and continue to sail, in Adriatic waters. Thus, the setting up  of two planes was considered by Berisha as a remarkably normal  thing in the framework of the cooperation between Albania and  NATO, Albania and the United Nations, and Albania and the United  States.    This was a general view of the news conference that just  ended at the Palace of Culture.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / German banks chief attacks sell-off plan MR Horst Kohler, the newly-appointed president of the German Savings Bank Association, yesterday stepped into the growing debate on bank privatisation by calling for his member banks to remain in public ownership. Mr Kohler said that privatisation of Germany's 710 local authority-owned savings banks and 13 commercial banks owned by state governments could lead to restrictions on lending to small and medium-sized companies. His remarks at a press conference follow pressure from German politicians including Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal economics minister, for the speeding-up of bank privatisation. Mr Kohler, formerly finance ministry state secretary, said that the 13 Landesbanken and 710 Sparkassen which account for 60 per cent of all small business lending, could lose their regional strength if privatised. He said that public ownership enabled the savings banks to take a longer-term view of finance for small and medium-sized businesses, and their network of 20,000 branches led to more accurate credit assessments. Mr Kohler said that it was important to ensure that financial services were available in all regions. He said privatisation of savings banks could lead to 'more concentration, and more fragility in our economy'. He said that savings banks were supporting local businesses more strongly than privately-owned commercial banks, since Sparkassen lending was 6 per cent up in the first half of the year, compared with the second half of 1992. Mr Rexrodt last month promised new laws to accelerate privatisation of the Sparkassen and Landesbanken. He singled out WestLB, the Landesbank in North Rhine-Westphalia for criticism over its equity stakes in companies. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, economics spokesman and former leader of the Free Democrats, Mr Rexrodt's own party, has also called for bank privatisation, which economists have calculated could raise DM100bn-DM150bn (Pounds 40bn-Pounds 60bn) for the government. Mr Kohler said the Sparkassen had to reduce costs and improve their use of technology, but their relatively low proportion of write-offs of assets, including loans, showed that their local presence improved earnings.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> NELSON CONDUCTS BERLIOZ, RAVEL, TCHAIKOVSKY AT BOWL  </P> <P> Beginning the final week of the summer season at Hollywood Bowl with yet  another guest conductor, the players of the Los Angeles Philharmonic seemed,  paradoxically, more relaxed, more malleable and more cooperative than one might  expect.  </P> <P> For his second Bowl appearance, however, John Nelson made wonderful music  Tuesday night with our overworked but willing orchestra -- before a crowd  counted by management at 9,293 listeners.  </P> <P> He elicited from the Philharmonic tight performances, splendid soloism and  cohesive ensemble playing.  </P> <P> The American conductor, now 48 and a free-lancer tied only to Opera Theatre of  St. Louis, led an unremarkable program -- Berlioz's "Benvenuto Cellini"  Overture, Ravel's Piano Concerto in G and Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony -- with  heat and conviction, as if each of these pieces had suddenly become a matter of  life and death.  </P> <P> And so they had, apparently. Tchaikovsky's overfamiliar Fifth moved along  unhurriedly, but with an urgency and thrust few achieve. Its opening and finale  made their rhetorical points without overstatement or dutifulness, but in all  seriousness, and with immaculate instrumentalism.  </P> <P> The inner movements became occasions for genuine articulation but no  grandstanding.  </P> <P> And there was no letdown at midprogram, when the brilliant Jean-Yves Thibaudet  returned to play the Ravel concerto.  </P> <P> At his first appearance in Southern California at a recital at Ambassador  Auditorium eight years ago, the French pianist performed a Ravel group Albert  Goldberg called "exquisite." Thibaudet's Ravel continues to earn that  description. In the G-major concerto, he sculpted every 16th-note, colored  every phrase to fit within his ideal conception of the piece, and made it all  seem natural and effortless, as well as thrilling.

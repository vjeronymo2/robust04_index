			<p>CSO     [Text] Major Japanese trading companies are increasing  personnel assigned to Asia. The objective is to promote a  rapidly growing market. Sales handled in the region by trading  firms represent about one-third of worldwide figures, but  underlying growth potential is huge and the trading firms have  reached the assessment that "they have no choice but to boost  their revenue in Asia." Such moves by trading firms are likely  to continue into the future despite a trend to otherwise reduce  overseas personnel assignments as a cost-reduction measure.    As of April, Nissho Iwai had 280 personnel assigned to the  Asia, reflecting an increase of 34 (14 percent) in a one-year  period. Total personnel assigned overseas is 548, a reduction of  21 in the same period. The company has adopted a "strategic  personnel" system under which it assigns individuals for a  two-year extended temporary duty period as a means of handling  the need to increase personnel in Asia. Overseas assignment  expenses were normally absorbed by the respective divisions such  as steel and machinery in the past, but since such an approach  would not allow for major increases in overseas assignments, the  expenses are now accounted for in the company overhead category.    Increases are noticeable in China, where the staff has been  increased by 13 to 49. Staffing in Vietnam has been roughly  doubled to 21, the largest for an integrated trading company.  The company has opened an office staffed with local personnel at  the Pun Tao oil transmission station in southern Vietnam which  is engaged in the development of energy resources. Personnel  have also been assigned to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyztan.    Sumitomo increased Asia region staffing to 209 (20 percent)  in one year. Increased staffing included 13 for China, five each  for Thailand and Indonesia, and three each for Hong Kong and  Vietnam. The additional personnel were noticeable in the  industrial infrastructure area and handle items such as plants,  communications, electronics, and aircraft. Half of the overseas  assignment expenses were charged to headquarters in order to  alleviate the burden on each of the operating divisions. A vice  president was placed in charge of the Asia region to strengthen  control over regional activities.    Marubeni increased Asian regional staffing to 266 or by 10.  Staffing in Vietnam was roughly doubled to 6 in Ho Chi Minh city  and 5 in Hanoi. Further, the senior individual assigned to  Vietnam and India was raised in rank to that of representative  director.    Other trading firms are making similar moves. Profits being  reaped by the trading firms are sizeable in Asia, rendering the  situation such that they will equal or exceed those being  realized in Europe and the United States, where business has  been declining.</p>

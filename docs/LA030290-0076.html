			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ONE DOWN, OAKLAND, L.A. TO GO IN RAIDER MOVE SAGA  </P> <P> A few months ago, Gregg Lukenbill, chief promoter of the bid to entice the  Raiders to Sacramento, was saying that owner Al Davis was not that difficult to  deal with, that he was misunderstood by critics.  </P> <P> Lukenbill has joined the critics.  </P> <P> Two days before the Sacramento City Council's Wednesday midnight deadline for  Davis to agree to an offer of municipal payments of $50 million to move to the  state capital, Lukenbill told the Sacramento Bee: "I think he's just basically  blowing us off. It's hard for me to believe that, but that's what it seems to  me.  </P> <P> "God knows, we've given it our best shot. If what we've got isn't good enough,  there's no point continuing the dialogue, because this deal isn't going to be  any better two weeks or two years from now."  </P> <P> Days before, Lukenbill already seemed to recognize that the Sacramento bid was  dead.  </P> <P> On Feb. 12, Lukenbill told a Times reporter that Davis has become so suspicious  of offers, apparently feeling he repeatedly has been misled by promoters and  politicians elsewhere, that he no longer can recognize "a good offer when he  sees one.  </P> <P> "I wonder whether he is capable of coming to an affirmative decision,"  Lukenbill said. "His own indecisiveness is dragging this out."  </P> <P> Lukenbill insisted Sacramento's offer was better than those of Oakland and Los  Angeles, even though there might not have been as much money in it for the  Raiders.  </P> <P> He said that was because debts incurred by Oakland and Los Angeles in making  good on their offers would require high ticket prices that would alienate fans.  </P> <P> "In Oakland, wait until the fans see it's going to cost several hundred  dollars, at least, to buy tickets," he said. "The team would be very unpopular  two years after going there."  </P> <P> In Sacramento, he said, luxury boxes and club seats would, comparatively, be  held down and ticket prices would be far more reasonable.  </P> <P> But, Lukenbill added, he recognized Davis had trouble moving from Los Angeles  to Sacramento, a growing but medium-sized city.  </P> <P> "We have what he wants, but we're in the wrong market for it," Lukenbill said.  </P> <P> As negotiations dragged on, Lukenbill said, communications between him and  Davis became increasingly difficult. Months before, Lukenbill indicated one  serious issue in dispute was a demand by he and his partners for a share in the  ownership of the Raiders to help guarantee that the franchise would remain in  Sacramento. In the February conversation, Lukenbill did not mention that but  said in general he had problems talking to Davis. Lukenbill added that no  matter how hard he and his partners tried to improve matters, understanding and  rapport with Davis deteriorated.  </P> <P> Those feelings apparently were picked up by Sacramento residents. By the time  the City Council met Tuesday night to formally reject an extension of its bid,  there seemed to be very few citizens who cared.  </P> <P> Lukenbill didn't bother to attend.  </P> <P> A half-hearted attempt by City Treasurer Tom Friery to keep the deal alive was  quickly rejected by Council members.  </P> <P> The next move in the saga of where the Raiders will play is expected March 12  in Oakland, when the Oakland City Council and the Alameda County Board of  Supervisors meet to consider approval of a $660-million offer to Davis.  </P> <P> One step toward approval came this week when authorities finished negotiating a  contract revision with the Oakland Athletics' baseball franchise. The A's will  accept stadium expansion in exchange for $500,000 more from the sale of luxury  boxes, a larger share of parking and concessions revenues and the right to  leave in 1996 if they decide they don't like sharing the Oakland-Alameda County  Coliseum.  </P> <P> There was bad news, however. The San Francisco 49ers claim they are due  compensation if the Raiders return to Oakland in a "territorial re-invasion"  that could be competitively detrimental to the 49ers.  </P> <P> Regardless of what happens in Oakland, however, the odds may slowly be shifting  Los Angeles' way in the bidding to claim the Raiders.  </P> <P> Negotiations between the Los Angeles Coliseum's private managers, Spectacor  Management Group and MCA, Inc., and Davis, were said Thursday to have reached a  delicate stage, but to have promising elements.  </P> <P> Neither side would discuss the situation publicly, but Coliseum Commissioner  Richard Riordan said: "I'm more optimistic. . . . The basic question is where  can you sell (luxury) boxes for $100,000 a year, except in L.A?"  </P> <P> The Los Angeles offer includes building 200 luxury boxes and thousands of club  seats either in a reconstructed or renovated Coliseum, depending on which is  most satisfactory to both parties.  </P> <P> It also contains at least $70 million in franchise fees and other guarantees, a  figure that may be low, but one which apparently doesn't match Oakland's in  committed dollars. As Riordan indicated, the Los Angeles pitch is that Davis  can make more money here than in the Bay Area, even if the advance guarantees  are smaller.  </P> <P> Many people who have dealt with Davis on behalf of Los Angeles or suburban  Irwindale, when that project was still alive, say they have the impression that  Davis would prefer to stay in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Accordingly, Oakland, like Sacramento, may be something of a sideshow, kept  going by Davis to keep the Los Angeles negotiators worried enough to make a  high bid.  </P> <P> If that is the case, it should become evident after Oakland has completed the  formalities of approving its offer. Just as Lukenbill and Sacramento residents  gradually perceived, Davis wasn't really going to be coming north.  </P></p>

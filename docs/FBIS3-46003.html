			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese  Government has decided to launch a nationwide "employment  project" this year aimed at helping long-term jobless people.    "The project will also serve China's target of keeping the  nationwide jobless rate within three percent", said Zhang  Xiaojian, head of the Employment Department of the Labor  Ministry, in an interview with XINHUA today.    The project will create more job chances for the unemployed  by offering special services and administration through the  country's 10,000 job-introduction agencies, 2,200 job-training  centers and over 200,000 labor service enterprises.    China has already achieved marked results in arranging jobs  for the jobless, according to the official. Statistics from the  Labor Ministry showed that in 1993 alone a total of 7 million  jobless people found jobs. The total unemployed nationwide has  dropped sharply from 11 million to the present four million in  the past couple of years.    The official said that the vast majority of the unemployed  can now find new jobs within six months with the help of China's  employment service system.    The jobless people who have been out of work for over six  months account for 20 percent of the total jobless figure.    "The employment project will focus on helping these  long-term  jobless people," the official stressed.    The Labor Ministry stipulates that enterprises which employ  long- term unemployed people are entitled to receive their  previous unemployment relief fund partially or wholly, as  subsidies for wage payment.    Preferential treatment in terms of finance, taxation and  choice of sites will be granted to jobless people who are to be  self- employed, the official said.    The long-term jobless who cannot find jobs even after job  training will be given temporary jobs in the locally-run labor  service enterprises until they find new jobs.    For those who reject any form of employment without any  sensible reasons, the government will cease to grant them  unemployment relief funds.    The official said that the employment project will first be  launched in a dozen provinces and municipalities, including  Beijing and Shanghai Cities, and Shandong, Hebei and Zhejiang  Provinces.    The project will then be carried out on a nationwide scale  in  1995.</p>

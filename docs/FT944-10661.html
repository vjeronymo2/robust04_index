			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (9): Agriculture faces shake-up - The likely impact of joining Europe Heavily protected and generously subsidised for years, Finnish agriculture has looked ripe for a shake-up for a long time. The crunch will finally come on January 1 with European Union membership. Producer prices will fall by as much as 50 per cent in an overnight alignment with European levels. There will be compensation, but average incomes will still fall by at least 10 per cent. In the longer term, as transitional payments are phased out, the pain will increase, threatening a big wave of restructuring in three to five years' time. With this sort of future ahead, it is not surprising that farmers were at the heart of the campaign against Finnish EU membership. Their economic argument was relatively weak - after all, farmers account for only 7 per cent of the working population and as little as 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product. What counted far more were the psychological and political factors. Psychologically, the farmers benefited from the Finnish population's strong attachment to the countryside - 35 per cent of the country's inhabitants still live in rural areas - and a security-related reluctance to see large areas of the country being depopulated. Politically, they were helped by the fact that the Centre party, the dominant power in the centre-right coalition government, has traditionally drawn much of its support from rural areas. The irony is that despite the importance Finland gave to agriculture in its EU negotiations - no other issue received greater emphasis - the farmers ended up getting a deal which even EU supporters felt could have been better. The Finns complain that this was partly because neighbouring Sweden, which radically overhauled its farm support system in 1990, did not make an issue out of agriculture in its own EU accession talks. Finland's settlement allows it to provide farming support over a five-year transitional period in return for accepting immediate price alignment. Next year's aid will be worth around FM5.65bn, FM1.8bn less than would be needed to make up the entire income shortfall. The immediate adjustment to EU prices, together with the scrapping of import controls, is one of the main grievances of the MTK, the farmers' union. The MTK believes a transitional regime, with prices being lowered gradually over a five-year period, would have helped farmers to adapt and plan ahead. Its second complaint is over the way the country has been carved up into different areas qualifying for different amounts of support. Around 53 per cent of the country's arable land qualifies for assistance under a special 'Nordic' category, while 85 per cent has been designated a so-called Less Favourable Area (LFA). Both areas qualify for subsidies on top of normal EU price support. Excluded, however, from either category is 15 per cent of the country in the south, where most of the country's cereal and vegetable production is based. According to Mr Antti Haavisto, MTK director of trade policy, the designations are completely arbitrary. 'Neither line has any justification in terms of agricultural conditions. It's a lottery,' he argues. The situation is unfair, say the Finns, because thousands of farms in more productive areas of the EU further south are treated more generously since they are part of LFAs. The MTK says a farm in Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, with an average yield of 6.8 tonnes per hectare, could end up getting three times the support available to a farmer in southern Finland, where the yield is 3.1 tonnes. The final grievance is the uncertainty that still remains. Even though the overall sums have been agreed and a general payment mechanism outlined, it is still not clear how much individual farmers will receive and when. Part of the reason for the delay is that the package has to be approved by the European Commission. If it is rejected, the farmers frustration will only grow further. Mr Mikko Pesala, agriculture minister and a member of the Centre party, is confident of EU backing. But, acknowledging the uncertainty, he says his 'top priority is to ensure the national support measures are applied in January'. The transitional support measures should cushion farmers from the worst effects of the abrupt changes, at least initially. However, life for farmers in the south of the country could become very much tougher towards the end of the transitional period if Finland cannot grant them support under article 141 of the commission's code covering serious economic hardship. This has still to be negotiated. In any case, it is hard to believe there would not have been a clampdown on agricultural support, even if Finland had remained outside the EU. Many feel that farmers have been cossetted at the taxpayer's expense for too long and they will be glad to see food prices fall. Domestic budgetary pressures would almost certainly have forced the issue - sooner rather than later, if Finland had rejected EU membership and the farmers were blamed. The point is that everyone expects the number of farms to shrink as the sector consolidates towards the end of the decade. Mr Pesala says he expects the number of farms to fall to 70,000 within 10 years from 120,000 today, at the same time as the average farm size rises from 20 to 30 hectares. He hopes those who stay the course will be able to compensate for the drop in their incomes through lower costs and advantages of scale.</p>

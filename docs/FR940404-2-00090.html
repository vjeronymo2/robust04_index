The proposed Order will also prohibit TCH and GEI, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas. However, if GEI sells Thrifty/PayLess and no longer owns any pharmacy businesses, it will not need to seek the Commission's prior approval of the acquisition of any businesses that have pharmacies in the relevant geographic areas. In addition, GEI may, without prior Commission approval, acquire up to five (5) percent of any companies' stock for investment purposes even if such a company may own pharmacies in the relevant geographic areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, TCH and GEI will be required to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order.

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ICI seeks restructure of polyurethane industry - Struggling European market hit by falling prices IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the chemicals group, is calling for a restructuring of Europe's struggling polyurethanes industry. The company, which views the sector as one of its core businesses, said it was prepared to participate in any restructuring. The market is struggling from a combination of over-capacity, falling demand and tumbling prices. Mr Richard Stillwell, managing director of ICI polyurethanes, said: 'If prices continue to fall, there will have to be rationalisation. If we were approached by someone we might well be interested.' The European market will have fallen between 5 per cent and 6 per cent this year after static growth in 1992, according to ICI. That compares with growth of up to 7 per cent during the late 1980s. ICI said the polyurethane sector's plight has been aggravated by large slugs of new capacity coming on stream. The European industry has a capacity of about 12m tonnes a year, of which about 140,000 tonnes is excess. Mr Stillwell said: 'We would like to build on our areas of strengths. If anyone offered us a component part of the MDI market we might be interested.' MDI (diisocyanato-diphenyl-methane) is a raw material for polyurethanes. ICI's areas of strength include supplying the automotive, consumer appliance and footwear industry. The industry must take some imaginative steps, said Mr Stillwell. ICI might consider doing an asset swap, even though its polyurethanes operations were not overburdened with non-core activities. Bayer, the German group, has added a new production line at a plant in Spain, whose 65,000 tonnes capacity was only partly offset by the closure of a small production line. Meanwhile, BASF of Germany has acquired an east German plant, adding about 35,000 tonnes a year to capacity, which it may have also increased thanks to bottlenecking. Dow of the US has also bought a new plant with a 65,000 tonnes a year capacity. Prices have fallen - depending on the particular grade - by about 33 per cent over the last 18 months from DM3.80 a kilo to about DM2.60. 'I believe prices have reached rock-bottom,' said Mr Stillwell. 'Although we are making money in Europe, break-even point has been passed for most other producers if you include fixed costs. At these prices I do not think the industry can cover reinvestment or spending on the environment.'</p>

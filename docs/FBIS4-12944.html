			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine --  al-Aqsa battalions has stated that the Israeli Government would  be responsible for any failure of the peace process. Israel's  prevarication and refusal once again to withdraw from Gaza and  Jericho within the period ending 13 April was a blatant breach  and a scandalous, open violation of the bases of the Declaration  of Principles agreement signed in Washington between the PLO and  the Israeli Government.    In a press statement by its chief amir and Abu-'Abdallah  Fa'iz al-'Aswad, its official spokesman in the occupied  territories yesterday, the movement added: The procrastination  of the Israeli side, which is not implementing the withdrawal by  the set date, will lead to further deterioration of the  situation in the occupied land. Consequently, the Rabin  government will be responsible for the developments which will  result from the non-implementation of the mechanisms of the  Declaration of Principles agreement.    Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine further said  that the escalation of terrorist acts by the settlers and the  troops of occupation, the sealing off of the occupied  territories, and the imposition of a military and economic  blockade on the children of our Palestinian people would not  weaken their determination to persevere in their legitimate  right to rebel, rise, and fight the Israeli occupying enemy  until the recovery of their legitimate national rights. Namely,  their right to return and the right to self-determination and  the establishment of an independent state with holy Jerusalem as  its capital.</p>

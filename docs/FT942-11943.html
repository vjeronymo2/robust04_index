			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Treasury set to defend dollar - Currency Markets This week could see battle joined between the foreign exchange market and the US Treasury in a manner reminiscent of the the ERM dislocations in 1992-93. The difference this time is that it will be the dollar that is the focus of attention. Last Friday the Fed had to step in, at the behest of the Treasury, to prevent the US currency falling to a record low below Y100. The central bank's efforts were successful in preventing the dollar from testing its all time low of Y100.30, but few are confident that the market will not again test Y100. Friday provided the first evidence that the Treasury does care about the fate of the dollar. Previously, the market believed the US administration favoured a stronger yen as a means of exerting pressure on the Japanese government to enact fiscal and trade reforms. Just how much the Treasury is prepared to spend supporting the dollar remains to be seen. Market accounts suggest that fairly small sums were spent on Friday. Analysts believe that considerably more will have to be spent if the market is to be kept at bay. Apart from the activities of the Fed, dollar watchers will have some substantive economic data to chew on: the release on Wednesday of the Tan book, setting out the economic background to the May 17 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and payrolls data on Friday. The market is expecting further tightening of policy from the Fed, but it is doubtful whether economic data supportive of this stance will help the dollar. There has been little evidence in recent months that interest rate differentials have played much of a role in the market's view of the dollar. Elsewhere, sterling is vulnerable if the Tories, as predicted, suffer heavy losses in Thursday's UK local elections. This will renew speculation about the future of Mr John Major, prime minister. Uncertainty is likely to persist at least until next month's European elections, where Tory prospects are predicted to be even worse. The chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England meet for their monthly monetary policy discussion on Wednesday, but there is little expectation of this producing any change in interest rates. In the Netherlands, opinion polls suggest the ruling Christian Democrat - Labour coalition may lose its majority in today's election. This is not expected to effect the guilder's close link to the D-Mark.</p>

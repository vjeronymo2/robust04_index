			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Shao-pin (7115 0783 6333): "Liu Huaqing </F> Says China Will Oppose Hegemonism and Will Not Seek Hegemony"]    [Text] According to information from Beijing, at Beijing's  Jingxi Hotel on 8 April, a number of leaders of the CPC Central  Military Committee received outstanding officers and men from  the three military services, as well as experts who had made  inventions and creations on the national defense science,  technology, and industry front. Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of  the Central Military Commission and standing committee member of  the CPC Political Bureau, made a speech on behalf of the CPC  central leading body and the Central Military Commission.    Liu's speech emphasized two main points: First, accelerating  the development of modern weaponry by relying mainly on China's  own strength, and second, opposing hegemonism and power politics  and promoting the establishment of the new international  political and economic order.    Liu Huaqing said: Along with the increase in our economic  strength, we must accelerate the modernization of the armed  forces. Relying mainly on our own efforts, we should develop a  number of deterrent weapons for the ground, naval, and air  forces, including some modern weapons that even the Western  countries do not possess. Our purpose is to defend ourselves  more effectively, to resist the military threats from  hegemonism, and to guarantee our socialist construction and our  people's peaceful lives and work. Liu added: The experience of  the Chinese people shows that a nation's independence is most  valuable, but China will not be able to stand firm without the  backing of modern military strength and may be bullied and  pressured by hegemonism. China will always stand on the side of  the Third World, and will never seek hegemony or world  leadership [bu dang tou 0008 3981 7333]. However, we will play  our role as we should in international affairs, and will  actively promote the establishment of a new international  political and economic order. We fear no one; neither will we  offend anyone. First, we do not fear the interference of U.S.  hegemonism and power politics in our internal affairs, and do  not fear its intimidation [e zha 6073 6094] and sanctions.  China will never yield to the hegemonist practice of the United  States. Since its founding, the PRC -- growing from weakness to  strength -- has never been daunted by any military threats,  sanctions, isolation, or subversive plots, and has never  bartered away its state sovereignty and national dignity in the  face of hegemonism and power politics.    Liu Huaqing said: The whole Army is well aware that state  sovereignty and national security are always of primary  importance for us. U.S. hegemonism now takes China as its main  enemy, and tries to interfere in China's internal affairs. Who  has given them such power? Have the Chinese people and the  Chinese People's Liberation Army ever yielded to hegemonism at  any time? Hegemonism acts simply on the basis of its  comparatively greater national and military strength. Today,  however, in the 1990's, China has learned how to deal with the  intimidation, bullying pressure, subversive attempts, and  challenges from hegemonism and power politics.    Liu Huaqing further stated: The leaders of our party and  state -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Vice Premier Qian  Qichen -- have given explicit and firm messages to the United  States: China will never tolerate foreign interference in its  internal affairs and will never barter away its principles.  China will not seek confrontation, but will not fear  confrontation and will not evade any imposed confrontation. If  the United States severs relations with China, China still will  be able to develop further.    It also was said that Jiang Zemin, chairman of the CPC  Central Military Commission, had issued orders to commend 58  military and national defense scientific research and production  units, as well as more than 250 individuals in the military and  national defense scientific research units, who had made  contributions to the successful development of some modern  military equipment, 38 of which reached the contemporary  advanced level in the world. Ten types of weapons were the most  advanced in the world.</p>

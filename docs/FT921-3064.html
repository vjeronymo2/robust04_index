			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Nationalists gain in Catalan elections NATIONALISTS made significant gains in Sunday's elections to Catalonia's autonomous parliament, which returned Mr Jordi Pujol to power for a fourth successive mandate with an increased majority, writes Tom Burns from Madrid. Mr Pujol's centre-right Convergencia i Unio (CiU) coalition gained 71 seats in the 135-member Catalan parliament, two more than in the 1988 elections. Meanwhile, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), a party that for the first time was openly calling on voters to back independence for Catalonia, doubled its share of the vote to 8 per cent and raised its membership in the assembly from six to 11. The Socialist party was the chief casualty of the poll, with the loss of three seats and returning of 39 members its worst result to date in the Catalan legislature. The ebbing support for the local socialists could indicate a growing disillusionment with the Madrid government  - where the socialists hold sway - in the wake of a succession of corruption scandals. The Communist party, formerly the third force in Catalonia, lost two of the nine seats it held four years ago, while the Madrid-based conservative party, Partido Popular, won seven seats, one more than in 1988, and the small liberal party, Centro Democratico y Social (CDS), which had three members in the outgoing parliament, failed to return a single member. The polls highlighted the growth of nationalism in Catalonia with the locally based parties, CiU and ERC, obtaining 61 per cent of the vote between them, up from 55 per cent in 1988's regional polls. Mr Pujol now emerges a powerbroker in national politics, with general elections due next year likely to rob the Socialists of their present slim majority and elect a hung parliament. The CiU returns between 18 and 20 members to the Madrid parliament in general elections.</p>

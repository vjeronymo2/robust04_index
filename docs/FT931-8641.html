			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: Road tolls - financial penalty and social costs understated (2) Sir, Richard Tomkins correctly argues for the inclusion of accident and environmental costs of road transport in a cost-benefit analysis of motoring. However, his case is weakened by the use of estimates for the social costs which are far too low, namely Pounds 6.1bn for accidents and Pounds 1.7bn for the environment. The Umwelt und Prognose Institute in Heidelberg has published careful estimates for external costs in West Germany in 1989 which are roughly comparable to the current UK situation. They calculate total accident costs at about DM70bn and all external costs of road traffic at DM250bn, equivalent to 12 per cent of German national income. Even allowing for higher traffic density and accident rates in former West Germany, the corresponding UK figure should be at least six times that quoted by Tomkins. Urban congestion can be most effectively reduced by improving public transport with priority lanes and restricting car access, as in Zurich and other Continental cities. The general problem is most effectively dealt with by higher fuel taxes rather than cumbersome new road taxes.

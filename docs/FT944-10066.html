			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Is value for money possible? Sir, Robert Rice quotes Ms Denise Kingsmill (Business and the Law, November 8) on duties and remuneration of non-executive directors. A rate of Pounds 15,000-Pounds 20,000 for 100 days' work a year seems fair reward for 10 hours a week. However, it is often the case that directors have several non-executive appointments as well as a full-time one. Does Ms Kingsmill suggest that persons with six part-time and one full-time directorship are willing, and capable, of putting in 100 hours a week and, more to the point, what kind of value can shareholders expect from such overworked directors?

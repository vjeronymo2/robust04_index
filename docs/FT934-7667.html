			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (17): Foreign firms move in - Accountancy and legal services are growing fast AFTER years of being rigidly controlled by the state and treated as irrelevant, accounting joint ventures and foreign and domestic law firms are experiencing an explosive growth in China. The changes have been profound. In the face of a serious shortage of Chinese financial experts with a real understanding of the workings of a market economy, international accounting firms, in joint ventures with domestically-trained accountants, have moved to fill the vacuum. 'The idea has begun to be accepted that accounting is for business and not for the government, and that international accounting standards should be practiced in China,' said Charles Feng, deputy manager of Arthur Andersen Hua Qiang, the accounting firm's joint venture here. With the rise of accounting firms, the economy has also seen the emergence of a small group of well-connected domestic lawyers that work in independent co-operatives, with at least five attorneys, in what are better known in the west as partnerships - 'these co-operative firms are good and became good quickly,' says a western lawyer. 'They are a bigger competitive threat than foreign law firms realise.' Within the last year, about 100-150 co-operative firms have been established nationwide with at least twenty based in Beijing, six in Shanghai, and two in Guangzhou. Nearly all deal with commercial issues. Almost none handle criminal or civil cases. Their areas of expertise include financing commercial transactions, securities and listing advice, foreign investment and trade, real estate, commercial disputes, and intellectual property rights. Co-operatives are dramatically different from China's more conventional state-owned law firms. Attorneys operate along western lines, working longer, more western hours, making far larger salaries, and assuming more individual responsibility. For China, these 'partnerships' are the wave of the future. State firms are losing many of their best attorneys to these new co-operatives with the result that state-owned law offices may gradually fade away or be forced to change. With the emergence of independent domestic law firms, the role of foreign lawyers has slowly begun to shift. Although foreign law firms continue to offer legal, financial, and investment advice to both Chinese and foreign companies, some foreign lawyers are beginning to specialise more in legal consultations involving large business deals for Chinese companies overseas and for those Chinese enterprises seeking listings on the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges. But fundamental differences between Chinese co-operatives and foreign law firms remain. Foreign lawyers are not allowed to argue a case in court for their clients, nor are they permitted to give advice or legal opinions on Chinese law. Despite the restrictions, foreign law firms are eager to cash in on China's increasing economic openness. Since the government has given official approval to foreign firms to operate here, there are now over 40 foreign law firms with offices in China, among them, such prominent companies as Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, &amp; Garrison, Denton Hall, Graham &amp; James, and Coudert Brothers. While foreign law firms compete with the newly established domestic co-operatives, they also frequently work closely with them on matters requiring vital personal Chinese connections and Chinese assistance in litigation and in arbitration. Still, foreign law firms bring a certain analytical edge that the fledgling law co-operatives lack, according to western attorneys. 'Chinese firms are not yet strong enough on analysis: it's an approach they haven't yet developed,' a western lawyer observes. While lawyers are rapidly moving to become the economy's legal foundation, accountants have become the country's economic linchpin. The government says Chinese state-run enterprises seeking foreign investment must adopt international accounting standards to make corporate bookkeeping understandable to foreign investors, and in the future, this will be broadened to include all Chinese enterprises. Chinese accounting practices have followed the former Soviet model, where ownership and profitability were irrelevant in a centrally planned economy. 'In government-owned enterprises, you couldn't find the real owners,' says Li Bichang, vice-president of KPMG Peat Marwick Huazhen. 'The government is trying to use corporatisation to clarify ownerships. It is a difficult job.' The monumental task of overhauling China's accounting practices to bring them into line with a market economy has proven to be a boon to foreign accounting firms. All of the large multinationals are here and have ambitious expansion plans. Under the new regulations, they have formed joint ventures with accounting firms that are linked either directly or indirectly with the Ministry of Finance. Previously, they were permitted to do consulting and auditing only for foreign joint ventures. Now, they are able to offer the same services to any Chinese enterprise. Their focus will remain, however, on serving foreign joint ventures and on those Chinese enterprises that are planning to be listed on Chinese, Hong Kong, or New York stock exchanges. While accounting and law are forging ahead, insurance remains largely closed to foreigners. The multinational AIG is the only foreign company that has been given a license to operate in China. It can sell life insurance to Shanghai residents and write policies primarily for foreign investment enterprises.</p>

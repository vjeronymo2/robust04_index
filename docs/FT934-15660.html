			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Financial services activity falls THE PATCHINESS of economic recovery was underlined yesterday in figures from the Confederation of British Industry which showed that business activity in the financial services sector fell slightly in the third quarter of the year. A 21 per cent drop in banks' business with industrial and commercial companies was the main cause of the fall in overall activity, which occurred in spite of strong rises for venture capitalists, securities traders and others. In spite of the 3 per cent fall in activity, optimism about trading prospects strengthened for the fourth quarter in a row, with 41 per cent of the 294 companies responding to the survey saying they were more confident than before. Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI director of economic affairs, said recovery in the sector was still 'uneven and patchy'. A fall in volumes for banks and life insurers, which make up half the sector, accounted for the drop in business. Mr Sentance said that business volumes were predicted to rise sharply in the final quarter, although a similar optimism three months ago had not been fulfilled. Insurance brokers and fund managers were among the most optimistic companies. The survey, conducted jointly with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, found that income from fees and commissions rose during the three months. However, banks reported a net fall in average loan margins, with a further fall expected. Operating costs fell for the eighth quarter in a row, with general insurers, building societies and life insurance companies reporting the strongest falls. Financial Services Survey September 1993.

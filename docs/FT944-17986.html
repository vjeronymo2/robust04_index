			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (4): Europe, still a long way to go - The single market / Almost two years ago, Europe's single market was launched with high hopes and much goodwill. Today, a large measure of the initial enthusiasm remains HARMONISATION: Exporters welcome the more liberal trading environment, but slow progress is being made on harmonising key commercial areas Businesses in all 12 of the European Union's member-states are enthusiastic about the benefits that have stemmed from the dismantling of internal frontiers and the abandonment of customs controls. They report that delivery times have been cut sharply with delays at customs posts no longer part of a lorry driver's daily existence. Across the Union, exporters are taking advantage of the more liberal trading environment brought on by the 1992 initiative to ease trade moves into neighbouring markets. Nevertheless, much remains to be done. Recently, in a bid to speed up the single market's completion, the European Commission took a close look at those member-states that had been slow to adopt all the harmonisation legislation crucial for the free flow of goods, services and capital within the market's frontiers. Tables produced by the commission showed which member-states were helping to hinder progress. Germany, France and Holland, for example, had a poor record on adopting legislation on the harmonisation of pharmaceutical products from other member states: Greece, Spain and Germany were dragging their feet on insurance. There has also been little progress with plans to create a single market in intellectual property. In this area, half the member-states have delayed adoption of the relevant directives. In company law, Germany, France Greece and Spain still have a long way to go before they have put all the relevant legislation on national statute books. Secondly, the commission also decided to look at those areas where no harmonisation legislation applies but where the principal of 'mutual recognition' of technical standards is supposed to ensure that pressure cookers made in Italy, for example, can be sold without obstacle anywhere else in the Union. Their decision to do so went to the heart of a dilemma facing Europe's policy makers. In spite of the progress that has been made, countries are still blocking goods from other member states on the often spurious grounds that safety or technical standards do not match. When the single market was first dreamt up, it was deemed unnecessary to harmonise standards in all commercial sectors. Standards in sensitive areas such as medicine, chemicals, cars and toys would be harmonised under legislation agreed by all 12 member-states. But for the bulk of goods and services mutual recognition was supposed to ensure that prams, lollipops, and electric light bulbs, for example, would circulate freely. In practice, there have been endless hitches. A commission inventory of barriers to trade based on complaints from manufacturers shows that peas from Belgium, for example, came up against barriers in Denmark because of 'classification problems and quality standards.' The UK objected to radishes from Holland because of worries about a certain fly. Ceramic tiles from Greece have been barred from the French market because of 'difficulties in obtaining type approval.' Generally, the complaints tend to come from manufacturers in the EU's smaller member states who cannot get their goods circulated in the larger countries. A survey by the Danish ministry of finance produced a shockingly high number of complaints about remaining technical barriers to trade. As a result, the commission is coming under pressure to produce more harmonisation legislation, particularly from the less powerful EU members such as Denmark and Spain to deal with those areas where mutual recognition is failing. 'There have been a lot of concerns from caravan makers,' says a commission official from DG15, the directorate responsible for the internal market. 'We have had pressure to produce a directive over things like dimensions and the materials with which the caravans are made.' As a first step, a new commission proposal recommends a change to the way in which complaints are recorded. At present, the commission relies on manufacturers to keep it informed of what is happening at a grassroots level. Now it wants to switch the onus to the authorities who are doing the refusing. In other words, any national authority that refuses a product from one country will have to notify the commission thereby providing Brussels with a more complete record of where problems are arising and where more harmonisation legislation might eventually be required. But as one commission official explains: 'This rather simple proposal is running into all sorts of difficulties.' Some member-states - notably the UK - are very keen on the proposal. 'It is something that we think is very important,' says an official from the UK representation in Brussels. The French and Germans, however, have argued that there are so many examples of where one country is blocking another's goods that the proposal will spawn unnecessary bureaucracy. Whether or not the member-states can reach a consensus on the proposal will only be known in October when relevant ministers meet again to discuss the single market. Until then, and until the information has been gathered, the commission will continue to favour mutual recognition as a better, less cumbersome, route than legislation, partly because legislation is so costly, but also conscious of the fact that a directive on caravans, or peas would do nothing for the image of the meddling Brussels bureaucrat. But if mutual recognition continues to be flouted by the Union's biggest and most powerful states, some countries, and many manufacturers, will step up pressure for more harmonisation. At that point, Brussels will have to decide how best to tackle the grievances of traders and decide whether or not more legislation is required to maintain momentum behind the single market.</p>

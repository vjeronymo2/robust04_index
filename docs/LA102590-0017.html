			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON, FEINSTEIN ON TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> How ironic that Dianne Feinstein continually voices her opposition to  Proposition 140, which would limit political terms to two, on the grounds that  political lobbyists will then be running the government. Yet, since the courts  overturned Proposition 73, Feinstein has taken more than $750,000 from  political lobbyists.  </P> <P> Since the court ruling she has accepted more than $300,000 from labor unions  alone. She has also accepted more than $100,000 from five of her husband's  friends and business associates (Oct. 10). Feinstein claims that she must take  these large sums of money to counter Wilson's excessive war chest. While Pete  Wilson could indulge in the same fund-raising tactics, he has stood by  Proposition 73's restrictions.  </P> <P> Will these large donations affect Feinstein's political decisions if she is  elected governor? That is the risk the voters will have to contemplate when  casting their vote on Nov. 6. By following the restrictions imposed by both  Propositions 73 and 140, candidates will be more inclined to vote for the  public interest rather than for their major contributors' interests.  </P> <P> HEATHER MORSE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS / STEVE HENSON;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS' BOWEN FINDS WRITERS A VOWEL LESS THAN LETTER-PERFECT  </P> <P> Leafing through some newspapers Saturday morning and seeing his name misspelled  in most of them -- again -- might have made Cory Bowen wince.  </P> <P>  Ouch! There's that E again.  </P> <P>  But he was already sore all over, having been tackled 21 times the night  before by Canyon High's vicious defense.  </P> <P> Bowen, Thousand Oaks' junior tailback, gained 133 yards in Canyon's 27-13  victory, impressing everyone from Cowboy defenders to rival coaches scouting  the game.  </P> <P> But after browsing through the paper, Bowen mused that it is awfully tough for  a guy to make a name for himself when almost everybody gets it wrong.  </P> <P> Including sportswriters. And his coach.  </P> <P> Somehow, an E has been wedged into his first name like a running back squeezing  between guard and tackle. The Lancer program lists him as Corey, which is  probably the reason three of the four newspapers that cover Thousand Oaks write  his name that way.  </P> <P> "Everybody is always doing that," Bowen said. "I have no idea how it started.  It's a little bothersome but it happens all the time."  </P> <P> Bob Richards, the Thousand Oaks coach, noticed that newspapers were spelling  Bowen's first name differently. In an effort to clear it up Friday night, he  took a reporter aside and said, "You know, his name is spelled C-O-R-E-Y."  </P> <P> Richards might be excused: He's a math teacher who knows Bowen best as No. 20,  the player who has gained 313 yards in three games. Richards has no trouble  counting.  </P> <P> What's in a name, anyway? Not a lot, unless it's yours that is continually  being butchered.  </P> <P> The easy answer would have been for somebody -- anybody -- to ask Bowen how he  spells his name. That's right, actually talk to him. Then maybe the scribes  could save their E's for describing his running style, elusive and full of  extra effort.  </P> <P> "No one has asked me yet," he said.  </P> <P> Unraveled plot: What Cleveland needed in the fourth quarter Friday night  against Fairfax was a director, a real Hollywood type with dark shades and gold  chains, to dash onto the field, stop play and yell: Cut, cut, whadaya, whadaya,  that's not in the script!  </P> <P> Taking a page from the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl playbook, the Cavaliers  scripted their first 25 plays from scrimmage, detailing before the game the  precise order in which signals would be called.  </P> <P> And for three quarters, they had a blockbuster in the making: Cleveland led,  7-0, after scoring on the game's opening drive and held the lead heading into  the final 12 minutes.  </P> <P> The ending was a real tear-jerker, however, leaving the performance with mixed  reviews. Fairfax scored three touchdowns to win, 21-7.  </P> <P> "If we'd have played the whole game like we did the first series, we'd have  blown them out," said David Erhardt, Cleveland's quarterback. "Everything was  going according to plan, then I think some guys just got tired."  </P> <P> Erhardt, playing in his first game as a Cavalier after transferring from Canoga  Park, was not shy about panning his play. His fumble on an option play led to  Fairfax's winning touchdown. "I stepped up after the game and told the team  we're gonna run five miles on Monday," Erhardt said. "But it was my fault as  much as anybody's."  </P> <P> Flags: The 220 yards in penalties racked up by Locke on Friday night exceeded  the National Football League record of 209 set by the Cleveland Browns against  the Chicago Bears on Nov. 25, 1951.  </P> <P> Penalties are supposed to be fatal, yet Locke destroyed Verdugo Hills, 27-0,  behind a defense that allowed only 12 yards.  </P> <P> Hurt so good: Newbury Park players streamed into Mel Hayashi's office Saturday,  getting balm from the team doctor. But the Panthers had no emotional wounds for  a change, thanks to a convincing 17-0 victory over Buena on Friday night.  </P> <P> A week ago, all the sophisticated orthopedic gadgetry in Hayashi's office  couldn't mend the mental anguish caused by Newbury Park's heartbreaking, 21-20  loss to Ventura, a game that slipped through the Panthers' fingers when Ventura  scored on a 68-yard desperation pass on the game's final play.  </P> <P> "We felt like we won but we didn't," said running back Dave Roberts as he  fiercely pedaled away on a stationary bicycle. "People at school would ask if  we won and I'd want to say yes, but I couldn't."  </P> <P> This week the answer will be resoundingly affirmative, and the victory proved  an affirmation of Newbury Park's spirit.  </P> <P> "We were robbed big time against Ventura and there was no way it was going to  happen again," quarterback Zack Sutton said while Hayashi worked on his sore  right shoulder.  </P> <P> "It was in the back of everybody's mind and we put out some extra effort."  </P> <P> Forward progress: The recovery of talented Newbury Park tailback Walter Thomas,  who underwent surgery on his left knee two weeks ago, is ahead of schedule.  Hayashi said the chances of Thomas playing Thursday in Newbury Park's Marmonte  League opener against Thousand Oaks are 50-50.  </P> <P> "You've got to give him credit, he's worked very hard," Hayashi said. "On  Thursday, I ran sprints against him and I beat him. One day later, he beat me  running backwards while I was running forward."  </P> <P> Buddy system: For second-year Newbury Park Coach George Hurley, familiarity  breeds shutouts.  </P> <P> Under Hurley, the Panthers have twice blanked Buena -- no small feat  considering the Bulldogs' reputation for high-powered offense.  </P> <P> Hurley and Buena Coach Rick Scott both served as Newbury Park assistants  through most of the 1970s. They remain friends, although they don't always see  eye to eye.  </P> <P> "Rick and I worked together for a long time, and preparing for his team is like  preparing for ourselves," Hurley said. "He runs the same plays we do, they just  throw the ball more."  </P> <P> Scott isn't quite ready to concede that Hurley knows him like the back of his  playbook.  </P> <P> "We're really a different type of team than they are," Scott said. "I don't do  the same things I did when I was at Newbury Park."  </P> <P> Who's right? Hurley points to the scoreboard and rests his case.  </P></p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Share deal considered approved, court hears THE BUYING of Blue Arrow shares by County NatWest, County NatWest Securities and Union Bank of Switzerland took place with legal approval and the knowledge of NatWest, the parent bank, a former County director had believed, he told the Blue Arrow trial yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr James Riddell, a former County financial control director, agreed that the holdings - taken in the 1987 rights issue - were in three parcels to avoid the disclosure requirements of the Companies Act. He agreed with Mr Jeremy Roberts, QC, for Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County chief executive, that legal advice had been that that was possible. Mr Riddell said that, in examining the accounting treatment of the Pounds 70m loss on the holdings after the stock market crash, he had 'always worked from the framework that everything was legal'. He presumed Mr Norman Berman, then NatWest's financial control director, knew everything about the transaction. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips and Drew Securities and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m issue.</p>

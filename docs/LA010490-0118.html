			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEOOK;  </P> <P> OPPONENTS FIND BUENA TEAM UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED  </P> <P> Buena Coach Glen Hannah thought he was supervising a high school dance, not a  basketball team. The Bulldogs, who scored more than 100 points in each of their  first three games, suddenly had stopped running their fastbreak.  </P> <P> They were standing around on the floor, each waiting for a teammate to take the  first step, according to Hannah.  </P> <P> "We hit a slump for 2 1/2 games," Hannah said. "We weren't playing hard. We  looked for other people to do things instead of doing them ourselves."  </P> <P> Hannah held a team meeting. Team captain Jeff Oliver called a players-only  meeting the day after Christmas.  </P> <P> And after the meetings, Buena held a basketball seminar last week in the  Ventura/Kiwanis tournament.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs beat Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Oxnard to win their first  tournament title of the season, and Oliver was named most valuable player.  </P> <P> "I thought we played a lot harder," Hannah said. "We were more consistent  throughout the game. We didn't hit so many peaks and valleys."  </P> <P> No matter the pace, Buena was able to keep up with its opponents, Hannah  discovered. Buena and Thousand Oaks combined for a tournament-record 193 points  as the Bulldogs won, 102-91.  </P> <P> "We prefer a fast-paced game with lots of fast breaks," Hannah said. "But I  think we also proved we can be patient against deliberate offenses."  </P> <P> Bad break: Sophomore Jeff Wright wanted an opportunity to play with his older  brother, Ryan, on the St. Bonaventure varsity and got his break when senior  Kevin Zoll suffered a knee injury.  </P> <P> Wright, however, injured his hand during a junior varsity game the day before  his promotion.  </P> <P> Diving for a loose ball, Wright sustained a fractured bone in the middle finger  of his right (shooting) hand.  </P> <P> Wright, who was promoted because of his scoring ability, was hampered by the  splint on his finger and averaged only 3.3 points in three games at the  Carpinteria tournament.  </P> <P> The Seraphs (4-5) have lost three straight since Zoll, a three-year starter,  suffered a torn ligament in his left knee. Zoll is averaging 12 points and four  assists a game.  </P> <P> St. Bonaventure's last win was over Santa Paula, 58-35, on Dec. 20.  </P> <P> "We can't find anyone to pick up the slack for Zoll in terms of points,  ballhandling and court leadership," St. Bonaventure Coach Marc Groff said.  </P> <P> "We're trying to collectively make up the difference and it's not working."  </P> <P> Groff believes senior off-guard Marvin Sagles (11 points a game) could prove to  be the solution to the scoring problem.  </P> <P> Streak stoppers: Nordhoff holds the distinction of being the last team to beat  Santa Clara in a Frontier League game. The Rangers beat the Saints, 59-53, in  the 1984 league finale to sweep their two-game series and win the title.  </P> <P> Since that loss, the Saints have won 34 consecutive league games and four  titles.  </P> <P> The teams meet in a Frontier League opener Friday at Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Nordhoff might not have anyone to match the talents of Division I prospect Shon  Tarver, but it does have an outstanding sophomore. Tim Sebek, the son of Coach  Dick Sebek, leads the team in scoring (14.1 points a game), rebounding (8.6)  and assists (5.8).  </P> <P> Sebek could become the first player in school history to start all four years  for the Rangers (6-5).  </P> <P> Not ready for prime time: As his team' tallest and most talented player, 6-5  senior center Mike Spears has been cast in a prominent role for Hueneme. But  Spears has had trouble adjusting after a year as a role player.  </P> <P> "Spears is a stud," Hueneme Coach Howard Davis said. "He has the potential to  be a great player.  </P> <P> "But what he can do in practice, he can't do in a game. He doesn't know how to  dominate a game."  </P> <P> Spears has been averaging 15.5 points a game, but Hueneme has struggled to a  3-7 mark.  </P> <P> Davis said Spears needs to increase his average if the Vikings are to be  successful in the Channel League.  </P></p>

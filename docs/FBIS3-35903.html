			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is deeply  concerned at statements made by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin at a press conference January 27, the ministry's  statement reads.    The ministry is particularly concerned since Mr. Churkin's  statement and responses to questions are but the latest in a  series of appearances and articles by high-level Russian  officials. Estonia hopes that Mr. Churkin's statements do not  represent a new, even more confrontational and threatening line  in Russian foreign policy vis-a-vis the Baltic States.    The ministry agrees with Mr. Churkin statement that "the  Baltic states have a vital stake in the successful completion  and final victory of democracy and implementation of market and  economic reforms in Russia." There is nothing the Baltic states  wish more than good neighbourly relations with their big  neighbour to the east, peaceful relations which ensure the  security, sovereignty and prosperity of all parties and, indeed,  of all of Europe, the ministry said.    Estonia would like to view Russia as a normal state which  meets normal international requirements and criteria. One  obvious requirement is that Russia being a large country  refrained from making statements which make its smaller  neighbors nervous about Russia's true geo-political intentions.  Other obvious criteria, such as the unconditional withdrawal of  troops stationed on the territory of other nations against their  will, should be met. Moscow's policy of seeking and creating  special zones of interest and thereby, in practical terms,  denying full sovereignty to its neighbors must stop. Russia  should also stop denying basic human rights to Estonian citizens  living under its jurisdiction.    While Estonia welcomes Mr. Churkin's "disapproval" of the  events of 1940, the fact that he does not consider the Soviet  take-over of the Baltic states "annexation or aggression or  occupation" leaves out the most important legal and historical  dimension of those events.    Mr. Churkin's statement and responses to questions contain  numerous misstatements and errors of fact to which the ministry  intends to respond in more detail. For a small nation, in the  face of constant imperialistic-sounding threats and the  continued presence of foreign occupation troops on its soil, to  protect its sovereignty through all legal and peaceful means  available cannot be viewed as "confrontational" in any sense of  the word. Estonia has shown patience and good will and made  many concessions in order to solve the problems it inherited  from fifty years of Soviet occupation. The fact that Russian  officials completely disregard Estonian efforts and instead keep  up a barrage of propagandistic attacks and thinly veiled threats  of military action does not help to build confidence or to  ensure stability.</p>

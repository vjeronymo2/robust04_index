			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Tobacco warning rules clarified - European Court The European Court of Justice last week clarified in two cases the scope of discretionary powers available to European Community states when fixing health warnings on cigarette packets and other tobacco products. The first case related to British rules on the size of health warnings and their compatibility with EC law. Under the terms of the tobacco products directive, all cigarette packets for sale in the Community must carry health warnings which cover at least 4 per cent of the surface of the packet. Under the UK's rules, brought into force to give effect to the directive, health warnings must cover 6 per cent of the surface of a packet. Cigarettes imported from other EC states are deemed to comply with UK law if the health warnings comply with the requirements adopted by the exporting country in implementing the directive. The court was asked for a preliminary ruling on whether UK regulations were compatible with the directive. It said the directive laid down common rules for the labelling of tobacco products in the Community. Some rules gave states no discretion to impose stricter requirements; others allowed a degree of discretion. Such discretion was allowed in relation to health warnings. The directive set down a minimum surface area. EC member states were entitled to increase the area to be covered. The court accepted that its decision, which was contrary to the earlier opinion of the advocate general, might lead to less favourable treatment for national products compared with imports, but it ruled that this was an unfortunate consequence of setting out only minimum requirements on the size of health warnings in the directive. The second case involved Italian rules on health warnings. The Italian rules require manufacturers to put two health warnings on cigarette packets and require warnings covering at least 4 per cent of the surface for other tobacco products. The court said there was no discretion under the directive to require more than one health warning. The court said that as far as other tobacco products were concerned the directive set out different conditions than those for cigarettes. Health warnings simply had to be printed so that they were clearly legible and easily seen. There was no discretion for EC member states to impose more stringent requirements for warnings on other tobacco products.

Danish public procurement contract breached EC law Nearly four years after the case was first lodged with the European Court, judgment was given last week on the public procurement contract for the construction of the bridge across the Grand Belt, which divides Denmark in two. The court found the contract was flawed in two respects. First, by insisting that construction companies were to use as high a percentage of Danish materials as possible, the state-owned company in charge of the project was found to be in breach of EC law. The court said despite the removal of the clause in question, the tendering process had been tainted and that its removal at the last stage of the operation prior to signature was not sufficient to validate the breach. Second, the court found the successful tender had not been made in conformity with the tender offer conditions. The fact that the company in charge of operations had even considered that tender breached the fundamental principle of equal treatment. The court said it was irrelevant that the EC directive on public procurement did not specifically mention the right to equal treatment for tenderers, as the obligation to respect the principle corresponded with the directive's very essence.

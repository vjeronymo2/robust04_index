			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUCKEY TRIAL HALTED FOR JUDGE'S VACATION  </P> <P> After several days of crucial testimony by an 11-year-old girl in the second  trial of McMartin Pre-School molestation defendant Raymond Buckey, the  proceedings were halted Friday by the judge's vacation.  </P> <P> The trial will resume May 21, after a vacation scheduled by Superior Court  Judge Stanley Weisberg.  </P> <P> During intense questioning, a former McMartin student -- who did not appear  during the first trial -- testified that she remembered sitting in Buckey's lap  at the Manhattan Beach school while he molested her. She also said she  remembered him stabbing a turtle to keep her quiet and taking pictures of her  while she was naked.  </P> <P> The child's testimony is considered important in the retrial of Buckey, who  faces eight molestation counts stemming from alleged sexual assaults on three  former students at the once-prestigious nursery school. In his first trial,  Buckey, 31, was acquitted on 40 molestation counts.  </P></p>

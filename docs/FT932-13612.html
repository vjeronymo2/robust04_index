			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers disappoints with Dollars 575m BRISTOL-Myers Squibb, one of the world's biggest drugs companies, yesterday disappointed Wall Street with its first quarter earnings of Dollars 574.7m, or Dollars 1.11 a share. On the New York Stock Exchange shares in Bristol-Myers eased Dollars 1 1/8 to close at Dollars 60 7/8. Analysts had expected the company to earn about Dollars 1.13 a share in the 1993 quarter. A year earlier, Bristol-Myers turned in net income of Dollars 301.5m, or 59 cents. Stripping out the impact of accounting changes and earnings from discontinued operations, the company earned Dollars 534.2m, or Dollars 1.06, last year. Sales rose 4 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 2.76bn from Dollars 2.64bn. Bristol-Myers's 8 per cent improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings contrasts with a 10 per cent rise in underlying profits from Merck and Pfizer's 25 per cent leap in underlying earnings from ongoing operations in the same period. Bristol-Myers, which was one of the first big drugs companies to cut its workforce in response to increasing industry competition, has fallen from favour among many analysts after its disappointing performance in 1992. In January, Wertheim Schroder analyst Mr Jonathan Gelles warned that Bristol-Myers's most important drugs had peaked in use.</p>

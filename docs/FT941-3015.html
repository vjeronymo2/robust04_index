			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Tunisians go to the polls tightly muzzled: Francis Ghiles on an election that is a foregone conclusion but might prove a two-edged sword for the winners Tunisians go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president and parliament. Whatever the turnout, the result is a foregone conclusion. President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali is the sole candidate for the post he has occupied since replacing an ailing Mr Habib Bourguiba in November 1987, while the Democratic Constitutional party (RCD), which has held a monopoly of seats in the national assembly since independence nearly 40 years ago, is assured of a massive majority. A more liberal electoral law allows proportional representation in 19 new seats added to the existing 144 winner-takes-all seats. This will ensure opposition parties a few political crumbs. The one party that might have provided serious opposition, the Islamic Al Nahda (Renaissance) party, is banned. Many of the party's supporters have fled into exile. Mr Rashid Ghannoushi, its leader, was granted political asylum in the UK last summer. Supporters of Al Nahda in Tunisia and their families have faced a systematic campaign of intimidation by the security forces. Many remain in prison and, according to the human rights organisation Amnesty International, some have 'disappeared' while others have been ill-treated, sometimes tortured. In a report last January Amnesty wrote that 'by perpetually denying, in the face of compelling evidence, that torture occurs and by failing to take action against it, the government has in effect encouraged the continuation of a practice it professes to abhor'. It added that 'Tunisia's growing mastery in deploying the vocabulary and diplomacy of human rights abroad serves to mask a practice of serious and systematic human rights violations at home'. These are harsh words, but senior western diplomats do not dispute them, at least in private. They point to what they see as the widening of the circle of repression to include the arrest of Mr Hamma Hammami, the leader of the illegal Tunisian Communist Workers' party (PCOT), on February 14, and to the failed attempt by the former president of the Tunisian League of Human Rights, Dr Moncef Marzouki, to stand against Mr Ben Ali. The constitution demands that candidates find 30 deputies or mayors to endorse them. As virtually all such people belong to the RCD, Dr Marzouki failed. Meanwhile, censorship of the media remains tight. Two weeks ago Mr Robert Pelletreau, US assistant secretary of state for near-Eastern affairs, told the House foreign affairs committee: 'Tunisia's economic development is the achievement of a well educated and hard working population with a vigorous middle class. This is a principle strength of Tunisian society. Tunisia's people deserve an equal measure of political freedom and pluralism, and we believe it should be possible to handle challenges from the extremes even in this volatile part of the world without compromising these principals.' He went on to argue that Tunisia's political system would 'benefit from greater openness', a view shared by 'many Tunisians from within and outside the government'. Tunisian officials point to the incipient guerrilla war in neighbouring Algeria which, they argue, poses a big threat to their country's hard-won economic prosperity. It is not easy, they say, to be sandwiched between Algeria and the maverick Libyan leader, Colonel Muammer Gadaffi. Such concerns are genuine and are shared by most of Tunisia's 8m people. But they do not answer the question of how, in the longer run, the regime hopes to win the battle of ideas against proponents of radical Islam. Avoiding the extremes of poverty and wealth, and ensuring relative economic prosperity, are two keys to this battle. Economic growth has in recent years been impressive - 8.1 per cent in 1992, 2.5 per cent last year and it is forecast to reach 6 per cent this year; inflation was halved between 1991 and 1993 to 4 per cent; and a steady flow of foreign investment has followed liberalisation of the economy. The first-ever private placement for Tunisia, a Y30bn (Pounds 191.1m) Samurai bond arranged last month, underlined the confidence of international bankers in the future of North Africa's smallest state. But even sympathetic observers say it bodes ill for the future if the very professional people and intellectuals, on whose ideas the regime relies to ensure Tunisia's continued progress, know they are being closely monitored by the security forces. Few people in Tunis believe that Dr Marzouki, had he been allowed to run against Mr Ben Ali, would have constituted a real threat to the president's re-election. But such a campaign might have produced an interesting trial run for future elections. In that sense an opportunity has been missed, they say. Approval of the well managed economy and fear of radical Islam has made many western politicians and diplomats hesitate to air their criticisms in public. If however, in the months ahead, the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front either comes to power or ends up sharing it with the Algerian army, then Tunisia could be in for a rude awakening. Its leaders have voiced their fear of radical Islam for so long that they have convinced many Europeans that Tunisia could be the next domino to fall. This is disputed by many seasoned observers of Tunisia. They fear that the suppression of public debate on a wide range of topics and the muzzling of associations not directly sponsored by the government have deprived the president of safety valves. Were his policies ever to be seriously contested, Mr Ben Ali would be in the direct line of fire.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Switzerland (8):  Soffex gets the real thing - The electronic exchangehas had a good year. Options volume is up 35 per cent, and futures volume has more than doubled thanks to the new government bond future / The derivatives market DERIVATIVES markets, in Switzerland as in most main financial centres, are among the most active and innovative to be found in these recessed times. Whether it is in the Soffex futures and options exchange or in the warrant market on the Zurich Stock Exchange or in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, there seems to be a constant flow of new activity. Take the case of Soffex, now into its fourth year of life and revelling in the success of its latest product, a future on a long-term Swiss federal government bond. Until this year, it was impossible for the exchange to organise futures on Swiss government bonds, because there were too few of them. In its place, a future on a synthetic bond, based on the five-year swap rate, was offered, but it was not what the market really wanted. But this year, with the government's finances deteriorating, the volume of bond issues has increased, and a real future was introduced in May, the first Soffex future to be physically delivered. It is already trading at a level of 1,500 contracts a day, and attracting increasing interest. 'We could always have more, but we are satisfied,' Mr Otto Nageli, chief executive of Soffex, says. The other star products are the futures and options on the Swiss Market Index (SMI) of 21 leading issues (23 from next month) on the stock market launched in late 1990. Typically, the future accounts for more than half of all future trading, while turnover of the options accounts for about 40 per cent of all option trading. The net result is that Soffex has had a good year. Options volume is up 35 per cent, and futures volume has more than doubled thanks to the new government bond future. Mr Nageli is forecasting a return to profit for the exchange this year after a disappointing slump into a SFr0.86m loss last year. Meanwhile, on the Zurich Stock Exchange, the volume of warrant issues on Swiss equities continues to grow, in spite of the gradual disappearance of the original reason for issuing them. When they were introduced in the mid-1980s, the objective was to help foreign institutional investors get around restrictions on the ownership of shares in many Swiss companies. In the past year, many companies have lifted those restrictions, but investors have learned to use these warrants to avoid payment of withholding or income tax on dividends. According to one active dealer in these securities, another attraction is that transaction costs are significantly lower than on the equivalent values of underlying shares. In the OTC markets, the big banks make most of the running with their offers of strangely named new derivative products like GROIs and CLOUs, which are designed to give small investors a bit of a flutter as well as a secure return. The big banks are also the main producers of tailor-made packages for their big customers, which tend to be very big but not actively traded. These issues have compensated largely for the drying up of Japanese warrant issues in the past year, which used to be the mainstays of the over the counter market. There are no clear statistics on the relative importance of these derivative markets, but participants say the stock exchange warrant market is the largest, perhaps accounting for half the total value of contracts and commissions, with the rest split between Soffex and the OTC markets. Soffex claims to be the third-largest options exchange in Europe, after the Deutsche Termin Borse and the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), and number two in index options, thanks to the success of the SMI options. For all the progress, the year has not been a total success. Soffex encountered its first important reversal early this month, when it announced the suspension of trading in short term Eurofranc interest rate futures. The volume did not develop 'in keeping with Soffex expectations', the exchange said in a statement. This was the one case in which Soffex was offering an identical product to that offered on Liffe, and market participants say that Liffe provided a more efficient market than Soffex, and so attracted most of the volume. Mr Nageli acknowledged defeat, suggesting that, ironically, Soffex's weakness was the transparency it offered as an electronic exchange. That transparency is much appreciated when there are many small participants dealing in a product, but in this case, the market was dominated by large professionals. 'Professionals prefer to trade outside an exchange or, if they have to use an exchange, they prefer the outcry system where posted prices are indicators, not fixed offers. So I would have to say this was a product not suitable for an electronic exchange.' Similarly, the low exercise price call options (LEPOs), introduced in May 1991, have not been a great success, with volume of 51,000 contracts this year. They are vehicles for avoiding stamp duties, and Mr Nageli says market participants do not seem to have understood them. Among new products under consideration at Soffex are options on futures. The exchange could launch them in the second quarter of next year, probably on the federal bond future, although the liquidity and open interest are not yet big enough. Mr Nageli says the only other plausible candidate would be the SMI future, but he suspects that would just split the volume that exists already on the options and the futures. Soffex has made some progress in the past year on co-operation with other European futures exchanges, notably those in Amsterdam, Vienna and Stockholm, with which trading links have been established. It has also won regulatory approval to sign up its first member based outside Switzerland, Timberhill in Germany, and has applications from six others. With the rejection of the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty by the Swiss in a referendum two weeks ago, it is likely that regulatory co-operation between Switzerland and other European countries will remain difficult and this process will be retarded.</p>

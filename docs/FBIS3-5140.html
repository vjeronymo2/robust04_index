			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korean  businessmen's interest in North Korea has risen sharply since  Pyongyang decided on Feb. 16 to permit International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of its seven declared nuclear  sites.    The number of National Unification Board-approved  applications for contacts with North Koreans almost doubled from  14 in January to 27 last month, according to the Trade, Industry  and Energy Ministry.    The increase was particularly conspicuous in the week  starting Feb. 18, with 11 applications filed, indicating that  the North's acceptance of IAEA inspections has raised southern  businessmen's expectations on improved inter-Korean ties,  including better business relations.    Of the 27 applications approved in February, 17 concerned  forming trade relations with North Korean businesses and the  remaining 10 covered investment in joint ventures with North  Korean partners.    Of the 11 applications approved after Feb. 16, however, only  two were for establishing trade relations and nine for  investment in joint ventures.    An application filed by the Hanhwa Group in the names of  five  group executives, including chairman Song Nak-chung of Kyong-in  Energy, after North Korea's inspection decision covered  joint-venture investment in constructing oil storage facilities  and petrochemical factories along the west coast of North Korea.    Hyosong Corp. applied to contact a North Korean firm on  setting up a joint-venture knitwear factory, while Cheil Food  &amp;  Chemicals sought a joint-venture food processing factory.    Of the 233 applications filed last year, only three were  turned down, ministry officials said. Total applications this  year will more than double the number filed last year, they  added.</p>

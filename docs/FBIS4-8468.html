			<p>BFN     [Text] I would first like to remind our listeners that we  are awaiting confirmation of a piece of news that we received  from a source close to the Government Commission on the foreign  debt negotiations, namely that late last night, at 0130 in the  French capital, the talks with the Paris Club of official  creditors ended with complete success. According to the same  source, an formula was agreed for rescheduling repayments of the  debt for 11 years, with a seven-year gratis period.</p>

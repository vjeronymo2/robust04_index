			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> SCHOOL CUSTODIAL STAFF CUTS TO SAVE $1.5 MILLION  </P> <P> There will be fewer custodians to clean classrooms next fall as a result of a  school board budget cut this week.  </P> <P> The board Monday agreed to reduce its custodial staff by 10%, eliminating 37  jobs through attrition as part of a package of cuts that will save the Long  Beach Unified School District $1.5 million.  </P> <P> Last month, the board cut $8.7 million, mostly by eliminating 39 clerical and  managerial positions through attrition and an early retirement incentive for  administrators.  </P> <P> The cuts begin the budget process, which is expected to continue later this  spring when the board reviews the 1990-91 budget, estimated at $350 million.  </P> <P> Board members avoided more controversial suggested cuts, including a plan that  would have scheduled students and teachers for 7:18 a.m. classes. Board members  also dismissed the idea of eliminating a music program at the elementary  schools or increasing the average classroom size by one student.  </P> <P> In addition, the board nixed a proposal to mandate physical education for  11th-graders, which would have eliminated about 10 new teaching jobs. Staff  members suggested the change because physical education classes can accommodate  almost twice as many students as a regular class, thus eliminating the need for  some elective courses.  </P></p>

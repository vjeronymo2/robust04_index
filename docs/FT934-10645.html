			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Observer: Kohl shoulder Chancellor Helmut Kohl needs all the help he can get when it comes to sewing west and east Germany back together again. But there is one worthy endeavour with which he is unlikely to have much truck. Launched today in Bonn, the National Foundation for Germany is the brainchild of two men who rank among Kohl's most seasoned political rivals - ex-chancellor Helmut Schmidt, now displaying almost Bismarckian curmudgeonliness at the age of 74, and Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister of the east German state of Saxony. Biedenkopf may be a member of the chancellor's own party, but he shares with Schmidt the belief that Kohl's blind spot over the extraordinary cost of unification has greatly exacerbated the country's problems. Mere mention of Biedenkopf's name has been known to send Kohl puce with indignation. The foundation, to be based in Weimar, will specialise in that worthy German occupation of organising debates and study groups to ponder the country's future. Schmidt, who has fairly piled up the cash since leaving the chancellorship 11 years ago thanks to the success of his books, is putting DM1m into the organisation. Similar contributions are expected from the likes of Hermann Josef Abs, former chief executive of Deutsche Bank, and Gerd Bucerius, founder of the newspaper Die Zeit. A fund-raiser in Berlin at the end of the month aims to swell the coffers further. No surprise that it is president Richard von Weizsacker rather than the chancellor hosting the occasion.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission considers that under existing regulations it is reasonable to expect new licensees, other than renewals, to provide for ease of decommissioning and minimization of waste when designing and operating facilities. However, given past experience, the Commission believes that this new requirement is necessary to focus applicant's attention on the type of facility design and good housekeeping practices needed to minimize the types of problems the Commission has had to face with problem sites like those addressed in the Commission's Site Decommissioning Management Plan (NUREG&hyph;1444, October 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Timeliness <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission does not want to create a situation where time requirements for completing decommissioning would make it difficult or impossible for licensees to safely and properly remediate large, complex, or otherwise difficult to decommission facilities. Therefore, the Commission is requesting comments on whether the criteria contained in this proposed rule can be met within the time frames that were specified in the final rule on ``Timeliness in Decommissioning of Materials Facilities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, the Commission is soliciting comments on whether licensees that anticipate having to establish an SSAB should be exempted from the generic timeliness requirements. If so, what alternative provisions could be made to assure timely decommissioning of the site? For example, could licensees be required to provide site-specific decommissioning schedules during the earliest stages of decommissioning, or during preparation for decommissioning, e.g., in the decommissioning plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship Between the Generic Environmental Impact Statement and Site-Specific Decommissioning Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Generic Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the Commission on this rulemaking evaluates the environmental impacts associated with the remediation of several types of NRC-licensed facilities to residual radioactivity levels ranging from 100 mrem/yr TEDE down to 0 mrem TEDE (background). The Commission believes that the generic analysis will encompass the impacts that will occur in any Commission decision to decommission an individual site. Therefore, the Commission plans to rely on the GEIS to satisfy its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act in regard to individual decommissioning decisions that meet the 15 mrem/yr criterion for unrestricted use. However, the Commission will still initiate a preliminary environmental review in regard to any particular site to determine if the generic analysis encompasses the range of environmental impacts at that particular site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would also provide for the termination of the license and the release of a site under restricted conditions if the licensee can demonstrate that the use of land use restrictions or other types of institutional controls will provide reasonable assurance that the 15 mrem/yr limit can be met. The types of controls and their contribution to providing reasonable assurance that the 15 mrem/yr limit can be met for a particular site will differ for each site in this category. Therefore, the environmental impacts cannot be analyzed on a generic basis and the Commission will conduct an independent environmental review for each site-specific decommissioning decision where land use restrictions or institutional controls are relied on by the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GEIS indicates that the decommissioning of certain classes of licensees (e.g., licensees using only sealed sources) will not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, for these categories of licensees, the Commission is proposing to amend 10 CFR Part 51.22 of the Commission's regulations to specify that the decommissioning of these types of licenses are actions eligible for categorical exclusion from the Commission's environmental review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Use of Land Use Restrictions or Other Types of Institutional Controls To Allow Termination of the License and Release of the Site Under Restricted Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Commission anticipates that most licenses can be terminated for unrestricted use, the Commission also anticipates that there may be situations where the site radiological criteria can only be met through the use of land use or other types of institutional controls which will restrict the site to specific uses. For example, there may be some sites where unrestricted use for agricultural purposes or residential uses would cause the proposed criteria to be exceeded. However, restricting the same site to industrial or commercial uses would enable the site to meet the 15 mrem/y TEDE dose limit because the exposure pathways would be limited. The licensee, with the advice of the Site Specific Advisory Board, would propose certain types of land use or institutional controls in the decommissioning plan submitted for Commission approval, to provide reasonable assurance that the site would be limited to the types of uses that would enable the proposed criteria to be met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of these controls include traditional zoning controls to restrict the use of the site to specific uses, the imposition of deed restrictions such as restrictive covenants or equitable servitudes to restrict the land to certain uses, negative easements where the licensee-landowner agrees to restrict the use of the land to specified uses, licensee agreements to restrict the use of certain portions of the land (for example, restricting access to a particular building), or even some type of government ownership of the property. Whatever type of controls are proposed by the licensee, the licensee must demonstrate that the controls proposed have a reasonable expectation of enforcement. A decommissioning plan that is dependent on land use or institutional controls whose enforcement are speculative would not be approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recognizes that demonstrating that radioisotope levels at a site are indistinguishable from background may be a complex task involving sophisticated sampling, measuring, and statistical analysis techniques. The difficulty of the task can vary substantially depending on a number of factors that include the radionuclide in question, the background level for that and other radionuclides at the site, and the temporal and spatial variations in background radiation at the site. Therefore, in order to assist the licensee in making these determinations, the Commission will publish specific guidance on acceptable methods which can be used by the licensee to demonstrate that the concentrations of specific radionuclides at the site are indistinguishable from background. The Commission will also publish specific guidance on acceptable methods for estimating annual TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group. This guidance will include a discussion of the type of scenarios and exposure pathways which should be considered, and computer models for estimating the annual TEDE to the average member of the critical group. The computer models will include screening models which employ generically derived conservative assumptions and factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, licensees will be able to substitute assumptions and factors more appropriate to a particular site if they can demonstrate that these factors and assumptions reasonably reflect the conditions at the site. Licensees may also use other models or methods for estimating TEDE provided they can demonstrate to the Commission that these models or methods provide reasonable estimates for the site to be decommissioned. When using modeling to estimate doses from radioactivity remaining at the site, the licensee will be able to use site specific parameters wherever practical. In the absence of site-specific information, the licensee must use parameters which provide a sufficient margin of safety that the Commission can make a finding that there is reasonable assurance the TEDE criteria in this part will be met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An NRC staff working draft regulatory guide will be published simultaneously with the proposed rule as NUREG&hyph;1500, ``Working Draft Regulatory Guide on Release Criteria for Decommissioning: NRC Staff's Draft for Comment.'' This publication allows licensees and interested members of the public to provide early comment during the developmental process. The draft regulatory guide has no official regulatory standing. The NRC staff anticipates that the draft regulatory guide will be published with the final rule and will incorporate public comments and the results of continued technical development activities. The draft regulatory guide published with the final rule will be for interim use and comment to fulfill the rule requirements and test implementation options. The final regulatory guide will be published approximately 1 to 2 years after publication of the final rule and would take into consideration comments on the draft guide as well as information regarding experience in implementing the draft guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft regulatory guide provides guidance on methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff for determining the predicted dose level (PDL) from any residual contamination remaining at a facility, that should be compared to the numerical dose criteria specified in the regulation. It describes the basic features of the calculational models and the associated default assumptions and parameter values that the NRC staff would find acceptable in calculating PDLs. Appendices to the guide provide numerical values that are used to estimate the dose from various residual radioactivity levels remaining at a facility. Also included are the considerations inherent in the ALARA process for decommissioning. Because the proposed 10 CFR Part 20, Subpart E, introduces several new concepts, a regulatory position concepts section containing definitions and discussions is included to assist licensees in understanding some of the philosophy underlying the rule. The regulatory position concepts section is followed by the regulatory position procedures section that describes actions the licensee can take to implement the requirements of the decommissioning rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has also issued the following supporting documents to provide guidance on implementation of the residual contamination criteria in the proposed rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) ``Guidance Manual for Conducting Radiological Surveys in Support of License Termination'' (NUREG/CR&hyph;5849), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Technical Basis Document, ``Residual Radioactive Contamination from Decommissioning: Technical Basis for Translating Contamination Levels to Annual TEDE'' (NUREG/CR&hyph;5512).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Guidance Manual for Conducting Radiological Surveys is intended to provide licensees with specific guidance on planning, conducting, and documenting site surveys which could be used to demonstrate that the site has been decontaminated to a level consistent with the Commission's criteria. The Technical Basis Document would provide an acceptable method for translating residual radioactivity levels (measurable quantities) to doses to individuals. Generic dose rate conversion factors are being developed for screening. In addition, the technical basis is expected to include a computer model which can be used for conducting a screening scenario/pathway analyses with site-specific parameters so that site-specific dose rate conversion factors can be calculated. The NRC anticipates that in most cases these dose rate conversion factors could be used to determine compliance with criteria resulting from the rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

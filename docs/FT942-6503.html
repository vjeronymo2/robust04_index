			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Ballot blarney before bombs: The IRA's search for Irish-American support makes it more vulnerable to demands from the US that it end violence Bill Clinton knows how to hold a party. On March 17, St Patrick's Day, the US president played host to a gathering at the White House which those attending will not easily forget. The guest list, led by Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, included US trade union leaders, presidential advisers, human rights lawyers, businessmen, congressmen and senators. All were drawn by enthusiasm for America's Irish heritage. The evening underlined Clinton's own interest in Irish affairs. He was meeting the challenge laid down by Reynolds, that, as 'political leaders, we must show daring as never before . . . in bringing about the goal of peace'. Among those attending was a leading Irish American businessman Don Keough, the former head of Coca-Cola. Commenting on the significance of the evening for Irish Americans, Keough said: 'It's like the end of a journey. We all had a feeling of finally arriving.' There has been Irish razzamatazz in the White House before. John F Kennedy held some cultural soirees, and Ronald Reagan entertained Tip O'Neill, the legendary speaker on Capitol Hill. But never had the invitation list been so long; never had the evening been so political in its scope, drawing in many of those interested in that most touchy of Irish subjects, Northern Ireland. As Clinton himself later boasted, the last time the White House had hosted a comparable party was under 'Old Hickory' Andrew Jackson, the first Irish American to be voted in as president. So who has arrived and where? On the basis of blood alone, Clinton is not a natural player in American ethnic politics. Much as he might have proclaimed his Irish roots during his presidential campaign, these are not particularly deep or immediate. One theory is that his maternal ancestors, the Cassidys, settled in South Carolina in the 17th century, Protestant emigrants from Ulster. This is hardly the stuff of Irish nationalism, but it was enough for the Clinton presidential campaign to set up Irish liaison groups and to garner as many votes as Kennedy did among Irish-Americans. In return, Clinton promised the earth - or so it seemed to those Irish republicans who had long sought to draw the US into playing an active role in Northern Ireland. The 'earth' was Clinton's promise to send a presidential envoy to sort out the mess in Belfast. Since becoming president, Clinton has put the envoy idea on the backburner. But his decision in February to grant a visa to Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, against the advice of state department officials and UK government objections, seemed to presage a new activism. To Irish-Americans such as Niall O'Dowd, editor of New York's Irish Voice, a newspaper for Irish Americans, Clinton has shown not only that he has a grasp of Irish issues, but that he can deliver on them. 'Under Clinton, Irish-Americans have been allowed and encouraged unprecedented access to key White House officials.' The visa decision brought to the surface British nervousness about Clinton's attitudes on Northern Ireland, particularly that the IRA was about to get a pat on the back. But the visa was never intended as an endorsement, nor did it turn out that way. So says Nancy Soderberg, a senior member of the US National Security Council, who helped persuade Clinton to grant it. Ms Soderberg is a self-assured, young political operator who, as a former foreign affairs adviser to Senator Ted Kennedy, spent years listening to the debate over Northern Ireland. She believes Clinton is committed to conflict resolution, as a facilitator rather than intervener. 'We wanted to expose Adams to American opinion that is opposed to violence and try to reach out in favour of moving the peace process forward,' she says. Clinton's record in conflict resolution elsewhere is not sparkling. But his aides believe a helping hand from the White House - drawing on the support of most of the 44m Irish-Americans - could bolster the Irish peace process, widely viewed as irreversible. The man who invited Mr Adams to the US, Bill Flyn, hardly fits the picture of the republican hard nut depicted by the British tabloid press. He is president of Mutual of America, one of the biggest insurance companies in the US, with offices on New York's Fifth Avenue, a prime mid-town location. Until seven years ago, Flyn, a third-generation Irish-American with a sentimental attachment to things Irish, steered clear of political involvement in Northern Ireland. Then one day, a group of IRA sympathisers from the Northern Aid Committee (Noraid) - the group once described by British and Irish authorities as the main vehicle in the US for funds and arms to the IRA - came to his offices and asked him to give to the Irish republican cause. 'I told them I couldn't do it. So they said: 'Now look here, Flyn, if you believe in a united Ireland, what the hell are you doing about it?' They made me feel like a draft dodger,' he recalls. So Flyn became involved not in Noraid but in the Northern Ireland Peace Movement, which is opposed to IRA violence. He subsequently joined a number of business groups which work closely with the British and Irish governments to promote a stable Northern Ireland through informal mediation and increased investment. His reaction to the Anglo-Irish joint declaration in December last year, which seeks to establish a basis for peace in the province, was enthusiastic. 'It was a fine declaration and I took my hat off to John Major and Reynolds. It was a breakthrough,' says Flyn. It was in this spirit that Flyn invited Adams in February to speak at a conference on the future of Northern Ireland - which sparked off the visa row. 'I wanted to help the process towards peace,' says Flyn. He believed then, and still believes, that far from promoting the IRA's armed struggle, the Adams visit strengthened the hand of moderates in the republic movement and exposed republican hardliners to the moderation of most Irish-Americans. He has no regrets about the invitation. Drawing on his contacts in the Irish republican movement, Flyn says: 'I think the Adams visit achieved more in 48 hours than 20 years of violence did. He realised that, if he was to make progress, it would have to be through dialogue and not through the bullet.' The majority of senators and congressmen who backed the Adams visa also say they did so not as a sign of support for IRA violence but to achieve peace. The group includes congressman Joseph Kennedy, nephew of former President Kennedy, son of former attorney-general Robert Kennedy, and a rising political star on Capitol Hill. Six years ago the young Kennedy's tour of Northern Ireland drew the wrath of the UK tabloid press when he got into an argument with a British soldier and told him to get out of the six counties. Kennedy, who represents Boston, which has one of the largest Irish communities in the US, is now defensive about his reputation as a leading critic of Britain's military presence in Northern Ireland. 'Whatever (sectors of the British media) may think, I am not pro-IRA,' he says. Despite his continuing sympathy with the republican ideal of a united Ireland, Kennedy says: 'I have never met with the IRA although I have urged them to lay down their arms. Given my family's history of assassination, how could I possibly condone the use of a gun to make a political point?' On the Hill, the one person who speaks out unflinchingly and often in defence of the IRA is Peter King, a Republican congressman for Nassau, New York state. The son of a New York policeman of Irish descent, King says he supports the IRA out of personal conviction, having been converted to the cause after Bloody Sunday in 1972, when British paratroopers shot dead 13 civilians in Northern Ireland. While King has few supporters among congressmen or in his constituency, he personifies a sentimental loyalty to the Irish republican cause as well as the anglophobia which dates from the 1840s, when the first flood of Irish immigrants came to America after the Irish famine. This patriotism - American-style - was once described by James Stephens, the Fenian leader, as a 'windbag or a phantom, the laughing stock of sensible men and the El Dorado of fools . . . speeches of bayonets, gala days and jolly nights, banners and sashes . . . bunkum and fulsome filibustering'. It sprang from ethnic insecurity and a sense of profound powerlessness as poor Catholic immigrants tried to forge an identity in a country settled by Puritan colonists. From the early 1970s, it became a source of funds and guns for the IRA as Irish-Americans, mindful of the civil liberties enshrined in the US constitution, protested against what they considered human rights violations against Northern Ireland's Catholic minority. One of the Irish-Americans deeply embedded in republican folklore is Michael Flannery, founder in 1969 of Noraid. Flannery fought in the IRA's North Tipperary brigade before emigrating to the US after partition in 1921. There, Flannery and a few friends set out to radicalise some of the social clubs catering for Irish expatriates. Today, aged 92, poor, lonely and suffering from arthritis, Flannery personifies the romance and the limitations of Irish republicanism in the US. He lives with his memories in Jackson Heights, a New York suburb where Irish Americans are now outnumbered by Latin Americans, and where drugs trafficking is more common than Irish republican propaganda. Flannery chuckles as he recalls how in 1982 he was acquitted of raising Dollars 16,800 for the purpose of supplying rifles to the IRA. The prosecution collapsed after defence lawyers uncovered potentially embarrassing connections between the arms dealers and the CIA. 'They never proved we were financing the IRA,' Flannery says. Flannery left Noraid in the late 1980s after the organisation split over whether Sinn Fein and the IRA should continue abstaining from politics in the south of Ireland. Those who remained in Noraid supported political involvement in the south, alongside armed struggle in the north. Flannery rejected political involvement. But he remains committed to the armed struggle as the means to achieve one state on the island of Ireland. Noraid's current chief, the much younger Martin Galvin, works from a lawyer's cramped office in New York's Bronx area. Galvin insists Flannery jumped ship unnecessarily. 'He thought we were going away from republican principles - that the armed struggle would be wound down. The last eight years have proved that these (fears) were not justified.' Yet Flannery is not alone in thinking that Noraid, for all its rhetoric, has gone 'soft'. The FBI and British intelligence believe Noraid's fund-raising abilities have diminished - down to less than Dollars 200,000 a year from close to Dollars 1m in the early 1980s. This is the result of splits in the movement, recession, FBI infiltration, and better information being made available about Northern Ireland. There is now evidence that Noraid no longer represents the hardest line among Irish-Americans. At a ticket-only banquet held by an offshoot of the organisation, called Friends of Irish Freedom, in South Boston this month, a keynote speech by Tommy McKearney, a former IRA member who served 15 years for shooting a British soldier, rejected the joint declaration outright. He was warmly received by 200 people from the Boston unit of the organisation when he said Gerry Adams should insist British troops got out of Northern Ireland before further negotiation, or hand over the Sinn Fein leadership to somebody else. Though the Friends represent only a small minority of Irish-Americans, they might be a source of support for a reconstituted armed struggle if some militant Irish republicans were to end violence in response to the joint decla-ration. Despite divisions among Irish republican supporters, US interest in Northern Ireland seems certain to increase in coming weeks. Bars in New York, Chicago and Boston are gearing up with sweat-shirts, stickers, baseball caps and advance block bookings for matches, as they await the arrival of the Irish World Cup football team and its supporters. The turn-out will represent the biggest single instance of Irish immigration, albeit temporary, since the famine. And some bars will, no doubt, be collecting for the IRA. The earlier Irish migration sprang from suffering and fostered a romantic sense of Irish history which militant republicans have been able to translate into money for guns. While those first Irish immigrants clambered on to American shores as supplicant refugees, today's festive Irish fans will find a community of Irish cousins who have themselves 'arrived' and are now finding their voice around a new US presidency. It is not the type of community in which the IRA can take for granted support for its campaign of violence. Numbering about five times as many Irish men and women as live in Ireland, north and south, the community's politics is informed by moderation. As Bill Flyn puts it: 'I think the real power of 44m Irish Americans has been awakened. It's available to anyone who wants to be a peacemaker.' Step up, President Clinton.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Jan (TANJUG) -- Serb President Radovan  Karadzic said today that the international community remained  "blind in respect to the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and  that it continued to encourage the Muslim side to carry on with  the war," SRNA [Bosnian Serb news agency] reports.    Commenting on the latest NATO declaration in Brussels,  Karadzic told SRNA that this document by the international  community is designed to exert more pressure on the Serb side  despite the fact that, according to Karadzic, "the Serbs are the  most cooperative side when it comes not only to humanitarian  issues but also to the peace agreement."    "Only the Serbs have fulfilled everything that was expected  from them," Karadzic added. "Instead of lifting the sanctions  and exerting pressure on the Muslim side to accept peace, the  international community continues to issue threats against the  Serbs." These threats, to put it mildly, are counterproductive  to the peace process, Karadzic said, adding that the Muslims did  not feel obliged to sign the peace agreement for as long as the  West continues to encourage them.    Responding to accusations that the Serbs did not allow the  peacekeeping troops in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica to be  replaced, Karadzic said an agreement on replacement had been  reached a long time ago, "but that the technical details of the  agreement must be worked out with our generals."    "As for the fighting around Sarajevo, even UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] reports clearly indicate that the Muslims have  been attacking the Serb positions. When it comes to Sarajevo  airport, obviously it is not in our interest to shell the  airport; we definitely have not been doing that," Karadzic said  in reference to international accusations of the alleged Serb  "strangulation" of Sarajevo.    Karadzic said a peace agreement must be signed before the  airport in Tuzla was opened, adding that airports in Tuzla,  Banjaluka, and Mostar would be opened simultaneously on the day  when a peace agreement, guaranteed by the international  community, was signed.    "Europe has allowed chaos to be created in it. Europe caused  it, and it would be decent of Europe to contribute toward a  peaceful solution for that chaos," Karadzic said. He added:  "We have fulfilled all our obligations, and we expect that the  peace agreement will be signed on 18 January. If the peace  agreement is not signed, we will demand immediate suspension of  sanctions against the Serb nation from the international  community, and we still will be ready to negotiate for peace,"  SRNA reports.</p>

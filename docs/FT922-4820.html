			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Management: Bringing order to the AGM Company chairmen need no longer dread the yearly circus of the AGM. There is no further need to stand up unprotected, fielding a barrage of awkward questions about the dividend policy and the group's dubious employment policies in South Africa. A new computer system promises to make AGMs into well co-ordinated productions in which the company pulls all the strings. As shareholders arrive, they log questions into a computer. The questions are automatically sorted according to subject matter and transmitted to the relevant company expert. He or she can then put together a tactful answer that the chairman simply reads off his Autocue. Shareholders are given badges so that they can be summoned to the microphone with minimum fuss when their turn comes. The new system, called Q+A, has been developed by Q-TV Prompting, a computer company based in north London. At Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 3,000 for hire of equipment and staff for a meeting, it is expected to appeal mainly to larger companies. Cynics might wonder whether the technological wizardry of large AGMs has not already gone too far. Video shows and special effects are now de rigueur for larger companies, while the typical small shareholder is often more interested in a free glass of sherry. As for awkward challenges, chairmen have already been well rehearsed by their PR companies on how to get around analysts' probing questions at the time of the results. Other shareholders may have nothing more to ask than about the shortage of of wholemeal muffins in the Croydon branch. Answering that should be a piece of cake, even without a computer. The newly-privatised utilities - which are expected to be natural buyers of Q+A because of their armies of shareholders - already seem to be overdoing their AGMs. British Gas hired the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham for its first meeting, expecting a good turnout from its millions of private investors. In the event only a handful turned up. More recently, a similar fate befell Scottish Power.</p>

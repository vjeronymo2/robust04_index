The rival Koreas hailed the agreements as an historical step to eventual unification. But the failure to resolve concerns over North Korean nuclear weapons development was seen as a serious rift. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung called for mutual arms reductions and for withdrawal of all US troops.</p>

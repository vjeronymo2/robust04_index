			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: THE PRINT PRESS PAYS TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO TRAPPINGS OF TV NEWS  </P> <P> In the hotly competitive world of network news, the Persian Gulf crisis is a  major mobilization of anchors, reporters, producers, camera crews and public  relations hype. It's a kind of two-front war. One involves the actual coverage.  The other involves selling that coverage to our brothers and sisters who cover  television as a beat in the nation's newspapers.  </P> <P> At all the networks, the aim is to be first with the best. But, for many who  write about us, what counts is not what is being said but who gets where and on  the air first.  </P> <P> As someone who has played the PR game with enthusiasm over the years, I am a  little amused and frustrated by the turn this particular battle has taken. Most  of the newspaper coverage of our collective efforts has concentrated on who  gets where first. Or gets on the air first, even if it's a matter of minutes.  </P> <P> Now, the networks aren't blameless in this. It's a vicious cycle that we are  part of. We lean on our press and publicity people to get the word out on how  great we are doing or, failing that, how poorly the others are faring.  </P> <P> What happens when the television columns become a time-keeper's score card? ABC  gets Sam Donaldson into Saudi Arabia in the middle of the night and then rolls  him out of bed to appear on "Nightline" so it can claim the first report out of  that country, even though Sam privately complained he'd been on the ground only  two hours and had nothing original to say.  </P> <P> Dan Rather deserves the credit and coverage given him for getting the first  American one-on-one interview with Saddam Hussein. But many television  columnists, judging far-off events from home, didn't bother to analyze the  self-serving answers of the Iraqi leader or question the use of American  television to make his case. Instead, they told us that Dan didn't have time to  shave before the interview and that during small talk with Saddam Hussein the  CBS anchor discussed his favorite pastime, fly fishing. This, after earlier  columns deploring the evolution of anchors as television personalities first  and journalists second.  </P> <P> In writing about broadcast journalism's coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis,  form almost always takes precedence over substance. Almost no credit went to  NBC's Fred Francis for breaking the story of CIA training of Kuwaiti resistance  fighters in Saudi Arabia to strike inside occupied Kuwait; David Martin of CBS  was not interviewed about his scoop on President Bush's decision to send troops  into Saudi Arabia; no one cared whether ABC's Forrest Sawyer had shaved when he  reported that Westerners in Iraq were being rounded up.  </P> <P> My friend Bryant Gumbel spent a week doing memorable live reports from inside  Saudi Arabia for "Today." His work received only fleeting attention on the TV  pages until "Today's" ratings shot up. This from the columnists who accuse us  of an obsession with ratings over substance or anything else.  </P> <P> This kind of time-keeper, travelogue, ratings-driven coverage in the television  pages is not unique to the Persian Gulf crisis. It goes on during political  campaigns, space shuttle explosions, uprisings in Beijing, the collapse of the  Berlin Wall. Too much attention on the trappings of television news and not  enough attention on the day-to-day and long-term coverage. In fact, I always  find it more than a little shocking when television writers will confess they  really didn't have time to actually watch the programs. They were writing from  network press releases or spin or hearsay.  </P> <P> That only feeds what is ultimately a form of journalistic cancer: We get so  caught up in our own press we lose sight of our real role. Newspapers are not  innocent players. They approach broadcast journalism with a cynical double  standard. They decry its flamboyance while simultaneously encouraging it. After  all, writing about anchors and ratings is easier than actually watching and  listening to the programs these people work so hard to put on.  </P> <P> So, the next time the printsters write about who is doing the best job of  reporting on TV, look for the what, where and why along with the who and when.  </P></p>

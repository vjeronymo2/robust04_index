			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Allied steps up strategy of expansion in China ALLIED Group, the Hong Kong conglomerate at the centre of a corporate fraud investigation, is proceeding with its aggressive moves into China. It has taken a 30 per cent stake in USDollars 30m resort development in Manchuria. That follows news last week that Allied had placed out 10 per cent of the company to the Fujian provincial government, despite the uncertainty surrounding Mr Lee Ming Tee's group of companies. In the latest acquisition, Allied has taken a stake in China International Allied Yacht Club, a joint venture with a Mainland company which holds the only licence for operating yacht clubs in China. Initially concentrating on the Golden Stone Beach resort in Dalian, in the northern province of Liaoning, the joint venture company will also examine feasibility studies for resorts in Shinhuangdao, Qingdao, Xiamen and Zhuhai. Mr Lee has said he intends to invest up to HKDollars 5bn (USDollars 646m) in China within the next three years, so that more than 50 per cent of the company's assets would be across the border. A spokesman for Allied said the ongoing investigation into share dealings in the Allied group and related companies did not affect the group's assets and would not have any impact on its operations, or expansion plans.</p>

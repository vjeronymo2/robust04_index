			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Queue for a slice of cheese market - The larger producers are seeking to expand LA Vache Qui Rit, the creamy cheese with a chuckling cow on its box, is one of France's most popular cheeses. It is being talked of as a takeover target in the speculation over the future of Bel, its owner. Bel, which also owns Port Salut and Les Petits Amis, is one of the few large French cheese companies still under family control. Mr Robert Fievet, its chairman and controlling shareholder, is 84 years old. Besnier, the acquisitive French dairy group, has been buying Bel shares and owns 8.1 per cent of the company. It has made no secret of its hopes of raising its stake further. However, Besnier is not the only predator in the French cheese industry. Bongrain, another ambitious dairy concern, has made a number of acquisitions and is intent on expansion. Philip Morris, the US group which is a significant player in processed cheese through Kraft, is also eyeing the French market. 'We've already seen a great deal of change in this industry,' said Mr Claude Boutineau, joint-chairman of Bongrain. 'There is still more to come. The only question is how quickly?' French cheese is an attractive area for investment. The European cheese market slowed in the second half of last year, reflecting the economic squeeze in France and other European countries. However, cheese still has relatively high growth potential in the mature food market. France has a strong cheesemaking tradition and plentiful supplies of milk. The 340 French cheeses tend to be high-quality products that are well-placed to benefit from the European trend towards more sophisticated food. 'In the short term, the growth of the cheese market will remain relatively low,' said Mr Michael Oertli, European food analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. 'But in the long term there is strong growth potential for high-quality French cheeses, particularly in Germany and Spain.' The French cheese industry is polarised between a handful of very large companies - Besnier, Bel, Bongrain - and hundreds of small family companies and co-operatives. The small players are finding it increasingly difficult to operate in the French market, which is dominated by multinational manufacturers, such as Nestle of Switzerland and France's BSN, and multiple retailers, notably Carrefour and Casino. As a result, there is no shortage of acquisition targets for the large cheesemakers. Bongrain has grown rapidly both inside and outside France, increasing its sales to FFr9.7bn (Dollars 1.75bn) from FFr5.95bn in the five years to 1991. Last summer, it took a 10 per cent stake in ULN, a troubled co-operative of Normandy dairies, but, because of ULN's fragile finances, was able to secure full management control. The company is searching for other acquisitions. 'We have a strong balance sheet and if suitable opportunities arise, particularly in branded cheeses or interesting areas of technology, we'll take them,' said Mr Boutineau. Besnier, a co-operative chaired by Mr Michel Besnier, is pursuing a similar strategy. It is one of Europe's largest dairy groups, with annual sales of FFr22bn. Last year, it paid FFr862m for 58 per cent of Roquefort cheese in a deal with Nestle, the Swiss food group which had acquired the stake as part of its bid for Perrier mineral water. Besnier has since increased its holding to 69 per cent. Bel is Besnier's latest target. Mr Bernard Aubert, chief executive, said after the recent share-buying exercise that Besnier had 'absolutely no ulterior motives' towards Bel, but that it hoped to acquire a 'more significant holding'. He also envisaged amassing similar stakes in other businesses. Bongrain and Bel have been able to expand without coming into competition with the multinational manufacturers that dominate other areas of the food market. Cheese production is a complex process with limited scope for economies of scale. It is also prone to supply problems due to sharp seasonal variations in milk production. As a result, the general food groups have tended to favour sectors such as processed cheese, rather than finicky French products. Nestle chose to sell Roquefort to Besnier (partly to placate the French financial establishment), although it has significant cheese interests in Spain. BSN is a significant force in French fromage frais, but its cheese business is bigger in Italy than in its native France. Bongrain and Besnier may face stiffer competition partly because advances in dairy technology are eroding production problems. Philip Morris has been suggested as a potential purchaser for Bel. Its interest may well have prompted Besnier to speed its share-buying in Bel in order to make sure that it had a blocking stake, in case La Vache Qui Rit does come up for sale.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART IN THE EIGHTIES;  </P> <P> A GILDED AGE;  </P> <P> ART: MUSEUM CONSTRUCTION FLOURISHED, PRICES FOR ARTWORKS SKYROCKETED AND  ARTISTS GOT RICH, BUT CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND NEA RESTRICTIONS PUT A DAMPER ON  PROGRESS IN THE '80S.  </P> <P> They were the Opulent '80s. The visual arts, a once-esoteric subculture, joined  the real world, reflecting the Reagan era's love of consumption, prestige and  self-congratulation. We crowned ourselves in a frenzy of museum building and  filled our cultural cathedrals with the booty of centuries. Artists joined the  ranks of the rich and famous. Galleries flourished and auction prices ascended  into the stratosphere.  </P> <P> It was gilded and grandiose, but in the end museum directors feared for the  future of public showplaces. New York's magisterial Metropolitan had a 1989  deficit of more than $4 million. Tax laws discouraged donations, and auction  prices shut down institutional collecting. New art lost its way in a maze of  cross-purposes, and all art was reduced to a commodity increasingly in the  hands of private investors seeking status, profit or their very own private  museums. Some boutique museums worked -- like Houston's smart, soulful Menil  Museum -- but hearts sank when Armand Hammer jerked his promised collection  away from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to build his own monument in  Westwood.  </P> <P> It looked like the dawn of the Nasty '90s.  </P> <P> What happened? What went right? What went wrong?  </P> <P> Los Angeles matured into a meaningful art center and came to symbolize the  whole caboodle as the home of the world's richest art institution, the J. Paul  Getty Trust. With an endowment well in excess of $3 billion, it has an annual  income of about $150 million -- a sum a Saudi prince would have trouble  squandering. Among many acquisitions was one of the 10 most expensive works  auctioned. It paid $35.2 million for Jacopo Pontormo's "Halberdier," but Van  Gogh and Picasso dominated the Top 10.  </P> <P> Los Angeles mirrored a Euro-American cultural axis at the apex of Baroque  splendor. It built museums with the enthusiasm of medieval worshipers. Art  itself took on the aspect of a weird secular religion. True believers revered  its relics. The powerful purchased piety through corporate indulgence. The  artist Hans Haacke blew the whistle on them, the Ralph Nader of the art world.  </P> <P> Angeltown's greening was signaled by the enchanted Olympic year of '84 with its  cosmopolitan arts festival. The fine arts had a small part in it, but the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art's lovely Impressionist show, "A Day in the  Country," captured the mood.  </P> <P> The Museum of Contemporary Art went through birth traumas. Wrangles over  architectural control and the loss of its superstar director Pontus Hulten had  to play out before Richard Koshalek took charge. Now, Arata Isozaki's pretty,  witty building glitters on Bunker Hill.  </P> <P> In 1980, Earl A. (Rusty) Powell came from Washington to direct the  steady-as-she-goes County Museum. Now the museum's new Anderson Building by  Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and its Japanese Pavilion by Bruce Goff are as exotic as  the town, but they echo a phenomenon that swept westward from the Berlin Wall  to the Pacific Rim.  </P> <P> West Germany probably led the pack, capping its economic miracle with a blitz  of building, adding nearly 30 new museums by decade's end, including such  masterworks as James Stirling's muscular Stuttgart Neue Staatsgalerie and Hans  Hollien's lapidary Stadtisches Museum Abteiberg in Monchengladbach, a burg of  just 150,000 souls.  </P> <P> Paris gilded its lily with the grandiose art-unfriendly Musee d'Orsay, got it  right when they housed the legacy of the rebellious Picasso in the 17th-Century  Hotel Sale and surprised everybody when I. M. Pei's new glass-pyramid entry for  the Louvre turned out handsome and respectful of its august surroundings.  </P> <P> The real spirit of the era began with a national sigh of relief on Inauguration  Day, 1981, when the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini released American hostages held  in the Tehran embassy. Self-celebration followed. Art of all stripes acted as  reassurance that the culture was still rich and powerful even as it felt  rattled and unsure. The country became conservative and art held up the mirror  in a revivalist rush into the past.  </P> <P> Art formed cliches of Post-Modernism accompanied by big nostalgic shows devoted  to the American Renaissance, Louis Comfort Tiffany and decadent Vienna, 1900. A  paraded pomp of bread-and-circus shows that started in the '70s with "The  Treasures of Tuthankamun" lumbered on to pretty well culminate with the  National Gallery's "Treasure Houses of Great Britain" in 1985. By then, rising  insurance costs and dwindling support had turned such shows, no matter how  popular, into albino elephants. Some, like the fatuous "The Search for  Alexander," had been turkeys anyway.  </P> <P> A newer, more nourishing trend was already under way. Serious and revelatory  surveys of master art proved the most passionate fruit of the decade. Even  aficionados who had spent their days with noses glued to framing glass were  astonished by the number of once-in-a-lifetime American exhibitions of great  old master art: Watteau, Caravaggio, Poussin, Zurbaran, Hals, Velazquez. As  history moved closer, it focused on the towering figure of Cezanne, the  heart-stopping testament of Van Gogh, the unavoidable stylishness and exoticism  of Gauguin.  </P> <P> For Los Angeles viewers, such marvels were both revelation and aggravation  because witnessing any of them required pilgrimage to Manhattan's Metropolitan  and Museum of Modern Art and Washington's National Gallery. Los Angeles came a  long way, but baby we still got a long way to go.  </P> <P> We did better -- even astonishingly better -- when it came to totting up the  short list of the decade's finest modern exhibitions. The originality of a  revived modern-art program at LACMA ran neck-and-neck with the classicism of  the Museum of Modern Art. MOMA's great Picasso retrospective, her "Primitivism  and 20th Century Art" plus "Picasso and Braque," added up to a thoughtful  probing of fixed tradition. LACMA talked about the present and future in  exhibitions devoted to near-forgotten, newly relevant movements like the  Russian avant-garde and Stephanie Barron's German Expressionist sculpture and  second-generation shows. Maurice Tuchman had the gumption to say that modern  art had soul in "The Spiritual and Art." The museum reintroduced the dense  mastery of Max Beckmann in a retrospective no New York museum had the brains to  book.  </P> <P> Then there was contemporary art.  </P> <P> Pluralism turns out to be code for "one fine mess." The art of the moment  became a chaotic tower of Babel with everybody speaking every conceivable  language but his own. Babylon babbled on in the accents of fashion,  entertainment, politics and economics, but it was a rare day when there was a  sign in the window reading "Man Spricht Kunst" or "On Parle Art." In the end,  art was deemed more interesting if it attached to a current issue like  perestroika, AIDS or Japan than because it was good.  </P> <P> The Museum of Contemporary Art became the West Coast flagship of the Now. Not  fully launched until 1986, it made great strides, buying its core collection  from Milan's Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo for $11 million and receiving  bequests from the estates of Barry Lowen and Taft Schreiber. Everyone wished  MOCA well, but as the artificial curtain came down on the '80s, the museum  seemed not to have gained traction. A sense of trying to do too many things at  once echoed the disarray of the larger world of contemporary art.  </P> <P> Bogus movements succeeded one another like mannequins parading down a ramp:  Neo-Expressionism, the Transavantgardia, New Images, Neo-Geo, Appropriation,  Deconstructivism. Art was reinternationalized and, for what it's worth, a local  institution exercised broad influence. A generation of Young Turks from CalArts  under the guruship of John Baldessari spearheaded art that deals in  word-associated images and social parody via The Media.  </P> <P> The new power of the press to intervene in shaping popular artistic taste was  never clearer than in the hot, slow summer of '86, when Time and Newsweek  carried cover stories about the supposed discovery of a cache of supposedly  secret paintings by Andrew Wyeth. All depicted his longtime model, Helga  Testorf. The subtextual implication that the grand old conservative of American  painting had had an affair was enough to ensure the popularity of a museum  tour. It had nothing to do with art. It was about the yarn.  </P> <P> International bellwether exhibitions proved there are more artists working than  anybody can keep track of -- or wants to. Germany's Documenta and the Venice  Biennale suffered from inbreeding and hollow giantism. After 10 years, only a  handful of such artists stick in the mind: Anselm Kiefer, Jannis Kounellis,  Richard Long, Jonathan Borofsky, Christian Boltanski -- to name a few of the  few. Local examples with talent and apparent staying power are as rare as Jill  Giegerich.  </P> <P> Last summer, Paris' Pompidou Center organized "Magicians of the Earth." It  mixed a sprawling melange of jet-set regulars like Nam June Paik with unknown  Third World folk-style artists and may have been the worst, most incoherent  circus of the epoch.  </P> <P> Superstar artists flaired and fizzled. A trio of Italians hot at the start were  half forgotten by the end. Americans like David Salle, Julian Schnabel, Eric  Fischl and Robert Longo sold in six figures, but after Longo's retrospective at  LACMA a New York critic wondered if he was washed up with the decade. Green  talents were launched before they were ready. Jean-Michel Basquiat died from  it.  </P> <P> Truth to tell, the most memorable art of the '80s came from artists who  predated it: Frank Stella, Richard Diebenkorn, David Hockney, Lucien Freud, Ed  Moses, Joe Goode and the artist's architect, Frank Gehry. One of the nicest  memories comes from '85, when Christo wrapped Paris' ancient Seine bridge, the  Pont Neuf. Seen at sunset swathed in dull golden fabric, it was like a  liquefied cocktail of past and present existing in classic harmony.  </P> <P> What went wrong?  </P> <P> The culture went greedy, narcissistic, intensely confrontational, contentious  and short on civility. Fracturing polarization symbolized by, say, the  agonizing debate over abortion, signals a society that has lost the ability to  make the distinctions necessary to arrive at a common set of values.  </P> <P> A French poet, I think it was Valery, when accused of being overly cultivated,  replied that if civilization fails to become more refined it must become  brutalized.  </P> <P> In the arts, the decade saw a breakdown of distinctions that breached the  borders between the various arts, a cross-fertilization that revitalized  architecture and design but impoverished fine art. Even artists who kept the  faith found themselves confronted by an audience relieved of the burden of  being attentive to pesky nuances. After all, it's all the same in the end. It's  all collectibles.  </P> <P> Andy Warhol died, but his sardonically innocent insights about American culture  proved true. Fame and money.  </P> <P> Public Art turned out to be code for vulgarization.  </P> <P> Vulgarity has the virtue of energy and the vice of self-satisfaction. Now that  art is like everything else, everybody has a shot at it from John Q. Public to  The Media and Sen. Klaghorn. The decade has shown where that gets us.  </P> <P> Remember the controversy up in the Bay over Robert Arneson's bust of  assassinated Mayor George Moscone? What about the wrangle over Maya Lin's  Vietnam Veterans Memorial in D.C., or New York's grinding battle around Richard  Serra's "Tilted Arc," which was finally removed to the artist's anguish? Around  here, there was Robert Graham's Olympic Gateway. Critics out to weigh its  aesthetic worth were surprised at public outrage over pubic specificity.  </P> <P> Remember when the city's manager for cultural affairs, Fred Croton, left the  post after it was discovered he had exaggerated his qualifications on his  application? The Getty's respected curator of antiquities, Jiri Frel, was  allowed to resign quietly after he'd violated museum policies on acquisitions.  Dreary business.  </P> <P> Gentlemanly John Walsh, director of the Getty Museum, must have been bemused by  the number of times journalists and dealers besmirched his acqusitions as hot  or fake. First they went after his Dieric Bouts, then his ancient Greek Kouros  and a big Aphrodite. Thomas Hoving of Connoisseur magazine led the charge so  many times it should have gotten funny. Never did.  </P> <P> It does not auger well that the lights go out on a year when the big news was a  senatorial attack on the National Endowment for the Arts. Hard to forget that  the Corcoran Gallery did the wrong thing by canceling an endowment-funded show  of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. Instead of avoiding controversy and  political interference thereby, they increased it, incensed the art community  and kicked off a chain of events that ended with legislation restricting  endowment grants to "obscene or offensive" art, whatever that means.  </P> <P> Means trouble.  </P> <P> Nobody wants to leave a decade on such a sour note. Let's go back to London, to  the new Clore Gallery for the art of Joseph Mallord William Turner. There is a  study room there where any citizen willing to wash his fingers can contemplate  Turner's glorious watercolors, holding them in his own hands.  </P> <P> That's what it's all about.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUYING POWER  </P> <P> Major Acquisitions of the J.

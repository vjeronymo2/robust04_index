The terrorist group's seven-strong ruling Army Council was  said to be divided 4-3 in favour of accepting the month-old  joint Anglo-Irish initiative -- a majority not considered  adequate to avoid the formation of a breakaway group backing  continued violence, or to swing the hard-line republican  movement as a whole behind peace.    And doubts about the statement signed by Prime Minister John  Major and his Irish counterpart Albert Reynolds were reported to  be widespread among grassroots supporters of the IRA and their  Sinn Fein political spokesmen.    The Dublin sources said the general membership did not  appear  to have been given enough information by their leaders to make a  decision.    The last of a series of consultative meetings organised by  Sinn Fein to sound out their followers is due later this month,  one week ahead of the party's annual conference in Dublin, the  date now regarded as potentially vital by the Irish government.    Members are understood to be pressing for details of the  document produced last year after discussions between Sinn Fein  chief Gerry Adams, and John Hume, head of Ulster's Social  Democratic and Labour Party, so that its contents could be  compared with the Major-Reynolds declaration.    There is also said to be concern among the republicans about  the failure of the Downing Street statement to mention the  possibility of an amnesty for jailed terrorists on both sides of  the Irish border.    IRA activists in several areas of Northern Ireland were  reckoned to be blocking acceptance of the peace plan.    Within the Dublin-based security services, concern persists  about the destination of huge IRA arms caches thought to be  hidden at a number of secret locations throughout the Irish  Republic.    Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds told the Dublin  parliament today that he had no evidence to back up reports of  divisions within the IRA.    And he remained doggedly optimistic of eventual IRA and Sinn  Fein agreement to the joint peace declaration.</p>

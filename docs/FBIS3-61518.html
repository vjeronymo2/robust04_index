Timofeyeva, K.M. </F> Mendigaliyeva, Scientific Center of Regional Nutrition Problems,  Alma-Ata; UDC 641.56:577.4+616-08+612.273.664.002:616-084]    [Abstract] The high incidence of iron deficiency anemia  which, according to WHO, affects 84-90% of women in some  parts  of the world, and the lack of data on the assimilability and  side effects of iron preparations prompted the Scientific Center  of Regional Nutrition Problems at the USSR Academy of Medical  Sciences to develop a new lactic product--Zhiger--with a  specific antianemic effect. It is prepared on the basis of cow's  milk with a special serum lactis or whey, vitamins,  trace elements (Fe and Cu), and other biologically active  components. The product has good organoleptic indicators and  contains 2.5-2.7 g of protein, 2.4-2.6 g of fat, and 3.6 g of  carbohydrates per 100 ml. Clinical tests of the new preparation  were carried out at the Alma-Ata oblast hospital on anemic  patients and patients diagnosed with chronic gastritis. The  behavior of the hemoglobin, erythrocyte, color index, serous  iron, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SOE) in the blood  before and after treatment with Zhiger, the behavior of certain  hemopoietic indicators in anemic patients against the backdrop  of gastritis before and after treatment with Zhiger, and the  behavior of certain hemopoietic indicators in anemic patients  before and after therapy (control group) are summarized. The  findings demonstrate that Zhiger leads to a verifiable change in  the hematologic indicators when used on patients with anemia of  first degree. In patients with anemia of second degree,  treatment resulted in positive blood indicator dynamics. Tables  4.</p>

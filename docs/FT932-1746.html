			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters success News that Reuters had reached its initial target of executing an average 1,000 trades a day on its Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange trading system triggered a flurry of strong support for the shares as some analysts adopted the view that the new system has established clear marketing leadership within the lucrative forex market. Reuters rose 16 to 1347p on turnover of almost 1m shares. 'We believe it is possible for Reuters to achieve a 10 per cent market share in forex, which is now a highly profitable growth market,' said Mr Brian Newman, electronics analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, the stockbroker. The Henderson analyst said he believed Reuters had left the international opposition in forex dealings systems far behind. Volume carried out by Minex, controlled by a consortium of Japanese banks, was mostly sourced in Japan, while the start-up of the EBS system, run by a consortium including Telerate, had been delayed to September.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sebahattin Onkibar from the "Politics Diary" </F> column: "Al-Biqa' Is the Next Target"]    [Excerpt] A high-ranking General Staff official was on the  telephone. We were discussing the previous day's successful  operation by our Air Force against Zhalah camp, one of the new  bases of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan].    This official said: "Our air operation hit all the targets  and we achieved results. The Turkish Air Force has proven that  if necessary it could also destroy targets beyond 500  kilometers. In terms of distance Zhalah camp is not nearer than  al-Biqa'. If the civilian authority orders, we can similarly  strike at al-Biqa'."    This high-ranking General Staff official placed special  emphasis on al-Biqa' and made no request that this not be  published.    The conclusion that could be drawn from this is that  al-Biqa'  has been included among targets that could be struck when the  international situation allows. [passage omitted]</p>

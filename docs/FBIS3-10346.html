			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 1 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican Foreign  Secretary Manuel Tello Macias asserted today that dialogue and  negotiations among countries are essential to confronting the  challenges and threats that endanger international stability and  security. He emphasized that the world faces new challenges and  threats to its stability and security following the era of  political-ideological confrontation. Speaking at the  inauguration of the 10th Mexican-Canadian Ministerial Commission  meeting here, Tello asserted that cooperation among countries  must be increased, justice among nations augmented, and  international institutions strengthened. The Mexican foreign  secretary said that Mexico and Canada have significant points of  agreement that have allowed more solid and profound bilateral  relations. Tello asserted that as the world has become more  independent, nations are intermingling more, new economic spaces  are being created, and competition for markets and positions in  the global economy is increasing. For this reason, scientific  and technological developments force firms and governments to  propose efficient solutions that acknowledge the needs of  growing competitiveness.    He emphasized that NAFTA has increased and broadened  Mexican-  Canadian interaction and has caused bilateral relations to  become significantly closer and more familiar. The foreign  secretary said the agenda of the 10th meeting, which ends this  afternoon, shows the richness of the countries' relations as it  includes issues related to commerce, finance, agriculture,  transportation, mining, forestry, fisheries, and labors.    Regarding politics, the dialogue goes beyond the bilateral  field and includes aspects related to the operations and goals  of institutions such as the United Nations, the OAS, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation mechanism.    Canadian Foreign Minister Andres Ouellet pointed out the  importance of the countries' bilateral relations based on mutual  respect and agreement on goals to bring peace and respect to  every country. He added that NAFTA has prompted great  international interest as well as curiosity in European and  Asian countries, but "for us, it is a new relationship that we  must intensify, mature, and fully experience."    He mentioned the possibility of Latin American countries  such  as Chile joining the commercial agreement and added that  countries in the hemisphere should seek wider membership.    The Canadian minister explained that the meeting will  include  issues related to the export of Canadian equipment and minerals  and tele-exploration [teledeteccion] technology, as well as  access to the market of Mexican firms such as Mexican Petroleum  and the Federal Electricity Company.    Ouellet said NAFTA increases Mexico's and Canada's prospects  for sustained economic growth and said that both governments  will respect the other's priorities regarding labor and  environmental issues.    The delegates to the 10th Ministerial Commission meeting  will  study bilateral relations and cooperation mechanisms in various  sectors of common interest.</p>

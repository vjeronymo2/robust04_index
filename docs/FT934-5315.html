			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Hungarian bank steals limelight with DM1bn offering The National Bank of Hungary had the stage to itself yesterday when it raised DM1bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds, its third DM1bn Eurobond issue this year. The bonds, via Commerzbank, were priced to yield 223 basis points over the German government's 6 per cent bund due 2003, broadly in line with the spread in the secondary market on Hungary's DM1bn issue of 10-year Eurobonds, launched in August. Syndicate managers said the pricing reflected the market's improved perception of Hungary, since last year it was paying a yield spread of more than 300 basis points over bunds. The bonds were targeted mainly at German retail investors, among whom Hungary has a wide following. However, lead manager Commerzbank said the yield pick-up on the bonds also attracted institutional demand from the Benelux countries and the UK. The bonds, which had a recommended re-offer price of 99.55, slipped to 99.10 bid in the late afternoon. Some traders blamed the fall on signs that the lead manager was selling the bonds below the recommended level. Yesterday's other notable issue was a Dollars 115m offering of four-year Eurobonds from Eurofima, the Swiss-based rolling-stock financing organisation. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate Swedish kronor. A number of borrowers are scheduled to tap the Eurobond market before it closes down for Christmas. The International Finance Corporation, which completed its Dollars 200m buy-back of old Eurobonds last week at an average spread of 14 to 15 basis points over US Treasuries, is due to launch a Dollars 500m offering of five-year Eurobonds today. The offering, via Deutsche Bank and Mitsubishi Finance, is expected to be priced to yield between 12 and 13 basis points over US Treasuries. Depfa, the German mortgage bank, is likely to raise DM1bn through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds in the next few days, via Commerzbank and Morgan Stanley. The Bank of Greece is expected to raise Dollars 500m through an issue of five-year floating rate notes later this week, via CSFB and Salomon Brothers. The notes are likely to yield between 110 and 115 basis points over Libor. The issue could be the last by the Greek central bank, on behalf of the state. From next year, the Hellenic Republic is expected to tap the international capital markets directly. The Republic of Argentina is likely to launch its offering of 10-year global bonds towards the end of next week. The deal was originally expected to raise Dollars 500m, but the amount could be raised to Dollars 750m due to the positive response from investors. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) will launch Spain's first domestic bond issue linked to a stock index on December 30, Reuters reports from Madrid. The bond yields will be linked to the IBEX-35 stock index which supports futures and options trading on the Meff exchange. The three-year issue will total Pta10bn.</p>

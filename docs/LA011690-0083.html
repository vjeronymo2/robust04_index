			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS TARGET ORANGE COUNTY'S DORNAN, PRINGLE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE STATE PARTY PLANS A MAJOR REGISTRATION DRIVE TO BREAK A GOP LOCK  ON THE AREA'S STATE AND FEDERAL SEATS.  </P> <P> State Democratic leaders said Monday that they will try to break the  Republicans' lock on Orange County's state and federal legislative seats this  year with a major registration effort aimed at Rep. Robert Dornan and  Assemblyman Curt Pringle.  </P> <P> In an agreement reached at a weekend meeting in San Diego, state Democratic  Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr. pledged to contribute $25,000 to the registration  drive and pay for a full-time staff director by March 1. He also said he will  sponsor a fund-raiser for the financially strapped county party.  </P> <P> Cathy Calfo, executive director of the state Democratic Party, said Orange  County "is crackable."  </P> <P> The Pringle and Dornan seats are attractive to Democrats because both districts  already have a Democratic edge in registration and the areas overlap, enhancing  the impact of a registration drive.  </P> <P> Also, anti-war activist and Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, whose life story is told  in the current movie "Born on the Fourth of July," is considering a challenge  to Dornan, a Garden Grove Republican.  </P> <P> Pringle, also a Garden Grove Republican, is considered vulnerable because his  1988 campaign was involved in the decision to place uniformed guards at several  polling places in predominantly Latino sections of Santa Ana. The FBI and the  district attorney's office are conducting a criminal investigation to determine  whether the move violated voters' civil rights.  </P> <P> Pringle said Monday that he has long expected the state Democratic Party to  target his seat, as it did when he narrowly won his first election in 1988.  </P> <P> "I've known they were going to come after me," he said. "I know I have a lot of  support among Democrats. It remains to be seen what the outcome will be."  </P> <P> Pringle said the Republican Party is also involved in registration efforts in  his district. While the county Democratic Party has no full-time staff, he  noted that the county Republican Party has had a full-time registration officer  and other staff for several years.  </P> <P> "What you're talking about is a Democratic Party that is absolutely dead in the  water in Orange County," Pringle said.  </P> <P> Dornan could not be reached for comment Monday.  </P> <P> The agreement to bolster the Orange County Democrats resolved a dispute between  county and state Democratic leaders over financing that has simmered for about  a year.  </P> <P> The $25,000 dedicated by the state to the registration effort should generate  about 10,000 additional Democratic voters in the district, Calfo said.  </P> <P> Currently, there are almost 89,000 Democrats and 77,000 Republicans in Dornan's  38th Congressional district. There are about 50,000 Democrats and 40,000  Republicans in Pringle's 72nd Assembly District.  </P></p>

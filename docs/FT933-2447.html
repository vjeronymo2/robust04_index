			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses end the week on a higher note OPTIONS expiry affected trading in a number of continental markets yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's rise of nearly 1.5 per cent was driven both by technical trading from the options and futures exchanges and a sharp rise in Daimler as traders covered short positions after the release of the group's interim results. A revival of the dollar also helped sustain sentiment. The DAX index closed up 26.32 at 1,881.99, for a week's rise of 1 per cent. Turnover was DM12.5bn. However, a broker at Commerzbank said that he did not expect the market to maintain the up-trend since there had been an absence of institutional funds and genuine buy orders yesterday. Daimler was the most actively traded stock, outperforming the market largely as a result of a short squeeze. The interim figures came in much in line with forecasts and the shares closed up DM19.00 or 2.7 per cent at DM721.50. PARIS saw turnover pick up after mid-session, but trading remained generally uninspired. The 1 per cent rise in the CAC-40 index was put down partly to technical factors given the absence of many fund managers. The index closed up 23.86 at 2,099.50, a week's rise of just 0.4 per cent. Turnover was around FFr3bn. St Gobain gained FFr15 to FFr572 as investors were encouraged by better than expected half year data. AMSTERDAM added ground with the CBS Tendency index gaining 0.4 to 124.0, barely changed on the week. Hoogovens rose Fl 1.20 to Fl 45.60 after announcing that it had won a French contract. Nedlloyd lost 10 cents to Fl 43.10: it announced further restructuring in Europe. ZURICH moved ahead amid renewed talk of lower interest rates but shares were unable to hold on to their best levels and the SMI index finished 10.8 higher at 2,385.2, 0.9 per cent higher on the week. Zurich Insurance put on SFr20 to SFr1,176 as it unveiled half yearly figures that were at the top end of expectations and forecast higher 1993 profits. Bearer shares of SMH, the watchmaker, continued under pressure, losing SFr32 to SFr1,045 with investors awaiting an announcement on the future of the Swatchmobile ecological car project. Saurer, the textile machinery and technology group, tumbled SFr90 to SFr2,290 in spite of its announcement of favourable 1993 first-half figures. MILAN picked itself up after Thursday's fall as domestic investors returned and the Mibtel index rose 50 to 10,350. The Comit index was unavailable yesterday. The prospect of further rights issues remained a worry. Italmobiliare shed L1,495 or 3.6 per cent to L39,805 in further response to its plans. Fiat dipped L78 to L5,897 but Snia, the chemicals and synthetic fibres subsidiary, rose L39 or 3.2 per cent to L1,256 in response to better than expected first half results. Ferruzzi traded limit down for the sixth successive session, the share shedding L29.75 or 10 per cent to L265. Sme, the foods group and privatisation candidate, shed L49 to L4,141, after reports that bids for its Autogrill restaurant chain and GS supermarkets had been rejected as unsatisfactory. STOCKHOLM was slightly firmer as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 1.1 to 1,264.6 with the shipping sector showing the day's biggest advance. Stena gained SKr3.50 to SKr47.50. BRUSSELS turned lower in heavy trading after a session dominated by basket trading linked to the expiry of September options contracts. The Bel-20 index finished 6.35 lower at 1,301.66, although 1.5 per cent higher on the week. Glaverbel, the glass maker, surged BFr110 to BFr3,750 ahead of its first-half earnings publication, which showed a BFr1.78bn group net loss.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 17 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1263.72  1264.39   1264.73  1266.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1342.63  1341.88   1343.08  1345.16                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1268.34  1266.72   1264.44  1265.02 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1346.78  1346.43   1342.07  1343.60  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 16    Sep 15    Sep 14    Sep 13    Sep 10 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1257.07   1260.47   1279.94   1276.64   1263.72 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1335.87   1337.35   1357.12   1351.64   1355.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1268.60; 200 - 1348.88 Low/day: 100 - 1263.49 200 - 1339.38.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Redundancy costs cut Alvis to Pounds 1.1m and final is lowered ALVIS, the defence contractor, yesterday reported a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.83m to Pounds 1.13m for the year ended September 30 1992. The final dividend is cut from 1.7p to 0.5p. The company, formerly United Scientific Holdings, said redundancy and restructuring costs at its Coventry plant were mainly responsible for the drop in profits. Alvis announced in October that it was cutting 230 jobs from a total of 750 at its Alvis Industries factory, mainly because of a drop in demand from the Ministry of Defence for armoured vehicles and spares. The company took an exceptional charge of Pounds 4.95m and also wrote down by Pounds 2.5m the value of stock carried forward from previous years. Sales fell from Pounds 114.2m to Pounds 92.4m in 1991-92. The group said its profit before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 6.4m was 29 per higher. The group said its electro-optical companies increased combined pre-tax profits by 49 per cent and ended the year with a larger combined order book. Alvis Industries, which now includes Self-Changing Gears (SCG) and United Scientific Industries, barely broke even at the operating level, compared with operating profits of Pounds 5m last time. The group said this was because of lower MoD orders, reduced margins, the stock write-down and operational problems, which followed the relocation of the SCG business to the Coventry site. Losses per share amounted to 5.5p, compared with 0.3p last time. The reduced final leaves a total for the year of 1p (2.2p). COMMENT Different name - same old problems. Life is not easy if the Ministry of Defence is your biggest single customer, as these figures amply testify. Nevertheless, the shares advanced 5p to close at 19p, suggesting that the market had overdone the gloom in marking Alvis down from 62p in February. That sort of slide suggests a company which is about to go bust, and there are no such signs at Alvis - even if the road to recovery remains long and winding. The electro-optical businesses are sound and the problems at Coventry are being addressed, although the order outlook is uncertain. A market value of only Pounds 10.6m might attract a predator - and a spell of solid trading could see the shares bounce back - but even speculators should be able to find less troubled sectors to fish in.</p>

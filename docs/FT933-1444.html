			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / EC hears calls for cuts in real wages THE level of wage increases in Europe, as well as social security costs, needs to be brought down across the Community, according to a majority of EC employment ministers, meeting in Bruges yesterday, writes David Gardner in Bruges. But most also argued that EC social legislation and the European welfare model could not be ditched in the fight against unemployment. The meeting, convened to discuss proposals on jobs and competitiveness the European Commission has been asked to prepare for December's EC summit in Brussels, heard vigorous calls for real wages to be cut or frozen. 'Wage increases have to be less than the inflation rate,' said Mr Jose Antonio Grinan, labour minister in Spain's Socialist government. Senior Dutch officials told the meeting that the Netherlands' Christian Democrat-Labour coalition would decree 'a legal wage freeze' next year if both sides of industry could not agree to limit increases. 'I see a sea-change in the whole tone of the debate,' Mr Michael Forsyth, UK employment minister, said afterwards. On non-wage costs, one British official at the meeting noted that 'all member states are now talking about reducing social security costs, and that is clearly new'. However, Ms Miet Smet, Belgian president of the meeting, and Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC commissioner for social affairs, reaffirmed their intention to push ahead with controversial social legislation long stuck in the EC pipeline largely because of British opposition.</p>

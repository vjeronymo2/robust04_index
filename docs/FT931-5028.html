			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Compaq's US cuts may spark PC price war COMPAQ COMPUTER yesterday cut the prices of its personal computers and printers in the US by up to 20 per cent, sparking fears of a price war which could put smaller PC suppliers out of business. Compaq is now considering whether to make corresponding cuts in Europe. If it does, the effect on Europe's leading suppliers including Viglen of the UK, Vobis of Germany and IPC of France could be dramatic. 'This year is going to see one of the biggest bloodbaths in the history of the industry,' Mr Ronald Skates, chief executive of US-based Data General, said yesterday. PC prices have fallen by up to 40 per cent a year on average for the past two years. Analysts in the US expect a further fall of about 25 per cent this year. The prospect of a further price war is good news for customers. US buyers now expect to be able to buy a PC with Intel's fastest chip, 4m bytes of fast memory and a 120m byte hard disc for less than Dollars 1,000. Only five years ago, a less advanced system would have cost in excess of Dollars 5,000. The UK, however, is something of a special case because of the devaluation of the pound. Some suppliers argue that the UK price war is over and that prices must rise. Elonex, for example, a leading supplier, raised its prices by Pounds 50 a machine last month. Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad, another leading UK supplier, warned recently that the prices at which PCs could be obtained today were unlikely to be repeated. Worldwide, the principal beneficiaries of this latest round of price cutting are likely to be the aristocrats of the industry, Compaq and International Business Machines. Both have introduced new ranges aimed specifically at the low end of the market where gross profit margins are thin to the point of invisibility. According to one UK-based manufacturer, the average gross profit margin on a low-end computer is now between 15 and 20 per cent, compared with 40 per cent in earlier years. Most suppliers expect another tough year before prices stabilise and profits return. IBM's search for leader, Page 19</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Skandia suspends annual dividend SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurance group, is suspending its dividend for the first time, after a fall in its net asset value for the third successive year. The group said yesterday that its net asset value at December 31, 1992 was estimated at SKr11.5bn (Dollars 1.6bn), down 20 per cent from SKr14.4bn the previous year, and down nearly 42 per cent from SKr19.7bn in 1989. Skandia has paid a dividend every year since it was founded in 1855, with the 1991 payout totalling SKr4 per share. The company yesterday declined to comment on its dividend policy. The group's shares fell SKr8 to SKr109 yesterday. Skandia said a sharp fall in the value of its Swedish and foreign real estate portfolios was one of the main reasons for the decline in net asset value last year. It blamed losses associated with its 48 per cent stake in Svenska Kredit and its 26 per cent holding in International Credit, two credit insurance operations which collapsed during 1992. A final factor was the impact of hurricane Andrew in the US, which pushed up claims costs and led to a sharp deterioration in the group's international insurance result. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, the chief executive, said the group would continue with its reorganisation strategy, which has seen it disclose plans to halve its international non-life reinsurance operations over two years. He said it planned a further concentration of its international business operations, but did not elaborate. 'The reorganisation which we are now in the process of implementing, coupled with falling interest rates makes me believe that we have the possibility to achieve growth once again in the net asset value of the shareholder operations in 1993,' Mr Wolrath said. He added that the group's Nordic operations were continuing to perform well and lower interest rates and rising share prices were improving the returns of the Swedish Skandia Life activities. Skandia will announce its preliminary result on March 18. In the first half of 1992, the group's management operating result was a SKr636m loss.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVANCY SWAPS CONTROL FOR SUPPORT;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: AGENCY AGREES TO UNUSUAL RESTRICTIONS TO GET SUPERVISORS TO PUT  PARKS BOND MEASURE ON BALLOT.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has made unusual compromises with the  Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors that sharply limit what land it could  buy using bond proceeds.  </P> <P> The conservancy, a state agency that buys land for public parks in the Santa  Monica Mountains and other nearby ranges, agreed to the compromises in a  last-ditch effort to persuade supervisors to place the proposed $816-million  bond issue on the Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> One compromise grants supervisors veto power over certain conservancy land  purchases; another guarantees that the conservancy will not compete with the  County Sanitation Districts for landfill sites in mountain canyons.  </P> <P> The bond measure -- thought to be the largest in county history -- would  generate funds for a wide array of projects, from restoring beaches and public  gardens to removing graffiti in inner-city neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The measure is backed by an odd-bedfellows coalition ranging from Sierra Club  members to anti-gang activists. Millions of dollars from the bonds are  earmarked for gang-prevention projects such as building Outward Bound-style  wilderness camps.  </P> <P> The supervisors Tuesday postponed a scheduled vote on whether to place the bond  issue on the ballot. They must decide by next Tuesday in order to meet the  legal deadline for November ballot issues.  </P> <P> At least three supervisors -- Mike Antonovich, Ed Edelman and Kenneth Hahn --  support it, their spokesmen said. Supervisor Pete Schabarum is opposed.  Supervisor Deane Dana, who pushed the conservancy for the compromises, remains  undecided.  </P> <P> Conservancy officials and other backers hope to get as many supervisors as  possible behind the bond issue, which requires approval by two-thirds of the  voters in November. Recent bond issues, statewide and in other counties, have  passed by margins only slightly above 66%, and proponents of the Los Angeles  County measure worry that opposition by powerful supervisors could damage its  chances.  </P> <P> The conservancy infuriated some county officials recently by maneuvering to  keep county sanitation officials from purchasing mountain canyons for garbage  dumps. In December, the agency bought 145 acres of land at the mouth of Towsley  Canyon near Santa Clarita, effectively blocking truck access from the Golden  State Freeway.  </P> <P> In intense negotiations with supervisors in recent weeks, the conservancy  agreed not to use any of the $80 million it would get from the bonds to buy  land identified by the county for potential dump sites.  </P> <P> The parks agency also agreed not to buy property astride access routes to such  areas.  </P> <P> Conservancy officials further agreed to give supervisors veto power over  conservancy efforts to buy land in unincorporated county areas using bond  proceeds -- a move conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston called "an  unprecedented compromise for a state agency."  </P> <P> "What do we do? We're at the mercy of the Board of Supervisors. . . . If they  don't put it on the ballot, it doesn't get on the ballot," Edmiston said.  </P> <P> He said the compromises give county waste-disposal officials a "big strategic  window of opportunity" to buy potential landfill sites in canyons that the  conservancy might otherwise try to acquire.  </P> <P> Provided it passes in November, the bond measure nonetheless would provide a  huge windfall to financially strapped public agencies seeking funds to  rehabilitate local parks, beaches, museums and other recreation-related  facilities.  </P> <P> For example, the county would receive $332 million for projects ranging from  restoring trout streams to improving the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  Cities would receive $243 million to use for specific projects such as  acquiring wildlife habitats, building sports complexes and improving beaches.  </P> <P> The bond measure also represents a bonanza for the cash-strapped conservancy,  which would receive $80 million directly and be eligible for another $35  million.  </P> <P> The idea for the bonds was originated by Esther Feldman, who works for an arm  of the conservancy that provides park services in Los Angeles and Ventura  counties. Feldman also helped run the successful 1988 campaign for Proposition  70, a statewide bond issue that generated $776 million for parkland.  </P> <P> Feldman said the measure has been endorsed by 47 of the county's 86 cities,  including Los Angeles. It is also endorsed by local Sierra Club chapters, the  League of Women Voters and dozens of other groups.  </P> <P> However, several cities oppose the measure, arguing that they would pay more to  amortize the bonds than they would receive in bond revenues.  </P> <P> James B. Hendrickson, city manager of Palos Verdes Estates, said that according  to his calculations, only nine cities in the county would get more than they  would pay, even without including interest costs on the bonds.  </P> <P> Although the cities would receive $348 million in bond revenues, they would pay  $744 million in bond principal alone, he said.  </P> <P> Hendrickson said that he "can't get straight figures" from the conservancy  about how much property taxes would have to be raised to repay the bonds and  that he doesn't believe that backers have thoroughly analyzed the bonds' true  costs.  </P> <P> Feldman said Hendrickson's complaint that only a few cities would get more than  they pay is "highly misleading" because it doesn't take into account benefits  that residents will enjoy from improvements in regional facilities such as  beaches.  </P> <P> "We all go to the beaches, regardless of what city we're in," she said. "To  assume that the $50 million going to the county for beaches doesn't benefit you  because the beach isn't in your city is ludicrous."  </P> <P> Feldman said the bonds would cost the average property taxpayer an extra $8.50  annually over the bonds' 20-year amortization period. She said different tax  rates she gave out earlier this year were based on "a couple of assumptions  which now have changed," including different interest rate projections.  </P> <P> She said the figure for the tax rate increase was drawn up by a Los Angeles  investment banker who favors the bond issue and who volunteered his time.  </P> <P> Hendrickson said the county should not be issuing bonds for parks when it has  so many other pressing funding needs, such as providing shelter to the homeless  and improving County-USC Medical Center, which recently was placed on  conditional accreditation.  </P> <P> But, Feldman said, enhancing parks, beaches and other recreational facilities  is a vital concern to many residents worried about increasing urbanization and  a deteriorating quality of life in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Schabarum said he opposes the parks bond issue because it is  only one of five property- or sales-tax increases that could be on the November  ballot. Schabarum said the measures will not only raise taxes but add to the  county's bond debt.  </P> <P> Feldman countered that the county is in good financial health and can easily  afford the park bonds. She said debt payments represent less than 2% of the  county's budget, well below the 5% limit recommended by Standard &amp; Poor's,  a nationwide credit-rating agency.  </P></p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Media Futures: The man who would be king of pay-tv - Martin Dickson talks to the still innovative but now less abrasive chairman of Home Box Office Michael Fuchs, the ebullient, irreverent chairman of Home Box Office, the US pay-television company, could never be accused of false modesty. 'I consider us to be the McDonald's sign on the side of the information highway,' he declares. 'We are a king brand.' He speaks with considerable authority: HBO, 21-years-old this year, is not only the oldest pay-television service in America, born at the dawn of the cable television era, but it is also the biggest, with operating profits last year of Dollars 230m (Pounds 148m) on revenues of Dollars 1.4bn. A subsidiary of Time Warner, the world's largest entertainment group, HBO's profits have grown by 9 per cent a year on average during the past seven years and this month (July) it reported record earnings of Dollars 128m for the first half of 1994, up 14 per cent. Its main channel transmits a mixture of feature films and sports, documentaries, comedy and music shows to 18m US subscribers, by means of cable systems and satellite. Last year, it garnered more of the television industry's prestige prime-time Emmy awards than any of the big three traditional broadcast networks - NBC, ABC and CBS. Its winners included the made-for-tv films 'Barbarians at the Gate', which deals with the epic takeover battle for RJR Nabisco, and the wonderfully named 'The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom'. A second channel, Cinemax, is devoted entirely to movies and reaches 7m customers. But does the current turmoil in the US communications industry pose a threat to HBO? After all, the cable television industry is fairly mature; and in the coming era of inter-active, multi-media entertainment, viewers will be able to choose from a vast number of viewing choices, including movies-on-demand. On the contrary, insists Fuchs, 'we are feeling right now more optimistic about our business over the next five years than I have felt at any other moment over the 10 years I have been (in charge) here'. He admits that after about the year 2000 his crystal ball gets foggy. Fuchs acknowledges that the US basic cable industry - where subscribers pay a fixed fee to a cable service company for a cocktail of channels, mostly advertiser-supported - is fairly mature, reaching about 60m US homes. But he says there is plenty of room for growth at pay channels like HBO, which are not supported by advertising and which viewers pay a special additional fee to receive. Analysts also point out that cable service companies, which recently had basic cable rates cut by regulators, are now likely to emphasise marketing pay channels to customers. The company is also stepping onto the international stage, which will absorb cash in the short run, but which has greater long term growth potential than the US. 'Don't have the misconception that Rupert Murdoch is going to own Asia, because he's not', says Fuchs, who also has designs om Europe and Latin America. In the US, HBO added 1m subscribers last year, an increase of about 4 per cent, thanks to the strength of its programming, powerful marketing (a Dollars 150m a year warchest) and pioneering innovations like 'multiplexing'  -rebroadcasting its programmes on different time schedules. 'The biggest complaint we have had from the first day of this business is 'it's not on when I want it.' So we are configuring HBO so people can have eight bites of the apple instead of one,' Fuchs says. He also maintains that well established television brands are not going to simply disappear with the advent of inter-active television, although some smaller players may be squeezed. Several analysts agree, and a few bold ones even suggest that HBO may be the prototype channel of tomorrow, unencumbered by programme advertising breaks, and supported solely by the subscriptions of the people who wish to watch it. 'The basic cable channels are nervous about a la carte,' Fuchs says. 'We don't know anything but a la carte." Any television channel ultimately stands or falls by the quality of its programming, and it is here that Mr Fuchs has proved himself an important innovator. HBO, which began as a movie and sports channel, but was very adversely affected by the advent of the video cassette recorder in the 1980s, has developed a reputation for the kind of sophisticated, cutting edge, and socially conscious programming which the big three broadcasting networks often shy away from - for fear of offending viewers or advertisers. It also keeps very tight control of costs. A native of New York, where HBO is headquartered, Fuchs, 48, was an entertainment lawyer before joining HB0 as a programmer in 1976. He became president in 1984 and acquired a reputation for abrasiveness, particularly during negotiations with Hollywood production companies. The image was accentuated in 1989 when Time, HBO's parent, merged with Warner Communications. Fuchs clashed repeatedly with executives at the Warner Brothers film studio about his plans, bitterly opposed by Warner, to make films for release in cinemas. Fuchs lost the battle and bitter feelings between the two sides lingered, making a mockery of claims that the Time Warner merger would produce great synergy. 'There wasn't a lot of sportsmanship and team playing, but we've gotten through that,' admits Fuchs, who insists the two are working well together in developing international markets. 'We wouldn't be in the foreign business without Warner Brothers.' Fuchs seems a mellower individual generally. After avoiding the press for years, he has suddenly made himself available for interviews. Some suspect this is a diplomatic offensive to improve his chances of succeeding Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman. Others say he simply has a lot to shout about.</p>

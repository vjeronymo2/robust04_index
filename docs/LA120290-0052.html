			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> FEE FOR FALSE FIRE ALARMS  </P> <P> Hoping to reduce a spate of false fire and burglar alarms, the city will begin  charging residents and businesses $50 if their alarm is accidentally activated  more than three times in the same year.  </P> <P> The penalty, approved by the City Council last week, will take effect Jan. 6.  The Department of Public Safety reported that in a 12-month period that ended  in May, 98% of the city's 2,947 alarm-generated emergencies were false calls.  </P> <P> The ordinance also limits the duration of an alarm to 15 minutes and prohibits  alarm systems that sound like emergency vehicle sirens or civil defense  warnings.  </P></p>

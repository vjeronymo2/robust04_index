			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, may 12 (XINHUA) -- China has contributed  to the history of bridge construction worldwide by building the  Yangpu Bridge in Shanghai with the biggest span of all  cable-stayed bridges in the world.    Holger Svensson, a renowned bridge expert from Germany, made  this remark here yesterday while visiting the Yangpu Bridge  together with some 100 other bridge engineers from 19 countries  and regions. These experts are attending the 1994 International  Symposium on Cable-Stayed Bridges here.    He praised the design of the Yangpu Bridge, with a span of  602 m [meters], as "first-rate", its welding techniques as  "perfect" and its structure as "excellent".    Walter Podolney, a structural engineer with the U.S. Federal  Highway Administration, said that the erection of the Yangpu  Bridge across the Huangpu River is not only a matter of pride  for the entire Chinese people, but also for mankind in  conquering rivers.    He added that so far the bridge still has the biggest span  of  any cable-stayed bridge in the world.    However, cable-stayed bridges with even bigger spans are  being built in France and Japan. "So, there is no limit to the  progress made by mankind," he noted.    Dr. Man Chung Tang, a professor at Columbia University and  chairman of DRC Consultants Inc. of the United States, revealed  that a cable-stayed bridge with a span of 865 m in Normandy,  France, is scheduled for completion later this year.    Another cable-stayed bridge, with a span of 890 m, in Japan  is set for completion in 1997, said Man, who helped the Asian  Development Bank examine all data concerning the Yangpu Bridge  in 1991. The bridge was built with a loan from the bank.    The bridge in France is a concrete bridge, while the bridge  in Japan is a steel one, he said.    But the Yangpu Bridge is a concrete and steel composite  girder bridge, he said, noting that it is different from the  above two bridges in terms of structure.    Lin Yuanpei, chief architect of the Yangpu Bridge,  accompanied the foreign guests on their visit to the bridge.    Lin said that the erection of the Yangpu Bridge is  inseparable from contributions from foreign bridge experts.    "Yes, it belongs to China and yet it is a crystallization of  mankind's engineering progress," he said.</p>

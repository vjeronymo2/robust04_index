			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Timetable of Bond Issues; Government </F> Bonds for 250 Billion Forints"]    [Text] According to the budget passed by parliament, this  year the budget deficit is expected to be 329.56 billion forints  [Ft]. The demand for financing is less than that, and the  Finance Ministry wants to come up with the necessary money  primarily by issuing government bonds. As the Hungarian News  Agency [MTI] reports, starting in March, each month new  government bonds in the value of Ft15-25 billion will be issued.  The issue will generally take place in the first week of each  month. As a result, this year public government bonds will be  issued in the value of Ft250 billion. The law allows the issue  of Ft300 billion.    Of this amount, Ft69.2 billion will be used to service  credits and to renew government bonds that are due to expire.  Thus, the issue of medium and long-term bonds in order to  finance the deficit will amount to Ft180 billion. Starting in  April, foreigners will also be eligible to buy government bonds,  for forints.    The issue of treasury bonds will continue according to the  previously established system. The sale of interest-bearing  treasury bonds will take place in the third week of each month,  after a week-long registration period, and the amount issued  will depend on the demand. Treasury bonds to the population will  continue to be sold by designated branch offices of the National  Savings Bank [OTP] and the Budapest Bank. Issue will be  determined by demand in this case, as well. Every Wednesday an  auction of 30-day discount treasury bonds will be held, at which  the advertised amount is expected to be Ft6-10 billion. Every  other Tuesday, an auction of 90-day discount treasury bonds is  planned, where the advertised amount will be Ft8-10 billion. On  the last Thursday of each month, an auction of 180-day discount  treasury bonds will be held, at which bonds will be offered in  the value of Ft10-15 billion. Finally, every other month, on the  last Friday of the given month, an auction of 360-day discount  treasury bonds will be held, where Ft15 billion will be offered.</p>

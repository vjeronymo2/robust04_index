			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> NEWS NOTES: The syndicated TV show "Smash Hits" bows Sept. 23 with a  sweepstakes promotion in which a viewer will win a "rock 'n' roll prize  package." And they're not just talking about Joan Jett's key chain and Tom  Petty's cigarette lighter. The package consists of a bass autographed by Paul  McCartney, keyboards autographed by Elton John, a guitar signed by Jon Bon  Jovi, and drums inscribed by Phil Collins. The winner will be announced early  next month. The half-hour show, which will air on KNBC-TV in Los Angeles on  Saturdays at 2:30 p.m., will be hosted by deejay Scott Shannon.  </P> <P> Michael and Janet Jackson aren't the only members of that famous family with  albums slated for release before Christmas. Jermaine is expected Oct. 3 with  "Don't Take It Personal," Randy is due Oct. 17 with "Randy and the Gypsies,"  and Marlon weighs in Nov. 7 with "Marlon Jackson." LaToya Jackson, meanwhile,  who bared herself earlier this year in the pages of Playboy magazine, is  seeking to capitalize on the association. Her new album -- which has been  released only in Europe -- features songs titled "Bad Girl" and "Playboy."  </P> <P> Belinda Carlisle's upcoming album, "Runaway Horses," will contain a flyer  promoting two charities: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Earth  Communication Office, which works to raise awareness of the Greenhouse Effect.  . . . PolyGram Records obviously expected "Great Balls of Fire," the recent  film biography of Jerry Lee Lewis, to be a hit. The company is releasing three  (count 'em) double album sets titled "The Killer," collecting Lewis' work from  1963 to 1977. Avoid the rush: Eurythmics have already filmed four videos to  support songs from their upcoming "We Too Are One" album. . . . The upcoming  feature film "Rising Storm" will be dedicated to Tom Donahue and other pioneers  of free-form FM radio in the '60s. The film, due in January, concerns a  futuristic America ruled by a dictatorial televangelist. . . . MTV nixed the  original version of Aerosmith's "Love in an Elevator" video, which showed side  and rear views of a topless woman, but is airing a compromise version with  black "censored" bars over the racier scenes.  </P></p>

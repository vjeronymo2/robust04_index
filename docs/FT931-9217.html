			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Guinness saga ends as Ward is cleared of theft the first of several recent scandals to traumatise the City - finally came to an end yesterday with the acquittal of Mr Thomas Ward. Mr Ward, the US lawyer who advised the company on its 1986 takeover of Distillers, was found not guilty of the theft of Pounds 5.2m at London's Old Bailey. In stark contrast to the highly public spectacle of the first Guinness trial, which left an indelible imprint on City attitudes and behaviour, nobody was in the public gallery and just a handful of reporters were present. After Mr Ward's five-week trial, the jury took six and a half hours to reach a unanimous verdict of not guilty. Mr Ward, standing in the dock, called across the courtroom to the jury: 'Thank God - thank you all.' He criticised his prosecution as 'misconceived' and insisted he had no regrets about his role in the infamous takeover. 'I regret what has happened, but I don't regret the contribution I made to Guinness,' he said, adding that he intended to resume his career as a corporate lawyer in the US. For the Serious Fraud Office, the verdict marks a disappointing end to its series of prosecutions over the Guinness affair, which was its first major challenge. The first trial resulted in the jailing of Mr Ernest Saunders, the company's former chief executive, Mr Gerald Ronson, the Heron chairman, and the stockbroker Mr Anthony Parnes. Mr Jack Lyons, the financier, was fined Pounds 3m. Mr Ward, however, is the only defendant in the Guinness trials to be acquitted by a jury. The second trial - of Mr Roger Seelig and Lord Spens - collapsed before a verdict could be reached. During the Ward trial, the prosecution had alleged that Mr Ward had stolen the Pounds 5.2m from Guinness in a joint enterprise with Mr Saunders. The Pounds 3m Mr Ward later deposited into Mr Saunders' Swiss bank account was the former Guinness chief executive's share of the spoils, the prosecution alleged. However, lawyers for Mr Ward argued that the payment was a US-style 'success fee' for his work in reversing the bid's referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and in obtaining the prior agreement of Distillers to meet Guinness's costs for the takeover. The Pounds 3m transferred to Mr Saunders' account - a central theme in Mr Saunders' own trial - belonged to Mr Ward, they insisted. The US lawyer had placed the money there to meet his tax bills, they argued. After yesterday's verdict, the trial judge, Mr Justice Turner told the jury: 'In my respectful opinion, you have done as much as any jury could in this case.' They would be excused serving on a jury again for 10 years, he told them. The judge said he would use today's hearing to decide costs issues and to make some further comments about the handling of complex fraud trials.

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Major steps up pressure over treaty vote MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday refused to countenance defeat in this week's crucial House of Commons vote on the Maastricht treaty's social chapter as he stepped up pressure on Conservative Euro-sceptics to fall into line. Entering the most difficult week of his premiership, the prime minister repeatedly expressed incredulity that any Tory MP would vote for proposals that he said would raise unemployment and transfer 'massive' powers from the UK to Brussels. 'I don't believe - given the nature of the social chapter - that Conservative MPs, when they consider what it means and what it can do, are going to do other than support the government,' Mr Major said. Interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record, the prime minister was adamant that Thursday's vote was not about ratifying the treaty or his own political future. 'Here is a free-standing debate on the social chapter,' he said, four times sidestepping the suggestion it would amount to a vote of confidence in him. But some Euro-sceptics immediately rejected this position and called for the government to make it clear whether it intended to ratify Maastricht with Britain's social chapter opt-out intact irrespective of the outcome of Thursday's vote. 'At the present time we have to vote on hypotheticals because we do not know if by voting for the social chapter we destroy the treaty or not,' said one hard-core Euro-sceptic. 'This is not at all about the social chapter - it is about whether or not the treaty proceeds,' said another Euro-sceptic. As senior ministers said privately it was 'inconceivable' the government would not ratify Maastricht, the prime minister dismissed as 'not remotely likely' suggestions his current problems might trigger a leadership challenge. He admitted recent moves to seek a judicial review of Maastricht in the High Court might 'inhibit' ratification. Some Euro-sceptics were yesterday confident there are enough Tory rebels to defeat the government if none of the opposition parties break ranks. The government is expected to wait until Wednesday before deciding whether to increase efforts to persuade the Ulster Unionists to vote with the government, perhaps by hinting that their longstanding demand for a Northern Ireland select committee will be granted. One Unionist said yesterday the party's nine MPs planned to decide how they would vote at a meeting on Thursday morning. Meanwhile, Mr John Smith yesterday raised expectations Labour would press for a vote of censure if the government lost Thursday's vote and ignored the verdict. 'If he (Mr Major) behaves outrageously and defies the will of parliament that is a matter we must take extremely seriously,' the Labour leader said. His remarks came as an NOP poll for the Trades Union Congress found 44 per cent of respondents thought the social chapter should apply to Britain as well as other European countries, with 10 per cent neutral and 15 per cent answering Don't Know.

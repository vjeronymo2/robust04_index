			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden -- AKHBAR AL-USBU' has learned that the  security organs in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in Aden have  arrested a number of Jordanians and prevented Jordanian families  from leaving Aden for Jordan, under the pretext that Jordan is  participating in the war at the side of President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih. It has also been learned that Jordan is holding  intensive contacts through other parties to release the  Jordanian nationals held as hostages.    Legal Jordanian sources said: What Aden has done is strange  and a violation of international law. The sources added that the  Jordanians are defenseless and have not participated in the war.  Consequently, the sources said, the safety of the Jordanian  nationals is the responsibility of the authorities in the south  who should not restrict the movement of or arrest those  Jordanians.</p>

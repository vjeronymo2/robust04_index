			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Observer: Bush telegraph George Bush is not exactly on a winning streak at the moment. But if he continues to get things wrong he might serve as a useful negative index for economic pundits. On Monday he gave a speech to America's house-builders and praised them for leading the economy out of recession. Yesterday morning it was announced new home sales had dropped alarmingly in April. His next speaking engagement, later yesterday, was to the association of retailers. It would be advisable, therefore, to watch the next retail sales report on June 11.</p>

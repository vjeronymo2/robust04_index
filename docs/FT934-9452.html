			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (1): Reform awaits its reward - President Salinas denies he has overemphasised the North American Free Trade Agreement, although he is depending on its passage. But Nafta is no panacea for the economy PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas would probably have wanted it another way. As he ends the fifth year of his six in office, the Mexican economy is showing only sluggish growth and his efforts to secure a free trade agreement with US and Canada depend precariously on the US Congress. The North American Free Trade Agreement, which was to guarantee continuity in economic policy and thereby cement Mexico's stability, has so far only succeeded in creating uncertainty. The treaty has been identified with the president so profoundly that its loss would be a severe personal blow. 'President Salinas bet the store on Nafta,' says Mr Jorge Castaneda, an academic and a critic of the government, writing in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, 'and if passage is his triumph, rejection or delay is his defeat.' But just as Nafta's passage would be no panacea for Mexico's economic ills, its collapse - while significant - would not necessarily be disastrous. Good macroeconomic management - a hallmark of the Salinas presidency - has lowered the budget deficit and inflation and increased foreign exchange reserves, all of which should cushion the economy from the worst of the shocks. If Nafta does fail, however, prospects for growth will be diminished in the short and medium terms. Interest rates would probably have to rise - hurting growth - to ensure that capital flows stayed intact in the immediate aftermath of a defeat. In the medium term, foreign direct investment and other flows would likely be lower, suggesting a slower growth track. Government officials say their immediate reaction to Nafta's failure would be to allow interest rates to take the strain, and that they are contemplating no devaluation to speed up growth. Still, big speculative outflows could endanger this outcome and in any case no government advertises devaluations in advance. Mr Salinas denies that he has overemphasised Nafta and says his administration's other reforms show it is 'not the only thing going on in Mexico'. Apart from the agreement with the US, Mexico is also negotiating trade pacts in other parts of the world and expects next year to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. If Nafta fails, Mr Salinas says, however, that the chances of another agreement 'would be out for several generations'. After more than three years of negotiations, and following the uncertainty over the treaty generated by the US recession and the change in administration, he adds: 'We have learned that the worst moment to negotiate a trade agreement is during a recession and an election.' The treaty's defeat would affect next year's presidential campaign. Slower growth would weaken the government by leaving in doubt the overall success of its economic policies. Meanwhile, a nationalist backlash could well hurt relations with the US and put pressure on the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has held power for more than six decades. While the PRI will continue to have significant advantages over the opposition in the elections, its ability to rig the vote has been constrained - some political observers say to an important extent - by electoral reforms pushed through in the Salinas presidency. 'With the new rules for the election, it makes a different range of scenarios possible from those we have seen in the past. I don't believe it will be possible to manufacture elections as in the past. It's not a perfect reform but if it applies next year, it does imply clean elections,' says Mr Federico Estevez of ITAM, a private university in Mexico City. Not everybody agrees: the left-wing opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) has criticised the reform, calling attention to the predominance of PRI officials on the supposedly independent electoral commissions running the ballot at federal and state level. Its candidate Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas describes the changes as 'a backward step'. With the right-wing PAN opposition not viewed as having a strong presidential contender for 1994, the anti-government protest vote is likely to coalesce around Mr Cardenas. This suggests that the elections will again be criticised, after the fact, as fraudulent by the opposition. The closer the result is - and it is widely assumed that Nafta's rejection will aid the opposition - the more these complaints would resonate. This would again raise questions - as they were raised by Mr Salinas's victory in 1988 - about the legitimacy of the administration. 'For a democratic election to occur, all major parties in a country must accept the process and respect the results,' said a report from the Carter Centre of former US President Jimmy Carter last month. 'Mexico has not yet reached the point where that is the case.' Thus, in a continent of elected governments, Mexico's continues to be coloured by allegations of electoral fraud and authoritarianism. The uncertainty generated by the election - even when most people assume they know who will win - indicates not the strength of its authoritarian system but its weakness. The power of the Mexican executive was also once commonly seen as a help in pushing through unpopular economic reforms in the early stage of the reform process. If that were ever the case, there is increasing doubt about it now. Some economists in Mexico are beginning to see the power of the executive as an obstacle to further development. In a number of areas, flaws that stem from the autocratic nature of Mexican government are seen as having important economic consequences. The fact that the judiciary is subordinate to the executive underlines the weakness of the rule of law, and reinforces the discretionary and arbitrary nature of judicial decision-making. This not only increases cynicism about the legal system, it makes problematic the enforcement of contracts in Mexican courts. Furthermore, it means there is no guarantee that intell-ectually-sound, well-drafted laws - for example, that on competition policy which came into force this year - will ever be executed in practice, or that those with friends in high places will not be able to circumvent them. The next stage of development 'has to do with creating a proper legal system, developing the accountability of government and making it possible for small companies to prosper', says Mr Luis Rubio, head of a development research group in Mexico City. The importance of a functioning legal system as a countervailing influence to government has not been diminished by the Salinas administration reforms which have reduced the size of the state. Privatisations have enabled the government to lower its budget deficit to tackle inflation and have helped it to finance a more effective anti-poverty programme, but they have not spread economic power. 'I'm concerned about the creation of new vested interests, a new oligarchy,' says Mr Rubio. Furthermore, partly because the judicial system does not have a role in calling government servants to account, corruption in government remains an important issue, and not one merely restricted to its lower echelons. When an agent acting for IBM claimed this year that he was asked for a bribe to secure an air traffic control contract, his allegations were never proved but he was widely believed. Some senior government officials believe strongly that the weakness of the legal system is an important economic problem that will have to be addressed by the next administration. Meanwhile, the government has begun to address other economic constraints. For example, bank privatisation does not seem to have ensured full competition in the banking system, even though there are 18 banks. The high cost of credit is one of the main constraints to the development of small- and medium-sized business. The government has started to attack this - in part by increasing competition from banks outside Mexico  -but nobody believes a solution will be rapid. Furthermore, while efforts to deregulate at a federal level have been impressive, there has been much less change in state and municipal dereg-ulation. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, trade and industrial development minister, says: 'We have been successful at the federal government level, but have a lot to do at the state level. At the local level we have not been that successful.' Other officials see the labour law and the social security legislation as in dire need of change. 'The social security system is the time bomb for the next administration,' said one senior official. The incomplete nature of reform at a microeconomic level is often offered as an explanation of why growth has not been faster: growth of less than 2 per cent will generate this year a current account deficit of Dollars 20bn, 6 per cent of GDP. A further explanation for slow growth - not necessarily contradictory - is that the government and the private sector underestimated the inefficiency of the economy before the it was opened to the outside world. This has rendered the existing capital stock obsolete far more quickly than expected: growing against this backdrop is rather like rowing against the current. Yet mounting evidence of increased productivity suggests reform has not been in vain. Mr Salinas said this month that labour productivity had increased by 19 per cent in the last three years. Yet, with or without Nafta, Mexico is still likely to remain dependent on foreign capital for some time to come. In reality, this leaves little room for manoeuvre in macro-economic policy for any future government. 'On the economy, there is little that they can tinker with because the markets will react the minute they perceive that reform is threatened. The Mexican economy is like a bicycle: if they don't keep pedalling they will fall off,' says Mr Rubio. Asked how he wants to end his presidency, Mr Salinas replied: 'I'm working towards ending my administration with economic growth, with price stability and with a social consensus that would confirm that it was worth the process of reform to which we have been committed in the last five years.' Achieving this will depend in part on Nafta's ratification. History may show Mr Salinas as having exceeded expec-tations in his pursuit of economic reform. Politically, however, he will probably be seen as being more firmly in the PRI tradition than he was often perceived, certainly outside Mexico. He has used fully the powers of his office in this most centralised of states and his concessions to opponents have emphasised, rather than tempered, the continuing power of the executive. If, as expected, he follows convention, he will choose his party's candidate for the elections scheduled for next August. It seems likely - though not inevitable - that the fate of Nafta will be decided before he has to make the choice. While education minister, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, is regarded by some as an outsider with a good chance, there are three front runners: Mr Manuel Camacho, the mayor of Mexico City, finance minister, Mr Pedro Aspe, and Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the social development minister. Mr Camacho is known to favour political reform and is regarded as a political conciliator: his drawback is that he is regarded, rightly or wrongly, as likely to frighten foreign capital. Mr Aspe is seen as ensuring that Mexico remains in the good books of international investors, but he is viewed in the party as an economic fundamentalist and therefore somewhat dangerous. Party officials also suggest he would be the weakest of the main candidates as a campaigner. Conventional wisdom has it, however, that Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the social development minister, is the man most likely to succeed Mr Salinas. Mr Colosio is viewed as Mr Salinas's 'son', the man the president can most trust. Mr Colosio is taken as the candidate with neither the drawbacks of Mr Camacho nor of Mr Aspe, and the one most likely to carry Mr Salinas's style of government to the new century.</p>

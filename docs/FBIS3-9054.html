Ivaylovgrad falls in the border zone and the two  diplomats' presence there without the permission of Bulgaria's  Foreign Ministry is a gross violation of border regulations.    The police do not know how the two diplomats reached  Ivaylovgrad unimpeded. A protocol was drawn up and they left  for Sofia.</p>

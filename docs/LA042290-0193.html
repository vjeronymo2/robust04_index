			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERIORS: GETTING STARTED IN THE FINE ART OF STENCILING;  </P> <P> DECOR: PAINTING DESIGNS CAN ENHANCE THE LOOK OF EARLY AMERICAN PINE FURNITURE  OR ADD INTEREST TO A ROOM.  </P> <P> Looking for an easy, effective way to set off a piece of Early American pine  furniture? Or liven up a mundane wooden floor? Or add interest to the typical  painted room? Stenciling may be what you're looking for.  </P> <P> Stenciling is an art that requires almost no artistic skill. If you can cut out  a simple pattern with a sharp knife and make little dabbing motions with a  paint brush, you can decorate successfully with stencils.  </P> <P> Probably the best way to get started in stenciling is to buy a copy of "Early  American Cut and Use Stencils," by Joanne C. Day (published by Dover  Publications, 180 Varick St., New York, N.Y. 10014).  </P> <P> This book includes 54 full-sized stencils in a variety of Early American  motifs, all printed on heavy oak tag. All you have to do to use them is cut out  a page, soak it in a mixture of linseed oil and thinner, and let dry. Then you  take a sharp razor knife and cut along the printed shapes and you are ready to  start stenciling.  </P> <P> This involves little more than taping the stencil in position on your work, and  dabbing paint over it with a blunt stenciling brush as shown in the sketch.  Day's book includes a basic set of instructions, but if you give stenciling a  try and become interested, you might want to learn more about it.  </P> <P> In that case, she has a more advanced book, "The Complete Book of  Stencilcraft," published by Simon &amp; Schuster. Another book with good  information is "Paint Magic," by Jocasta Innes (Pantheon Books).  </P> <P> If you'd like to fool around with stenciling on your own, here's a quick review  of how to get started:  </P> <P> You can make a simple basic stencil out of a piece of cardboard. An ordinary  file folder works well. If you can come up with your own design idea, fine. If  not, you should be able to get ideas from magazines, catalogues and books.  Simple Early American and Pennsylvania Dutch designs always work well.  </P> <P> Once you have your design, draw it out on your piece of cardboard. Then mix up  a small batch of boiled linseed oil and paint thinner or turpentine, mixed  50/50. Soak this into both sides of the cardboard for several minutes. Then  wipe off the excess and let dry for about half an hour. This treatment will  give the cardboard extra body, make it easier to cut, and when fully dry, will  protect the stencil from both latex and oil paints.  </P> <P> If, after half an hour, the cardboard is still wet, wipe it off again. Then lay  it out on a smooth board and cut along your lines with a razor-sharp knife.  Then let the stencil dry overnight.  </P> <P> Paints used for stenciling can be latex or oil, but in any case, should be  fairly thick. Thin, runny paints will seep under your stencil. Subdued, earthy  colors such as browns, greens, ochers and rusty reds usually look most  appropriate.  </P> <P> Rather than buy cans of paint, it's often cheaper to mix your own, using  artist's acrylic or oil paints. These come in tubes and can be thinned with  water (for acrylics) or turpentine (for oils) to a consistency about like heavy  cream.  </P> <P> There are special brushes made for stenciling, but if you can't find one at  your art store, buy a cheap round sash brush at your paint store and cut off  the bristles to about half their original length to create a stubby, flat-nosed  substitute.  </P> <P> Put some of your paint in a saucer or other shallow container and tap the end  of the brush into it a few times. Dab the end of the brush onto some newspapers  a few times to get off the excess and you are ready to go to work.  </P> <P> It's not a bad idea to practice a bit with your stencil on a scrap of wood.  This will help you get the feel of how much to load the brush, and how to apply  the paint. So place your stencil down on a scrap and give it a try.  </P> <P> Apply the paint by tapping lightly with the tip of the brush. Don't try for a  heavy coat. If the brush is too wet, paint will seep under the stencil and  cause smears. If it's too dry or your paint is too thin, you won't get good  coverage.  </P> <P> Once you have your technique worked out, wipe the stencil clean with a soft rag  or paper towel. Then tape it to your real work and go to it. After the paint  has dried you might want to go over it lightly with very fine sandpaper to give  it a worn look. If the stencil is in a high-wear situation, it's a good idea to  protect it with a coat or two of varnish.  </P></p>

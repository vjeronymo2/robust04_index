			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL WILL CHANGE MAYOR EVERY 9 1/2 MONTHS  </P> <P> City Council members on Tuesday voted to rotate the mayor's job among  themselves every 9 1/2 months.  </P> <P> By a 3-2 vote, the council abolished the current system, which provided for  two-year terms for mayors elected by members of the council.  </P> <P> Mayors were eligible to seek reelection.  </P> <P> Under the new system there will be no election for mayor. Instead, the council  has adopted a rotation system in which each member will serve as mayor over a  four-year period. The rotation system goes into effect after council elections  in April.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem James Castaneda opposed the rotating mayor system. "We're making  a change here without doing all the homework," Castaneda told the council. He  suggested that the system should be changed to allow the voters, instead of the  council, to elect a mayor.  </P> <P> Mayor John Tapp, whose term expires in April, agreed. "I'd like to go to a  system where the people do have a voice," he said.  </P> <P> But Councilwoman Mary Cammarano said the new system, patterned after methods  used by Alhambra and Monterey Park, is more fair than a two-year term for the  mayor. "Everybody gets a chance to be mayor this way," she said.  </P> <P> In the new rotation, Castaneda will become mayor on April 17.  </P> <P> At one point during the debate, Councilman Sabino Cici proposed that the change  take place immediately, which would have allowed Castaneda a head start on his  term. But Cici's motion died because of lack of support.  </P></p>

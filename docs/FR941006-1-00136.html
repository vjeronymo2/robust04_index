			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency may conduct focus group research to evaluate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer understanding of the proposed warning messages and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the messages are not misleading. Focus group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research involves gathering small, representative groups of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers (no more than nine consumers per group) and leading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then in a directed discussion of the research topic. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present research, consumers will provide feedback as to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of understanding of the warnings and the degree to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specific wording of the messages is believable, relevant,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusing, or irritating. The agency intends to consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results of the focus group research in arriving at any warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement that is included in the final regulations. FDA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make a report on the results of its research available for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment before it issues the final regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Review of Packaging Issues in Citizen Petitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two of the citizen petitions suggested that FDA take action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to the packaging of iron-containing drugs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dietary supplements. Both petitions recommended packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements as a means of reducing pediatric poisonings from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion of multiple doses of drugs and dietary supplements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AG citizen petition requested that FDA use its authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the act to require that all iron-containing drugs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dietary supplements containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be packaged in child-resistant blister packs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NDMA petition recommended that FDA incorporate into its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations the NDMA-initiated voluntary program to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric poisonings by such iron-containing products. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary program includes, in part, a proviso that all iron-containing products currently subject to CPSC's special packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaged in CRP's, and that there be no exemption to CPSC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child-resistant special packaging requirements for these types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. As discussed previously, NDMA's voluntary program also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifies labeling statements and includes an educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Implicit in NDMA's recommendation is the view that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CRC's, labeling warning statements, and consumer education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are sufficient to ensure the safe use of iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Agency Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA considered the following questions in evaluating and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responding to the packaging issues raised in the citizen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitions: (1) Can educational efforts and label warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements alone sufficiently reduce pediatric iron poisonings?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Are noncomplying child-resistant packages a principal cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iron poisoning deaths? (3) Are additional packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements necessary to ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing products? (4) What is FDA's legal authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulate packaging for foods and drugs? (5) Should child-resistant blister packaging be required for iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Can educational efforts and label warning statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly reduce pediatric iron poisonings?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA agrees with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NDMA that educating consumers on the proper use of CRC's and on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hazards posed by iron-containing drugs and supplements is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very important. However, based on the available evidence, even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if all CRC's were properly used, these closures could not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevented the majority of the 37 reported fatalities. Improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of CRC's was reported in only 4 of the 21 (19 percent)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric iron fatalities known to involve child-resistant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging (Table 2). Educational programs and label warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements should help to increase proper use of reclosable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CRC's, and thereby help to prevent some pediatric iron-poisonings. However, FDA knows of no information showing that a consumer education program, either that recommended by NDMA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other such program, will be adequate to ensure that children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be able to defeat even properly closed CRC's, or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improper use of such closures will cease. In the absence of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, FDA believes that measures beyond consumer education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are necessary to ensure that the use of certain iron-containing products is safe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also tentatively finds that label warning statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be sufficient to ensure the safe use of these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This tentative conclusion is based on the fact that label warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements do not in any way bar access to the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Label statements are an important educational tool for making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adults aware of the significant consequences for young children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if they gain access to the product. Young children,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, cannot read and have little judgment. Thus, a warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement is likely to have little or no effect on their efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to gain access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Jobs: The numbing effects of visible responsibility - How the best laid plans of top management are bedevilled by political forces IF the Jobs column could have anything it wished for its 19th birthday today, the choice would be the luck to run across as many realistic books about management as it did last year. In all, there were two of them. Mind you, neither was exactly hot off the presses. Indeed, the first (which I wrote about 17 weeks back) was published as long ago as 1958, being called The Boss in Britain but The Managers in the United States. It pointed out that management is not so much an economic exercise as a political one, in which the power-wielders' personal ambitions may well clash with the best interests of the organisations they rule over. The second book, which takes the same theme farther, is at least recent enough for 1991 to have seen its first appearance in paperback. The work of Sweden's Professor Nils Brunsson, it is entitled The Organisation of Hypocrisy.* Its central message is that - in big, complex organisations at any rate - politicking is not only inevitable, but as resistant to cure as original sin. Hence management is a process best undertaken in a spirit of Christian hope, rather than in any expectation that it will ever work very well here on earth. What's more, Brunsson suggests that trying to make it do so by installing sophisticated systems beloved by business schools, is apt merely to compound the problem. That book too has already been discussed here, 15 weeks ago. But on re-reading it since, I have twigged that several of its general truths can be distilled into a further addition to the Laws of Organisational Stupidity, of which the Jobs column has for nine years been the self-appointed codifier. As enduring readers may recall, those laws aren't of the inviolable kind exemplified by the law of gravity. What they describe are simply regularities: events observed to happen more often than not in given circumstances. The original one, for instance, is Parkinson's First: Work expands to fill the time available. Accordingly, not only can they be broken, but when they are the effects are usually beneficial. The latest addition, bringing the number to 23, reads: Willingness to impose control declines as visible responsibility for the results increases. And the book's clearest illustration of its workings is in connection with probably the most time-honoured of the aforesaid sophisticated systems: namely, budgeting. Although the particular exercise the professor cites took place in a Swedish local authority, I've little doubt that the budgeting rituals of big businesses are often prey to the same bedevilling forces. The fact that the event occurred in a recession is important because it is only in such conditions that the new law - 'Brunsson's Turner' - applies. At buoyant times, the general managers at the top rarely need to impose control. Availability of extra funds for expansion, albeit never as much as the subordinate department heads would like, is usually enough to persuade them and their staff to co-operate with their superiors' policies. In the Swedish case, recession gave point to the pledge which got the authority's new top bosses elected. It was to cancel the out-going council's plans for increases to taxes already among the highest in the land. The promise was not to reduce taxes, but only to hold them steady instead of upping them by 0.75 per cent, which was ordained as the minimum increase necessary by the authority's five-year plan. The first idea of the tax-freezing bosses, whom the professor calls 'guardians', was to make uniform percentage cuts for the next fiscal year in the planned income of the departments providing the various services. It would be up to the departments' heads, called the 'champions', to decide how the detailed savings were to be made. But the champions objected that, as departments were not all the same, a uniform cut would affect them differently to the extent of preventing some from operating properly. So, since it was the guardians' duty to see the services worked, they should decide the specific cuts. The blackmailing overtones of that claim were enough to lever the guardians into concurrence. They therefore began scrutinising the details of expenditure, relying for specialised advice on the fellow-guardians they had appointed to head the committees of officials running the services concerned. Whereupon there came into play three of the bedevilling forces mentioned earlier, the first being epitomised by Alexander Pope's line: 'A little learning is a dang'rous thing'. As Nils Brunsson says: 'The different levels of knowledge as between guardians and champions is a typical aspect of budget processes. The guardians are all too likely to have just the amount of knowledge that makes savings difficult. If you know nothing about an operation, you can easily convince yourself there must be plenty of scope for saving, and if you know a lot about it you have a good chance of seeing concrete opportunities for saving; but if you just know a little bit, it is more difficult to see how savings can be made.' The next bedevilling force lay in the fact that the committee heads, although appointed by the top management team of which they were members, still had personal ambitions. That made them loth to see the services they were heading reduced in importance. Hence they began to side less with their fellow-guardians than with the champions in their particular departments, using such specialised knowledge as they'd been able to pick up accordingly. The third force was that the officials running the various services, being aware that a chain is as strong as its weakest link, declined to help the top bosses to identify sensible economies not just in their own domains but in any of the other services. So the guardians, already weakened by a fifth column in their own ranks, were also faced by a united front. The only savings proposed to them from below were of a sort involving them in heavy risk of being visibly responsible for breakdown. Moreover, the officials added a subtle touch by suggesting that if their superiors were reluctant to decide for themselves, they should take advice from the organisation's treasury department. That brought into play a fourth force because the treasury officials, while operating independently of the champions in the spending departments, were not in favour of savings that would cut future income. Their interest was in garnering as much cash as feasible for the corporate kitty - which is why the professor calls them the 'hoarders'. Trapped in the concatenation of all four forces, the guardians were confronted by a dilemma. Their only way of doing the job they had been put in to do as a team - namely, to impose a standstill on expenditure  - was by jeopardising their individual ambitions. There are no prizes for guessing the outcome. The pledge to hold costs was abandoned, and taxes for the coming year were increased. But the rise was only 0.5 per cent, compared with the 0.75 envisaged by the previous regime. That enabled the guardians to take advantage of the general tendency to mistake plans for reality, and represent the increase as an 0.25 per cent reduction. So they did not do too badly out of the exercise. While the champions were also fairly satisfied with it, of course, the group who gained most from it were the hoarders. Nils Brunsson says that when the budgeted year was actually over, the financial accounts showed a surplus of more than Pounds 1m - enough not just to have held taxes steady as originally promised, but to have cut them by a full percentage point. *John Wiley, Pounds 17.95.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Former miners' job hopes improve BRITISH COAL Enterprise, the job creation arm of the mining industry, yesterday reported a 60 per rise in job vacancies in recent weeks. It said more than half of miners leaving the industry would be in work within six months. Last week Enterprise placed 279 ex-miners in jobs, the best figure for 18 months. The company said it expected to find jobs for more than 80 per cent of miners who sought its help within a year of losing their coal jobs. If the record of previous years was maintained about a third of those who were successful would maintain or improve their pay. Mr David Pickering, Enterprise commercial director, said companies contacted by his staff were optimistic about prospects and were taking on employees as a result. In the last past six weeks there had been a 60 per cent rise in advertised vacancies. Although British Coal is contracting at an unprecedented rate, the number of people leaving it in the past year or so has been much lower than the 35,000 annual job losses of the late 1980s. Fewer than 20,000 miners have left the industry since last October. Mr Philip Andrew, Enterprise chief executive, said about three quarters of blue-collar workers leaving British Coal and virtually all white-collar staff had sought the agency's help. The increase in job opportunities was at the higher end of the pay scale, in jobs with Pounds 15,000-plus salaries. Growth areas were in welding, offshore oil and computer numerically controlled (CNC) skills, but not in computers generally. British Coal Enterprise plans to spend Pounds 50m in reviving former coalfield economies this year. Last year the company helped create 11,136 jobs compared with 7,200 the year before. The cumulative total since 1985 is more than 90,000.</p>

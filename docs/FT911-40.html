			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Bush pledge on chemical weapons THE US will renounce the use of chemical weapons 'for any reason' and destroy all its stockpiles within 10 years once international agreement is reached banning their use, President George Bush said yesterday. His announcement is intended to give fresh momentum to international talks which resume today in Geneva on a chemical weapons convention. The US move goes beyond a draft agreement signed at the US-Soviet summit in Washington last June to destroy all but 5,000 tonnes each of their chemical weapons stocks by 2002. In the first eight years after the signing of an international agreement, this would be reduced to 500 tonnes. For the US, this would have meant retaining about 2 per cent of its current total. The White House has been considering the worldwide chemical weapons initiative as part of a wider series of arms control moves specifically affecting the Middle East. In a statement intended to 'demonstrate the US commitment to banning chemical weapons', Mr Bush said the US was 'formally forswearing the use of chemical weapons for any reason, including retaliation, against any state, effective when the convention enters into force and will propose that all states follow suit'. He added that the US 'unconditionally commits itself to the destruction of all our stocks of chemical weapons within 10 years of entry into force of the convention'. Previously the US has retained the right to use chemical weapons in retaliation - and to keep the 5,000-tonne stockpile - until all nations with such weapons had agreed to eliminate them. The US originally wished to keep a residual stockpile as a deterrent against countries such as Iraq which might use chemical weapons in war but Washington has changed its view, partly as a result of the Gulf war. The US not only won through the use of conventional weapons but also had to consider, and reject, the possible use of its own chemical weapons as a retaliation against any Iraqi chemical attack - although none materialised. Under the terms of the United Nations ceasefire resolution, Iraq is required to hand over all its stocks of chemical weapons to a UN commission for destruction. At today's Geneva talks, the US is calling for the resolution of all important issues by the end of this year and a final treaty within 12 months. The US delegation will ask that the negotiating committee of the Conference on Disarmament stays in continuous session from now on.</p>

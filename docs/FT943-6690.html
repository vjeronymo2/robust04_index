			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Higher interest income keeps Pegasus in black A fall from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 68,000 in pre-tax profits was announced by Pegasus Group, the USM-quoted accounting software designer, for the half year to June 30. The outcome reflected reorganisation within the group, Mr Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, chief executive, said, with the results last time benefiting from a contribution from the forms business, sold for Pounds 6.98m in September 1993. Operating losses amounted to Pounds 136,000, compared with Pounds 957,000 profits, which included Pounds 607,000 from discontinued activities. However, the pre-tax figure was after net interest receivable of Pounds 204,000, up from Pounds 60,000. Turnover fell to Pounds 2.28m, against Pounds 5.3m which included Pounds 1.79m from discontinued operations. There were 'substantial revenues' last time from the release of the Senior Version 6 upgrade, Mr Hubbard-Ford said. During the half year the company's focus had remained on product development. Plans for modernising and extending the range of products were now finalised, the chief executuve added. Earnings per share slipped to 0.7p (9.4p); the interim dividend is held at 2p.</p>

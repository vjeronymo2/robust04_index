			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BZW launches Pounds 100m food retail warrant BARCLAYS DE Zoete Wedd, the stockbroker, yesterday launched a Pounds 100m warrant for the food retail sector in one of the first such moves involving UK-only traded stocks. Investors will be able to buy a warrant at yesterday's closing mid-prices for a basket of food retail shares weighted by market capitalisation. The cost of the warrant - which allows investors to exercise an option to buy the shares at the price on the day of purchase - is 230p based on a basket price of Pounds 18.80. Investors then have until April 1995 to exercise their warrants. BZW said it had decided to use the warrant instrument as a way of encouraging investors back into the depressed food retail market. Shares in the sector have underperformed the FT-SE All-Share Index by over 30 per cent in the past six months. The launch coincided with the stockbroker's research team adopting a more positive recommendation on the food retail stocks. Sainsbury heads the basket weighting of seven food retailers, with 40 per cent, followed by Tesco (21 per cent) and Argyll (17.5 per cent). The sector has had a turbulent six months. Investor concern has focused on lower margins caused by increasing competition and the threat posed by discount chains, with US and European operators moving into the UK market. Results from the leading supermarket groups have confirmed the City's fears. The threat of VAT on food in next month's budget has also undermined investor sentiment.</p>

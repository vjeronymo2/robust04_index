			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Graduates warned not to delay job search Graduate job-seekers risk missing out on recruitment opportunities if they leave applications until the summer, a leading employer has warned. Mr Peter Johnstone, Human Resources manager at Mobil Oil and vice-chairman of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, said students were being told that employers were not recruiting when in fact the big recruiters were planning to fill their vacancies by Easter. Mr Johnstone's warning, in the latest issue of Personnel Management Plus, the Institute of Personnel Management's magazine, reflects a revival in graduate recruitment among large employers. 'Fatalism has percolated through to the 1994 crop,' he said. His own company was planning to take on more graduates, but the number of applicants had fallen by a quarter. He said: 'Undergraduates have been told by their academic counsellors that there aren't any jobs and they should concentrate on getting a good degree and then enter the summer marketplace.' Students, he warned, would 'miss the boat' if they did not apply now. Many companies with staff-cutting programmes are deliberately keeping quiet about graduate recruitment plans for fear of upsetting existing employees. Graduate recruitment has been declining for three years. Big employers such as Marks and Spencer and IBM have frozen their programmes, and others have cut numbers. This year, however, the number of graduates recruited is expected to show a small increase. The number of graduates coming on to the market is also increasing, leading to greater emphasis by employers on assessment techniques to sift the best candidates.</p>

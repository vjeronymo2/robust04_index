			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Go-ahead for Rhone Poulenc share sale THE French Finance Ministry last night announced that it would, after all, go ahead this week all with its 'on-off' sale of 6m Rhone-Poulenc shares at FFr500 (Dollars 92.59) each. The size and distribution of the share sale follows exactly what the ministry announced last year - 2.7m shares to be sold in France, 1.7m elsewhere abroad, 1m in the US, and the remaining 10 per cent on preferential terms to Rhone-Poulenc employees. But last year the ministry never set a price for this sale of 10.6 per cent of the total equity of the state-controlled Rhone-Poulenc. In early December, the government said it would not proceed with its planned sale by February 1 in current conditions as the company's share price was gyrating downwards, partly because of steadily lower revision of profit forecasts. Recent stability in the stock market and an improvement in Rhone-Poulenc's own share performance have now persuaded the government to proceed. In advance of last night's announcement, Rhone-Poulenc this week revised its 1992 growth forecast for the third time, estimating that last year's operating profit had risen by 5 to 10 per cent. This week's sale, and an accompanying enfranchisement of Rhone-Poulenc's non-voting shares, will bring the state's direct stake in the company from 77.5 per cent to 45 per cent. But indirect state holdings still give it an ample majority of the equity.</p>

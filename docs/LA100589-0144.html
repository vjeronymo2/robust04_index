			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA SUES 4 CITIES FOR FAILING TO ENFORCE WATER QUALITY RULES  </P> <P> The Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency filed lawsuits  Wednesday against four U.S. cities for failure to enforce water quality  standards requiring industries to treat toxic waste water before releasing it  into municipal systems.  </P> <P> Acting on the EPA's behalf, Justice Department attorneys initiated action  against the cities of Detroit, El Paso, Phoenix and San Antonio, seeking court  orders to force them to meet federal requirements. Continued failure to comply  could bring fines of $25,000 a day.  </P> <P> In addition, the EPA disclosed that 57 other cities and towns have been the  subject of judicial and administrative sanctions for failure to enforce the ban  against discharge of untreated toxic wastes into their sewage systems. Among  them is California's Chino Basin area, which was assessed a $200,000 fine by  the state last summer.  </P> <P> "We can, we must, we will do a better job of enforcing our environmental laws,"  EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said at a news conference as he and Atty.  Gen. Dick Thornburgh announced the actions against the four cities.  </P> <P> Reilly characterized the four as "the weak link in the effort to remove toxic  pollutants from the nation's waterways."  </P> <P> Altogether, EPA estimated that a third of the country's nearly 1,500 municipal  sewage treatment facilities at which pre-treatment programs are required remain  in violation of at least some of the requirements.  </P> <P> The effluent from thousands of industrial sites contains many toxics, including  chemicals such as cyanide and arsenic and heavy metals such as lead and  cadmium. Without pre-treatment, such discharges have the potential to corrode  the pipes of municipal waste treatment systems, endanger workers and even cause  explosions.  </P> <P> Besides California, non-compliance actions have been initiated by the states of  Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and Tennessee.  </P></p>

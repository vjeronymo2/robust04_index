			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jean Obed Maturin from Jeremie] </F>   [Excerpts] Sofonie Paul, 1, and Dieula Paul were killed and  Tortila Paul, 9, was slightly injured in an explosion over the  weekend in their courtyard in Caracolie, a residential  neighborhood in Jeremie. Military authorities in Jeremie have  arrested several people as part of their investigation. Among  those arrested: Serge Paul, a well-known labor union member and  Federation of Haitian Workers [CTH] coordinator in Jeremie;  Paul's wife; and many of Paul's relatives. Paul is the father of  the two young victims of the explosion. Military authorities  also arrested for questioning several union members from  Port-au-Prince who were staying at CTH premises in Caracolie.  While the union members and Paul's wife were released after a  night in jail, the military authorities continue to hold Serge  Paul. Mrs. Paul was very shocked at losing her two daughters.  [passage omitted]    The explosion cut the girls to pieces but caused no property  damage. Military authorities in Jeremie have not yet confirmed  via press release whether it was a homemade bomb or a grenade,  as it is rumored. The two girls were mourned over the weekend.

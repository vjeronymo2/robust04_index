			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Sterling slides to record lows STERLING FELL yesterday to record lows against the D-Mark, the yen and its trade weighted index in one of its most turbulent days since leaving the European exchange rate mechanism in September. It also slipped below eight French francs before closing slightly firmer. Senior ministers insisted last night that the government would 'keep its nerve' in the face of the latest turmoil on the markets. With the collapse of Daf, the Dutch-based truck manufacturer which has big UK operations, delivering a further blow to the fragile prospects for economic recovery, there is no appetite in Downing Street for a rise in interest rates to stabilise the pound. But some of Mr John Major's cabinet colleagues acknowledged that an acceleration in the pound's slide would threaten the credibility of the government's anti-inflation strategy. If monetary conditions were no longer consistent with sustained, non-inflationary growth, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would have little choice but to increase the cost of borrowing. Paradoxically, hopes of lower interest rates continued to flourish in the City following last week's lowering of base rates in spite of government efforts to damp expectations of further cuts from 6 per cent. Equities moved higher, with the FT-SE 100 index gaining 1.39 per cent to close at a record 2,873.8, up 39.4. City economists accused the government of pursuing a policy of 'benign neglect' and 'glorious indifference' towards the pound. But officials insisted that the government was monitoring the exchange rate and giving it full weight in assessing monetary conditions. Mr Lamont discussed the pound's fall with Mr Major at their regular weekly meeting and also met Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, for their monthly assessment of UK monetary conditions. In discussions with aides, Mr Lamont again made clear that he had no plans to cut interest rates before the Budget on March 16. The latest indications are that he is also unlikely to cut rates in the wake of the Budget. In its latest monetary report, which was prepared for the chancellor's meeting with Mr Leigh-Pemberton, the Treasury noted that sterling had fallen by 5.5 per cent against its trade weighted index since the middle of January. It said that so far there were 'few obvious signs of sterling's depreciation affecting producer output prices or retail prices, apart from petrol'. However, the report was completed on Tuesday, before yesterday's slide in sterling. The pound touched new lows of DM2.355 and Y177.35 in early morning trading in London. Sterling closed in London at DM2.36, down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day, and at FFr8.0025. It also fell to a 1993 low of Dollars 1.4255 against a strong dollar before closing in London at Dollars 1.434, down more than a cent on the day. At one point, sterling fell to a record low of 76.5 on the index. In New York, sterling closed at Dollars 1.435, at DM2.3606 and at FFr7.799845. Turbulence in London was matched in other European centres, where heavy selling of the Danish krone pushed it to its ERM floor against three currencies and raised new doubts about the future of the European monetary system. In these circumstances, dealers and economists were divided on whether the pound would extend its fall. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist of James Capel &amp; Co, said steady interest rates on the money markets indicated that 'it is not a classic sterling crisis'. However, Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Philips &amp; Drew, was very pessimistic. 'There is a risk of a vertical fall for sterling,' he said.

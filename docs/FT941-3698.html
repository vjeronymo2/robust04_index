			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / G7 ministers move to tackle jobs creation: Germany warns unskilled workers are at risk Ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations yesterday began work on plans to tackle unemployment, as the German labour minister warned that Germany might lose 3m unskilled jobs over the next eight years. US president Bill Clinton, opening a two-day summit of G7 employment and economics ministers on measures to boost job creation, called on the G7 to tackle down-to-earth economic issues rather than concentrating exclusively on macroeconomic policy and high finance. But a US proposal to set up a G7 working party to study employment policy has already been dismissed by several countries. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, said a working party would be 'superfluous', since the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development already performed a similar task. 'If you set up machinery, a lot of the work goes into setting up the machinery rather than into substantive work,' added another official at the meeting. The German delegation expressed a number of other minor differences with the US approach and Mr Rexrodt dismissed US calls for more expansionary macroeconomic policies. Mr Clinton proposed the jobs summit at the G7 summit meeting in Tokyo last year. The summit, on the shores of Detroit's East-West river, is expected to yield a framework for the full G7 meeting in Naples this summer. G7 officials declined to discuss details of the principles which Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary and conference chairman, will set out when the meeting closes today. But a senior White House official said the final statement would be nothing like the five-point plan some other countries had suggested might be agreed. 'It will have principles in it but they are not going to be of the kind that suggests a highly concrete programme,' said Mr Bowman Cutter, a Clinton adviser. The conclusions, well short of a formal communique, are likely to address subjects such as re-employment, open markets and technology, and to remain general in order to avoid offending any country. Mr Clinton promised that the US would continue to bring its budget deficit down. He called on Japan to stimulate domestic demand and on Europe to work for lower interest rates. But he also called for more fundamental structural changes in unemployment benefit systems, training systems and employment regulations. 'Unless people believe they are prepared for the jobs of the future, that productivity benefits them and they can have both strong work lives and strong families in a dynamic economy, they will turn against change,' he said. Mr Clinton made a plea against age discrimination. 'If you want people to embrace change, we all have to change our attitude about who is employable, and especially on each end of the age spectrum,' he said. Mr Clinton's message won broad acceptance from delegates. 'We are completely in agreement with the policies outlined,' said Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor.

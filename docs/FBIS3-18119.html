Thomas Goppel, current Bavarian European affairs  minister and future environment minister, called on the Federal  Government to block the decision on additional financial sources  of the EU, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers in  Brussels at the beginning of March, until, first, the current  membership negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Norway, and  Finland have been successfully concluded and, second, agreement  on the "reduction of the German financial burden" has been  reached. Responding to Goppel's demand, the FRG Finance  Ministry said that one wants indeed to use all possibilities to  reduce the German burden, but one does not want to call into  question the political decision of the Edinburgh summit about  the financing of the EU for the rest of the decade.    Germany's net burden at the EU, that is, the surplus of  Bonn's financial contribution over the benefits from the EU, is  clearly soaring. For 1990, the year of reunification, the  Bundesbank registered 11.6 billion marks [DM]. The Finance  Ministry puts the net balance of the current year at DM31.2  billion. Goppel thinks that the pending "decision on  independent means" of the Council of Ministers is the last  opportunity in this decade to come to "a fairer burden-sharing  in the EU." Obviously, it is impossible to achieve this goal  via Brussels' payments to eastern Germany (DM28 billion until  1999). The Council of Ministers' decision is to put the  decision that the EU budget can be gradually expanded from  currently about DM140 billion to more than DM200 billion by 1999  into the form of a law. The German gross contribution would  then rise from the current DM45.4 billion to approximately DM70  billion.    Goppel's advance, which was coordinated with Bavarian  Minister-President Edmund Stoiber but probably not with  Christian Social Union [CSU] Chairman Theo Waigel, is  undoubtedly part of the election campaign, during which the CSU  critics want to deal with European integration. Nevertheless,  Bavaria is also forced to act now, both because of the dates for  decisionmaking in Brussels and because of the membership  negotiations. "Many member states are vitally interested in  raising the financial ceiling," Goppel said. This desire for  raising the EU's financial means primarily applies to the  southern members. During the current "hot" period of the  membership negotiations they are causing difficulties, because  they fear that the accession by the rich EFTA [European Free  Trade Association] countries will lead to a majority of "net  payers" in the Council of Ministers, which would oppose them.  By practically taking the decision on the EU's financial means  hostage, the Germans could force the south to agree to the  expansion.    The Bonn Finance Ministry and the politicians in Munich  partly agree on the question of how the burden on Germany could  be eased. In both places it is insisted that the future net  payments of the new members must not be used for additional  expenditures by Brussels, as the south wants, but must be used  to save money for the old members. While Goppel also suggests  that Germany could either be exempt from participating in  financing the British budget discount or could ask for a  temporary discount itself because of the burdens it has to bear  in eastern Germany, the politicians in Bonn state that, in the  longer term they are striving for negotiations about London's  discount.    In the EU it is criticized that the Germans are destroying  the membership negotiations, which they want to save, by trying  to hold parallel negotiations about easing the financial burden.  Peter Schmidhuber, the EU commissioner for finances, who is  also Bavarian, sees the solution to the EU's exploding budget in  a real EU tax, which would be levied by the European Parliament.    Differing opinions of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  and the CSU on the goal of European policy once again became  clear in Stoiber's criticism of the demand for a federal system  in Europe, which is contained in the new CDU basic program. On  Bavarian radio the CSU politician said that such a demand can  never be implemented with his party. Sine there is an agreement  between the two sister parties that the CDU can never outvote  the CSU, the smaller partner, in federal issues, the CDU just  has this demand written on paper. He does not believe that the  CDU will put the cohesion of the CDU/CSU at stake because of  this issue.</p>

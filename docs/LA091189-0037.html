			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WHALE'S DEATH  </P> <P> I was shocked and horrified when I read the news accounts about the two captive  killer whales (Kandu and Corky) who were forced to compete against each other  in the San Diego Sea World park in order to titillate the watching audiences. I  realize that Kandu broke her jaw after charging into the other whale -- but Sea  World is at fault for creating such a stressful environment in the first place.  </P> <P> KENNETH LLOYD LARSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARTS FUNDING  </P> <P> Beeb Salzer makes many important points in his commentary ("Budget Blade Poised  Again to Slice Arts Funding," March 4) defending city funds for the arts. I  agree that artists and artwork help make San Diego a better place to live and  work, with benefits far beyond mere bolstering of the city's image.  </P> <P> But in urging arts leaders to lobby against any cuts, Professor Salzer  contributes to the posturing that has polarized the budget shortfall facing the  city.  </P> <P> As an example, Professor Salzer lumps my moderate proposal for mild tax and fee  increases and carefully planned budget cuts with the more Draconian series of  cuts likely unless the City Council changes course.  </P> <P> My package of nearly $8 million in budget cuts would reduce arts and  promotional spending by $4.3 million. That would cause a direct cut to the arts  of $3 million -- $2.2 million for future arts festivals and $800,000 from  programs. But I also propose $41 million in new fees and taxes to keep whole  many services, from police and fire to libraries and recreation programs.  </P> <P> My proposal would provide about $5 million in continued funding for the arts --  not as much as I would like, but as much as the city can afford at this  difficult time.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a council majority, in overruling my objections March 7, instructed  City Manager John Lockwood to prepare a budget with no revenue increases,  meaning the budget would have to be balanced solely by cuts.  </P> <P> Preliminary reports from Mr. Lockwood indicate that under this scenario, few  programs would escape the ax. Police service would be trimmed back from current  levels. Social services funding would be eliminated from the general fund.  Mission Bay improvements would be deferred. All city recreation centers and  pools would be closed. Library hours would be drastically reduced, and arts and  promotional funding would drop by $12 million.  </P> <P> In such an event, it is unlikely there would be much support for any arts  funding at all, and certainly not the $5 million I would have the city provide.  </P> <P> How can Professor Salzer direct equal ire at my proposal and this course the  council has taken?  </P> <P> It is time for those now taking extreme approaches to lower the volume.  </P> <P> Those who now say "No cuts" should say what cuts they can live with. And those  who say "No taxes" should step forward and say where they would produce the  revenue needed to keep our streets safe, our libraries and parks open and our  streets and roads from slowly crumbling.  </P> <P> RON ROBERTS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P> <P> City Council  </P> <P> 2nd District  </P></p>

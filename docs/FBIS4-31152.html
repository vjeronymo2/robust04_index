			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia Network; passages within quotation </F> marks recorded]    [Text] Before his departure for Great Britain today,  President Lech Walesa said that he sees an opportunity for the  reconstruction of a political camp that would attain an  electoral success similar to that of Solidarity five years ago.  The condition for this is, however, that Solidarity politicians  start to listen to him. Walesa stated that he is certain of his  victory in the presidential election next year.    [Correspondent Maciej Sojka] Walesa feels that low ratings  in  public opinion poll surveys--in which he is led by several other  candidates for the presidential chair--do not negate his chances  of a second term in the Belweder Palace.    [Walesa] "That is why I am convinced I will win as  president."    [Sojka] The president does not yet know whether he will sign  the neo-popiwek law. He admitted that he sees no reason to  hurry with this decision.    [Walesa] "Well, not much is taking place. I see certain  people who have decent earnings, of 90 million, and these  paupers who have a million--and we are so scared of them?"    [Sojka] Asked whether he will stand by his invitation to  German President Roman Herzog to the commemorations of the 50th  anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, the president said that he  never goes back on his word.</p>

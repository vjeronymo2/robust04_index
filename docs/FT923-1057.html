			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities draw strength from bond prices Wall Street BUOYED by an upturn in bond prices, US stock markets registered modest gains in fairly active trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.18 up at 3,287.87, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 1.03 to 418.47 and the Nasdaq composite put on 2.97 to 585.93. NYSE turnover totalled 188m shares. The market drew all its strength from bond prices. The steep fall in bonds, which had pushed long-term yields up sharply, had prompted talk that the Treasury market was heading for a sustained bear phase. Yesterday's recovery in bond prices (the 30-year issue was up about 1/2 point in early afternoon trading) helped allay fears of rising interest rates. Ironically, the improvement in bond prices was a reaction to bad economic news: the latest weekly jobless claims figures showed a much bigger rise in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance than had been expected. The increase may have been inflated by job losses related to Hurricane Andrew, but this was offset by the fact that the reporting period was shorter than usual due to the Labor Day break. Car manufacturers remained in the limelight. Chrysler firmed Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 22 3/4 in busy trading after stating that it had reached a tentative agreement with unions which should avert a strike by drivers and technicians. General Motors, down sharply earlier in the week on analysts' downgrades, rallied Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 , but Ford, which had performed relatively well this week, eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 . The Dow was weighted down by a poor performance from pharmaceuticals group Merck, which dipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 1/2 in 3.3m shares traded after early figures for prescriptions of Merck's prostate drug Proscar came in below expectations. Unisys rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 9 1/8 after the computer group declared a Dollars 1.40625 a share dividend on its series 'A' cumulative convertible preferred stock, payable October 15. On the Nasdaq market, Athena Neurosciences moved ahead Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 8 5/8 after saying results of new studies had backed its plan to develop tests and therapeutic drugs for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease. Checkers Drive-In added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 22 on news that it will open 60 stores in and around Philadelphia in the next two years. Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed in subdued dealings as the market remained wary about a possible key rate increase by the Bank of Canada to defend the Canadian dollar. The TSE 300 index gained 6.2 at 3,410.6, but declines led advances by 263 to 252. Volume came to 27.3m shares.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article based on Russian Goskomstat Materials: "Will They </F> Help To Take Us Away From the Brink of the Abyss?]    [Text] The economic crisis is not dying away. The  materials of Russian Goskomstat are convincing indication of  this. At the end of May, the President of Russia passed a group  of edicts for a true breakthrough in the critical situation.  <H5>  Macroeconomic Indicators </H5>   The basic indicators characterizing the January-April 1994  results are presented below:                      January-April    In % of corresponding   April    Reference.                    1994             period in 1993          1994     January-April 1993                                                             in %     in % of                                                             of       January-April 1992                                                             March                                                             1994   Economic  Indicators   Gross domestic    142              83  product -- trln  rubles   Industrial        77               74.6        73.1        93       81.4  output volume  -- trln rub.

Goods  and services hold approximately equal shares of its volume, and  about 7 percent -- net (less state subsidies) taxes on products,  and on imports to which added-value tax, excise and import  duties apply.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Trln rub.         |In % of total     |Reference: 1993 i-|  |                  |                  |                  |n % of total      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gross domestic pr-|142               |100               |100               |  |oduct             |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |including: commod-|63.3              |44.6              |49                |  |ity production    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |service production|69.2              |48.7              |42                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |net taxes on prod-|9.5               |6.7               |9                 |  |ucts and imports  |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The proportion of services in the structure of the GDP  continues to increase, and the relative proportion of net taxes  on products and imports continues to decrease. In the 1st  quarter they constituted respectively 47.8 percent and 8 percent.    On the whole for January-April of this year, the decrease in  the gross domestic product was 17 percent. The drop was caused  by a further cut in output, work and services in the physical  production sectors.    The composite price index (GDP index-deflator) in  January-April of this year was 705 percent as compared to the  January-April 1993 level.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   In January-April of this year, Russian industry produced  goods worth R77 trillion at existing prices, including R21  trillion worth in April. The physical production volume, as  compared with January-April last year, decreased by 25.4  percent, including a 26.9 percent decrease in April (in  January-April 1993, it decreased by 18.6 percent, including a  16.4 percent decrease in April).    The average daily output in April of this year, as compared  with the same month last year, decreased by 25.2 percent, and as  compared with March of this year -- by 3.3 percent.    The dynamics of industrial products output by months of  1992-1994 can be seen from the following graph:   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-066-22A>      (in percent of the corresponding month of 1991) </FIG>     The production volume decreased to the greatest extent in  the  sectors producing primarily goods for investment purposes and  non-food consumer goods. For example, while in the fuel-energy  sectors the output of goods, during the period of the year that  had elapsed, decreased by 11 percent, and of the food industry  -- by 21 percent, in machine building the decrease was 45  percent, in chemicals and petrochemicals -- by 35 percent, the  timber, woodworking and pulp-and-paper industry and industrial  building materials -- by 32 percent and in the light industry  sector -- by 39 percent.    The number of enterprises having prolonged shutdowns of all  or some production facilities increased. While in January of  this year they numbered 3,800, in April there were over 5,000.  The main reason for the shutdowns were difficulties in selling  the products because of the consumers' inability to pay.    In January-April 1994, of the 406 most important types of  products, recorded in urgent returns, the production volume, as  compared with January-April 1993:    Increased for 24 items (including iron-ore pellets, coking  equipment, cash registers, sulfur, parquetry, ceramic floor  tiles, cotton fabric, freezers, mayonnaise, sausage items,  cheese and brynza [sheep-milk cheese], live and salted fish,  cognac, toothpaste), or 6 percent of the total number;    Decreased for 377 items, or 93 percent of the total number.  In this case, the output of 283 items (70 percent of the total  number) decreased by one-fourth and over, among them:  lubricating oil, rolled sheet metal, roll-formed steel, steel  pipes, steam, gas and hydraulic turbines, diesels and  diesel-generators, freight and passenger railcars, city  telephone communication cables, metal cutting machine tools,  press-forging machines, trolleybuses, tractors, rolling  bearings, mineral fertilizers, pesticides, synthetic dyes,  synthetic resins and plastics, chemical fibers and filaments,  synthetic rubbers, motor vehicle tires, lumber, wood-fiber and  wood-chip boards, cardboard, cement, prefabricated reinforced  concrete structures, wall materials, asbestos board, asbestos,  ceramic plumbing items, fabric of all types except cotton,  hosiery items, knitted outer wear, garment items, footwear,  sewing and washing machines, electric vacuum cleaners, tape  recorders, radio-receiving devices, television sets, cereal and  macaroni items.    No computer or computer-control complexes, cutters, shunting  or industrial diesel locomotives, scrapers or harvesters were  produced in the elapsed period of the year.  <H5>  Standard of Living </H5>   Income of the population. The monetary income of  the population in January-April of this year amounted to R78  trillion and was 8.5-fold higher than in the corresponding  period of 1993.    The available monetary income (income less compulsory  payments), based on the consumer price index, rose by  approximately 12 percent.    In April 1993, 26 percent of the population had average per  capita monetary incomes of up to R10,000 a month, 40 percent --  from R10,000-R20,000, 27 percent -- from R20,000 to R40,000 and  7 percent -- over R40,000.    The coefficient of concentration of incomes (Dow Jones  index)  in April 1994 was 0.311 (in April 1993 -- 0.353).    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Distribution of Total Volume of Monetary Income by Population Groups (in p-|  |ercent)                                                                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |April                                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1992              |1993              |1994              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |All monetary inco-|100               |100               |100               |  |mes of the popula-|                  |                  |                  |  |tion              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |including groups of the population (20% each)                              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |first (with lowes-|10.6              |6.8               |7.8               |  |t incomes)        |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |second            |15.3              |11.6              |12.7              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |third             |19.2              |16.4              |17.3              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |fourth            |23.8              |23.2              |23.4              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |fifth (with highe-|31.1              |42.0              |38.8              |  |st incomes)       |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The mass of monetary income of the fifth group of the  population exceeded the mass of monetary income of the first  group in April 1992 by a factor of 2.9, 1993 -- by a factor of  6.2 and 1994 -- a factor of 5.    The change in amount of the subsistence minimum for the  population of the Russian Federation in 1994 (determined in  accordance with the methodology of the Russian Ministry of  Labor) is shown in the following table (on the average -- thous.  rubles per month):    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |              |including                                   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |Entire popula-|Fit for work  |Pensioners    |Children      |  |              |tion          |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |January       |47.2          |53.1          |33.3          |47.7          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |February      |54.8          |61.6          |38.6          |55.3          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |March         |60.4          |67.9          |42.6          |61.0          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |April         |66.5          |74.8          |46.9          |67.2          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The incomes of 11 percent of the population (16 million  persons) in April 1994 were below the subsistence minimum,  including the incomes of 3 percent of the population not  reaching the produce "basket" value, which, in estimating the  subsistence minimum, was R45,400.    According to the estimate, the average wage put down for  workers, on the whole for Russia in April of this year, was  R175,000, and rose by 6 percent as compared with March of this  year and by a factor of 1.3 as compared with January.    The monthly increase in wages in March of this year in the  sectors of the material sphere was 15 percent, nonproduction --  11 percent.    The amount of social payments and benefits in March of this  year, calculated per worker, was R14,700, and increased by a  factor of 1.5 as compared with February. The highest payments of  a social nature were for extending credit and insurance --  R105,100, material-technical supply and sales -- R47,200. At  public health and education institutions, they were respectively  R6,900 and R7,400, calculated per worker.    The consumer basket. The value of the "basket"  made up of the 19 basic food products at the end of April was  R47,600 estimated for the month. During the month it rose by 7.5  percent, and since the beginning of the year -- by 55 percent.  The differentiation in the value of the basket for individual  regions in April was 4.5-fold. The minimum value of the basket  was recorded at Ulyanovsk (R28,700), and the maximum -- in  Magadan (R128,400). In Moscow and St. Petersburg, its value in  April was respectively R52,500 and R49,800.    Employment. The number of unemployed in the  Russian Federation at the end of April was 4.5 million people,  or 6.0 percent of the economically active population. They  included about 1.2 million people with the official status of  unemployed in the state employment agencies (1.5 percent of the  economically active population). In addition, the number of  persons forced into partial work-week conditions and on leave  without pay or with partial pay was estimated at 4.5 million  people.    Therefore, in April of this year, the total potential of  unemployed was 9.0 million people (in March of this year -- 8.8  million people).  Footnotes    1. Data on the volume of sales of consumer goods and  services  to the population are presented on the basis of an expert  evaluation of the volumes of sale at unregistered enterprises,  and also on the basis of unorganized import and sale of consumer  goods by private persons.    2. April 1994.    3. April 1994 as compared to December 1993.    4. April 1993 (in % of April 1992).</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Nakamura outlines plans to iron out Ilva's troubles - Changes at the ailing steel group MR HAYAO Nakamura conforms little to the stereotype of the Japanese business manager, despite his uniform blue suit and Nippon Steel badge on his lapel. He has spent more than 30 years working in Italy, mostly with Nippon Steel, speaks good Italian, and has just accepted a remarkable challenge. He has agreed to take over as chief executive of Ilva, Italy's ailing state-run steel group. The 56-year-old Mr Nakamura is the first Japanese to be recruited into such a senior post in a state-run European industry. He has also been offered the job in a country which has been the most protective about letting in Japanese industrial competition. 'I was surprised that Ilva was desperate enough to ask a foreigner, but at the same time I was taken by the brave decision,' he said yesterday. 'I first thought it would be easier if I didn't accept the offer.' His appointment, announced on January 22, followed the dismissal of the Ilva board by IRI, the Italian state-holding company which is the shareholder of the steel group. Mr Nakamura, who left Nippon Steel last month, will take over on February 18. Unlike most Japanese executives who are reserved, he is prepared to give straightforward opinions. He has few illusions about the problems of tackling Ilva with its debts of over L8,300bn (Dollars 5.5bn) and the urgent need to restructure as the group struggles to cope with excess capacity and falling European steel prices. Ilva, which emerged from the remains of the former Finsider group, is expected to have losses for 1992 near L2,000bn. He already knows the Italian steel industry well, having worked on the extension of the vast Taranto complex in the mid-1970s and helped Ilva with its Novi Ligure rolled coils facility. But being an outsider, Mr Nakamura says, will allow him to take what could become drastic restructuring measures. An insider - or even another European executive - would have found it more difficult to take painful decisions. The implication of these comments is that he plans big changes in the Italian steel industry. He believes the restructuring process will take up to three years and can be achieved via a mixture of changes in management, finance and production. He regards it as important to eliminate political appointees in Ilva management - this is also the philosophy of Mr Michele Tedeschi, the increasingly powerful chief executive of IRI. Further resort to outside talent will be limited, he says; and he claims that he has no plans to bring in former colleagues from Nippon Steel. The most pressing problem he envisages will be dealing with the workforce and Ilva's suppliers. He wants to instill a greater sense of responsibility for Ilva's products among the 40,000 strong workforce. He warned Italy's highly unionsed workforce that he would not be seeking consensus at any price, and that he would take a tough line on strikes and overtime. He appears determined to tackle head-on the restructuring of the vast Taranto complex located in the heel of southern Italy. The importance of Taranto to local employment makes the issue of restructuring this plant politically sensitive. But having advised on the plant's engineering, he reckons he is one of the few outsiders who know how to run Taranto. On the financial side, he anticipates Ilva will transfer two-thirds of its debts to a separate corporation. This is a pattern which IRI is also following with Iritecna, its troubled general contracting group, whose board was dismissed last week. He denies suggestions of special ties being developed between his former employers, and Ilva. But he recognises technological ties may be enhanced, especially in new steelmaking processes; and in an increasingly competitive international market his new employers in Italy may need all the help they can get.</p>

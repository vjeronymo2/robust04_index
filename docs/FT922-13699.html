			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): The thinking person's chip A NEW MICROCHIP developed by a British university research group allows computers to carry out complex tasks like financial forecasting and business modelling better than humans, writes Frank Brown. The chip, dubbed the probabilistic Ram (pRam), mimics the behaviour of brain cells more closely than any previous technology. 'This is the first time that some of the important functions of a nerve cell have been harnessed electronically,' said JG Taylor of the University of London team which developed the device. 'It accepts data from its teacher, makes decisions, changes its connections internally and becomes as good as its teacher,' he said. The pRam contains 256 cells, or neural nodes, and is 1,000 times faster than existing software-based neural networks. By linking them together large-scale artificial neural networks can be created. In addition to business and financial forecasting, applications include speech, vision and pattern recognition, scientific and statistical modelling.

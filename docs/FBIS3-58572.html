Speaking during his visit to Kipoi border checkpoint  this morning, Evert referred to Greek-Turkish relations and  stressed:    [Begin Evert recording] This is the guardpost of Greek and  European interests. This should be understood by the Europeans  as well as the Turks. They should realize that for the good of  the Greek and Turkish people, this border and this bridge should  be one of cooperation between the peoples, because diplomatic  and political impasses benefit no one. We are going through a  period in which all people and all governments should do  everything possible for peace. It will be useful if Turkey  understands this. [end recording]    Evert also stressed that when the Greek people are united,  they do not lose national battles. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: Snatched by the Gods/Broken Strings - Opera On their way to the Munich Biennale, the destination of so much new opera these days, two pieces by Param Vir were presented for the first time last week under the auspices of Netherlands Opera at the Amsterdam Studios. The cast was largely British, as was fitting when the composer's language - his musical language as well as the language of his librettos - has become so British since he came to England from his native India eight years ago. Studying with Maxwell Davies and Oliver Knussen may have helped. However Snatched by the Gods, the earlier of these chamber operas, suggested Britten's Curlew River as the nearer neighbour. This is also a story of pilgrimage, a boat crossing and the death of a boy. There is even a close musical connection in the wan falls with which so many of the vocal phrases end. Quite bizarrely, an Indian composer's treatment of an Indian story (based on a poem of Tagore) sounded for all the world like a piece of European exoticism, its main distinction being in the instrumental music, evoking moods of the sea in the way of another Britten work. The companion piece, Broken Strings, is musically more individual and instrumentally even more lustrous: hearing it played so superbly by the ASKO Ensemble under David Porcelijn was like turning the pages of a richly illuminated Persian or Moghul book. The story, too, is more interesting: a Buddhist parable, adapted by David Rudkin. A young musician, proudly confident of winning the competition for a royal appointment, is astonished when his elder rival continues to play on a broken instrument, summoning magic animals - an elephant, a fish, a peacock  -with his music. The young man breaks his own instrument. Nothing happens. Param Vir's music rapturously takes hold of the opportunities here for illustration, in matching, for instance, the characters and speeds of the magic animals, and even in tackling the rather trickier matter of suggesting the celestial music the old musician plays. In remaining at that level of illustration, though, the composer may have been too modest; the piece begins as spoken drama, and the role of the music is not so far above that of the rich brocade costumes invented by Chloe Obolesnky for the magic animals, a role of beautification. One wanted the supple solo woodwind lines, the inventive string effects and the suave textures woven around harp and two horns to be more at the heart of the matter, as they might with a more suggestive, ambiguous sort of drama. Pierre Audi directed the two pieces with care and tact. There were excellent performances from Cynthia Buchan and Katherine Ciesinski as the main women characters in Snatched by the Gods - the one strident in warmth, the other warm in stridency - and from Christopher Gillett and Richard Suart as the two musicians in Broken Strings, a show almost stolen by Nuala Willis's deep-voiced magic elephant.</p>

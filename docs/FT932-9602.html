			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: NatWest claims curb on job losses NATIONAL Westminster Bank has managed to avoid a large number of compulsory redundancies among its 93,000 employees this year despite its intention to shed 4,000 jobs, Lord Alexander, the bank's chairman, said yesterday. Lord Alexander told the Commons employment committee that only 97 staff had been made compulsorily redundant in the first four months of the year, and another 221 had accepted voluntary redundancy. Other jobs were being lost through natural wastage. He said that the net loss of 15,000 jobs between 1988 and last year had been caused by a combination of technological change and the sharper than expected dip into recession. Lord Alexander said there had been 'negligible' recruitment of school-leavers in the past three years as the bank tried to combat the surge in its recruitment in the late 1980s. The bank disclosed that it anticipated a cut of 25 per cent - from 815m to 602m - in the number of cheques it will clear this year compared to 1988. Lord Alexander said the switch towards electronic forms of payment was eliminating jobs. Mr Leif Mills, general secretary of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, said that NatWest had made 1,500 staff compulsorily redundant last year, but unions had reached an agreement which would reduce the number this year.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (3): Divided Meffsa looks both ways - Derivatives, the tale of two cities has ended in a compromise AFTER A squabble that pitted Madrid against Barcelona and which dragged on for more than two years, Spain finally got its future and options markets act together last December. Both cities had tried to be all things to all men, competed against each other and ended up delivering nothing very much to anybody. In December's compromise, Madrid and Barcelona jointly backed an overseeing holding company called Meffsa (the Mercado de Futuros Financieros SA), which is based in Barcelona, and each obtained that part of the action which was most suited to it. The need to sort out the rivalry was made all the more pressing by the fact that everything else was more or less in place to aid the rapid expansion of derivatives in Spain. The domestic financial markets had been fully liberalised, thus accelerating the already strong inflow of foreign investment, and domestic mutual funds were growing at a spectacular pace. Meffsa was effectively segmented into Meffsa Renta Variable (RV), which deals with equities and is located in Madrid; and Meffsa Renta Fija (RF), which is headquartered in Barcelona and deals with fixed-interest security and currency contracts. The sensible compromise recognised Madrid's dominant role in the Spanish stockmarkets. The home of on-line trading, Madrid's Bolsa , towers over its sister markets in Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia, and accounts for more than 80 per cent of the Spanish stockmarket business. In locating security futures in Barcelona, the compromise was also an appropriate nod to this city's inventiveness and to its determined ambition to establish a niche for itself in Spain's financial sector. The purposeful software investment undertaken by Barcelona's Meffsa RF has drawn plaudits from clients and could earn it high additional returns. One of the more striking aspects of the Barcelona operation is that it has a 16-strong team allocated to its systems, 12 of whose members work fulltime to develop the software. Meffsa RF is negotiating the sale of its systems to potential futures markets in Argentina, Malaysia, Norway and Portugal. Barcelona's star product is its 10-year notional government bond, which was launched in March. Meffsa RF has flopped, however, in its attempt to develop currency contracts in pesetas/dollar and pesetas/Deutsche Mark. The varying fortunes illustrate the start up difficulties. The fixed-interest business, which has drawn in 14 marketmakers so far, has a lot of room for growth, for only some 10 per cent of the existing mutual funds have accounts open at Meffsa RF. This low proportion reflects, in part, a current administrative limbo, as the Barcelona market and the fund managers await full clarification from the market regulator, the CNMV, on norms over hedging. As soon as this hurdle is crossed, Meffsa RF rightly believes that every fund manager who wants to be considered a professional will have to maintain open a futures account. Liquidity has, however, demonstrably failed to materialise in the currency futures market, which presently accounts for as little as 1 per cent of Meffsa RF turnover. There are just three marketmakers dealing in currency futures, and they offer no competition to the existing over the counter (OTC) swaps favoured by the big clearing banks. Meffsa RV, in Madrid, began offering contracts in January on Ibex 35, the Spanish stock market index which lists the 35 biggest quoted companies. In September, it hopes to offer contracts on individual stocks, some of which, such as the telecommunications giant Telefonica, the energy group Repsol and the utilities Endesa and Iberdrola, are well known to foreign investors. The inevitable problem that Meffsa RV faces is that it is too narrow. This is not surprising, for it mirrors the existing reality of the Spanish equities market. It is a difficulty that is nevertheless exacerbated by a widely shared view that Spanish managers have still a lot to learn about hedging. 'The market is already narrow, but the lack of skills among certain corporate treasures is making it even narrower,' says Mr Ian Triay, of Lloyds Bank's corporate division in Madrid. Mr Michael Hyman, investment director of GH Asset Management in London, criticises a 'reluctance' that he perceives among Meffsa's marketmakers to live up to their title. He faults them for failing to establish two-way prices, to match buyers and sellers and, in the final analysis, to make markets. 'When people come here with their presentations, I tell them: 'You don't have convince me to invest in Spain, because that's exactly what I want to do',' says Mr Hyman. 'I end up telling them to make things more efficient and to create a market that will allow in people like me.' In their defence, Meffsa executives say that these are still early days in what remains a fledgling market. They have done the hard part, which is to put the show on the road.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $2.4 BILLION SOUGHT;  </P> <P> VIACOM SUES HBO AND TIME, CLAIMS PREDATORY TACTICS  </P> <P> Viacom International, whose Showtime pay television service has long been an  underdog to Home Box Office, Tuesday sued HBO and parent Time Inc. for trying  to illegally muscle out competitors.  </P> <P> Seeking $2.4 billion in damages, Viacom said Time's vast cable system has given  unfair preference to HBO and Time's other cable channel, Cinemax, and has  refused to air competing services such as Showtime. The suit, filed in U.S.  District Court in Manhattan, also accused HBO of using its competitive clout to  tie up the best movies offered by the Hollywood studios, thus blocking their  use by other pay-TV services.  </P> <P> The suit contended that Time and HBO have violated federal antitrust laws "by  engaging in . . . predatory and exclusionary acts and strategies designed to  increase the costs of their rivals, raise barriers to entry and expansion, and  otherwise entrench themselves as monopolists."  </P> <P> Time responded that it considers the suit to be "totally baseless" and said it  expects to be vindicated after a vigorous defense.  </P> <P> The publishing and entertainment conglomerate noted in a statement that many of  the allegations "rehash issues that have been periodically raised for more than  a decade."  </P> <P> On several occasions, Time said, "the Justice Department has reviewed many if  not all of these allegations and repeatedly concluded that no action was  warranted.  </P> <P> "The timing and content of Viacom's suit are curious, inasmuch as Showtime has  initiated and aggressively pursued practices it now condemns. Particularly  ironic is the allegation of Viacom -- itself a significant cable operator --  that all cable operators are local monopolists, a claim we strongly dispute."  </P> <P> Many observers of the cable television industry said they were not surprised  that Viacom has challenged Time. Combined, Time's pay services have 2 1/2 times  the viewership of Showtime and the Movie Channel, Viacom's two pay channels.  </P> <P> According to figures published in January by Paul Kagan Associates, a research  firm in Carmel, Calif., that follows the cable industry, HBO has 17 million  subscribers, or 45.7% of the market. Its companion channel, Cinemax, holds  16.2% of the market, with 6 million subscribers. Showtime has 6.7 million  subscribers, or 17.8%, and Movie Channel, with 2.7 million subscribers, has a  7.3% share.  </P> <P> Named in the suit in addition to Time and HBO were American Television &amp;  Communications Corp., which is 82% owned by Time and is the nation's  second-largest cable operator; and Manhattan Cable Television, which operates  the only cable system serving Lower Manhattan's 370,000 homes. Viacom's cable  operation is the nation's 10th-largest system.  </P> <P> At issue in the case are several practices that have earned the cable business  a reputation as a "very nasty, strong-arm business," in the words of one  longtime observer of the industry.  </P> <P> One notable practice is "tiering," in which a cable operator requires customers  to buy one cable channel before it can buy another. In its suit, Viacom said  HBO has "induced and coerced" cable operators in certain local markets to  require subscribers to buy HBO and/or Cinemax before they may purchase Showtime  and/or Movie Channel. As a result, Viacom said, its business has suffered.  </P> <P> Another issue is "time lock." Under that practice, Viacom alleged, HBO has used  its power to induce cable operators not to promote Showtime and the Movie  Channel during the three two-month periods each year that HBO is heavily  marketed.  </P> <P> Also involved is "exclusivity," in which a company such as HBO or Showtime  locks up exclusive rights to a studio's movies for showing over the pay TV  channels.  </P> <P> The suit was filed by Viacom International and Showtime Networks, both  subsidiaries of Viacom Inc.  </P> <P> The suit put actual monetary damage to Viacom at no less than $800 million.  Under antitrust laws, damage awards are tripled. The amount actually sought is  $2.4 billion. Viacom also seeks to have Time barred from any further  anti-competitive actions.  </P> <P> Stock in both Viacom and Time fell in composite New York Stock Exchange  trading. Viacom shares dropped $1.375 to $53.375; Time sank $1.125 to $115.  </P> <P> This is not the first time that bigness has come under fire in pay television.  In 1981, a federal judge in New York pulled the plug on Premiere, a national  pay television network formed by Getty Oil Co. and four major film studios,  just two days before it was to be launched.  </P> <P> In blocking the network, the judge agreed with government attorneys that the  venture probably would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act because the  participating film studios planned to withhold their motion pictures from  competing pay TV services for nine months after being licensed to Premiere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Original Programming  </P> <P> Most of the programming on HBO and Cinemax consists of recently released  theatrical motion pictures, often purchased from studios on an exclusive basis.  HBO also recently has concentrated on producing original programming, including  movies and comedy and musical specials. It recently aired "Murderers Among Us:  The Simon Wiesenthal Story" and produces an annual "Comic Relief" special that  raises money for the homeless.  </P> <P> Showtime's most prominent original programming was "It's Garry Shandling's  Show," which it recently sold to Fox. It concentrates almost exclusively on  acquiring theatrical motion pictures.  </P> <P> Viacom also operates four advertiser-supported programming channels, including  MTV: Music Television, and Nickelodeon.  </P> <P> A handful of Viacom and Showtime executives formerly held top posts with HBO.  </P> <P> They include Viacom President and Chief Executive Frank J. Biondi, who joined  HBO in 1978 and eventually became president and chief executive. Winston H.  (Tony) Cox, chairman and chief executive of Showtime Networks Inc., at one time  was also president of HBO. Matt Blank, executive vice president of marketing  for Showtime, held a similar post at HBO.  </P> <P> One Wall Street analyst, who declined to be identified, said the presence of  the former HBO executives at Viacom lent some credibility to the suit. "If  anybody should know, it's Frank Biondi," he said.  </P> <P> Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, said the case could be  viewed as "an isolated incident, . . . a legal squabble." However, he noted,  there is the far broader issue of Time's plan to merge with Warner  Communications Inc.  </P> <P> Itself a cable system operator and movie maker, Warner would give Time  additional clout by giving it control of more subscribers and programming.  </P> <P> "It depends on how the whole issue of competition plays itself out (after the  merger)," Gerbrandt noted. "Viacom has been concerned over the Time-Warner  merger and what that means for broader access to markets."  </P> <P> At one time, Warner owned half of Showtime but sold its share to Viacom, then  its partner in the venture. Warner, which still carries Showtime over its cable  systems, was not named in the suit.  </P> <P> Although the suit mentions the merger at great length, a spokeswoman for Viacom  told Reuters that "it is not Viacom's intention to enjoin the Time-Warner  merger." And Viacom pointed out in a statement that its lawsuit has been in the  works for "over a year."  </P> <P> Observers noted that the complex case, which has been assigned to U.S. District  Judge John Walker, is likely to take years to resolve.  </P> <P> "Essentially, the complaint calls into question the whole history of the pay TV  and cable TV business over the last 20 years," said a source close to HBO.  "It's an enormous amount of territory to cover."  </P> <P> "This will be an enormously complicated case to try," said John Higgins,  financial editor of Multichannel News, a New York-based publication that tracks  the cable industry. "The discovery process is going to take years because of  the intricacy of the charges" and the number of cable systems involved.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC, THE NEW-FASHIONED WAY;  </P> <P> IMCDS -- INTERACTIVE, MULTIMEDIA COMPACT DISCS -- PLACE A COMPUTERIZED  ENCYCLOPEDIA AT YOUR FINGERTIPS AS YOU LISTEN TO THE MASTERS  </P> <P> Imagine listening to a compact disc and simultaneously having access to a  computerized, user-friendly, verbal and visual encyclopedia about the music.  </P> <P> For example, you're listening to Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 and the  computer program -- in a chapter about musical pitches -- informs you:  "Musicians eventually became frustrated. Picture the situation: Wonderful tunes  were invented, became Top 40 chants, but suddenly were forgotten because  someone's memory lapsed. No wonder Gregorian chants were simple -- what else  was a poor monk to do."  </P> <P> Welcome to the world of IMCDs: interactive, multimedia compact discs.  </P> <P> Not too many people know they exist, and few have the equipment on which to  play them. But they and their equivalents are destined to play a role in home  entertainment of the 1990s.  </P> <P> According to Allan Ayars, director of multimedia industry services for  Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, probably fewer than 10,000 of  these systems exist. But by 1994, Ayars expects the market for the systems to  reach half a million, driven by the rapidly increasing number of software  producers.  </P> <P> That's why companies are lavishing thousands of hours and hundreds of thousands  of dollars on so few potential customers. To Santa Monica-based Voyager Co.,  it's all about publishing. "Our goal is to be the Random House of tomorrow,"  spokesman Bob Stein says. "But tomorrow isn't here yet. What we're trying to do  now is to establish our position and survive."  </P> <P> To Warner New Media, the issue is keeping competitive in an uncertain future.  Company president Stan Cornyn says, "If you're a large corporation, you don't  want to be blindsided by new technology," but he adds that "I would like to see  more players out there. It's kind of strange to be making a lot of phonograph  records for a universe where there are no phonographs."  </P> <P> IMCDs are played on a CD-ROM player hooked up to a Macintosh personal computer  and an audio playback system. The most visible IMCDs to date, classical music  presentations from Voyager and Warner New Media, demonstrate the medium's  potential to such great effect that both the home electronics and the computer  industries are convinced that these classical music IMCDs have opened a window  onto the future.  </P> <P> "These programs allow people to manipulate audio and visual information with  the power they previously had only over words and numbers," says Peter Bloch,  president of Interactive Production Associates in Santa Monica, whose company  made the interactive programs on illuminated manuscripts that you can see at  the Getty Museum in Malibu.  </P> <P> "Compare the multimedia programs with books, and you can see that we're  offering an entertaining, gamelike environment. If a picture is worth a  thousand words, an interactive multimedia environment containing words and  pictures is worth ten thousand."  </P> <P> Interactive multimedia has been around since the '70s for industrial and  educational purposes. Until late 1988, however, it was too expensive for the  home. That changed in late 1988, with the development of sound generating  software for CD-ROMs (read-only memory compact discs with massive storage  capacities). Since then, most of the world's major entertainment and computer  companies, including Sony, Philips, IBM, Intel, Yamaha, Apple, Commodore and  NEC, have embraced the concept.  </P> <P> The system recommended by both Voyager and Warner New Media consists of an  Apple Macintosh computer with at least one megabyte of memory, an  Apple-compatible hard drive with at least five megabytes of free space, an  Apple-compatible CD-ROM drive, and an audio playback system. Prices for the  computer components have fallen as low as $1,700 (down from $3,200 just 12  months ago), but getting into this new technology may still be too expensive  for many otherwise interested consumers. The alternative, unfortunately, is an  indefinite waiting time, until the Voyager and Warner Media programs are made  available for MS-DOS setups and such specific players as Commodore's CDTV, due  this fall, and Sony-Philips' CDI machine, due in 1991.  </P> <P> Why classical music? Laura Boddine, president of Tiger Media in Downey, whose  first interactive multimedia program, Airwave Adventures, the Case of the  Cautious Condor, was recently named Best Adventure program in Japan, explains:  "Classical music is a niche market. When CD audio came out, classical music  products were important because there was a ready market, even though it was a  small one.  </P> <P> "Interactive multimedia is a very expensive medium to work in, there's no  installed base. But there's lots of public-domain content available and no  royalties have to be paid to Beethoven or Mozart."  </P> <P> More important is Apple's Macintosh, an ideal computer on which to develop a  multimedia product -- its graphics-based environment and HyperCard software  suited to recording, connecting, relating and remembering the staggering number  of words, pictures and sounds that the interactive medium requires.  </P> <P> Each classical IMCD contains a complete audio recording plus information on the  music's history, technical features and stylistic content in the form of text  and pictures, viewed on the computer's screen, and additional musical examples  and audio commentaries. A "mouse," the Macintosh's interactive pointing device,  is used to move from one information screen to another with a technique called  "clicking." You can simply listen to the music straight through with or without  reading the screens, or concentrate on individual movements or even single  chords that you can repeat over and over.  </P> <P> The first classical IMCD was Beethoven's Ninth, using Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt's  Vienna Philharmonic recording. It was written by UCLA professor Robert Winter  and published in 1989 by Voyager as the first title in its CD Companion Series  ($99). Apple CEO John Sculley was impressed: In his opening remarks to the  MacWorld Conference last fall, he heralded the Ninth as a key to the future of  computing. Consumers have been impressed: They have bought more than 6,000  copies.  </P> <P> Turning on the Macintosh and calling up the programs reveals an index card-like  screen with a picture of Beethoven and a table of contents. "Each of the five  chapters," Winter explains, "takes the user to a different level of complexity.  The simplest level is called 'The Pocket Map,' which lays the four movements  out with structural guideposts so that you have a sense of where you're going.  You can click on, say, 'First movement, second theme,' and hear the music  immediately. You can stay at this level for 20 minutes or more, having fun  going here and there, making connections at a very basic level."  </P> <P> The second level, called "Beethoven's World," supplies cultural, political and  social background on Vienna of the 1820s, where Beethoven wrote the Ninth  Symphony. Again, many of the graphics, musical instruments for example, are  linked to passages in the music that can be listened to nearly instantaneously.  The third stack, called "The Art of Listening," explains the musical  architecture of the Ninth.  </P> <P> "Just like with a painting," Winter explains, "where bits of color, shape and  form interrelate, Beethoven's Ninth consists of hundreds of individual sounds.  If you were to scramble them, the piece would not be very impressive. It is the  way in which they grow, develop, come together and unfold that the music gains  its power."  </P> <P> At the fourth level, "A Close Reading," the Ninth plays through in its entirety  while everything happening in the music is being explained in vivid, clear  English with the persuasive authority of a world-class scholar ("Just when it  does not seem possible to generate more excitement, the . . . choral entries do  just that, enlivened by a series of electrifying orchestral trills," Winter  writes of a section in the fourth movement).  </P> <P> The last level, "Fun &amp; Games," is a "Jeopardy"-like series of questions  exploiting the relationship between ideas and sound. The computer, of course,  keeps score.  </P> <P> At any moment, at any level, you can jump from movement to movement, from  section to section, simply by clicking with the mouse. And, any time there's a  technical term -- even one as basic as "movement," a clear, down to earth  explanation is only a mouse click away, often with a musical example. According  to Winter, "A reasonably alert 8-year-old will be able to use the CD Companion  as well as a seasoned 80-year-old."  </P> <P> The second classical IMCD was Mozart's "Magic Flute," using Nikolaus  Harnoncourt's 1988 Zurich recording. It was written by a team supervised by Cal  State Fullerton's Irene Gurtin and published three months ago by Burbank-based  Warner New Media as the first title in its Audio Notes series ($66). Customers  at Tower's Sunset Strip classical store were impressed. The store has sold out  two shipments and is waiting for its third.  </P> <P> Although the "Flute" operates in exactly the same way as Beethoven's Ninth --  using a mouse to move from screen to screen, exploring relationships between  music and information -- there are more than minor cosmetic differences. Warner  New Media head Stan Cornyn explains that "Voyager's is at this point looked  upon as a Robert Winter vehicle, in the best sense. His Beethoven Ninth  therefore was an attempt to communicate what he had to say about Beethoven's  Ninth.  </P> <P> "We took a different approach, putting all sorts of extra audio on. We have  narrators talking, Florence Foster Jenkins singing, and so on. Our HyperCard  stack, between 7,000 and 10,000 cards, is much larger and tends to encompass a  great deal more. We are trying not to take one man's idiosyncratic view of  anything, but trying to present a broader sense of things. Theirs is the auteur  approach, ours the generalist's."  </P> <P> Given the lively sense of competition between the two companies (Cornyn and  Winter worked together at one point), it's not surprising that their new titles  share such enhancements as audio commentaries and graphic representations.  Previewing Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps" from Voyager, using the Charles  Dutoit/Montreal Symphony recording and written by Winter (scheduled for release  this month), and Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 from Warner New Media, using  the Vermeer Quartet's recording and written by a team supervised by  editor-in-chief Cynthia Woll (scheduled for September), revealed improved  production values and greater ease of handling.  </P> <P> Woll's Beethoven Quartet ($50) also reveals more personality than the "Magic  Flute," combining authoritative eloquence with a delightful sense of humor.  </P> <P> Its five main levels (called "Spines" as if they were the spines of books)  allow real-time, full-length analyses of the work from levels suitable for  beginners to levels suitable to experienced listeners. The "Blueprint" spine  contains graphic representation of the music and the "Notebook" spine allows  the user to enter his or her own thoughts. At all times, "hotkey" options  appear on screen like sidebars in magazines. When you're reading the "Tempo  Guide" screen, for example, you can "hotkey" (the Warner nomenclature for mouse  clicking) to "Beethoven &amp; The Metronome," "Quartet Map," or "Index"; while  reading an "Exploring the Music" screen, you can "hotkey" to "About Melody,"  "Chamber Music Lovers" or "About Chamber Music."  </P> <P> Although Voyager's new "Sacre du Printemps" ($99.95) is also expanded and  improved, the format is the same: The opening screen offers menu choices  including "A Pocket Guide" (a one-screen orientation to the entire work);  "Stravinsky's World" (on the composer's life and times); "Rite Listening" (a  chatty introduction to the music); "Dancing the Rite" (discussing the actual  production); "A Close Reading," a real-time commentary, and "The Rite Game."  </P> <P> If, after listening to the opening bassoon solo, you want to hear a bassoon all  by itself, you go to the glossary, click on bassoon and the bassoon plays  alone. You can access all the instruments of the orchestra, each with a  characteristic audio excerpt from "Sacre."  </P> <P> Voyager does offer a unique product, the CD AudioStack, a stand-alone program  retailing for $99.95 that allows CD-ROM users to play and precisely control  off-the-shelf CDs. It's like making your own CD Companion.  </P> <P> The future? Voyager has Winter doing the first three Brandenburg Concertos and  histories of early jazz and mid-'50s rock in the planning stages, while, later  this month, he and the Angeles Quartet will do a five-camera shoot of Mozart's  Quartet K. 465, for the first time adding video to the menu of options. Warner  New Media's schedule includes Brahms' German Requiem, Berlioz's "Symphonie  Fantastique," Benjamin Britten's "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra" and  Arnold Schoenberg's "Pierrot Lunaire," the last written by Schoenberg Institute  head Leonard Stein.  </P> <P> There's little doubt that both Mozart and Beethoven would have been eager and  consummate multimedia authors. Not only was Mozart a superb writer, as attested  to by his voluminous letters, but he was an avid game player who invented a  do-it-yourself composing method using dice. And, adds Winter, "Beethoven called  himself a Tonkunstler, a painter with tones. Even in his time, a composer was  considered both an artist and a scientist, someone with great skill in  manipulating materials."  </P></p>

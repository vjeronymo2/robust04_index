			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhou Dongyao: "Time for Hungarians To Choose"] </F>   [Text] Budapest, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Flags of various  colors representing different parties are flying over the Danube  River bridge. Huge pictures are hung everywhere in the streets  of the capital city.    The time has arrived again for Hungarians to choose.    The Hungarian general elections, which occur every four  years, begin on May 8. Of the more than 90 parties across the  country, 15 are eligible to take part in the campaign.    The exhausted party leaders are shuttling from city to city,  from metropolis to countryside, shaking hands, smiling, making  speeches and criticizing their opponents.    Everyone in this country is waiting for the time to vote,  and  for the election results.    In these elections, voters will choose 386 new  representatives to form the new National Assembly. Those  parties with five percent of the vote will have representatives  in the Assembly.    The two or three parties with the most representatives will  form the government; the others will be opposition members.    In the 1990 elections, the Democratic Forum party received  the most votes. It allied with the Small Holder's Party and the  popular Christian Democratic [People's] Party and formed a  cabinet. The Alliance of Free Democrats, the Socialist Party  and the Federation of Young Democrats become opposition parties.    However, in the past four years great changes have taken  place. Opinion polls from the end of last year until now show  that the Socialist Party is the favorite, followed by the  Alliance of Free Democrats, the Federation of Young Democrats,  the Democratic Forum, the Small Holder's Party and the popular  Christian Democratic [People's] Party.    The ruling parties are losing their dominance, while the  opposition parties are gaining. The opposition Socialist Party,  according to the polls, could win as much as 25 percent of the  vote.    Why have such changes occurred? it is widely believed that  the change is happening because the ruling parties have not  devoted their energies to economic development.    The country's economy declines every year, budget deficits  rise, the jobless rate increases, and inflation remains high  while fraud occurs in the process of privatization. This has  all been pointed out by the opposition parties, who conclude  that "the present economic situation is worse than 1990".    The most recent opinion poll found that only one percent of  the people surveyed believe the government has done "very well",  27 percent say "good", 34 percent say "poor", 21 percent say  "very poor" and 17 percent say they don't know.    But the ruling parties insist that they have done quite  well,  and that the country has been the most stable in Eastern Europe  over the past four years. The government has achieved progress  in economic reform, and the country has gained more foreign  investment than any other in Eastern Europe. Yes, they say, the  government has made some mistakes, but they have been corrected  in time.    Peter Boross, Hungarian prime minister, believes he should  be  prime minister for another four years. He strongly opposes the  Socialist Party assuming power, and rules out an alliance with  the Alliance of Free Democrats.    Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, responding to both domestic  and foreign fears and speculations, affirmed repeatedly that  Hungary will not change its policies after the election.    However, it is believed that changes will be made in  diplomatic policy and the administrative program after the  election, though no party will change the multi-party  parliamentary system, privatization or the market economy.    Such changes, if they were to occur, would send shock waves  through the country, and no doubt in all of Eastern Europe. So  the Hungarian people face a choice with great significance.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Letter: Tax proposals will hit small oil exploration companies while benefiting large producers Sir, Since the chancellor's budget statement your pages have carried the reactions of two of the biggest North Sea oil companies to the proposed changes in the Petroleum Revenue Tax arrangements ('North Sea group may halve exploration after oil tax change', March 24). At the other end of the spectrum is a company like my own, arguably the smallest North Sea oil company and yet one which would be strongly affected if the chancellor's proposals were to be implemented. Over several rounds of North Sea licensing Croft has built up a portfolio of exploration acreage, committing to the government to carry out certain seismic surveys and drilling. Our plans and commitments had been based on a fiscal regime in which our exploration and appraisal costs could be relieved against our PRT liability from the one producing field we have, Claymore. Under the chancellor's proposals the work we shall have to carry out under those commitments to government will effectively quadruple in cost. And, similarly, any discretionary exploration or appraisal work we might wish to carry out in the UK will be made that much more costly. Expressed another way, from 1996 when the PRT changes would begin to bite, our North Sea production revenue (and hence the money available for exploration) will halve. That is how a company largely devoted to exploration and appraisal will be affected. But certain other North Sea oil companies have such large producing interests and pay such large PRT bills that their effective increase in exploration and appraisal costs under the chancellor's proposals will be outweighed by the chancellor's other proposal, to reduce the PRT rate on existing fields from 75 to 50 per cent. Such companies, although few in number, are naturally rejoicing as your March 25 headline points out: 'BP defends oil tax from attacks.' Mr John Browne of BP is reported as saying that for too long the taxpayer has subsidised exploration. The reason he is now rejoicing is because the chancellor is proposing that in future the taxpayer will instead foot the bill for BP's increase in North Sea revenue, estimated at up to Pounds 140m a year. Mr Browne is one of the few North Sea oil company executives to consider exploration levels will not be seriously affected by the proposed changes, reportedly saying that instead it will give exploration a stronger focus and make it more cost-effective. If drilling success rates have declined from 1 in 5 to 1 in 7, as he says, it is not because of inefficient exploration but because with advancing maturity the North Sea is yielding smaller discoveries of which more are falling beneath the threshold of commercial viability. 'Stronger focus' is simply a euphemism for cutting the number of wells drilled, and fewer wells will mean fewer commercially viable discoveries. The government estimates that up to 25bn barrels of oil and 44 trillion cubic feet of gas may remain to be discovered in the UK. Finding those reserves will require sustained high levels of exploration. On the whole, over the past 30 years the fiscal regime has been conducive to such exploration - that could now change.

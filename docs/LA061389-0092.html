			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> Ex-model and restaurateur Marilyn Lewis, who was once part of the Andy Warhol  clique and is now making a documentary about the artist, believes Warhol was  "one of the most unusual men of our times. He was terribly religious. He was a  voyeur regarding drugs, sex and other elements of life but not a participant."  Lewis suspects the world hasn't seen the last of Warhol. "I believe Andy is an  afterlife person. He spent his life preparing for a reincarnation." ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

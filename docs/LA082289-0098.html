			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WATER FLOWING AGAIN AS CREWS FIX DAMAGED L.A. AQUEDUCT  </P> <P> Flash-flood damage to the aqueduct that supplies Los Angeles with 75% of its  water was repaired ahead of schedule, and water has resumed flowing, officials  said Monday.  </P> <P> Water began moving through the Los Angeles Aqueduct about 8 p.m. Saturday after  extensive repair work, said Mindy Berman, a Los Angeles Department of Water and  Power spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Crews laboring around the clock completed the repairs about three days ahead of  schedule, she said.  </P> <P> The amount of water flowing through the damaged area will increase over several  days to its previous rate of about 600 cubic feet per second, aqueduct engineer  Dennis Williams said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost of $800,000  </P> <P> Repairs took 12 days and costs are expected to total about $800,000, Williams  said.  </P> <P> "They replaced about 800 linear feet of concrete panels on the sides of the  aqueduct. That's pretty fast work," said Jay Malinowski, a Metropolitan Water  District spokesman.  </P> <P> An Aug. 8 flash flood on Olancha Creek dumped tons of debris into a two-mile  stretch of the aqueduct 180 miles north of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Another storm on Aug. 10 soaked the ground, causing parts of the concrete  lining to buckle along an 800-foot stretch of the aqueduct.  </P> <P> Most of the water that would have flowed through the damaged section of the  338-mile aqueduct was held in Crowley Lake north of Bishop.  </P> <P> The new flow of water was scheduled to reach Bouquet Reservoir, the first of  several local reservoirs, north of Los Angeles near California 14, late Monday  or early today, Malinowski said.  </P></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Palestinian leaders jostle to hold economic reins: Julian Ozanne speaks to the finance minister Palestinians are determined to resist World Bank and international pressure and impose their own priorities on economic development and the allocation of foreign aid, according to the new Palestinian finance minister. In an interview Mr Mohammed Nashashibi called for donors urgently to give more money to the embryonic self-rule authority, warned about the difficulties of stringent tax collection demanded by donors, and said he favoured renegotiating the free-trade economic agreement with Israel to allow Palestinians to protect their industry. Mr Nashashibi's remarks came as the controversial Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (Pecdar) - the body originally empowered to implement, monitor and co-ordinate aid-funded projects worth Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.57bn) over five years - came under renewed pressure after Mr Hassan Abu Libdeh, Pecdar deputy managing director, threatened to resign. Mr Libdeh's threat is the result of continuing political infighting within the Palestine Liberation Organisation over who will wield power over economic development. At the heart of the matter lies a struggle between Palestinian economic ministers and fears that Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, will not desist from intervention in economics. Mr Nashashibi, a 60-year-old Arafat loyalist and former banker, said there had been a World Bank campaign to influence the composition of Pecdar to marginalise the PLO political leadership in favour of technocrats. The PLO had resisted this and would do so in the future. 'There was an attempt to prevent the political leadership from taking a leading role in building the economy and they preferred to have technocrats dealing with the World Bank without political sponsorship of the leadership,' he said. 'This is not acceptable in any part of the world and it will not succeed with us.' Mr Nashashibi, a PLO executive member since 1972, said the PLO's determination to inject its political priorities into economic development had nothing to do with donor concerns about transparency and accountability. 'There will be no transactions under the table. Everything will be over the table and we have internal and external auditing and proper procurement procedures. Now the system is so open and so clear.' The minister also said the Palestinian Finance Ministry was taking greater authority over Pecdar and would be in control of the budget and of negotiations over foreign funding of the estimated budget deficit of Dollars 168m. Mr Nashashibi's growing power over finances, aid and Pecdar at the expense of Mr Ahmed Qurie, economics and trade minister, may be one reason behind Mr Libdeh's threatened resignation. Mr Libdeh refused to indicate yesterday whether he was departing but said: 'We have to define roles in a very definite way. Regardless of who is in control everybody must work towards the same programme, otherwise the thing will blow up and the losers will be our people sitting at home hoping for results.' Mr Nashashibi, who studied at Ruskin College, Oxford, warned that the fragile peace process would quickly collapse unless donors immediately started disbursing aid promised for projects. Pecdar has presented donors with a list of emergency projects and plans to issue tenders for projects worth Dollars 200m in the next few weeks. 'Our people need to see something - not simply meetings in Washington and Paris,' the minister said. 'After one month, if we do not implement projects, I think the Gaza people will kick us out. What are the donors waiting for?' Mr Nashashibi also warned that the PLO still did not have enough money to meet the costs of running self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, particularly paying salaries to civil servants and 9,000 Palestinian police. Of the estimated budget deficit of Dollars 168m, donors have committed Dollars 133m, with Dollars 61m in a special fund administered by the World Bank and named after Mr Johan Jorgen Holst, the late Norwegian foreign minister. After long talks the World Bank agreed that the PLO draw down the Holst fund by Dollars 13m a month - a sum the PLO claims is still insufficient. Mr Nashashibi said he had paid the civil servants for July but did not have enough money to pay the policemen. He warned that the new self-rule authority would need further start-up assistance as it would be difficult to collect taxes to the level achieved under Israeli occupation. 'The way the Israelis collected taxes was inhuman and before jobs are created by projects it will be difficult to collect the taxes needed.' The minister was also critical of the PLO-Israeli free trade economic agreement which had left Palestinians without the ability to apply their own trade regime. He said he would press for a renegotiation of the agreement, even if it meant closing borders. 'Let them close the borders. I am ready to see the borders closed. The Israelis must realise they cannot continue overwhelming our economic future. How can I have my own import policy and develop industry if my market is open freely to Israeli products? You can never build your own economy if you don't protect industry.'</p>

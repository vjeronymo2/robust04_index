			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Olivetti loss worse than expected OLIVETTI, the troubled Italian computers and office equipment group, yesterday announced a bigger than expected consolidated loss of L459.8bn (Dollars 372m) for 1991 and passed its dividend for the year. In 1990 it made a profit of L60.4bn. Most of the loss came from restructuring costs as the company tackled what it said was the 'most difficult year experienced by the information technology industry worldwide'. Olivetti is undertaking a wide-ranging restructuring programme to halt declining growth in demand for computer products and confront the fierce price competition. Adjusting to the tougher conditions overshadowed its 1991 accounts. Almost L290bn of last year's loss stemmed from redundancy payments and associated interest and extraordinary charges. A further L170bn was set aside to cover 'extensive process and industrial restructurings' linked to last November's decision to scrap its former complex divisional structure and adopt a simplified model. Although only put into operation in January, the full provision for restructuring was carried on the 1991 accounts. The benefits of cost-savings on labour were partially held back by delays in government approval for last year's job cuts, meaning that most of the redundancies only took effect at year-end. Nevertheless, Olivetti's workforce shrunk by 7,200 in 1991, more than double the rate of the previous year, and helping to reduce operating costs by 2.8 per cent. At operating level, Olivetti reported a loss of L28.3bn, while sales fell by 4.8 per cent to L8,607bn. The operating figure was slightly worse than the company's earlier predictions of breaking even. Olivetti did not forecast sales or profits this year. However, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman, has said that it hoped to break even in 1992. Instead, the group stressed its financial solidity, and the signing of important new ventures this year. Net indebtedness fell by L172.6bn to L571.9bn last year, while net operating working capital dropped by 18.7 per cent to L2,549bn at the end of last year. On the sales side, first quarter revenues fell by 4.4 per cent against the same period last year, or by 3 per cent when adjusted for disposals. Olivetti reached agreement with Canon in March on a joint venture to produce computer printers and it has just announced an accord to supply personal computers to the McDonald's restaurant chain in the US. Meanwhile, the rate of cost reductions accelerated as expected as part of the group's continuing efforts to bring down its break-even point.</p>

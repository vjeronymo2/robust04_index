Eligibility/feasibility reviews will be completed in priority point score order. Where a tie in priority point score exists, the order of review will be determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section. In cases where the market study is incomplete or not in accordance with Exhibit A&hyph;8 of this subpart, applicants will be required to have the study supplemented to agree with FmHA requirements. The time involved in supplementing the market study will cause the preapplication to be delayed in determining feasibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) In those cases where the need for new rental units is questioned by the servicing official, another market study may be obtained by the servicing office at its discretion through contract with a market analyst.

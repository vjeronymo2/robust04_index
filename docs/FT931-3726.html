			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: American Express in Dollars 1bn disposal AMERICAN EXPRESS, the troubled financial services and travel group, yesterday formally announced the Dollars 1bn sale of the retail broking and asset management businesses of its Shearson Lehman arm to Mr Sandy Weill's Primerica financial services group. The deal will lead to the creation of Smith Barney Shearson after Primerica merges its Smith Barney securities subsidiary with Shearson. The combined entity will have more than Dollars 112bn of assets under management, 10,500 brokers and almost 500 branch offices. As a result Mr Weill is now in a position to challenge Merrill Lynch's position as the leading US brokerage house. The deal will cause first quarter write-offs at American Express of about Dollars 730m for transaction-related costs such as severance, relocation and systems modifications plus a write-down of Dollars 750m in Shearson's goodwill. American Express stressed that the first-quarter losses it expects to suffer on the Shearson deal would be offset in part by the previously announced plan to sell The Boston Company for Dollars 1.47bn and anticipated gains from the sale of Dollars 1bn of stock representing majority control of First Data Corporation, the group's data processing subsidiary. The Shearson takeover was hailed on Wall Street yesterday as a coup for Mr Weill, who built Shearson in the 1970s and sold it to American Express in 1981 for Dollars 900m. Following this deal, Mr Weill became the president of American Express, only to resign in 1985. The 59-year-old Mr Weill, who yesterday named Mr Frank Zarb, Smith Barney's chairman, to head the new brokerage house, has agreed to pay American Express Dollars 850m in cash, Dollars 125m in Primerica convertible preferred stock and Dollars 25m in Primerica common equity warrants. In addition, Primerica will pay American Express future contingent amounts based on the new unit's performance - up to Dollars 50m a year for three years plus 10 per cent of after-tax profits that exceed Dollars 250m a year over the next five years. Primerica will finance the deal by issuing Dollars 550m of new debt securities and Dollars 500m of equity-equivalent securities. Lehman Brothers is not part of the Primerica deal, but American Express said yesterday that among its options would be a public share offer of Lehman stock. Shearson Lehman last year suffered Dollars 116m of losses. Smith Barney last year had Dollars 170.1m of earnings. Mr Harvey Golub, the American Express chief executive who took over last month after the departure of Mr James Robinson, yesterday moved quickly to outline a new group strategy that will focus on a leaner business based on its three main subsidiaries.</p>

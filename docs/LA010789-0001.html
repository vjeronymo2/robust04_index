			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION BOYS' BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> A MIND-BOGGLING MISMATCH: CLEVELAND CLOBBERS CANOGA PARK, 126-29  </P> <P> Cleveland High Coach Bob Braswell vowed this week that the Cavaliers would show  little mercy during the Northwest Valley Conference season. Perhaps his players  got carried away in Friday's conference opener at Canoga Park, however.  </P> <P> Cleveland, the state's second-ranked team in Division I, walloped the Hunters  by the improbable score of 126-29, leading by as many as 100 points before  settling for a 97-point victory.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers led, 28-2, after the first quarter, 65-7 at halftime, and showed  little letdown after intermission. Cleveland's 40-point third quarter was its  most productive period in school history, and the 126 points set another school  mark.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers (11-2) averaged nearly 4 points a minute, and all 13 players in  uniform scored. Lucious Harris scored 40 and Adonis Jordan added 37.  </P> <P> Although Cleveland and Canoga Park (2-9) play in the same conference, the teams  are grouped in different City Section divisions: Cleveland is a 4-A team and  the Hunters are 3-A. That gulf seemed 100 miles wide.  </P> <P> "They're too fast, too big and too quick," Hunter assistant Mark Nogy said.  Head Coach Joey Nakasone refused comment.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers overwhelmed the Hunters with full-court pressure defense from the  opening tip-off, lifting the press in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "He said he wasn't going to take any prisoners and he stuck by his word," Nogy  said. "It's hard to take but it's a free country."  </P> <P> Braswell admitted he was embarrassed by the final score.  </P> <P> "I guess that's the best word to use," he said. "I teach my kids to play one  way and you never want to stray from that. I sympathize with Joey and the kids.  I don't want to destroy any kid's pride."  </P> <P> Taft 59, San Fernando 50 -- Guard Tony Middleton scored 15 of his game-high 22  points in the second half to lead Taft (11-1) to victory in the Northwest  Valley Conference opener at San Fernando.  </P> <P> Taft point guard Dedan Thomas added 17 points, including 7 of 9 free throws in  the second half.  </P> <P> With 5 minutes to play, San Fernando (6-7) trailed, 52-48, but could not get  any closer.  </P> <P> A trio of juniors paced San Fernando. Guard Marco Renteria scored 16 points and  center Lance Whitaker added 13. Forward Michael Wynn scored 7 points and had a  game-high 14 rebounds.  </P> <P> Birmingham 71, Monroe 55 -- Tyrone Craig scored a game-high 19 points and Jason  Wallace added 16 points for the Braves in the Valley Pac 8 Conference opener at  Monroe.  </P> <P> Kenyon Wright led Monroe (1-7) with 14 points and Lodis Woodmore added 8 points  and 8 rebounds. Larry Sims had 12 points for the Braves (5-6), who outscored  Monroe, 20-8, in the final period.  </P> <P> Reseda 71, Poly 59 -- Coley Kyman scored 20 of his game-high 25 points in the  first half and the Regents' defense stifled Poly's outside shooters in a Valley  Pac 8 Conference opener.  </P> <P> Kyman also had a game-high 16 rebounds and teammate Mike Basowski added 23  points.  </P> <P> Scott Cooper scored 17 points for Poly (5-6) and teammate Juan Estrada added  16.  </P> <P> Sylmar 51, Van Nuys 49 -- Clarence Pattin scored 16 points and Andre Robinson  added 12 points and 9 rebounds as the Spartans held off the Wolves in the  Valley Pac 8 Conference opener at Van Nuys.  </P></p>

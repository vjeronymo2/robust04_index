			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> BIG LOTTO WINNER PICKS UP FIRST CHECK  </P> <P> Standing near a long banner that declared his "big win," a Laguna Beach service  station manager received his first installment from California Lottery  officials Wednesday at the Circle K market where he bought the winning Lotto  ticket on Oct. 25.  </P> <P> The $64,000 check was the first of 20 annual payments that Edward Schwartz, 42,  a 20-year Laguna resident, will receive toward his $1,567,250 win.  </P> <P> "At first you don't believe it," Schwartz said. "It took a while to set in . .  . You don't know what to think."  </P> <P> He said he got up that October morning at 4 a.m. and went to a Chevron service  station that he manages and checked his numbers in the newspaper. Once he  realized that he had won, Schwartz telephoned the Lottery recording to double  check.  </P> <P> "He called me at a quarter to 6 and I could tell by his voice that he was  probably serious," said Marlene Locke, Schwartz's longtime girlfriend. "I could  hear his heart beating through the phone . . . I wanted to scream, I was  euphoric."  </P> <P> Ever since the California Lotto games began more than two years ago, Schwartz  said, he has spent about $50 a week on lottery tickets. Every Wednesday and  Saturday he buys four $5 cards, fills them in with birthday and anniversary  numbers and also buys a $5 "quick pick" card, letting the computer pick the  numbers. Like any devout Lotto player, he keeps his numbers top secret, but it  was a random quick pick that made him his fortune, he said.  </P> <P> "I was really thrilled for him," said Locke, an account executive for Orange  County Magazine. Locke and Schwartz have lived in their house on a ridge above  Laguna for 17 years. Schwartz is hard- working and deserves the money, she  said. "Really, his only vice is the Lotto. It was his thing . . . I call him  the Laguna Lotto Guru. Everybody's calling and asking what the magic (system)  is."  </P> <P> Shortly after Schwartz was handed his check a man walked by with a handful of  Lotto tickets. "Do me a favor and bless these," the man said to Schwartz.  </P> <P> Schwartz said he and Locke don't have any big plans for the money. "We'll  probably buy a new couch and some new blinds for the house, nothing  extravagant." However, Locke said they have had plans to remodel their house  for some time and now they can do it all at once, instead of bit by bit.  </P> <P> Neither Schwartz nor Locke are planning to quit their jobs right away, but  Schwartz said he might retire in three or four years.  </P> <P> "I like my job and I like the people in Laguna." Schwartz said.  </P> <P> Ali Amin, manager of the Circle K where Schwartz buys his tickets, said the  store's Lotto business has about doubled since the big win. "Everyone asks,  'Who's the big winner?' " he said. "They all want to know if it was a local  person."  </P> <P> Amin said Schwartz had only $15 on the day he bought the winning ticket and  asked Amin to pick up the other $10 so he could play all of his numbers. But  none of the tickets Amin bought were winners.  </P> <P> Locke said she never plays the Lottery, Enbut she might start. "I'm thinking  about it," she said. "Then we can be a two-Lotto-winning family."  </P> <P> Although Schwartz said he wouldn't necessarily recommend that people play  Lotto, he did note, "If you don't play, you can't win."  </P></p>

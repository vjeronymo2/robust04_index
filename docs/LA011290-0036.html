			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: ARGUMENT FOR A COMPROMISE  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Why is it that when my husband and I argue, we never reach a  solution? I don't think this is my fault because I'm always willing to continue  the discussion and search for a compromise, while my husband wants to  discontinue the discussion or pretend there's really no problem. One result is  that I'm frustrated because nothing changes. -- V.C.  </P> <P> DEAR V.C.: Men and women generally have different goals when there are  disagreements. According to Dr. John Gottman, a psychologist at the University  of Illinois, men tend to want to avoid conflicts in marriage, while women are  more willing to confront them.  </P> <P> The wife wants to resolve the argument so she feels closer to her husband and  respected by him, but his main concern is avoiding a blowup. The husband, Dr.  Gottman says, doesn't see the disagreement as an opportunity for closeness, but  for trouble. He believes one of the reasons is because men are more vulnerable  than women to physical stress from emotional confrontations.  </P> <P> The problem is that when arguments are never settled or resolved in a positive  way, the differences remain and eat away at the relationship. Resentments  build, and eventually this interferes with the quality of the marriage.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm married to a brilliant and successful engineer, but his  lack of understanding of me and his two children sometimes amazes me. I know in  my heart that he loves us, but he's demanding. At times, all of us rebel and  want to clobber him. He refuses to get any counseling and seems to think the  difficulties and problems are all directly due to our defects. -- S.B.  </P> <P> DEAR S.B.: Analysts who work in communities where there are many engineers and  high-tech workers often comment on the great power of precision of those  workers, and on their lack of persuasion and inability to express feelings.  </P> <P> Engineers tend to be perfectionists and, according to psychologist Judah  Landes, this often causes family conflict. Obviously, this doesn't mean all  engineers are difficult and uncommunicative, but Landes points out that those  who suffer from what she calls the Lockheed Syndrome usually try to avoid  conflict by turning to hobbies, hiding behind stereo headphones or escaping by  sitting for hours in front of a TV set.  </P> <P> Very often, scientists and engineers are happy being by themselves, doing  something they have control over. Since they have little control at home, they  may feel deep frustration, which they are unable to express. You can help your  husband by urging him to share his feelings. There's no reason he can't be less  of a perfectionist at home.  </P></p>

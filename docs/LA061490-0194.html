			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: CTG SEASONS: FROM SONDHEIM TO ROBERT PENN WARREN;  </P> <P> THE TAPER: 'HOPE OF THE HEART' KICKS OFF THE SEASON IN SEPTEMBER. THE SCHEDULE  ALSO FEATURES 'THE LISBON TRAVIATA,' 'THE WASH,' 'MR. JELLYLORD' AND 'WIDOWS."  </P> <P> Taper subscribers have been told they will receive priority seating for the 23  performances of "The Dragons Trilogy" ("La Trilogie des Dragons") at UCLA's  Freud Theatre, Sept. 14-Oct. 14. The production covers a 25-year time span in  Quebec City's Chinatown -- hence the connection to the Pacific Rim theme of the  Los Angeles Festival. It won first prize at the Theater of the Americas 1987  Festival and also won top awards from Canadian critics' circles.  </P> <P> The Taper's regular season will begin in September with "Hope of the Heart."  Director Adrian Hall had hoped -- in his heart -- to be able to present his  earlier adaptation of the rest of "All the King's Men" along with this  adaptation of the book's Chapter Four -- in a two-evening package. Asked if  Davidson felt it was beyond the Taper's resources to do both shows, Hall  laughed and replied, "I think he felt it was beyond my resources." In a mailing  to Taper subscribers, "Hope" is described as a "journey into the pre-Civil War  heritage of a young reporter, who uncovers the past of a distant relative, Cass  Mastern, and his wild, horrifying and disastrous affair with a plantation  owner's wife."  </P> <P> As previously reported, Terrence McNally's "The Lisbon Traviata" is expected to  occupy the next slot on the Taper season, opening in November.  </P> <P> Philip Kan Gotanda's "The Wash" is the likeliest candidate for the January slot  in the season. An examination of an elderly Japanese-American couple's divorce  and its aftermath, "The Wash" is slated to be directed by Berkeley Repertory  Theatre artistic director Sharon Ott -- first at the Manhattan Theatre Club in  October and then at the Taper in early 1991. The play has been through several  Taper workshops, including one that was reviewed in 1985, but the official  premiere was at San Francisco's Eureka Theatre in 1987. A film version received  a limited release in 1988 and was seen on PBS' "American Playhouse" in March.  </P> <P> "Mr. Jellylord," the musical about Jelly Roll Morton, for which the Taper  recently received a $100,000 grant, will probably occupy the next slot, opening  in March, though there is some uncertainty about the order of "The Wash" and  "Mr. Jellylord."  </P> <P> The Taper has promised subscribers "the first look" at an American production  of a classic play in late spring, before it is dispatched to the United Kingdom  as part of an exchange agreement with Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Theatre  Company, which brought "King Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to the Taper  earlier this year. "Julius Caesar" is the expected choice.  </P> <P> The season's last slot probably will be occupied by "Widows," Chilean writer  Ariel Dorfman's play about resistance to a brutal military dictatorship.  Originally scheduled to be running right now, the play was pulled from the  current season for more rewriting, despite Dorfman's stated belief that it had  been ready to go into production. By phone, Dorfman said he and the Taper now  "seem to be in agreement. I think we'll find the right text."  </P> <P> In an earlier mailing to subscribers, Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" also  was described as "set for the (1990-91) season." But now it looks as if the  two-part epic won't receive its first full production, at Eureka Theatre in San  Francisco, until next May at the earliest, which would probably postpone its  appearance at the Taper until the following season. The first half of the show,  "Millennium Approaches," recently closed at Taper, Too, but the second half,  "Perestroika," is still being developed and may go through a Taper workshop  next fall.

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Observer: Down and out in DC Cost overruns on the World Bank's headquarters building in Washington - some Dollars 100m above the original Dollars 186m - do not seem to have made the bank one wit more modest when it comes to doling out advice to third world governments on how to handle their finances. Some of the staff seem to be equally challenged in the humility department. Take Armeane Choksi, vice-president for human resources and development operations policy who, with his wife, is selling the Chevy Chase home to move into one they are now having built. A full-page colour ad in Washingtonian magazine describes in painful detail the heartbreak involved in moving house. 'She will miss their long private drive, the bright and open floor plan and the wonderful decks overlooking the majestic trees. He'll remember the luxurious master suite complete with Jacuzzi, skylight, separate shower, and circular windows, the grand first floor library with fireplace, and the impressive entry foyer. They'll both miss the dumb waiter which carries groceries direct into the kitchen]' The ad also says that this luxurious dwelling boasts 'walls of glass, soaring ceilings and enormous room sizes'. What it neglects to point out is that one of Choksi's chief responsibilities is for the bank's anti-poverty programme.</p>

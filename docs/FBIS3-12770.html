The visiting Polish foreign  minister, Mr. (Andrzej Olechowski), gave this assurance in his  talks with the external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, in  New Delhi. The Polish foreign minister said his country gives  special emphasis to its relations with India and wants to  strengthen the economic ties.    Mr. Dinesh Singh briefed him about Pakistan's attempt to  internationalize the Kashmir issue under the guise of raising  human rights issue. Pakistan's own record in this area is  abysmal. Mr. Dinesh Singh said the political process in Jammu  and Kashmir can easily begin if Pakistan stops aiding and  abetting terrorism in the state.    Both also discussed the ongoing reforms in the UN system and  called for making it more democratic.</p>

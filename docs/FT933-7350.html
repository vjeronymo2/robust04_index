			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / How To Spend It: Where east meets west - Top chef Ken Hom enthuses over Bruce Cost's cooking in California / Restaurant Review AS AN authority on Chinese cuisine I am always on the lookout for any good Asian restaurants, Chinese or otherwise. Thus, I was delighted in 1989 to discover Bruce Cost's San Francisco gem, Monsoon, shortly after it opened. I was impressed by its imaginative and delicious offerings and my experiences there, until it closed in 1991, only confirmed my original judgment. Food critics and writers from all over America have joined me in that consensus. Now Cost has moved to Berkeley, on the other side of the Bay, to take over Fourth Street Grill which he has transformed into Ginger Island. The delicious menu would give some of the best restaurants in Asia a run for their money. Bruce Cost, the proprietor and chef, is not of Asian descent. Nevertheless, he has mastered the essences and subtleties of Asian cuisine as if he were a native. Before Monsoon and Ginger Island, he had already established his reputation as an accomplished chef, an expert on Asian cuisines. He began his apprenticeship years ago in New York, under the guidance of Virginia Lee, a fine cook. This soon led him to become a chef and cookery instructor. When he moved to San Francisco, he found easy acceptance into the Bay Area circle of cooks whose foremost member is Alice Waters, of Chez Panisse fame. This group was influential in forming what is now popularly known as California Cuisine, with its emphasis on freshness, colourful combinations, imaginative reworking of classics and the creative blending of different culinary traditions, the familiar and the exotic. Alice Waters acclaims Cost as 'one of the greatest cooks I've ever known.' I agree. Cost is a fanatic on freshness of ingredients. He boasts that the only items in his freezer are his frozen fruit ices, made on the premises. Every main ingredient, from fish, seafood to meats and poultry, is delivered daily, in the case of fish and seafood, usually live. Cost is an expert on Asian spices and flavourings and uses only the best peanut oils, vinegars and soy sauces. Although specialities change daily, some popular favourites are almost always available. My personal choices include Vietnamese spring rolls and Ginger Island wontons. The spring rolls are a delicate and refreshing combination of tastes and textures, crackling rice paper with a savoury filling. The wontons are perfectly poached dumplings with a delectable pork filling and a wonderful hot vinegar-ginger sauce. Equally good is the alternative wonton choice filled with earthy Chinese green vegetables and Chinese eggplant with ginger-sesame glaze, a northern Chinese inspired dish which is served with either toast or croutons. All his claypot dishes taste as if they come, freshly made, from a Chinese home. One of my favourites is claypot of braised pork shoulder. Any Shanghainese would serve it with pride. It is a fatty cut of pork that is slowly braised in a master sauce until the fat has melted into a sweet succulent savoury treat. It is then cooked with white radish. The combination is what a Chinese like myself would always find memorable. However, a clay pot of spare ribs with black bean sauce was uncharacteristically bland and the meat tough. Ginger Island's seafood is as good as you would find in any restaurant in Hong Kong. A distinctive dish includes fresh clams, sea scallops and mussels perfectly steamed and served in a delicate Thai lemongrass-ginger coconut sauce. It has a slight bite balanced by the rich sweetness of coconut milk. Shellfish can sometimes have a robust taste, but are rendered exquisite, sweet and ethereal at Ginger Island. There is usually a selection of fresh Asian vegetable dishes which reflects the seasonal harvest of bountiful California. These may range from Chinese broccoli to choy sum, a mustard green. All are prepared with skill and frequently accompany the main dishes with a serving of Thai jasmine rice. Asian cuisine is not noted for its dessert courses but Ginger Island offers such original delights as fresh ginger cake, Ginger Island hot fudge sundae and fruit sundae. This east-west collection of desserts changes daily, and I have found the sweets delicious and refreshing. They are something in which Cost excels. The food can be enjoyed in a bright, contemporary and tropical atmosphere and is served in a friendly manner. All this at affordable prices. Ginger Island, 1820 Fourth Street, Berkeley, California. Tel: (510) 644-0444 (reservations advised). Credit cards: Visa and Mastercard, lunch and dinner. Cost of a meal for two without wine is approximately Dollars 40.</p>

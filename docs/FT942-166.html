			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Soccer scores in Japan - The craze for football has spawned a huge consumer market Yukari Akasaka, a 35-year-old housewife living in Shizuoka, central Japan, does not want to think about how much her family has spent on soccer. Since Japan's professional soccer league kicked off in May last year, the Akasakas have spent Y3m (Pounds 19,000) on a van to transport the family of five to local club games, bought Y80,000 of team jerseys and other paraphernalia, and spent more than Y40,000 a month on tickets. 'We would be rich if we saved all we spent,' she says. The Akasakas are among the 17m Japanese caught up in the recent craze stirred by the J-League, now in its second year. In spite of the national team's failure to win a place in this year's World Cup, spectators have continued to crowd the stadiums. A huge consumer market has evolved. Hopeful that the popularity of the league will rub off on them, manufacturers have adorned their products with the J-League logo. Products so emblazoned include beer, cornflakes and electronic pagers, while on television soccer players are advertising men's wigs, curry and mosquito repellent. The J-League market, with merchandise revenue estimated at Y56bn, advertising totalling Y20bn, sponsor fees at Y19.5bn, is thought to have totalled Y140m in its first year. Some analysts are anticipating direct and indirect spending to total around Y500m. The popularity of soccer has even prompted the government to consider a soccer pools scheme. A large part of the league's commercial success is down to astute marketing and campaigning by leading advertising agency Hakuhodo. After a range of feasibility studies and market research (until then used only for consumer goods marketing), the agency launched a Y200m media campaign in 1991. Unlike Japan's fragmented baseball league, J-League controls the design, marketing and sales of items related to its 12 member teams, and splits revenue from the goods, advertising and television sponsorship fees equally among them. The success of the J-League is also due to the way it has filled a vacuum created by waning support for baseball and sumo, which embody traditional Japanese values. The younger generation, more individualistic and westernised, are bored by the stoicism of sumo players and shun the collective effort of baseball in favour of the Japanese style of soccer which focuses on the star players. It is the glitzy image of the fashion-conscious stars and their un-Japanese displays of emotion - hugging, kissing and dancing after goals, or wailing and ranting after lost games - that have captured the hearts of young Japanese. Wearing team jerseys and colourful face paint, the fans cheer their role models on, chanting, dancing and hooting horns throughout the games. The many foreign stars have added to the international appeal of soccer. Most of the league's leading players are not Japanese and many of the coaches and team staff are also imported. Baseball, however, still treats foreign players as outsiders, while sumo is still queasy about awarding champion status to foreigners. Another ingredient in J-League's success has been the corporate support achieved during the late 1980s. Kazuki Sasaki, spokesman for the league, says that when it first approached companies in 1989 it indicated that a team would need up to Y1bn in corporate contributions a year. Most companies had extra cash and were eager to contribute to philanthropic causes and community-based activities. 'We wouldn't have been able to pull it off if it had been a few years later,' he says. Even amid the current slump in earnings, sponsor companies remain happy with the long-term investment. Nissan, the car maker which owns a Yokohama-based club, says the returns justify the costs. It says owning the team also helped the company to communicate with its employees in Sunderland, in the UK, and consumers in other countries. The league's insistence upon local involvement has also boosted support. The soccer clubs have provided entertainment for the culturally barren provinces, and have instilled a sense of pride and camaraderie in the communities. 'Until now there has been nothing to represent Shizuoka,' says Akasaka, whose family has made friends with fellow fans. The main question for J-League officials, corporate sponsors and the players is what happens next. Companies initially pledged financial commitment for 10 years or more, ensuring long-term financial support for the teams. Officials hope for further commercial expansion of the league when two new teams join next year. But to sustain the current popularity, the standard of players must improve. Investment is also needed in better soccer facilities, including stadiums with capacity of more than 40,000 - existing stadiums hold only about 20,000. It was beneficial that Japan failed to qualify for this year's World Cup games, says Kuniaki Sasaki, director of Nissan's football club. He believes the loss fuelled the fever. 'Fans will stay with soccer for the next four years as they want to know how the national team will fare in the race for the 1998 games.'</p>

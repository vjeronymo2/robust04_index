Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;355&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate an additional delivery point for service to Piedmont Natural Gas Company (Piedmont) in Rowan County, North Carolina, under TGPL's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;426&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TGPL proposes to add the delivery point on TGPL's 42-inch Main Line ``D'' in Rowan County in order to continue its existing service to Piedmont, a transportation and storage customer of TGPL, during replacement of a 1.2 mile segment of TGPL's Main Line ``A''. TGPL estimates that the construction cost would be $68,000. It is asserted that TGPL delivers up to 17,000 Mcf of natural gas per day to Piedmont, and that this volume would not be altered by the proposal. It is further asserted that the deliveries are within Piedmont's existing entitlement from TGPL. It is stated that TGPL has sufficient system delivery capability to accomplish deliveries at the proposed delivery point without detriment or disadvantage to TGPL's other customers. It is explained that the addition of the proposed delivery point will have no effect on TGPL's peak day deliveries and little or no impact on TGPL's annual deliveries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

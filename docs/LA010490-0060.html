			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: REGION;  </P> <P> WATER BOARD SEATS DISPUTED  </P> <P> The Goliath of water agencies, Metropolitan Water District of Southern  California, faces a challenge from the Three Valleys Municipal Water District  over who can serve on Metropolitan's board.  </P> <P> For the last three years, Richard W. Hansen, Three Valleys general manager and  chief engineer, had represented the district on the Metropolitan board because  political fighting among board members meant that no board member could gain a  majority.  </P> <P> But the Three Valleys board last month voted 4 to 3 to send one of its members,  Paul E. Stiglich, to serve on the Metropolitan board. But to attain the  majority vote, Stiglich had to vote for himself. State law governing  Metropolitan's board prohibits this.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, we won't get in a spitting match with Metropolitan," said Three  Valleys President William H. Koch. But, he said, it is important for the water  district, which represents much of the eastern San Gabriel Valley, to have an  elected official on the 51-member Metropolitan board, which oversees much of  the water supply for the region's six counties.  </P> <P> Metropolitan spokesman Jay Malinowski said the Three Valleys board must send  them its minutes naming Stiglich before the Metropolitan board can decide  whether to seat him, possibly at its February meeting.  </P> <P> "We're not going to make a personal judgment whether (Stiglich) ought to be on  the agency," Malinowski said. "But we will make a legal judgment. And if we  determine that his credentials aren't in order, he won't be seated."  </P></p>

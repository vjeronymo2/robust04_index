			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Clinton set to revive dialogue with PLO - US president hails recognition deal achieved yesterday in the Middle East PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday hailed the Middle East peace deal as 'a huge development' and was expected today to announce that the US would resume a dialogue with the PLO because of its agreement to recognise Israel. Administration officials predicted that the PLO statement of recognition - signed in Tunis last night - would meet US conditions for resuming talks with the PLO, with which the US has had no contact since 1990. Mr Clinton cancelled until today a statement planned for last night because Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, had not yet signed a document recognising the PLO. But earlier yesterday Mr Clinton said in Cleveland: 'If the PLO statement meets the criteria we have repeatedly set down - renouncing terrorism and acknowledging Israel's right to exist - then we will resume our dialogue with them, and we'll go forward from there.' Mr Clinton applauded the 'very brave and courageous' decision of mutual recognition by the PLO and Israel. The president was 'very, very hopeful about the future', adding: 'I am extremely happy that this finally happened. This is a huge development.' Among other reaction, France hailed the breakthrough and pledged the European Community would give political and economic support to Arab-Israeli peace. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said: 'French diplomacy is determined to support their efforts to build this just, global and lasting peace for which we have long wished.' He said he would seek to enlist EC foreign ministers' backing at an informal meeting in Belgium tomorrow. Egypt's foreign minister Amr Moussa described the initiative as 'a positive step in a long journey to reach a settlement to the Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflict'. Lebanese foreign minister Faris Bweiz described the peace moves as the 'most important event since the fall of the Ottoman Empire' early this century. In Washington Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, urged Israel to prove peace was real by lifting a six-month-old closure of the West Bank and Gaza, releasing prisoners and allowing home all those deported during the 26 years of Israeli administration of the occupied territories. PLO supporters in the territories generally welcomed the accord. But Islamic fundamentalist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad joined Damascus-based Palestinian radicals in a call to sabotage the agreement which they see as a sell-out of Palestinians' claim to all of pre-1948 Palestine.</p>

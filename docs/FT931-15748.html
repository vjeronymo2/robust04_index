			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / UK Gilts: Little interest in long-maturing securities DEMAND for short-dated gilts picked up slightly while investors showed little interest in long-maturing securities, as the gilt market reacted to indications of lower short-term interest rates across Europe. The healthier tone to sterling also underpinned prices for short-dated gilts, while funding worries pushed up yields at the longer end of the yield curve. With the market slow to pick up after the new year break, last week saw relatively little price movement. Yields for gilts maturing at 10 years or less fell by about 10 basis points compared with the week before Christmas, while over the same period, yields at the longer end of the spectrum rose by a similar amount. One of the biggest influences on the market was the decision by the Bundesbank council to ease its short-term money market rates, a move accompanied by speculation that it would soon cut its internationally important Lombard and discount rates. The central bank's action in cutting its so-called 'repo' rate to 8.6 per cent from recent levels of 8.75 per cent or higher was interpreted as signalling a softening in its previously obdurate stance on monetary policy. Assuming that the Lombard and discount rates come down soon, that could give the green light for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to reduce UK base rates, now at 7 per cent, in an effort to speed recovery. Potentially significant room for manoeuvre on this front was provided by last week's strengthening in sterling, which finished on Friday night in London at a relatively healthy DM2.525. These developments buoyed investor interest in short-dated gilts, while longer-dated securities were mainly on the sidelines due partly to lingering concern about inflationary pressures over the next few years. Mr Paul Temperton, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said: 'All the action at the moment is at the short end of the market, with many investors perceiving that longer maturing issues have big structural problems.' Although Mr Lamont has given few public signs of preparing to cut interest rates, many economists believe it is only a question of time before he does so, especially if the recent signs of a slight upswing in the economy fail to be repeated in the coming weeks. Theories about a fragile upturn were given extra weight by the 3 per cent year on year increase in the M0 money supply measure in December, together with some evidence about a burst in retail activity around Christmas. Mr Sanjay Joshi, an economist at Japanese investment house Daiwa, said these indicators did not alter his view that a recovery would be extremely slow. 'The pick-up in M0 may simply mean that people are switching into cash, rather than use credit cards where they are anxious to pay off debts,' he said. Mr Stuart Thomson, an economist at Nikko Securities, is another relative pessimist, believing that 'signs of a rebound are unlikely to be sustainable'. Playing heavily on the minds of consumers may be indications that the Treasury is considering tax increases in the March Budget as a way to restrain rises in the public sector borrowing requirement. The PSBR this financial year is likely to climb to above Pounds 37bn, while the figures for 1993-94 and 1994-95 could easily reach above Pounds 50bn, especially if growth remains relatively slow. According to FT estimates, the PSBR in 1995-96 could climb to Pounds 75.8bn, or 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product, assuming only weak growth of 1 per cent a year in the three years from 1993-94. As for gilt investors, the notion that Britain may be stuck with large deficits for a long period is unappealing, on the grounds that this will mean large tranches of price-depressing gilt issues until the mid to late 1990s, on top of the Pounds 50bn of issues expected in 1993-94.</p>

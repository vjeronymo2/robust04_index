			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses respond to good tidings Wall Street's overnight gains, good chemical results and ecstatic buying in Milan took bourses higher yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose 1.9 per cent, the Dax index closing 40.98 higher at 2,243.20 after a better than expected quarterly from Hoechst and reduced growth in M3 money supply growth. The big three chemical stocks led the bourse higher, BASF - seen as the most cyclical of the trio - outperforming its rivals with a rise of DM14.50, or 4.6 per cent to DM328.50. Hoechst's statement that it had seen a noticeable economic upturn over the past few weeks added to the general enthusiasm, and there was a suggestion that German institutions might finally be buying the sector for its dividend payments, currently due. Turnover rose from DM7.7bn to DM10.8bn. Professionals also noted stronger bund and futures trading. Mr Thomas Nolten of B Metzler in Frankfurt said that there was a story that Monday's equity trading had been depressed by the expiry of a 2,200 OTC option on the Dax index and that, yesterday, traders found themselves with short positions to cover. AMSTERDAM, encouraged by first quarter results from Akzo Nobel recovered most of Monday's fall, and the AEX index finished up 3.46 at 418.42. The chemical group dominated interest, hitting a new 12 month high of Fl 229 before losing a little on profit-taking to end up Fl 6.40 or 3 per cent at Fl 226.90. Hoare Govett sounded positive on the stock, noting that in spite of recent strength the group remained the cheapest of Europe's chemical stocks in p/e terms and had, prior to yesterday's rise, been trading at a 10 per cent discount to the equity market. Heineken added Fl 3.30 to Fl 241, as the brewer said that it was calling on European subsidiaries to provide supplies for the domestic market owing to a six day old strike at its two main factories. PARIS failedto recoup all of Monday's losses, the CAC-40 index ended at 2,130.91, up 14.62, after a session high of 2,138.57. Equities remained trapped in a narrow range, with many institutions having gone underweight in recent weeks and domestic investors distracted by the UAP privatisation. The insurer lost FFr1.10 to FFr162.90 yesterday. Accor rose FFr6 at FFr718 although Meridien hotels, for which it is bidding, said that it preferred the offer from Forte, of the UK. Air France, which holds 57 per cent of Meridien, is due to meet tomorrow to select the successful bidder. MILAN was swept to an eight year high by a fresh wave of domestic liquidity, the Comit index rising 24.90, or 3.2 per cent to 801.98. Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa Sim in Milan, said that the absence of violent protest during Monday's Liberation Day celebrations had opened the way for Mr Silvio Berlusconi to be asked to form a government. This, in turn, would open the way for lower interest rates, while newly released first quarter industrial output figures had provided confirmation that economic recovery was under way. Industrial blue chips led the advance. Pirelli rose L212 or 7 per cent to L3,227, Olivetti added L158 or 5.4 per cent to L3,066 and Montedison put on L81 or 5.3 per cent to L1,613 in volume of 77.6m shares. Fiat rose L379 or 5.8 per cent to L6,992. Paribas Capital Markets, which has downgraded the stock from a buy to a hold, said recent positive developments, including cost savings and new production units, renewal of the vehicle range and recovery of the European car and truck markets, had been discounted by the market after the shares' sharp rise in recent months. MADRID rose but Santander paid for its Banesto win, falling Pta440, or 7.2 per cent to Pta570 as the general index closed 3.07 higher at 322.06. Turnover shot up again to Pta40.3bn. It was estimated that half of this was in the banking sector where Banesto rose Pta113, or 15 per cent to Pta868 and the failed bidders, Argentaria and BBV, by Pta200 to Pta5,900, and Pta95 to Pta3,295 respectively. Elsewhere, the US-influenced Telefonica rose Pta45 to Pta1,815. ZURICH ended below its best as Roche and Nestle turned back after an early show of strength. The SMI index finished 12.7 higher at 2,776.2, after a peak of 2,798.4 in response to firmer bond futures and an easing of worries about the outlook for interest rates. Roche was unchanged at SFr6,800 after a high of SFr6,890 and Nestle gave up SFr1 to SFr1,210 after testing SFr1,225. Insurers, underperformers during recent months, continued to recover. Zurich bearers added SFr21 to SFr1,252 and Swiss Re put on SFr16 to SFr590. WARSAW went limit-down in most top stocks, and trading in nearly all of them was suspended as the WIG index dropped 1,225.9, or 9.9 per cent to 12,221.7 after four sessions on the upgrade.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 26                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1462.63      1463.52      1464.54      1468.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1477.75      1479.10      1479.55      1484.03  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1468.01      1467.51      1467.00      1464.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1482.98      1483.58      1482.76      1480.61  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Apr 25    Apr 22    Apr 21    Apr 20    Apr 19 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1449.13   1456.24   1436.73   1444.73   1448.50 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1467.22   1476.62   1458.95   1465.17   1470.66  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 - 1468.85; 200 - 1485.59 Low/day: 100 - 1462.49  200 - 1476.93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY HIKE: WALK ALONG BEACH FROM SUMMERLAND TO MONTECITO  </P> <P> One might guess that Summerland was named for the weather, but the name was  taken from spiritualist literature -- something to do with the Second Heaven of  Spiritualism. A century ago, spiritualists pitched their tents on the tiny lots  in this coastal area just south of Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> In the waters here, the first offshore oil platform in the Western Hemisphere  was erected in 1896. Soon, more than 300 wells were pumping oil from  Pleistocene rocks at depths of 100 to 800 feet, an insignificant depth by  today's standards.  </P> <P> Oil attracted far more people to Summerland than spiritualism, and t he air was  heavy with the smell of gas and oil. It was said that free illumination came  easy -- one simply pounded a pipe into the ground until reaching natural gas  and lit a match. Liberty Hall, the spiritualists' community center, glowed with  divine light, and for a time Summerland became known as the White City.  </P> <P> This walk travels due west along sandy Summerland Beach (parts of which are  popular with the clothing-optional set), rounds some rocky points and concludes  at the narrow beach in front of the famed Biltmore Hotel. Summer is a fine time  to stroll along Summerland.  </P> <P> Directions to the trailhead: From U.S. 101 in Summerland, take the Summerland  exit and turn oceanward to Lookout County Park.  </P> <P> Consult a tide table. This beach walk is easiest and most enjoyable at low  tide.  </P> <P> The hike: At Lookout County Park is a picnic area and a monument commemorating  the first offshore oil rig. A well-marked ramp leads to the beach. From Lookout  (Summerland) Beach, a sea wall extends three-quarters of a mile west to Fernald  Point. At high tide, you may wish to walk atop it, but you'll have to battle  some brush. You soon pass a pretty little cove, bounded on the far side by  Fernald Point, formed by a fan delta deposited at the mouth of Romero Creek.  </P> <P> Around the point, as you approach Montecito, you'll see the higher parts of the  Santa Ynez Mountains on the north skyline and the overturned beds of sandstone  located near the peaks. There are no official public beaches in Montecito, but  most of the shoreline receives public use: Fernald-Sharks Cove is the first  beach you travel, then Miramar Beach below the Miramar Hotel.  "Miramar-by-the-Sea" has been a popular watering place since the completion of  the Southern Pacific railroad line in 1901. The hotel, with its finely  landscaped grounds and blue-roofed bungalows, used to be a passenger stop.  </P> <P> In another quarter of a mile, you'll begin hiking across Montecito's third  beach, Hammonds, popular with surfers. Hammonds Meadows on the bluffs above the  beach is a former Chumash habitation and a potentially rich archeological dig.  Although it was placed recently on the National Register of Historic Places,  it's been bulldozed for development.  </P> <P> Up-coast from Hammonds you'll pass a number of fine homes and arrive at narrow  Biltmore Beach, frequented by the rich and beautiful. Opposite the beach is the  magnificent Biltmore Hotel, built in 1927.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Summerland Trail  </P> <P> Lookout County Park to Biltmore Beach; 5 miles round trip  </P></p>

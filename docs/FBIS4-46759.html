			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Namoz Mamatkulov, secretary of the Erk Party </F> Surkhondaryo Oblast Council: "The National Movement Is  Undivided"]    [Text] One of the facts of the perestroyka movement was  national awakening. The struggle for independence in the  colonial republics is a direct continuation of this national  awakening movement. As long as the Union was preserved, it is  clear that basic democratic reform in some of the republics was  not implemented.    Thus, there was a need for a political organization with a  national orientation in Uzbekistan. The Erk Democratic Party  came to the fore to fill this need. From the time the party was  formed it set for itself the goal of national independence and  used its power in this direction. On the foundation of the  earlier national awakening and this movement, basic reform in  society was the path selected by Erk.    Viewed from this point of view, it was natural that the  national aim was not to move toward the literal concept of  "democracy" accepted in the West. Forces not completely  understanding the meaning of this began to take aim at Erk from  various directions the day it was founded.    On one hand, representatives of the totalitarian regime  placed obstacles in its way (this is why the party was not  officially registered for a long time), and on the other,  radical communists who had suddenly become "democrats" attacked  it.    Perestroyka was brought about through the dismantling of the  empire, and its colonialized people attained national liberation.    Under this historical situation, communists who had turned  into "democrats," including representatives of the Birlik  movement such as Abdurayim Polatov, completely repudiated the  goal of independence; "we will not separate from Moscow: If we  separate from Moscow, we will be unable to attain democracy,"  they claimed.    However, the healthy part of the Birlik movement was  together  with the Erkists in this struggle. The majority of the members  of this movement joined the ranks of Erk. This became especially  evident during the referendum held to preserve the Union.    Under existing circumstances the forming of democratic  traditions in the concept of a nation and in society became a  regular duty. Thus the Erk party, as a constructive opposition,  opted for the parliamentary way of democratic struggle, in other  words, entering the government through the electoral process. In  the Baltic republics, representatives of the national movement  came into the government by means of elections, also.    On the basis of the plan and struggle of the Erk party, the  passing of the Declaration of Independence at the Supreme  Council of Uzbekistan and the participation of Muhammad Solih,  the founder and chairman of the party, in the presidential  elections was an expression of this goal. These actions  undoubtedly raised the political understanding of the nation.    After the elections the party continued its path of  struggle,  and ERK, its press organ, continued to cast light on events in  the Republic although it was placed under merciless censorship.    Erk did not stop at this. It gave precedence to the people's  interests and its own suggestions, and struggled to introduce  these into the direction of the government.    Forces in favor of strengthening democratic principles in  the  government began to group around Erk and the Forum of Democratic  Forces of Uzbekistan was formed. Birlik also joined this Forum.  Birlik cochairmen and activists Bek Toshmuhamedov, Gulchehra  Nurullayeva, Dadakhon Hasan, and others demonstrated that Erk  was firmly on the road. Not only did the government oppose the  formation and activity of the Forum, but also the Polatovs,  whose goal and struggle was unknown.    Individuals who attach the title of "democrats" to  themselves  like Abdurayim Polatov, who was then and is now a communist,  have found no other function than denigrating the Erk party. For  example, it is sometimes forgotten that Polatov, who calls  himself a "democrat" and yelled "Down with communism!", was  secretary of the Communist Party's primary party organization at  the Cybernetics Institute where he worked.    I was never a communist, but if I had been, I would have  been  ashamed at yelling something like that.    After the Istiklol Yoli [Independence Road] Party was  founded, I expressed my opinion about this on Radio Liberty. In  response, Abdurayim Polatov, in a radio interview, said that he  was glad and the government was also glad that two traitors had  left the Erk party.    Polatov lied when he said in his interview that "Erk was  founded before the parliamentary elections of 1990." In the  first place, the 1990 parliamentary elections took place in  February 1990. As for the Erk party, it was founded in April  1990. And Muhammad Solih was not elected to parliament in his  capacity as party chairman, but as a writer and public servant  known to the people.    Polatov has accused Erk of being in the constructive  opposition. Yes, we are a party of constructive opposition now  and in the future. We are different from the "shadow parties,"  which declare the government's line to be their own line, and  the radical communists, who lack both their own line and  proposals for one. The Erk party has a clear program in every  sector and concrete proposals which it has stated to the  government in every sector. We are fighting to apply this  program to life.    If we come to the allegation of Abdurayim Polatov, the only  reason for this is that he is jealous of the Erk party, because  when Erk was organized in April 1990 he himself was struggling  to organize a party. He named it the Birlik party. But the  majority of Birlikists refused to join it.    The basic democratic forces today are grouped around Erk,  and  the party, under the present serious conditions, is acting in  solidarity with all progressive forces in the Republic. Our  friends, who know themselves to be true Birlikists, are fighting  shoulder to shoulder with us.    Following the last party congress, democratically inclined  religious officials, who had wavered earlier, joined our  struggle. Their activity has been a great help to us since the  Erk party wants our nation to be formed as a nation of high  principle.    There are those who do not recognize this unity movement.  But  there are more who do than do not. They are the Uzbek people.</p>

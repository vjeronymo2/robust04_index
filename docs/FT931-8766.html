			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow Pounds 56m issue TAYLOR Woodrow yesterday raised Pounds 55.5m through a debenture issue in a rare move by a construction group to borrow money through bonds secured on a property portfolio. The bonds were added to an existing debenture issue, first launched in 1989. The company raised Pounds 80m at that stage, though it later bought back Pounds 35m of the bonds to record a Pounds 7.5m profit. Explaining the decision to issue more of the long-dated bonds, which are due to mature in October 2014, Mr David Green, finance director, said: 'Historically, these are the lowest long-term interest rates in 25 years. I doubt very much that they will go very much lower.' The bonds were issued with a yield of 10.037 per cent. Institutional investors in the UK, who buy such bonds to match future pension or insurance liabilities, would be resistant to buying bonds that yield less than 10 per cent, suggesting that this is a good time to borrow, said Mr Green. The money will be used to repay a sterling eurobond.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- A parliamentary group based  on the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin election bloc does not plan to  participate in the new government, ITAR-TASS learnt on Thursday  [6 January] from Igor Yakovenko, member of the group's temporary  council and co- chairman of the Russian Republican Party.    "The bloc stood out during the election campaign against  combining parliamentary work with that in government  structures," Yakovenko, member of the State Duma (lower house),  explained. "We ran for the State Duma for parliamentary work  rather than for joining the cabinet," he stressed.    The group regards as its main task "the drafting and  adoption  of bills to change the mechanism of carrying economic reforms  peacefully". Yakovenko noted that the elections corroborated  the mechanism's inefficiency.    The group now numbers 30 people, but it will possibly be  boosted by independents. The temporary council includes  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (group chairman), Yakovenko, Vyacheslav  Shestakovskiy, Vladimir Sheynis, Anatoliy Golov and Vladimir  Lukin.    Group representatives are now working on all committees  engaged in organising the State Duma's work. According to  Yakovenko, the status of legislator is among the main topics of  ongoing discussions.    The group suggests free rather than imperative mandate of  lawmaker. Yakovenko said that the imperative mandate  presupposes that a lawmaker is to vote strictly in compliance  with a decision of a group he represents. He added that "such  an approach is fraught with turning a legislator into a puppet".    Speaking about a possibility of setting up a democratic  coalition, Yakovenko noted that "democratic groups will most  probably cooperate to counter revenge-seeking forces".    He did not preclude "temporary cooperation" with Russia's  Choice and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord as well as with  communists and the Agrarian Party.    Yakovenko confirmed that the group nominated Lukin for the  post of State Duma speaker.</p>

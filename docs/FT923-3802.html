			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: P&amp;O At the trading level, yesterday's interim results from P&amp;O seemed to meet expectations. But significantly, the Pounds 18m reduction in interest charges came not from the Pounds 600m proceeds of last year's rights issue - which were largely offset by Pounds 525m of increased borrowings when the bulk of P&amp;O's stake in Laing moved on to the balance sheet. Instead the cost of dollar borrowings fell with US interest rates. While the rights issue may not have been directly used to repair the hole blown in finances by the Laing adventure, its juxtaposition with the borrowing increase illustrates where a lot of shareholders' funds have gone. Of course, those are past mistakes. More chilling was a statement by the chairman that if the economy and the dollar remain depressed, second-half figures could be disappointing. P&amp;O has invested heavily through the recession, and the greater part of its operations are in property and housing or exposed to the vagaries of consumer confidence. While operations like shipbuilding require long-term planning, shareholders may be forgiven for wondering when they will see a return on money spent. Capital expenditure should decline towards the end of the year, easing the pressure on cash flow, yet tough trading conditions may leave the dividend barely covered by earnings. Hence the share price reflects concern over the payout. Given a classical recovery, P&amp;O would be a screaming buy on a yield over 11 per cent. In a harder world, it is in for a long sweat.</p>

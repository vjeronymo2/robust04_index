			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Current account shortfall in US rises to Dollars 62.4bn THE US current account deficit climbed back to Dollars 62.4bn last year, with an improved surplus on services partially offsetting a widening merchandise trade deficit and declining income from overseas investments, George Graham writes from Washington. The US surplus in services payments rose to Dollars 55.1bn from Dollars 45.3bn in 1991, but net income from foreign investments fell to Dollars 10.1bn from Dollars 16.4bn in 1991. The commerce department also reported that housing starts in February ran at an annualised rate of 1.21m, 6 per cent lower than a year ago.</p>

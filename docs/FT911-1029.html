			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Bonn threat to block Soviet housing finance THE BONN government yesterday threatened to block its financing of a housing programme for returning Soviet troops after Moscow's decision to award the first of the lucrative contracts to Turkish and Finnish companies. Mr Klaus Beckmann, state secretary in the Economics Ministry, said Bonn would withhold the earmarked funds unless Moscow agreed to review its decision, announced on Tuesday.

'If the German offers had been competitive economically, then there would have been room for some favouritism,' said one official at Soyuzvneshstroimport, the state organisation responsible for foreign construction work.

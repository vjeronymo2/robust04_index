			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz -- The Armed Forces general staff is  assessing a series of state intelligence and security reports  suggesting that Chapare, in Cochabamba Department, be declared a  "military zone," taking into account that a series of factors in  the region could place the country's political and social  stability at stake.    The reports state that the presence of individuals linked to  terrorism has been detected in this tropical region of  Cochabamba. It is even suspected that they may have some  relationship with subversive groups operating in Peru, also  precisely in coca production areas, such as Upper Huallaga,  which has characteristics similar to those of Chapare.    The reports mention, moreover, that the presence of drug  traffickers that have come into Bolivia from Colombia has been  detected. These traffickers are allegedly inciting the peasants  to oppose the implementation of programs to eradicate surplus  coca plantations, through demonstrations that recently almost  resulted in violent clashes.    According to the intelligence report submitted to the Armed  Forces high command suggesting that Chapare be declared a  military zone, these and other factors detected in the area  represent a worrisome prospect. National institutions must work  to prevent the unleashing of conflict that could place internal  security and the country's sociopolitical stability at stake.    Moreover, military sources who asked not to be identified  stated that high-ranking government echelons are concerned over  the existence of acts of sabotage against the alternative  development program. This seriously affects the country as a  whole regarding the fulfillment of bilateral agreements with the  United States.    The Bolivian and U.S. Governments have reached drug  enforcement agreements, including the gradual elimination of  surplus coca plantations, in which large sums of money have been  earmarked for alternative development programs, interdiction  actions against drug trafficking, and aid to help maintain  Bolivia's balance of payments.    President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada recently voiced his  concern over the presence of domestic disturbance factors in  some regions of the country when he referred to the possibility  of "narco-guerrilla" groups appearing in the country and warned  of the need to look into this possibility more carefully.    Sanchez de Lozada said that there are signs of underlying  violence in Chapare, and that if adequate and timely preventive  measures are not taken the region could become a territory  occupied by international drug cartels or even  "narco-guerrillas."    The president of the Republic's concern also reached  Congress, where it was stated that the possibility of violent  actions promoted by drug traffickers and terrorists in Chapare  "is real," according to recent comments by Cochabamba Deputy  Hector Cartagena, of the UCS [Solidarity Civic Union].    Military sources consulted by LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz stated  that the mentioned reports are being carefully assessed in order  to reach a specific institutional evaluation, but that in any  case it is up to President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, in his  capacity as the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, to make  the decision regarding the possibility of declaring Chapare, in  Cochabamba, a "military zone."</p>

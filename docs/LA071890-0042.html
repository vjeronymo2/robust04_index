			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNEY JUVENILE HALL RECERTIFIED BY STATE  </P> <P> Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey has been recertified. Barry Nidorf, chief  probation officer of Los Angeles County, told the Board of Supervisors on  Tuesday that the California Youth Authority restored Los Padrinos' certificate  Monday night after deciding that the crowded facility is providing proper  sleeping conditions.  </P> <P> Los Padrinos was decertified because youths were sleeping on four-inch  mattresses that didn't meet state standards. The 700-bed facility was turned  into a virtual factory last Thursday as workers stitched and stuffed 12-inch  mattresses.  </P></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Postcode directory to go to businesses A bulky new directory is soon to join BT's phone books, Yellow Pages, Thomson's directories and trade association year books on business bookshelves. Royal Mail, the letters division of the Post Office, plans to distribute free postcode directories to 2m businesses in the UK. Regional Postal Address Books will list the correct postal address and postcode for business and residential addresses in each of 11 regions. The directory will not include the names of householders, but will list business names of offices, factories, shops and banks. Its purpose is to improve the use of postcodes in business mailings to speed up sorting and distribution. A quarter of all mail is currently incorrectly addressed, with government departments and local authorities more likely than average to omit the correct postcode. The directories will be financed by advertising revenue and sales of other regional volumes where required. They may eventually be distributed more widely to homes, according to Mr Peter Howarth, managing director of Royal Mail. Distribution is due to begin in September and will be completed by March next year.</p>

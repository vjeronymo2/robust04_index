			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Regional News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] It was learned from a work conference on the  management of cable television, which opened on 4 March, that  according to relevant decrees and regulations on management  issued by the State Council and the Ministry of Radio, Film, and  Television, the Tibet Radio and Television Department, its  Public Security Bureau, and the State Security Department will  jointly conduct a comprehensive inspection, registration, and  rectification of units subscribing to cable television channels  and owning ground satellite stations in Tibet.    Because the work in management and other aspects failed to  keep abreast with the situation of rapid development, the blind  expansion of satellite ground stations and cable television  stations, poor censorship of programs, and other problems have  cropped up in some areas in Tibet in the past couple of years.  To solve these problems and to subject the utilization of  ground facilities for receiving statllite signals and the  management of cable television to legal administration for  orderly development, the regional radio and television  department, public security bureau, and state security  department will conduct a comprehensive inspection,  registration, and rectification campaign.    All units should immediately stop receiving and relaying  programs from the BBC; the Chinese Channel, the Entertainment  Channel, and the Sports Channel of Star TV; and other television  stations outside Tibet. Units owning two ground satellite  stations must close down one of them. The Holiday Inn and other  foreign-funded hotels, which have registered to receive programs  from outside Tibet, should immediately stop receiving and  relaying programs from the BBC. Units wishing to receive  programs from outside Tibet should undergo examination and  approval procedures again. Units which have applied for the  installation of such facilities and have received permits for  installation, permit-holding units which have clearified the  kinds of programs they are receiving, and units whose installed  facilities have passed assessment and have obtained permits to  broadcast programs must go through relevant procedures again  with the departments concerned by 5 April. Those who do not  comply with this order will be punished strictly according to  rules, and those who are involved in serious cases will be  charged with criminal responsibility.</p>

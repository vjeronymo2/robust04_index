			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Observer: Spell-cheque Microsoft chairman and co-founder Bill Gates is careful to whom he gives his home telephone number, but John Seabrook, interviewing Gates in the latest Esquire magazine, tells us the nerdish-looking multi-billionaire is more than happy to communicate via e-mail. Seabrook struck up a matey electronic relationship with 'Billg', quickly learning to copy the maestro by dispensing with formalities such as Dear and Yours. Gates apparently spends two hours a day reading and writing e-mail. While Gates gives little away - 'having lots of money is a corrupting thing' gives a flavour - former girl friends recall his apparent indifference to personal hygiene and his spectacles being so grimy as to be ineffective. Gates says he invariably runs a comb through his hair before dispatching e-mail - 'hoping to appear attractive'. Most odd.</p>

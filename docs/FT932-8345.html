			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Capital Exchange launches fund-raising initiative PLANS for a market in bonds issued by small and medium-sized unquoted companies have been launched by the Capital Exchange, a small company which is attempting to increase the supply of capital to small firms. Companies which have been trading for at least three years would be able to issue what would be known as SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) bonds for amounts of between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 5m. Capital Exchange hopes to launch the Private Syndicated Funding Scheme later this year, but will have to obtain approval from the Securities and Investments Board. The scheme is intended to make capital available to smaller companies which face the prospect of the possible closure of the USM and the ending of the Business Expansion Scheme at the end of this year. In January the Capital Exchange launched the Capital Exchange Gazette, a bi-monthly magazine intended to form a meeting place for small businesses seeking finance and private investors and larger companies looking for investment opportunities. The magazine has 400 subscribers, but Capital Exchange hopes to increase this to 50,000 within three years. The gazette is aimed at companies seeking between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 250,000. The bond scheme is for companies wanting larger amounts. The bonds of companies which pass the audit and management criteria for the private syndicated funding scheme will be offered to subscribers to the magazine and to the public by means of a synopsis in the national press. Bonds would be issued in Pounds 500 denominations. Interest, at an agreed rate above London Interbank Offered Rate, would be paid on half of the bonds' nominal value while dividends would be paid on the other half. Under normal circumstances, Capital Exchange said, companies would be expected to make dividend payments to bondholders. Information on bond-issuing companies would be included in the magazine and Capital Exchange would encourage operation of an after-market.</p>

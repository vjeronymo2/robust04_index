			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ophat Bunlom] </F>   [Text] The Thai government should honor its extradition  treaty with the United States and send Nakhon Phanom MP Thanong  Siriprichaphong to stand trial in that country where he is  accused of having smuggled in 45 tones of marijuana between 1973  and 1987, according to a legal expert.    Phanat Thatsaniyanon, a member of the government's mutual  legal assistance committee which handles the legal aspects of  extraditions, said the Thai government should comply with a  request by a U.S. court to have Thanong extradited to answer to  drug smuggling charges although under the Thai-U.S. treaty, the  Thai government can use its discretion.    "If the Thai government decides not to extradite Thanong to  stand trial in the United States, it must be able to explain  why. The Thai government cannot just cite 'national pride' for  not honoring the treaty," Phanat said.    "The international community has come a long way toward a  borderless world, with increasing cooperation among countries,  and Thailand should not hold back by stubbornly adhering to  false national pride," he said.    Phanat said the U.S. government had complied with requests  by  Thailand for the extradition of Thai citizens, including the  case of So Thanawisut, who fled to the United States after being  charged with masterminding a murder in Thailand several years  ago.    He said the U.S. government had consistently honored the  extradition treaty because it attached great importance to  bilateral cooperation in this area.    Phanat said in a Thai-U.S. extradition treaty ratified some  60 years ago, Thailand had made it a point not to send its own  citizens to stand trial in the United States under any  circumstance because of national pride. The agreement has since  been replaced by the Thai-U.S. extradition treaty of 1990, which  allows the Thai government to use its discretion on a  case-by-case basis.    Under normal procedures, the U.S. government will send an  extradition request to the Thai Foreign Ministry which in turn  will pass it on to the Police Department. The Police Department  will ask the Office of the Attorney General to seek a court  order for the extradition if it decides that the request should  be complied with.    "The whole business depends on the Thai government. If the  Thai government decides not to comply with the request, then  there will be no extradition," Phanat said.    Retired Supreme Court judge Sansoen Kraichitti, also a  member  of the mutual legal assistance committee, said a person  extradited under the treaty would be punished only after  standing trial in the other country and being found guilty of  the alleged crime.    Sansoen also said the Thai-U.S. extradition treaty did not  make it compulsory for the Thai government to comply with all  extradition requests made by the U.S. government.    He said those charged with drug trafficking and extradited  under the treaty must have allegedly committed the crime after  1991 because a provision in the Thai anti-drug law that allows  alleged offenders to be tried in foreign courts was introduced  in that year.    Chaikasem Nitisiri, deputy special prosecutor in charge of  international legal assistance on criminal matters, said  Thailand's Office of the Attorney General had not received a  formal request from U.S. law enforcement officials regarding  Thanong's extradition.    He ruled out the possibility of Thanong, a Chat Thai MP,  being extradited to the United States while Parliament is in  session.    "Even if we received an extradition request now, we would  not  be able to send Khun Thanong to the U.S. at this time, while  Parliament is in session," Chaikasem said.    MPs have immunity from legal prosecution while Parliament is  in session.</p>

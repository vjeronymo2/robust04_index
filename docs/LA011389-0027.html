			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ADMITS DISREPAIR AT NUCLEAR PLANTS  </P> <P> The government's nuclear weapons production plants have been allowed to  deteriorate so badly over the last 25 years that at least four of them probably  will have to be closed permanently and the rest will require at least $81  billion in repairs and cleanup, the Reagan Administration acknowledged  Thursday.  </P> <P> The current complex of 15 plants that build and service the nation's nuclear  bombs and warheads are no longer either environmentally safe or secure against  terrorist threats, the Administration said in a report. In addition, "public  opposition" to nuclear work in heavily populated areas has made some of the  plants, particularly the heavily contaminated Rocky Flats facility near Denver,  not worth spending the money to improve, it said.  </P> <P> The report, written by a panel of officials from the Energy Department and the  Pentagon, contains little information that has not already been released but is  the most comprehensive Administration public statement to date on the  production plants' problems.  </P> <P> Its recommendations, stressing the need for more repairs and investment along  with some plant closings, are not binding on the new Administration.  President-elect Bush, speaking to reporters after announcing that retired Adm.  James D. Watkins will be his energy secretary, said that he would not  necessarily accept its conclusions.  </P> <P> "I am not committed to any report," Bush said, adding that he would ask  Watkins, whose new department runs the weapons plants, to "immediately take a  look" at the problems of the weapons plants. The increased money the report  recommends would amount to a 50% increase in the budget for the nuclear program  for the next 20 years, an increase that will be difficult to fit into Bush's  plan for a "flexible freeze" on government spending.  </P> <P> Asked if further study of the issue might not increase risks of public harm or  environmental damage, Bush replied: "I think there's a risk if we imprudently  go forward (before) he and I have had a chance to take a hard look."  </P> <P> Watkins, saying that he had not yet had a chance to look at the report, told  reporters that the Navy's experience with reactors proves that nuclear programs  can be run safely. "And its about time to demonstrate to the American people we  can do it," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clean Bill of Health  </P> <P> Indeed, the plants that process uranium for Navy reactors were about the only  part of the nation's production complex that received a clean bill of health in  the document. The rest of the plants, which make tritium -- a radioactive gas  -- for hydrogen bombs, process plutonium and construct the bombs all pose  problems, it said.  </P> <P> No immediate changes were recommended at the government's three nuclear weapons  laboratories, which include the University of California's Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory. But because of increased population around the lab,  located about 30 miles inland from Oakland, future expansion should be  channeled to "a more remote site," the report suggested.  </P> <P> The study called for substantial changes at the plants that make tritium, which  decays rapidly, requiring a steady resupply to keep nuclear bombs ready for  use. Those plants, all at the Savannah River facility in South Carolina, are  all now shut down and probably will not be able to reopen until the end of the  year.  </P> <P> Many of the problems, the report concluded, were caused by federal budget cuts  that deferred maintenance.  </P> <P> The result has been that the plants, mostly built in the 1950s and mid-1960s,  "are rapidly reaching the end of their useful lives." Modernizing them will  cost at least $52 billion over the next 20 years, the report said. In addition,  another $29 billion will be needed to clean up environmental hazards, which  include radioactive wastes at some plants and toxic chemicals at others.  </P> <P> Along with modernization, the report suggests consolidation of the weapons  plants, concentrating them in a few sites that are remote from population  centers.  </P></p>

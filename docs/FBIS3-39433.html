			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Heinz Peter Ziegler] </F>   [Text] Modelled on the famous Ash Wednesday meetings by  former Bavarian Minister President Franz-Josef Strauss, Joerg  Haider, Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] chairman, gets even with  his political opponents in the Jahn assembly hall at Ried im  Innkreis, surrounded by beer mugs and pretzels. He says he has  again come to Ried this year in spite of being very busy with  election campaigns for three provincial government elections.  And he gets down to business immediately.    [Begin Haider recording] Of course, the Austrian People's  Party and Social Democratic Party of Austria are top in opinion  polls. But the elections have always been won by us, and this  will also be the case on 13 March. [end recording]    Haider also knows how he wants to win the elections. The  state, which has been ruined by the governing parties, must be  reorganized without taking anything away from hard working  people. This could be done by cutting bureaucracy, reforming  the social insurance system, and abolishing privileges for  functionaries.    [Begin recording] I think it is the wrong policy to say we  will secure our future social benefits by letting more  foreigners enter the country; they are known to have more  children than Austrians, and they will finance our social  benefits. I have a different opinion. We need fewer foreigners  and a sensible family policy so Austrians can afford children  and it is not a question of money whether we have children or  not. [end recording]    Haider also demands self-confidence for Austria's European  Union [EU] accession talks. He says the government has  submitted a declaration of capitulation in Brussels.    [Begin recording] Dr. Mock said we should enter the European  Union quickly because the window to Brussels is open. To, so to  speak, slip in through the window, then you are in, because it  could close again. We have to tell him, we Austrians are  self-confident enough to enter a house through the door.  Whoever wants to get us in through the window will not get us  in. Either they open the door properly, in which case we will  enter if we want to, or we will stay out. [end recording]    Another issue that is topical for Haider on Ash Wednesday is  that of the letter-bomb attacks. He rejects any link between  the FPOe and the attacks. And he suspects that those who are to  blame are to be found in a different political camp. A  confidant of the state police is behind bars as a suspect. And  another was arrested in the apartment of a well-known socialist  functionary in Vienna, Haider says.</p>

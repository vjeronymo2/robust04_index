			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Baltic back in black with Pounds 1.6m BALTIC, the finance and leasing company, returned to the black in the six months to end-June. On turnover reduced by disposals to Pounds 9.3m, against Pounds 19.5m, pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.58m, compared with losses of Pounds 2.73m. The shares rose 8p to 101p. The company said the improvement was mainly due to the lack of exceptional items, particularly bad debts of Pounds 5.5m. It added that after charging Pounds 1.6m for bad debts and interest rate hedges operating profits this time were down 43 per cent. During the period the company continued to focus on the reduction of debts and the development of fee earning capabilities. The book value of the lending portfolio was halved to Pounds 45m. Earnings per share came out at 1.2p (losses 6.5p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 0.5p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov by BTA </F> Bulgarian Economic Outlook (BEO) Correspondent Nacho Khalachev;  placer and date not given: "Bulgaria Pursues Sovereign Foreign  Policy"]    [Text] Sofia, March 11 (BTA) (You can read the  interview's full text in BEO No. 10 of March 11-17, 1994.)    Q.: Minister, which are Bulgaria's foreign policy priorities  now, in view of the changes which have taken place in this  country?    A.: Bulgaria pursues a sovereign foreign policy, proceeding  from its national interests and based on the universal standards  of international law. Our efforts are directed towards the  attainment of two strategic objectives: identifying an optimum  national security framework and creating foreign political  conditions for this country's transition to a market economy and  mitigation of any adverse external factors in this field.    These strategic objectives determine Bulgaria's specific  priorities, and above all the integration into the European  political, economic and military organizations and the  Euro-Atlantic security structures. The entry into force of  Bulgaria's Europe agreement will bring us considerably closer to  the European Union. At the same time, we will persist in our  efforts to promote economic contacts with the EFTA countries.  Bulgaria joined NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative and  will take an active part in it; will probably be granted special  status within the framework of the Western European Union.  Bulgaria will be the first postcommunist state to preside over  the Council of Europe.    Other priorities include promoting dialogue and updating the  contractual and legal framework of Bulgaria's relations with the  industrialized nations. At the same time, Bulgaria will also  seek to maintain active cooperation with the countries of  Eastern Europe, with Russia, Ukraine and the other countries of  the former Soviet Union.    It is our task to assist the creation of an external  environment that would guarantee our national security and  economic development. And this task is closely related to  Bulgaria's activities in the Balkans. Bulgaria will continue to  pursue balanced contacts with its next-door neighbours.    Q.: What are the objectives of Bulgarian diplomacy in Black  Sea Economic Cooperation?    A.: Bulgaria has supported the idea for Black Sea Economic  Cooperation from the very beginning and has substantially  contributed to the drafting and adoption of the documents on its  establishment. Bulgaria believes that Black Sea Economic  Cooperation need not turn into a closed integration community  but should rather continue developing as an open form of  regional economic cooperation, allowing its members to integrate  into the European structures.    Bulgarian diplomacy is also seeking to expedite work on  specific projects and on the achievement of concrete results  mainly in transport, communications, trade, power engineering,  environmental protection, science and technology, agriculture  and tourism.    Q.: How does Bulgarian diplomacy intend to help Bulgaria  regain and expand its market positions in the former Soviet  Union?    A.: Bulgarian-Russian relations are gradually entering the  stage of practical solution of outstanding problems, especially  in the trade and economic field. Our principal aim is clear:  To restore and strengthen the positions which Bulgaria has lost  in this boundless market. The Bulgarian-Russian Mixed  Commission will hold its second session in March to discuss  mainly economic issues such as debt settlement, payments system,  facilitating Bulgarian imports, and transport connections,  including the idea of a ferry service between Varna and  Novorossiysk. Bulgaria believes that trilateral talks should be  held with Russia and Ukraine to make efficient use of the  existing transport infrastructure.    The foundations of trade and economic cooperation with  states  of Central Asia and the Caucasus are being laid on the  initiative of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. This is a  difficult and slow process, but concrete results have already  been achieved. A protocol on the establishment of a joint  Balkan Credit Bank was signed with Kazakhstan in 1993.    Trade, financial and transport agreements are expected to be  signed this year with Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and  Uzbekistan.    Q.: To what extent are the priorities of Bulgarian diplomacy  determined by this country's economic interests?    A.: Bulgarian diplomacy still attaches primary importance to  seeking solutions and assisting various international  institutions and advanced countries for compensation of  Bulgaria's embargo- related losses and alleviating their burden  on its economy.    I believe there is broad political consensus in this country  on the invariability of the policy line towards Bulgaria's full  integration into the European economic area. You have witnessed  Bulgarian diplomatic activity over the past few years which  resulted in the signing of a Europe Agreement and an Interim  Trade Agreement between Bulgaria and the European Union. An  free trade agreement with the EFTA countries has already entered  into force. We intend to make still more active use of the  European Union's cooperation programmes and maximize the funds  provided within the framework of the PHARE [Economic  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] programme.  Bulgaria's full integration into the European Union is a  long-term target of this country's foreign policy.    I would like to stress the special importance we attach to  our relations with GATT. The negotiations have reached a  decisive stage. Bulgaria's accession to that organization would  guarantee this country equal participation in world economy and  trade, upgrade its international prestige and encourage foreign  investment.    Q.: Minister, thank you for this interview.</p>

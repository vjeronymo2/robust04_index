			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Tadpole Technology calls for Pounds 7m Shares in Tadpole Technology, the Cambridge-based electronics company, rose 31p to 316p yesterday despite interim losses and a Pounds 7m cash call. Indications are that the issue of 2.75m new shares at 260p apiece, through a placing and open offer fully underwritten by Albert E Sharp, will be oversubscribed. Funds raised in this manner will cost the company less than a conventional rights issue. The group incurred losses of Pounds 1.35m (profits of Pounds 27,000) before tax in the six months to March 31, on turnover ahead 19 per cent at Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 8.91m). Losses per share were 5.2p, against earnings last time of 0.3p. Analysts and investors were encouraged that the results were in line with the company's business plan and expect pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 1m for the full year. They were also encouraged by the announcement that Tadpole has signed a potentially lucrative contract with Digital Equipment to add to its existing agreements with International Business Machines and Sun Microsystems. The results reflected smaller sales of the market-leading portable workstation in the first half as customers anticipated the launch of a new version, the Sparcbook 3, and a decline in gross profit margins from 40 per cent to 31 per cent because of a change in product mix and the set-up costs of manufacturing a portable workstation for IBM. Tadpole leads the world in the technologies necessary to shrink a high powered engineering workstation to the size of a notebook computer. Its notebook workstations, which now represent 60 per cent of its business, are used by aerospace companies for maintenance and dealing houses for remote trading among other applications. The market today is worth about Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) and is reckoned to be growing at 100 per cent a year. Mr George Grey, chief executive, said the new money would be used to fund inventory growth arising from increased sales, tooling expenditure for new products and the repayment of bank borrowings, which stood at Pounds 1.83m on April 29. The order book was Pounds 7.9m at the beginning of the second half, 44 per cent ahead of the same period last year. Mr Grey said that further cash might be required from the market if growth exceeded expectations. The company was investigating the possibility of listing its stock as American Depositary Receipts in the US.</p>

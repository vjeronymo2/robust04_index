			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT ABOUT 'CATS'?  </P> <P> I take offense at some of the inane remarks made by Timberlake Wertenbaker in  your " 'Angry Young Man' is a Woman" article of Sept. 10. So films are for  children, and plays are the "real" intellectual voice? Might I suggest to our  pompous playwright that Olivier made "Hamlet"; Welles made "Citizen Kane," and  Coppola made the "Godfather" films -- all for adults. I guess "Starlight  Express," "Cats" and, God-only-knows, how many dreary theater revivals are  Wertenbaker's idea of stimulation for the mind.  </P> <P> MICHAEL HUENS  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

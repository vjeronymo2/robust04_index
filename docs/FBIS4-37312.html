			<p>BFN     [Text] London--Tujan al-Faysal, member of the Jordanian  House of Representatives, has assailed the unilateral tendency  in the negotiations with Israel.    In an interview with the London-based Lebanese newspaper  AL-HAYAH, published today, she emphasized that Jordan's interest  lies in coordination with Syria and Lebanon.    Answering a question on whether Jordan is heading for a  final  agreement with Israel apart from Syria and Lebanon, she said:  What I understood from the details of the closed parliamentary  session-- in which these issues were discussed and from which I  was absent--is that the Jordanian Government is showing  reservations about the subject of comprehensive coordination,  and of course I am opposed to this position.    She asked: Where is reason, logic, and interest when we opt  for coordination with Israel and the Palestinian entity and  ignore coordination with Syria and Lebanon?</p>

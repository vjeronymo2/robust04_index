			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont firm on his place at Treasury MR Norman Lamont sought yesterday to quash suggestions that Mr John Major might decide to move him from the Treasury in a new year reshuffle. The chancellor insisted that he would be delivering the next Budget in March. But the prime minister pointedly declined to rule out entirely the possibility of changes at the top of his government. While senior aides said that he had given 'no thought' to the issue, Mr Major would say only that he refused to be drawn into a reshuffle speculation. In a series of television interviews on the eve of the European Community summit in Edinburgh, the prime minister said: 'I will deal with reshuffles as and when we come to them.' Aides believe that Mr Major is unlikely to move Mr Lamont before the Budget, in spite of a growing view among cabinet colleagues that the chancellor no longer commands the confidence of most Conservative MPs. By refusing to rule out explicitly such a change, the prime minister is keeping his options open. Mr Lamont's comments were seen by Conservative colleagues as a veiled threat to Mr Major that he is ready to quit the government rather than accept another cabinet post if the prime minister seeks to move him. Mr Lamont - one of the handful of Euro-sceptics in the cabinet - has the support of many of the rightwing MPs on whom Mr Major must depend to secure ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Pressed during a television interview about persistent rumours of a new year reshuffle, Mr Lamont responded: 'I am here as chancellor and I will be delivering the Budget.' He acknowledged that such a decision was a 'matter for the prime minister', but then repeated that he would not be moved before March. Cabinet colleagues judge that Mr Kenneth Clarke is the strongest candidate to replace Mr Lamont at the Treasury. But the home secretary's strongly pro-European views would enrage the Euro-sceptics, suggesting that his chances for the job would be improved if a reshuffle is delayed until after the Commons completes ratification of Maastricht in the summer.</p>

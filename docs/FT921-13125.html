			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dissident shareholders criticise MEPC pay-out ASSOCIATES of Mr Harry Hyams, the reclusive property developer, yesterday challenged MEPC's decision to pay an increased final dividend at the property company's annual meeting. The intervention appeared to be a legacy of the acrimonious Pounds 516.4m takeover of Mr Hyams's property company, Oldham Estate, in 1987. Mr Hyams retained a fraction of his 28 per cent stake, apparently to express solidarity with a handful of small shareholders who opposed the offer. The dissidents criticised the performance of MEPC's share price and shareholder funds. They also implied that the dividend would not be covered if MEPC had not capitalised its interest costs. The four shareholders associated with Mr Hyams insisted on a poll being held, despite representing just 20.5m shares compared with MEPC's 125m proxy votes. MEPC was proposing to increase the final dividend by 1p per share to 14.75p, making a total of 20p (19p) for the year. The meeting, which took one hour and 40 minutes, was held at Centre Point, the London office tower built by Mr Hyams which attracted controversy because it stood empty for many years. Mr Jim Beveridge, MEPC's finance director, said that Mr Hyams was noted for his dislike of paying dividends. He said the inference that MEPC's dividend was not adequately covered was 'completely wrong'. He said that the shareholders had previously asked MEPC questions at an annual meeting of Oldham Estate. 'There is a residual body of Oldham shareholders who are angry that MEPC took Oldham over and ask embarrassing questions at meetings,' said Mr Beveridge. One of Mr Hyams's associates criticised MEPC for spending Pounds 6.5m on the refurbishment of Centre Point. Sir Christopher Benson, MEPC's chairman said it was too detailed a question to be answered during the meeting. MEPC issued a statement to the Stock Exchange, which said that its resolution to pay a final dividend had been passed following a poll and that the dividend cheques were being posted. Its share price fell from 398p to 381p. The dissidents' sharp questioning of MEPC's management was in marked contrast to the adulatory Oldham meetings Mr Hyams held. Although usually held at inconvenient times such as New Year's Eve, the Oldham meetings were never dull. On one occasion in the early 1970s, the secretive and reclusive Mr Hyams donned a Mickey Mouse mask to taunt journalists and photographers excluded from the meeting.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Brussels steps up pressure on Italian steel THE European Commission has stepped up pressure on the Italian government to justify the planned restructuring of Ilva, the state-owned Italian steel company. Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, has written to Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, identifying problems with the latest plan and calling for a rapid response - possibly including drastic capacity cuts. Separately, the Commission has decided to renounce 40 per cent of its DM175m (Pounds 71m) loan to Klockner-Werke, the troubled German steel and engineering group. It is now waiting for the German company to sign an agreement to cut this year's production by 20 per cent in crude steel, and from 4.2m tonnes to 3.7m tonnes in hot rolled products. Once confirmed, the decision will allow Klockner, which has been fighting bankruptcy, to go ahead with a debt rescheduling deal involving all its creditors. Commission officials claimed yesterday that the German company's plans were in line with the EC's calls for capacity cuts across the whole Community industry and did not amount to special treatment for Klockner. Mr Van Miert's letter to the Italian government is the latest in a tense exchange between Brussels and Rome. Mr Savona wrote to Mr Van Miert after an industry ministers' meeting two weeks ago to voice his concern at the commissioner's analysis of the Ilva plan. Iri, the Italian state holding company, had only submitted the new plan three days earlier. But in his letter Mr Van Miert confirms his original opinion that the Ilva plan involves Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of state aids. he says such subsidies will have to be accompanied by up to 3m tonnes of capacity cuts, if the plan is to fit into the EC package. The Italian authorities say they are happy to go along with the EC steel plan, but deny that subsidies are involved. A Commission spokesman said yesterday that the letter was neither a criticism of the Ilva plan, nor an ultimatum, but he added: 'It's based on certain observations and a serious analysis. If we don't have a quick solution, the whole EC plan will be in jeopardy.' Mr Van Miert wants member states to decide on a series of controversial aid-and-restructuring cases involving the Italian, Spanish and east German steel-makers at a special meeting of industry ministers in July.</p>

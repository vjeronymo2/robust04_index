			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS: DEPARTMENT STORE AS ENDANGERED SPECIES  </P> <P> As Christmas nears, many needy institutions seek the public's charity dollars.  Please consider the local department stores.  </P> <P> It shouldn't be hard to feel charitable. In many cases, it's the time of year  they're most attractive -- bustling with life, offering such rare services as  salespeople and free gift wrap. In some cases, the need is particularly  poignant: They may not be around next year.  </P> <P> Their desperation shows. Some kicked off their Christmas season by Halloween  this year. Some, fearing mere goods won't draw customers, are running  sweepstakes and offering premiums.  </P> <P> Their current November, Thanksgiving and pre-Christmas sales top off a year of  almost back-to-back two- and three-day sales. And still one could have shopped  almost alone some days and most evenings.  </P> <P> As it is, the retail landscape is "excessively over-stored" for today's  consumer, according to Price Waterhouse's Management Horizons division in  Columbus, Ohio. The consulting firm's recent report on retailing in the year  2000 predicts that half of today's retailers will be gone in a decade.  </P> <P> Traditional department stores are considered most vulnerable, having faded for  years. In prime downtown locations, they used to offer one-stop shopping for  everything from sewing goods to refrigerators, and they commanded the loyalty  of customers holding their individual charge cards.  </P> <P> Then came competition of all kinds. In the '50s, it came from new suburban  stores, drawing people out of downtown, and from the advent of discount stores,  particularly those selling hard goods.  </P> <P> In the '60s, it came from the regional mall, itself "a one-stop shop," says  Leonard Berry, director of the center for retailing studies at Texas A&amp;M.  Such malls were (and are) "anchored" by department stores but featured smaller  specialty stores as well, selling goods department stores also sold --  stationery, linens, separate categories of fashion (casual clothes, kid's  clothes, shoes).  </P> <P> Mass merchandise specialists took over in the '70s, selling more of the same  merchandise department stores offered, but in great volume and at deep discount  -- Toys R Us, Home Depot, fabric stores. In the '80s, it was fashion specialty  chains such as the Gap, the Limited, Ann Taylor, offering particular customers  savings in time and energy if not discounts. Such stores offer particular,  distinctive styles -- young, trendy, career-oriented. "With everyone working,  who has time to hunt and peck through a department store?" says Sarah Stack,  retail analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Over the last 30 years, all these new formats have arisen, each in its own way  taking market share from department stores," says Thomas M. Murnane, Management  Horizons' executive vice president in Los Angeles. "Discounters offer  convenience and price, specialists offer fashion and service, mass  merchandisers offer assortment and price." And bank cards and national charge  cards dissipated store loyalties further.  </P> <P> Department stores were still attractive enough to become buyout prey in the  '80s, when some buyers were attracted to anything standing. Whatever their  market problems before the mergers, acquisitions and debt-heavy takeovers, the  stores involved had problems thereafter. They were left cash-poor, saddled by  debt, and depleted, long on financial management and short on merchandising  talent, help, ideas and even goods from some top manufacturers who "are afraid  to ship for fear of not getting paid," says Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at  Management Horizons in Columbus.  </P> <P> The most common response is price cutting -- "the crudest form of competition  if they don't have a good combination of other store attributes, like quality,  selection, fashion," says Murnane. It's also a competition department stores  must lose, given their overhead.  </P> <P> The most secure stores, in fact, compete on bases other than price. Nordstrom,  Saks Fifth Avenue, and others often cited as healthy, offer fashion, quality,  service, even relatively high prices, because they're "catering to a customer  not as affected by price," says James Slayden, a retired retail executive now  teaching retail management at USC.  </P> <P> Some experts seem to suggest that such fashion and service would save all  department stores. But the kind of fashion admired, and the service usually  touted -- helping customers accessorize outfits, calling them with merchandise  bulletins -- is more appealing to big spenders and marketing analysts than to  middle-class shoppers.  </P> <P> There are still people who believe that, somehow, department stores will  survive. As Slayden points out, "For 40 years, we've been burying the  department store," and they're not dead yet. Department stores have "unique  locational advantages, heritage and image," says Murnane. They should even have  more customers "as the consumer population ages," says Berry. "People in their  50s grew up with department stores, and they're used to them."  </P> <P> Maybe so. But for some stores, even the merriest Christmas may not be enough.  </P></p>

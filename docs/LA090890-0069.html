			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UNICEF SEEKING $5.2 MILLION FOR REFUGEE AID  </P> <P> The U.N. Children's Fund, which last week appealed for $585,000 to aid  thousands of refugees streaming into Jordan from Kuwait and Iraq, raised its  target nearly tenfold Friday to $5.2 million.  </P> <P> "The numbers of affected persons continue to increase daily as more cross the  borders. Those crossing now are generally of more limited means and therefore  in need of greater support," UNICEF Executive Director James Grant said in a  press statement.  </P> <P> UNICEF said half a million people had entered Jordan since Iraq's invasion of  Kuwait on Aug. 2. It said as many as half a million additional evacuees, poorer  and more desperate, are expected to arrive soon.  </P></p>

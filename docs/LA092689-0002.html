			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is expected to join Interpol by the end of next year, a senior  official of the 147-nation international police coordinating body said in  London. Secretary General Raymond Kendall said he expects Moscow to apply for  membership in time for the group's 1990 annual assembly. There has been an  upsurge of crime in the Soviet Union, Kendall said, and Moscow has become a  transit point for international drug smugglers who use the Soviet airline  Aeroflot because it is thought to be above suspicion. Hungary, Romania and  Yugoslavia are the only East European members of Interpol.  </P></p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Former Saudi bank head to pay Dollars 220m in BCCI charges waiver The former head of Saudi Arabia's biggest commercial bank is to pay more than Dollars 220m (Pounds 147m) as part of a deal with the US authorities to drop charges against him in relation to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the former chief operating officer of National Commercial Bank, reached an agreement yesterday with Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, under which BCCI-related fraud indictments brought against him last year have been dropped. The plea bargain marks the latest high-profile case concerning BCCI in which Mr Morgenthau has failed to secure a criminal conviction. A case brought against Washington lawyer Mr Robert Altman for allegedly helping BCCI gain secret control illegally of First American Bankshares, a US bank, collapsed in August. Later, Mr Morgenthau dropped similar charges against Mr Clark Clifford, a former US defence secretary. Yesterday's deal could lead to US investigators obtaining valuable new information in their continuing investigations into BCCI. Sheikh Khalid is believed to have agreed to provide information on senior executives in the collapsed bank, and the role of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in BCCI. Under the terms of the plea bargain, Sheikh Khalid is to pay about Dollars 35m to the US Federal Reserve and Dollars 2m to the district attorney's office to cover costs, in return for the dropping of civil and criminal charges against him. He will also pay Dollars 188m into an escrow account to fund other possible civil cases against him. Sheikh Khalid and National Commercial Bank are being sued for Dollars 10.5bn by the liquidators to BCCI, who claim he broke US laws by engaging in racketeering and fraud. The liquidators' writ alleges that Sheikh Khalid channelled nearly Dollars 1bn through NCB to buy a stake in BCCI and in the parent company of First American Bankshares. National Commercial Bank is the biggest bank in Saudi Arabia and the only private one. It holds the Saudi royal family accounts.</p>

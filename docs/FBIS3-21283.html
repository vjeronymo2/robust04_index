			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Radhanath Chaturvedi: "Challenges Before the </F> Finance Minister in the New Budget"; quotation marks as  published]    [Text] The central government budget is to be presented in  the Parliament on 28 February. Unless something unforeseen  happens, the budget this year will be presented on or before 28  February. Before it, the traditional financial survey will be  presented.    Due to the accusations levied in the report that the Joint  Parliamentary Committee (JPC) had presented, Manmohan Singh, and  not others, had submitted his resignation. This resignation had  created an atmosphere of uncertainty. The prime minister, by  rejecting it, had removed this fog of uncertainty.    Whether Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was right or wrong in  doing so is not appropriate for discussion here. We have to  limit our discussion here to inflation and other economic issues.    The Congress (I) could not reduce prices of commodities  within 100 days as it promised in its election manifesto.  Instead, the prices increased. As for the present fiscal year,  prices of coal and steel increased. This increase was affected  by the government itself and did so by saying that their  production costs had increased. The wages for laborers had to be  increased. Almost a similar reason was given for increasing  railway fares and cargo rates. Except for one time, the rate of  inflation averaged 8.5 percent. If the finance minister wants to  reduced budget deficit, which is his greatest challenge at this  time, he must reduce inflation rate and prices of commodities.    We cannot say that nature is not helping the finance  minister. Like the last five years, there were good rains this  year also. More than 180 million tons of grains were produced.  Production of oil seeds always cause concern, however, this year  their production was satisfactory to an extent. Saurashtra,  where we have good yield of peanuts, could not produce as good a  peanut harvest as expected because of natural catastrophes.    Despite the good grains harvest and satisfactory oil seeds  production, the prices of grains and oil seeds have increased.  Even more troubling is the increase in pulses prices. In a  country like India, be one rich or poor, pulses are the main  source of proteins. Last year, pulses were around 15-16, and now  arhar pulse, the most popular of the pulses, costs 23 rupees per  kilogram. The same is true about mung, urd, and other pulses.    The combination of these reasons has increased the cost of  living by 10.7 percent and the wholesale price index has gone up  by 9 percent. The increase in inflation during this fiscal year  will force the finance minister to seriously rethink his  policies about prices and control in other areas. He has to keep  in mind that there was no such thing as the Gulf war this year  which could help an average citizen to understand the reason for  price increase and excuse him for it. The government did lift  control over the lubricants, however this could not have  affected the inflation rate to rise 10-11 percent. What is the  reason for it? The finance minister has to think about it. There  was a rumor that the finance ministry was increasing petroleum  prices to help reduce the cost of subsidies. However, there were  elections in five states. Perhaps, that is why the finance  ministry had to drop the idea of increasing petroleum prices.    If we look at the price indicators of the first half before  December 1993, we will find that there was an increase of prices  of almost all the listed items. The most significant aspect was  the increase in electricity rates. The prices of fuel were also  up. All these affect the common people. One reason for the  increase in electricity rates is the widespread theft of  electric power. The government of the Electricity Board is not  able to stop it. This theft usually occurs where electricity  lines pass through slums where they pirate electricity by  connecting illegally. When the question of taken action against  these arises, the electricity department is told to be quiet and  do not do anything.' [sentence as published] The leaders tell  them, "It is where we will get our votes from." In other  category are those rich people who damage their meters. This  question is related to ethics and should be corrected at that  level. The consumers and the corrupt electricity department  employees work together in stealing electricity this way.    The price indicator last year was 231, and it has increased  to more than 240 this year.    The prices of grains increased by 8.8 percent, prices of  pulses by 40 percent, and electricity rates by 37 percent. The  rise prices of oil seeds was the least, a record of half  percent. Sugar prices increased by about 30 percent. Other  increases were: cloth 10 percent, steal by percent, and chemical  products about 5 percent. Measures should be taken to stop  additional increases, only then will the inflation be checked.    It is not impossible to do that. There was good agricultural  production in 1992-93 and receipt were also good. Because of the  additional agricultural production of 180 million, receipts were  high again. By the middle of 1994, the government warehouses  will be full with these collected grains.    In some parts of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Punjab,  the  cotton crop was badly destroyed by disease. That led to the  recent increase in cotton prices. Still, no demand was made to  import cotton. This means that what was produced will meet the  need of our country. It is true that there has been some  reduction in the production of sugar. Compared to the 1992-93  production of 13.4 million tons, this year the production was  only 10.6 million tons, and this reduction has affected increase  in its prices. It is estimated that the production of sugar will  reach 11 million tons.    The challenge the finance minister has to meet while writing  the 1994-95 budget will require help from gods. This help should  be in the form of increased agricultural production. At the same  time, there should a sizeable increase in industrial production.  Chemical fertilizers and electric power must he provided to  farmers and industrialists at subsidized rates. If it is not  done then clearly the industrialists and farmers will not be  able to do their job lacking these basic needs of production. If  the rates of fertilizers and electricity increase, they will not  have the purchasing power to meet their needs, and this will  finally result in four-fold increase in prices.</p>

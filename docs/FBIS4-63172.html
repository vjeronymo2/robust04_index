			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his Liberal Democratic Party faction  stormed out of the State Duma on Friday in protest against a TV  report claiming that he had paid his faction members 500 US  dollars each for voting in favour of the draft budget.    Zhirinovskiy told lawmakers that his party "can no longer  tolerate lies and slander in the press". He added that in  retaliation he had designed "a complex of measures", but did not  elaborate.    The scandal erupted after Nikolay Svanidze, an anchorman of  the "Podrobnosti" (details) news programme of the Russian TV  announced that Zhirinovskiy is paying his party members.    Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin told lawmakers that his deputy  Mikhail Mityukov had sent a message to Oleg Poptsov, head of the  Russian TV, demanding to sack Svanidze.    However, the anchorman told TASS on Friday that he is ready  to submit proofs of his statements in court.    Svanidze denounced Zhirinovskiy's demands to sack him until  a  court ruling is passed. "I could have with the same success  demanded to keep the LDPR leader from work in Duma", he said and  added that he is ready to invite Zhirinovskiy to clarify the  scandal in the "Podrobnosti" programme.</p>

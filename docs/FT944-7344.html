			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Trade News: EU plans trade zone with S Americans The European Union and Mercosur, the South American trade grouping of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, yesterday announced plans to negotiate a free trade zone between them. A proposal from the European Commission to begin negotiations will be considered by EU foreign ministers next Monday. It is expected to be given formal approval by the EU summit in Essen on December 9 and 10. 'The central idea is to work in a realistic and pragmatic way towards a common free trade zone,' said Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, in Brussels yesterday. He and his three South American counterparts met the head of the commission, Mr Jacques Delors, and the commissioner in charge of relations with Latin America, Mr Manuel Marin. The EU has been the largest trading partner with the four countries since 1986. According to commission officials, the southern cone of South America is by far the fastest growing market for European exports. In 1992, the EU accounted for 27 per cent of Mercosur exports - against 21 per cent for North America, 48 per cent of direct foreign investment and 42 per cent of the group's foreign aid. No formal timetable was given for a free trade accord with Mercosur. Informally, officials have indicated a free trade zone could be in place by the year 2001. Detailed negotiations are expected to begin next year over trade liberalisation in the short-term, with the ultimate goal of a formal free zone being cemented later. The EU wants to see a Mercosur customs union in place, and a Mercosur institution established with which to negotiate. A Mercosur customs union setting a common external tariff for 85 per cent of goods will come into force on January 1, with the timetable for the most of the rest already negotiated. According to the Commission proposal going to ministers on Monday, the aim is 'the gradual establishment of a free trade zone in industrial goods and reciprocal and progressive liberalisation of farm trade (taking into account the sensitivity of certain products)'. 'This is a bold strategy but we have to move quickly, even if the goal is long term,' said one Commission official. The Commission calculates that with free trade in prospect European exports could be expected to grow at nearly double the rate of any other region. The Mercosur move is one of a number of trade initiatives being directed at areas outside Europe. It is also part of a larger package aimed at Latin America - containing a variety of new and existing policies - expected formally to be announced at the EU summit in Essen. The timing of the announcement - ahead of the Summit of the Americas hosted by President Bill Clinton in Miami which concludes on December 11 - is not accidental, says Mr Wolf Grabendorff of the Institute for European-Latin American Relations in Madrid. He says the message is that Europe - having maintained strong economic relations with South America during the debt-distressed decade of the 1980s  -does not plan to abandon the region to the US now that it is enjoying some economic success. The package also includes plans to enhance economic relations with Mexico, and to extend the generalised system of preferences arrangements with the Andean countries and central America. However, while the EU rhetoric speaks of free trade, the practical difficulties for many South American exporters to Europe have increased over the last five years. In a speech this week to a conference in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian ambassador to London, Mr Rubens Barbosa, said Brazilian exporters face non-tariff barriers, anti-dumping procedures, restrictions arising out of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, and distortions caused by preferential treatment of countries with privileged relations to the EU.</p>

The poll by MORI for American Express, conducted among 101 board directors of Britain's largest 500 companies, revealed that 39 per cent of those polled believed their companies had increased trade with Europe since 1989, in spite of the fact that 35 per cent said EU developments had led to stiffer competition.</p>

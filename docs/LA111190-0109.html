			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG TEN ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CARLSON'S KICKS HELP MICHIGAN BEAT ILLINI  </P> <P> J.D. Carlson tied a school record with five field goals as No. 19 Michigan  defeated No. 17 Illinois, 22-17, in a Big Ten game Saturday at Ann Arbor, Mich.  </P> <P> "There's no question we felt we beat a great Illinois football team," said  Michigan Coach Gary Moeller. "I knew they would be back after they got blown  out (54-28 by Iowa) last week."  </P> <P> Carlson equaled the mark set by Mike Gillette in a 22-7 win over Minnesota on  Nov. 5, 1988.  </P> <P> "A lot of field goals were really crucial," Carlson said. "It was a lot of  strategy out there today. If I had missed, Illinois could have come down and  put up some touchdowns."  </P> <P> His 51-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter bounced off the  crossbar and through the uprights.  </P> <P> The Wolverines, 6-3 overall and 4-2 in the Big Ten, led 19-3 after three  quarters and got a key interception by Vada Murray at their own two-yard line  with six minutes remaining.  </P> <P> Michigan then ran out the clock, driving to the Illinois 22 before time  expired.  </P> <P> "It was my fault," Illinois quarterback Jason Verduzco said. "I read it wrong.  I shouldn't have thrown it down there, but I did."  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive loss for the Fighting Illini (6-3, 4-2) who have  lost five in a row to Michigan and haven't won at Ann Arbor since 1966.  </P> <P> Carlson kicked field goals of 28, 51, 19, 18 and 18 yards. Freshman Ricky  Powers, who ran for 113 yards in 23 carries, had a three-yard run for  Michigan's only touchdown.  </P> <P> Shawn Wax, who had four catches for 64 yards, caught a 30-yard touchdown pass  from Verduzco and Wax tossed a 26-yard scoring strike to Steven Mueller for the  Illini, whose other points came on a 32-yard field goal by Doug Higgins.  </P> <P> Michigan had 432 yards, 303 on the ground. The Illini, held to 13 first downs  and possession time of 20:04, had 215 yards.  </P> <P> Michigan State 28, Minnesota 16 -- The Spartans eliminated the Gophers from the  Rose Bowl race by defeating them at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Michigan State (5-3-1, 4-2) kept its slim Rose Bowl chances alive, moving  within one game of Iowa, which lost to Ohio State.  </P> <P> The Spartans, who close the season against Northwestern and Wisconsin, have  already lost to Iowa. Michigan and Illinois are also 4-2 and Ohio State is  4-1-1.  </P> <P> Michigan State has already announced that it will appear in the John Hancock  Bowl (formerly Sun Bowl) in El Paso, Tex., if it doesn't win the Big Ten.  </P> <P> Hyland Hickson rushed for 97 yards and Tico Duckett had 76 to lead a Spartan  ground game that gained 242 yards against Minnesota. Each ran for a touchdown,  as did Courtney Hawkins and quarterback Dan Enos.  </P> <P> All four Michigan State touchdowns capped long, ground-oriented drives.  </P> <P> Minnesota's lone bright spot was the passing of Marquel Fleetwood, who missed  the last game with a collarbone injury. He completed 16 of 27 passes for 164  yards and scored on an 11-yard run.  </P> <P> Indiana 20, Wisconsin 7 -- Vaughn Dunbar rushed for 161 yards and one touchdown  and Rob Turner scored on a 67-yard pass play as the Hoosiers beat the Badgers  in a Big Ten game at Bloomington, Ind.  </P> <P> It was the first victory in five weeks for Indiana (5-3-1, 2-3-1) and the 11th  consecutive conference loss over two seasons for Wisconsin (1-8, 0-6).  </P> <P> Scott Bonnell added field goals of 43 and and 41 yards as the Hoosiers kept  alive their hopes for a bowl bid.  </P> <P> Purdue 33, Northwestern 13 -- Eric Hunter ran for two touchdowns and passed for  another in leading the Boilermakers over the Wildcats in a Big Ten game at  Evanston, Ill.  </P> <P> Hunter completed 17 of 28 passes for 185 yards before leaving the game late in  the third quarter with a bruised knee.  </P> <P> The Boilermakers (2-7, 1-5) scored 21 points in the third quarter and Jarrett  Scales returned a blocked punt 18 yards for a touchdown in the fourth.  </P> <P> Northwestern dropped to 2-7 and 1-5.  </P></p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: SEET reduces losses to Pounds 630,000 Pre-tax losses at SEET, the Edinburgh-based textile company, were halved in the year to April 30. However the shares still shed 6p to close at 42p. On turnover of Pounds 7.14m (Pounds 5.94m) pre-tax losses were Pounds 630,000 (Pounds 1.25m). Losses per share were 15.6p (24p). An extraordinary profit of Pounds 260,000 (Pounds 123,000) cut the attributable loss to Pounds 364,000 (Pounds 840,000). Mr Jock Mackenzie, chairman, said that Peter MacArthur and Co. had made good use of the increasing popularity of tartans to increase sales and profits and now had a healthy order book. Kenneth Mackenzie Holdings increased turnover and reduced its losses significantly. The Homemaker retail side, in which SEET has a 46 per cent interest, reported a small trading profit for the year. As expected the sale of Homemaker did not take place but SEET has reached agreement with the original vendors under which it has received Dollars 350,000 from the vendors and Dollars 150,000 from Homemaker. Further payments totalling Dollars 900,000 are due over the next four years provided Homemaker remains within the group. Should Homemaker be sold before August 1996 SEET will receive 65 per cent of the proceeds. In the present year Mr Mackenzie said that all companies were trading at a more profitable level than in the comparable period.</p>

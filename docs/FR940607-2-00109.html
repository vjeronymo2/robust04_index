			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted, and the duties and responsibilities of the directors of the Funds with respect to the various classes of shares will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished to the directors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in each of its prospectuses regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of the Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it also will disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present each class of shares separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant to Distribution Plans in reliance on the exemptive order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net assets of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. If a Fund implements any amendment to the Distribution Plan or other plan adopted under rule 12b&hyph;1 (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a ``non-rule 12b&hyph;1'' shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by a Target Class under the plan, then Purchase Class shares will stop converting into shares of that Target Class, unless Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the amendment. The directors shall take any action necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class shares as they existed prior to implementation of the amendment, no later than the date those Purchase Class shares were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class'') of shares, identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects, except that the new Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class and New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the amendment may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of that plan to the Purchase Class are disclosed in an effective registration statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Funds to meet class expenses shall provide to the board of directors and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which those expenditures were made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, as that rule is currently stated in Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or modified in the future.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

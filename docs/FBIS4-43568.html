[passage omitted]    The French proposal is not meeting unanimous approval: The  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is repeating this evening that it  will not hear of French soldiers in Rwanda. It has even refused  to listen to Jean-Michel Marlaud, the French ambassador to  Rwanda, who has been given the task of contacting all the sides  quickly. Paul Kagame, the RPF military head, has just said that  he will not meet Jean-Michel Marlaud. [passage omitted]</p>

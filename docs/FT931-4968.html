			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Lang to unveil Scots constitutional plans without conceding the creation of a Scottish assembly or parliament - are to be unveiled this afternoon by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary. They include proposals to increase the scope of the Scottish grand committee, which includes all 72 Scottish MPs and to devolve more administrative powers from London to the Scottish Office. The grand committee is likely to handle at least some sessions of Scottish questions to the Scottish Office ministers and to debate non-contentious Scottish legislation. The Scottish Office could take responsibility for training from the Department of Employment. Accompanying the package should be an announcement that some civil servants dealing with the regulation of North Sea oil in the Department of Trade and Industry will move to Aberdeen. The package, contained in a consultation paper, is certain to be attacked by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party. Even people associated with the government concede that it may not win it many friends. Yet the widespread view in Scotland is that the government will probably get away with it. The package is the fulfilment of a statement by Mr John Major last February that while ruling out any change to the union of Scotland and England, he would 'take stock' after the election. It was a sensible precaution because at that stage it seemed likely that even if the Tories won the election they would lose many of their nine seats in Scotland. In the event the Tories took two seats in the election and raised their 24 per cent share of the Scottish vote by nearly two points. The government is going ahead with the move partly because Mr Lang has made conciliation and consultation the hallmarks of his administration since the election, and partly because he believes he can outflank the opposition. After the election a cross-party organisation called Scotland United was formed to keep up the fight for constitutional change, but its demonstrations soon fizzled out. Mr Lang knows, however, that nothing he does will satisfy the pro-devolutionists, or assuage the nationalists. But he believes his proposals are enough to keep the constitutional issue off the boil.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The leader of the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), one of the seven parties in  the ruling coalition, said Wednesday [13 April] that Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata is the most probable successor to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, minister of health and welfare,  hinted, however, at his disapproval of behind-the-scene deals  among coalition parties over cabinet posts. "The new prime  minister should select new cabinet ministers," he told reporters.    Work on allocation of cabinet posts "must begin after  procedures are worked out and a new prime minister is picked,"  Ouchi said.    Ouchi's comment alluded to news reports that Social  Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo is tipped to  become new chief cabinet secretary under Hata, who is the head  of Shinseito, the most influential force in the coalition.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Rabin gives cautious backing to bank plan Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday gave his backing in principle to the creation of a Middle East development bank which would help finance regional projects worth tens of billions of dollars. However, in a meeting with Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, and Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, Mr Rabin made clear that Israel would support the idea so long as it would not yet have to make any financial contribution to the bank, which Mr Peres says would be capitalised initially at Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.1bn). Mr Rabin also made his support conditional on further study and government app-roval and an understanding with the US that any funds given by Washington to such a bank would not be deducted from US aid to Israel - worth Dollars 3bn a year and a further Dollars 2bn in loan guarantees. The commitment to create a regional development bank is expected to be enshrined in a declaration next Tuesday at the end of the Middle East/North Africa Economic Summit in Casablanca. The summit will establish an international working group to consider the feasibility of a regional bank and to report back at the regional economic conference expected to be held in Amman next spring. Mr Rabin's hesitant commitment to the bank reflects differences between the foreign ministry and treasury. Mr Peres has been an advocate of a regional bank to be a cornerstone of his vision of a Middle East Common Market modelled on the European Union. The foreign minister has built a consensus with Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians in the past three months on the need for the bank as a symbol of commitment to economic integration. They have campaigned for US backing, proposing a bank which would be capitalised 40 per cent by countries in the region and 60 per cent by others, such as the US, the European Union and Japan. Each country or bloc would have voting rights in proportion to its gross national product. The bank, modelled on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, would principally make capital investments and long-term loans for regional infrastructure projects, would provide technical assistance for projects and would raise and lend money on international capital markets. Mr Peres has proposed Israel invest 5 per cent of the bank's capital, or Dollars 500m. The regional bank would overcome problems the World Bank has in lending for regional projects. The World Bank also cannot lend to Israel because its per capita income is too high and cannot lend to the Palestinians because they are not a state. But both the Israeli and US treasuries have been extremely cautious about creation of another regional development bank and are not impressed by the current level of regional economic cohesion. They also prefer future regional projects to be co-financed by other multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank and are anxious to avoid creation of a bank which would lend at concessional rather than market rates.</p>

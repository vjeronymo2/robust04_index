			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Amy Liu] </F>   [Excerpt] A wedding banquet for a dissident couple in  Beijing earlier this week was cancelled due to the escalating  security surveillance in the capital city.    Meanwhile, authorities announced yesterday a set of  regulations designed to silence the vocal dissident community.  In the runup to the fifth anniversary of the 4 June military  crackdown on the pro-democracy movement police have stepped up  close surveillance on dissidents.    The ninth student leader on the wanted list for the 1989  protests, Zheng Xuguang, married recently in Xian and the couple  had their honeymoon in Beijing earlier this week.    Mr. Zheng had planned to hold a wedding banquet on Thursday  night in the capital, however he and his wife were ordered to  return to Xian on Thursday by his parents-in-law, who were  believed to be under pressure by police authorities, sources  said. At least 10 guests invited to the banquet were from the  dissident community.    Mr. Zheng was arrested in Beijing in January following his  meeting with the pro-democracy Peace Charter campaigners. Due  to close surveillance dissidents in Beijing said they found it  difficult to move within the city.    Apart from the 4 June anniversary, the tightened security is  also meant to keep dissidents quiet and avoid detention which  may cause complications to the Sino-United States row over human  rights.

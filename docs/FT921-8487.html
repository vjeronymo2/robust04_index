			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Hitachi enters white-goods market HOOVER is to sell washing machines to Hitachi for marketing under the Japanese company's name. This is the first step into the white-goods market for Hitachi and will cause tremors in an industry which is suffering from considerable oversupply and falling demand. In an allied move Hoover is to reorganise production in Britain and is closing its distribution depot in Bolton, Greater Manchester, with the loss of about 250 jobs. It will concentrate distribution at its new Pounds 14m centre in Merthyr Tydfil, opened last autumn. Hoover, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maytag of the US, is to move production of motors for washing machines and dishwashers from Cambuslang, near Glasgow, to the white-goods lines in Merthyr. The company is spending an estimated Pounds 4m a year on fuel to transport units to Wales. Mr Bill Foust, managing director of Hoover UK, would not comment on the plans, which are being discussed with unions. Hitachi has a television production plant at Aberdare, four miles from Hoover's plant in Merthyr. The moves are expected to add about 200 to 250 to Hoover's workforce in Merthyr. Some jobs will be lost in Cambuslang, but Hoover intends to continue production there of motors for upright vacuum cleaners. Hoover's Merthyr works - it once employed more than 5,000 but the workforce is down to fewer than 1,300 - has troubled successive owners. Performance at the factory has improved recently. Mr Foust said last month that productivity rose 44 per cent last year.</p>

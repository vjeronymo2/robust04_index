			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: ATHLETES ARE ON FRONT LINE IN DRUG FIGHT  </P> <P> If the United States of America were under attack from a terrible enemy that  was infiltrating the country through a half-dozen key ports and lining up our  youth and destroying them systematically, what do you think the national  response would be?  </P> <P> I'll tell you: The country would be on a total war footing, lights would be  burning late in Washington, bonds would be being sold, the Pentagon would be on  red alert and factories would be churning out defense weapons by the boatload.  Nobody would be counseling surrender.  </P> <P> Well, we are under siege. There is a terrible enemy at the gates. It has gained  an insidious foothold. It is a greater threat to our country than Communism  ever was. Hitler would never have gotten on our shores, but this invader  already is here.  </P> <P> The enemy is a coalition, a combination of deadly forces, and it's winning on  all fronts. It's an unholy alliance of cocaine, marijuana, codeine, heroin,  speed and, yes, alcohol. When last seen, it was marching up the coast of  Florida, it had New York and Los Angeles under siege, it appeared as  unstoppable as the Wehrmacht -- and a lot of people thought we should give up  and let it in, i.e., legalize it, naturalize it, as it were.  </P> <P> You can't fight this enemy with tanks and guns. Courts are ineffectual. You  can't stop to read the rights to a man about to kill you. You can't stop a  cartel with a warrant.  </P> <P> But we do have the weapon that could turn the tide -- education. This enemy  cannot function in the light. It strikes in the dark.  </P> <P> That's why a one-hour documentary on ABC Sunday at 4 p.m. PST, titled "Athletes  and Addiction -- It's Not a Game," is as important a counterattack in this war  as the Battle of the Bulge was in its.  </P> <P> The brainchild of a network producer, Geoff Mason, a sports specialist who  knows what he's talking about -- he once went through an entire Wimbledon  tournament in such an alcoholic blackout he doesn't remember a single lob, he  acknowledges. An alumnus of the Betty Ford Clinic in Palm Desert, Mason, who  barely escaped capture and imprisonment in this war, has decided to warn the  countryside.  </P> <P> Athletes are the most visible victims in this war. The public will pay  attention to their sad stories, where commercials showing frying eggs on a  griddle may miss the point. Says Jim McKay, the sportscaster who wrote and  narrates the addiction documentary: "They're role models whether they want to  be or not. What they do, a whole generation of kids copy."  </P> <P> McKay's documentary is a kaleidoscope of sports star addiction.  </P> <P> Derek Sanderson, once the highest-paid hockey player in the world, hits bottom  when he becomes a derelict in Central Park, trying to steal a bottle of wine  from another addict and, when being caught, demanding, "Don't you know who I  am?" and being told devastatingly, "Yeah, I know who you are -- a bum just like  me."  </P> <P> There's Tai Babilonia, pretty, gifted but terribly lonely and depressed,  turning to a glass of wine to help her sleep, then a bottle, then a case, then  a suicide attempt. These people pulled the rip cord just in time, but the show  addresses the John Matuszaks, too -- star athletes who crashed and died in free  fall. Or free base.  </P> <P> It also addresses the degree of difficulty in recovery. McKay says: "There's a  trap in which kids see apparently successful recoveries and say, 'Oh, I see how  this works. You do coke and then when they catch you, you go away for 28 days,  rehab, and then come back where you left off none the worse.' Well, it doesn't  work that way. The chances are you won't do as well. And the recovery rate is  not 100% -- more like 50%, some say as low as 10%."  </P> <P> McKay adds: "Athletes are treated as something special from childhood. They  think they are immune to the laws which govern ordinary people. And, to be  sure, they are encouraged to think so. We tell the story of the coach who finds  cocaine in the high school kid's locker but does nothing about it because the  kid's a star, and the coaches who call the rehab center and say, 'When can we  get Butch back? We need him!' You know, the ordinary addict is warned not to go  back to the same playgrounds, the same playmates or environment which got him  into trouble in the first place. But the athlete has to go right back to the  same locker room, the same stresses."  </P> <P> The documentary shows the plight of the young high school athlete who has been  at a treatment center for a year, after becoming an addict at 6 when his older  brothers talked him into smoking pot in the family cellar. In this war, they  bomb nurseries.  </P> <P> The war is far from won. It isn't even stalemated. The enemy is advancing on  all fronts.  </P> <P> The ABC documentary is at least an attempt to show our unarmed forces what the  foe looks like, what to look for -- like those sessions where they showed air  raid wardens the silhouettes of enemy fighters.  </P> <P> Any war effort requires first-rate intelligence. When you hear -- and see --  Chuck Muncie say, "In 1982, I scored 19 touchdowns, an NFL record; in 1989, I  went to prison for . . . cocaine," you get a better look at the enemy than any  chart could give. When Steve Howe says, "In 1981, I was on top of the world  with the world champion Dodgers; in 1983, I walked out on my wife, my newborn  daughter and my teammates for a line of cocaine," you know he's in division  strength.  </P> <P> You know you're in a desperate war when the casualties mount up. The Betty Ford  Center, where much of the documentary was filmed, has treated more than 15,000  addicts in its eight years. The success rate is high, but the wounded continue  to pile up nationwide.  </P> <P> This documentary is at least an attempt to put a lantern in the Old North  Church window, to turn Paul Revere loose. To delay any longer, this might be  the first war we ever lost in our sleep.  </P></p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Gulf states seek ways to counter western energy tax FOREIGN MINISTERS of Gulf Arab states started a second day of talks in Saudi Arabia yesterday to find ways of countering energy taxes proposed by the US and Europe, Reuter reports from Dubai. The two-day meeting in Riyadh is the last in a series of talks by Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) states, which control over half the world's proven oil reserves, to co-ordinate a unified position before talks with the European Community next month. Mr Mohammad Sahlawi, spokesman for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, was reported in the Saudi newspaper al-Riyadh as saying that Opec would continue to try to explain its opposition to the tax. The foreign ministers were also discussing the stalled Middle East peace process, the United Arab Emirates' dispute with Iran over three strategic Gulf islands, and Iraq's compliance with Gulf War-related UN resolutions. The GCC groups Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) heavyweights Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar with small independent producers Oman and Bahrain. The six states fear the tax would reverse a projected rise in oil demand and hit earnings. The proposed US tax would levy around Dollars 3.50 on each barrel of imported oil. Gulf exporters are worried it will spur the EC to go ahead with plans for a similar tax, which could add Dollars 10 over 10 years to the cost of a barrel of imported oil. Gulf oil ministers will take the proposals to a meeting in Oman in mid-April between Opec and other producers to map out a strategy to counter the tax.</p>

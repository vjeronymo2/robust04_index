			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: INFORM PARENTS ABOUT DIVORCE  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: After six years in a lousy marriage, my sister is finally  getting a divorce. Even though our parents didn't like her husband, she still  can't seem to find the courage to tell them. Yet she doesn't want to me to  break the news. This seems so childish to me. What's wrong with her? -- S.K.W.  </P> <P> DEAR S.K.W.: Telling parents about a divorce is often very difficult for adult  children, especially if they're still hanging on to close family ties. Your  sister is probably anticipating trouble when your parents may actually be  relieved. Often, parents are more aware of trouble than children know.  </P> <P> If your sister has children, your parents may be anxious about maintaining a  close relationship with the youngsters and they need to be reassured that there  will be no problem about this. Grandparents are always important in the lives  of youngsters but when there are marital difficulties, they become even more  important because they represent permanence and consistency in the child's  life.  </P> <P> Your sister shouldn't be afraid to let your parents know that she'll need their  emotional support. She shouldn't try to hide her feelings because it won't  work. Parents are much too adept at seeing through such disguises. If you have  any influence over your sister, encourage her to inform your parents -- and as  soon as possible.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My best girlfriend confessed to me that she'd heard  consistent rumors about her husband's infidelity. When this happened, she  invariably walked away from the person tossing out the hints. She says that she  doesn't want to know if he's cheating.  </P> <P> I find this almost impossible to understand. I'd be angry and hurt and would  raise hell if I knew my husband was involved with another woman. Am I crazy or  is my girlfriend? -- D.B.  </P> <P> DEAR D.B.: If this friend means what she says, she's either emotionally  involved with someone else herself or has such a low self-esteem that she  thinks she's lucky to get any man, no matter how badly he treats her. It's  possible, however, that she may be trying to protect herself from the truth  because she's not prepared to face it.  </P> <P> Once a woman accuses her spouse of infidelity, she has to be ready to decide on  a plan of action if he admits to an extramarital affair. Sometimes, women are  wise to delay any confrontation because the husband may lose interest. Some  women prefer to concentrate on trying to improve their relationship, hoping the  problem may disappear.  </P> <P> The ostrich approach to infidelity is dangerous, because if a woman waits too  long, her chances for improving her life in case there is a divorce tend to  diminish.  </P></p>

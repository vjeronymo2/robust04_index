			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ethane deal prompts ICI Australia to plan pipeline ICI Australia, a subsidiary of the UK-based group but traded separately on the Australian stock exchange, looks set to go ahead with a ADollars 250m to ADollars 300m (USDollars 184m-USDollars 221m) ethane pipeline connecting the South Australia gasfields to its Botany Bay petrochemical plant. The company has reached an outline ethane supply agreement with Santos, the Adelaide-based oil and gas group, for 10 years. The volume of ethane concentrate would be around 310,000 tonnes a year and, according to Santos, 'based on the current structure of prices in the oil futures market, the price formula agreed is economically equivalent to the current natural gas price with CPI indexation'. The deal also includes a possible extension for a further five years, on terms to be negotiated at that stage. The two companies aim to sign a formal contract within two months, and ICI hopes to set up similar arrangements with other producers in the Cooper Basin. ICI Australia said yesterday that it hoped to construct the 1300km pipeline between Moomba and Botany, which would come into operation in May 1996. The cost of the pipeline is put at more than ADollars 200m, and modifications to the Botany plant will take total project costs to more than ADollars 250m. The new pipeline will follow a similar route to the existing Moomba-Sydney pipeline, which is being sold by the federal government to AGL, the Australian utility, Canada's Nova and Petronas, the state-owned Malaysian oil company. Commonwealth Bank of Australia has sold its 50 per cent shareholding in stockbroking firm Burdett Buckeridge &amp; Young for an undisclosed sum, Reuter reports from Sydney. The purchasers were US institutional stockbroking firm Jefferies Group and Hong Kong-based joint venture investment bank Asian Capital Partners.</p>

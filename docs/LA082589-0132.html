About 5,980 homeless people were  served meals or allowed to sleep overnight at the armories, the report says.  </P> <P> County officials spent $4,614 on food and bedding at the shelters and nearly  $10,320 on security. The armories again will be used this winter on an  emergency basis to shelter homeless people.  </P></p>

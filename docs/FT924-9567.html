			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: US economy Now the election is over, attention is switching to the details of President-elect Clinton's economic policies. And as his package is prepared, the response of the Federal Reserve will be equally closely watched. Yesterday the Fed's 'beige book' report on the economy acknowledged that US growth was patchy, as the figures for third-quarter GNP suggested. But the Fed is likely to wait and see how much of a fiscal boost the president intends to give before considering another cut in rates, even if tomorrow's employment report shows the economy slowing once more. With short rates so low and inflation subdued, more investors may move from cash into longer-dated US Treasury paper in the weeks ahead, despite fears of a higher budget deficit.</p>

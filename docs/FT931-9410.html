			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Motoring: The Audi 80 Estate THE AUDI 80 Estate, newly-arrived in Britain, is at the other end of the scale from the big people-carriers. Audi has a hang-up about estate cars. So does BMW, which refuses to use the term for its five-door 3-Series and 5-Series Touring models, although that is what they are. The 80 Estate, Audi says, is designed to fit between a saloon and a 'traditionally functional' - for which read practical and boring - estate car. The 80 Estate is most enjoyable to drive with excellent handling, light controls and a feel of quality. A compact 4/5-seater, it comes with front or four-wheel drive. Engines range from a super-economical 1.9-litre, direct-injection turbo-diesel to a multi-valve, five-cylinder, turbo-charged 2.2-litre. My test 80TDI (Pounds 16,955) combined refinement with all the performance you could reasonably require and offered potential 50 mpg (5.65 l/100km) fuel economy. As for the Pounds 30,495, four-wheel driven S2 Estate above, think of it as the original Quattro turbo coupe reborn with smoother styling and bulk carrying capacity.</p>

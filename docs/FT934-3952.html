			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Channel tunnel evacuation procedures to be tested A large-scale evacuation involving 1,000 Channel tunnel employees, their spouses and children is to be carried out just before the tunnel opens for business next March. Mr Edward Ryder, UK head of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, said yesterday the plan was to test whether Channel tunnel trains could be evacuated rapidly in the case of a fire. The test will simulate the evacuation of a fully loaded train either through the central service tunnel or by train on the other main rail track. Car shuttles on the cross-Channel trains, once evacuated, are designed to contain a fire for 30 minutes, long enough for the train to reach the end of the tunnel, Mr Ryder said at the presentation of the authority's annual report. The main gas to be used to extinguish fires, halon 1301, is to be phased out from 1995 under an international agreement on greenhouse gases and a substitute will have to be found. Mr Ryder said Eurotunnel had enough stocks to last 10 years. Mr Ryder did not rule out the possibility that tests of more complex parts of tunnel equipment might lead to the opening being further delayed. But he added: 'We are confident that the design and concept of the project ought to be able to work safely. Once you are inside, you will be safer than you were on the journey to the tunnel.' Tests of the tunnel and its equipment will continue until the opening. Tests on the effectiveness of the ventilation system cannot be completed until trains are running. The risk of an earthquake damaging the tunnel has been assessed and it has been shown capable of withstanding shock waves equal to those of the worst earthquake to hit southern England, in 1580.

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Maghreb nations test EU's united front: No common mechanism for handling powder-keg to the south The spiral of violence in Algeria is forcing European governments to brace for the worst. Last week France said it was closing its schools and cultural centres there, after advising its 2,000 remaining expatriates to leave if possible. In Brussels, the European Commission is worried the military government of President Liamine Zeroual is losing control. The possibility of a fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front government in Algeria is no longer excluded, a prospect which could trigger instability across North Africa, from neighbouring Morocco to Egypt. 'There could be a domino effect,' said Mr Manuel Marin, senior Spanish commissioner who controls trade and development policy towards the region. Mr Zeroual warned the five-nation Arab Maghreb Union at the weekend they were all at threat from Islamic fundamentalism. The Algerian crisis provides a natural test for the European Union's fledgling common foreign and security policy. But member states are still wrangling over whether it should be funded from national budgets or the EU. Without agreement, there is no common mechanism or concept for dealing with the powder-keg to the south, a Brussels official says. Instead, Algeria looks like turning into a case-study of how the interests of EU nation states continue to take precedence over a common EU foreign policy. Five years ago, hopes were high that the European Commission could encourage the 12 member states to forge a new common policy toward the Maghreb, which embraces Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as well as Libya and Mauritania. The idea, spurred by an improbable Moroccan application to join the European Community in 1987, was to 'anchor' the Maghreb to the EC through free trade and closer political ties. The rough model was the EU's approach to former communist states of central and eastern Europe, without the promise of membership. The new Maghreb policy envisaged a shift from development aid to assisting small businesses in the hope of strengthening a nascent middle class, new balance of payments loans to smooth over debt repayments, and a Euro-Maghreb development bank modelled on the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Most striking was its focus on human rights and the progressive liberalisation of trade. The momentum behind the so-called EU-Maghreb partnership has since been lost. Some blame North African stubbornness in trade talks; others say the collapse of the Algerian economy in the past two years has exposed earlier hopes of closer relations as inflated. But the Europeans, including Mr Marin, are also under fire. North Africans say the EU's emphasis on human rights and democracy is hypocritical. In January 1992, when the Algerian army suspended a second round of elections which the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win, Europe's capitals were virtually silent. Mr Marin argues it is time to tilt EU foreign policy more toward the Mediterranean rather than continue with the current preoccupation with eastern Europe. Member states must look beyond immediate allies and clients to the common interest. 'Just as the future of the Baltic states cannot be a matter of interest only to Danes, Germans and British, so the fate of Algeria and Egypt cannot be of interest only to France, Spain and Italy,' he says. Mr Marin's task is made more more difficult because member states usually pursue short-term advantage, in the absence of firm guidance from the Commission. Last year Spain insisted on protecting its Andalusian fishermen before it would agree to a new fisheries pact with Morocco. Madrid then copied French strong-arm tactics in the Gatt talks, forcing its EU partners to agree to a time extension for a minimum entry price for tomatoes, cucumbers and oranges to the Canary Islands. The result was a blow to Moroccan exporters, hardly softened by Spain's claim it had to 'consolidate' the Canary Islands into the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Efforts are now under way to secure compensation for Morocco; but Spain's arguments in favour of extra EU money to support Morocco's balance of payments are opposed by budget-conscious Germany and the UK. Talks with Algeria are similarly vexed. The Commission remains unconvinced about the regime's reform-mindedness. It is insisting that Algeria sign a letter of intent with the IMF to allow rescheduling of its Dollars 26bn (Pounds 17.5bn) external debt and pave the way for much-needed economic restructuring. It also wants elections within two years. Behind the scenes, the EU front looks less united. France is pressing its EU partners to support a balance of payments loan of about Dollars 1bn to Algeria, to offset lower oil prices. But the UK is sceptical about a shot in the arm which could delay economic reform. In fact, the Commission proposed a similar Dollars 800m loan in autumn 1990 to support Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, then the reformist prime minister. But the French Treasury fought the idea. By the time President Francois Mitterrand presented his own Dollars 600m loan initiative in July 1991, Mr Hamrouche had been sacked. A golden opportunity was lost, senior Spanish and Italian diplomats involved said. Mr Marin still hopes he can wrap up partnership accords with Morocco and Tunisia by the end of the year. Algeria could follow at a later date, but only if the regime takes action to reform its banking sector, open up the public sector and trim subsidies, he says. Pressure for an early accord is high on both sides. In 1995 negotiations begin on the Maghreb's share of the Delors II budget package, one year before the EU's direct aid runs out. Assistance could rise well above the present Ecu1.1bn (Pounds 859m) five-year programme. Few doubt that the wily Mr Marin will squeeze out more money for his own budget. But Brussels officials concede the big challenge is to persuade people in the Maghreb that they share an interest in economic reform, open trade and closer relations with Europe, rather than Islamic fundamentalism. 'More must be done to stop the first domino falling,' says one Spanish official. Without such planning, the EU's dreams of a common foreign and security policy risk foundering just as they did when the Union was confronted, and failed to deal, with another crisis, in former Yugoslavia.</p>

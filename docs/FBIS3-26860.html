Exports in the first half of 1993 reached only $3.343  billion, an increase of 6.58 percent compared to 1992. In July  1993, Shanghai's exports decreased by 15.5 percent compared to  the same period in 1992. As of August 1993, the city's exports  not only failed to meet their quota but also became a  "bottleneck" and restrictive factor for Shanghai's economic  development. Under the leadership of the municipal party  committee and the government, with the support of various  fronts, and thanks to the hard work of cadres, workers, and  staff members of all foreign trade enterprises and individually  run export enterprises in the city, Shanghai's exports began to  jump in the third quarter and reached $7.382 billion at the end  of 1993, thus fulfilling the annual quota of $7.34 billion set  by the municipal people's congress and the government.    What does this fact show?    First, it shows that Shanghai cannot experience the great  development of foreign trade without emancipating the mind and  exploring new ideas. Despite experiencing a decline in foreign  trade in the first six months of last year, Shanghai began to  boost its foreign trade in the next six months. The important  reason for the increase is: Since the municipal meeting on  foreign economic relations and trade held in June 1993, cadres,  workers, and staff members of all foreign trade companies began  to reconsider their ideologies and ideas formed in the past.  They began to free themselves from the ideological shackles of  the planned economy and to foster a sense of the importance of  market competition, as well as of large-scale foreign trade,  trading ports, trading groups, and services. The city's silk  products import and export company and its garments import and  export company began to change the bureaucratic styles of  business often demonstrated in the past by improving their  services. As a result, they began to stand firmly in a severely  competitive environment. Last year, they became the first- and  second-largest exporting companies. In shattering the  restrictions on its scope of business, in 1993 the Lansheng  Company began to export machinery and electrical appliances for  the first time. The Machinery and Electrical Appliances Import  and Export Company took drastic measures to restructure its  organization by converting 16 departments into 10 constituent  companies which assume sole responsibility for profits and  losses. As a result, the company earned 13.15 percent more in  foreign exchange than in 1992.    The fact also proves that major reforms undertaken by  Shanghai in foreign economic relations and in trade, operating  mechanisms, and management methods are effective. At the  municipal meeting on foreign economic relations and trade held  in June 1993, Mayor Huang Ju said: It is necessary to take the  lead in establishing a new system for foreign economic relations  and trade that conforms to international practices, that  dovetails with international markets, and that is suited to a  socialist market economy. In following this requirement, the  city took the nationwide lead in introducing a series of reform  measures last year. Among them, the important ones are:  Mandatory plans for all kinds of foreign trade companies to  export, to earn foreign exchange, and turn it over to the state  were abandoned. A plan for reforming distribution methods was  introduced, thus enabling wages to increase in line with the net  increase of foreign exchange earnings. More enterprises in the  import and export sector were given decision-making powers. The  business scope of foreign trade enterprises was expanded. Such  large-scale reforms, the first in Shanghai's history of foreign  trade, have effectively helped the city. As a result, its  exports demonstrated a shift from a decrease to an increase.    The fact also proves that it is very important to establish  a  mechanism for building momentum inside the enterprise. A group  of enterprises in Shanghai had already paid attention to this  problem last year. The Shenda Textile and Garments Company  introduced a stimulation mechanism designed to promote exports  through wage increases and prizes. As a result, the company  took second place for individually run enterprises.    According to some experts, Shanghai still has to make great  efforts to maintain this year's favorable export momentum. Only  by fundamentally solving the deep-seated contradictions created  under the planned economy and the problem under which the  current system of foreign economic relations and trade is not  able to adapt itself to the changed situation can Shanghai  overcome two threatening problems in its foreign trade -- a lack  of mobility and a lack of sustained momentum.</p>

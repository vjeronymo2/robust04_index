			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAVILION PARTY RAISES TRAUMA CENTER FUNDS  </P> <P> Sunday Afternoon in the Shade  </P> <P> WestMed Gold Club, a support group for Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, was  host for a party at the Orange County Fairgrounds on Sunday in conjunction with  the Orange County Horse Show Assn.'s championship finals. About 250 VIPs  crowded two white tents ringside and watched local riders put their mounts  through their paces. Out there -- on the ground, in the riding ring, in the  free bleacher seats -- the sun shined blindingly bright. Benefit guests enjoyed  a shady view of events, as well as a lavish buffet lunch and pay-per-order  service bar. The party raised about $30,000, which will be used to buy  cardiology equipment for the hospital's trauma center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Four-Legged Attractions  </P> <P> The riders -- all of whom had won in previous OCHSA-sanctioned shows --  competed in hunter, high jump and relay classes. Among contestants in the  four-day show, which culminated with Sunday's benefit, was Karen Lucian, a  Newport Beach stockbroker and owner of a horse named "Capital Gains." Eyeing  the raffle table, Lucian cut a stylish figure in her shiny black boots, tan  riding breeches and Western hat with a three-foot turquoise feather tucked in  its band. Asked how she fared in the riding ring, Lucian smiled. Capital Gains  "won one championship and two reserve championships," she said. All by himself?  "Well, I was riding him," she added, laughing, "but you always say the horse  won." Causing a stir behind one of the tents were two miniature horses grazing  in a pen that would cramp some large dogs. While the tiny equines nibbled grass  and whisked flies with their little tails, a crowd of onlookers gathered.  Howard Larnard, president of WestMed Gold Club, lifted his granddaughter,  Kellie, so she could get a better view. Larnard, who lives with his wife, Ann,  in the horsy Nellie Gale community in Laguna Hills, admitted that he is a soft  touch for his granddaughter. Kellie, meanwhile, threw her arms around grandpa's  neck and said how much she'd like a horse of her own. "It's no fun riding  unless you have your own horse," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ringside  </P> <P> Marianne Boyd, a hospital support group member, was co-chairwoman for the  event, with Mike Braun, OCHSA president. Their committee included Robert  Boullon, Corinne Brewster, Ron Elliott, Devon McVey and Trudy Passo. Also  attending were Dr. Michael Callaghan, an orthopedic specialist at Western  Medical Center-Santa Ana, and his wife, Naomi; the hospital CEO David Morgan  and his wife, Kyoko, and Dr. John West, founder of the Orange County Trauma  Society.

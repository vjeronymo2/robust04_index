			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Premium brands lift Seagram SEAGRAM, one of the top four drinks groups, says its policy of concentrating on higher-margin premium brands is being reflected in higher profits. For the second quarter ended July 31 sales of spirits, wines and other beverages gained 2 per cent to USDollars 1.41bn, more than making up for the sale of several North American spirits brands in 1991. Operating income was Dollars 160m, against Dollars 120m. After including Dollars 72m in dividends from its 25 per cent interest in EI du Pont de Nemours (Dollars 69m a year earlier), and Dollars 33m equity in unremitted du Pont earnings, compared with Dollars 61m, Seagram's final net profit was Dollars 152m, or 41 cents a share, against Dollars 149m, or 23 cents, a year earlier. First-half final net profit was Dollars 319m, or 85 cents, down from Dollars 337m, or 89 cents, a year earlier, because of lower equity in du Pont's earnings. Sales were Dollars 2.65bn, against Dollars 2.78bn. In June, Seagram increased its 49 per cent interest in a Venezuelan distiller and a Venezuelan distributor to 100 per cent. This was in line with its policy of developing premium brands worldwide. Metall Mining, a fast-growing Canadian resource holding company controlled by Germany's Metallgesellschaft, earned CDollars 3.87m (USDollars 3.25m), or 8 cents a share, in the first half, against a loss of CDollars 2.5m, or 6 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 106m against CDollars 84.4m.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Labour's policy Labour's debate this week about its commitment to public ownership was irrelevant for British industry. Nationalising privatised companies would not be a priority for a Labour government. There are other means of controlling such groups. The conference rhetoric of Labour luminaries was primarily aimed at the utilities. In practice, the gas and water groups, burdened by infrastructure programmes and negative cash flow, are less at risk, but the regional electricity companies, weighed down with cash, swelling profits and bulging chairmen's wage packets, are in the firing-line. A windfall tax is a distinct possibility. The Recs' managements can see the risk of a populist administration raiding their balance sheets. The argument that they should do nothing, leaving shareholders to gauge the political risk, is inadequate. They would be better to use their cash to enhance shareholder value now, either through dividends or buying back shares more aggressively. A one-off special dividend has tax advantages, but involves political dangers. Buying back additional shares is a measure which politicians and tabloid headline writers have difficulty lambasting. If Labour is looking for unpopular companies to target for windfall taxes, it could well turn to the clearing banks, criticised last year for not fully passing on interest rate cuts. A windfall tax would scarcely damage their ability to do business. Such a measure could even be imposed before 1997. After all, the last government to impose such a tax on banks was led by Lady Thatcher.</p>

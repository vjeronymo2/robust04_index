			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse makes management changes MR Michael Jordan, the new chairman of Westinghouse Electric, has set in motion the first of an expected series of management changes at the company. The diversified group has been struggling to recover from an ill-advised foray into financial services during the 1980s. Mr Jordan, a former PepsiCo executive who was named Westinghouse chairman and chief executive just three months ago, said in an internal memorandum Mr Warren Hollinshead would leave his job as chief financial officer before mid-1995, when he was scheduled to take early retirement. Analysts expect Mr Jordan to select an outsider as the first member of a team charged with reversing the fortunes of the group, which has taken Dollars 5bn in charges in just three years. In January, Mr Jordan replaced Mr Paul Lego, who is believed to have left under pressure from institutional investors unhappy with his failure to stem losses related to real estate, junk bonds and leveraged buy-out investments. Over the past year, Westinghouse has attempted to reduce its massive debt burden by gradually withdrawing from financial services. As part of Mr Jordan's recovery plan, it agreed to sell its electronic distribution and control business for Dollars 1.1bn. However, Westinghouse's difficulties extend into its core operations as well. Earlier this month, it warned of a substantial downturn in third-quarter earnings due to a 'continued deterioration' of its environmental clean-up businesses as well as declines in electronic systems, power systems and broadcasting. Net income from continuing operations is expected to drop 50 per cent, against last year's comparable figure of Dollars 91m, or 22 a cents a share.</p>

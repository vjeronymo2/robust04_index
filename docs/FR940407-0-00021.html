			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Support for Utah's Proposed Amendment: Processing of Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters said they supported the proposed amendments and encouraged their approval as quickly as possible. The commenters further noted that approval of these definitions, which are identical to the Federal definitions, will remove any ambiguity recognized with respect to Utah's responsibilities to permit roads used primarily for coal mining purposes. In addition, the commenters stated that, according to OSM regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(7), approval of the proposed amendments was required by January 15, 1993, 30 days after the close of the comment period (December 16, 1992), and that in doing so, OSM must, as required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(10), apply the criteria set forth in 30 CFR 732.15 when determining whether to approve such amendment. Finally, the commenters said that because the proposed amendments are identical to the existing Federal regulations, there should be no question that the amendments should be approved within the mandatory 30-day time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM concurs with the commenter's interpretation regarding the above-cited Federal regulations. However, OSM also believes it necessary to provide clarification regarding the applicability of amendment processing procedures and the comment that approval of the proposed amendments was required by January 15, 1993, 30 days after the close of the comment period following publication of the proposed rule notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each State program amendment raises different legal and technical issues that require differing levels of analysis. Therefore, unless a proposed amendment is a verbatim copy of the comparable Federal regulation, it may require extensive review and analysis by Federal authorities in consultation with their State counterparts. The process involves review of widely varying amendments that must comport with Federal and State laws and court cases. Rather than simply disapprove a deficient proposal, OSM attempts to work with the State to bring the proposal up to a level where it is comparable to and no less effective than the Federal regulations. This process can be time consuming. Thus, the potential for delays in the process is a constant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to Utah's September 17, 1992, proposed amendment, OSM identified deficiencies regarding Utah's definitions of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road.'' Accordingly, OSM notified Utah of the deficiencies by an issue letter dated January 21, 1993. The issue letter provided Utah with an opportunity to correct the specified deficiencies. Utah responded to the issue letter in a revised amendment dated March 24, 1993. OSM then announced receipt of the revised proposed amendment in the April 8, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 18187), and, in the same notice, reopened and extended the public comment period for 15 days. The extended comment period closed on April 23, 1993. Therefore, according to OSM regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(7), approval or disapproval of Utah's proposed amendment was required by May 24, 1993, the first work day 30 days after the close of the extended comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

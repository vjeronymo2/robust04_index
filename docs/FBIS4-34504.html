Francisco Javier Najera coordinated the confiscation. He  explained the incidents occurred at km 180 of Highway 57,  Mexico-Piedras Negras, on the stretch between Matehuala and El  Retorno, when a pickup truck with Texas license plate No.  JO-1862 was being driven over the speed limit by Mexican citizen  Honorio Saucedo Moreno, 29, without its tail lights on, and for  that reason he was stopped.    The authorities seized 13,200 rounds of ammunition for 9-mm  weapons and varies amounts of ammunition for 223 [not further  specified], 30-30 carbines, .44 revolvers, .38 specials, .38  supers, .37 supers, as well as for 7.62's, 30-mm, and 25- and  22- caliber carbines.    In preliminary statements made to Hector Manuel Enriquez  Marquez, an Attorney General's Office official in Matehuala  Municipality, Saucedo said he was hired in Houston, Texas, to  transport the shipment to Tejupilco, Mexico State.</p>

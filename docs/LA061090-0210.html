			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE HOUSE: ROLLER PARTS AVAILABLE FOR SLIDING GLASS DOORS  </P> <P> QUESTION: Last year, my sliding glass door stopped sliding! The repairman said  the roller was broken and he could not locate the company or an interchangeable  part. He said the whole thing might have to be replaced.  </P> <P> It seems that a few months ago you mentioned the name and telephone number of a  company that has thousands of replacement parts (this one is American, I  think).  </P> <P> Will you please tell me once again how I might be able to make contact with  this company so that I can replace my broken roller? The repairman lost the  broken roller so I don't have something to have a part made from. Before you  know it, it will be hot again, and I need to have that door working!  </P> <P> ANSWER: Ah yes, the case of the sliding glass door that won't slide. A familiar  tale to those of us that deal with crime around the house. That is to say that  it's a crime that your door isn't operating properly. Fear not, you have come  to the right place. We'll surely get you and your sliding door on the right  track!  </P> <P> What do you want first: the good news or the bad news? The good news is that  The Blaine Window Company of Hagerstown, Md., boasts an inventory of more than  20,000 replacement parts for almost any aluminum frame window or sliding glass  door. And, if you send them $2, they'll send you a copy of their catalogue. Not  a bad thing to have if you have a home that is surrounded by windows and doors  with aluminum frames.  </P> <P> The bad news is that the folks at Blaine have a minimum order amount of $25,  which means the inexpensive do-it-yourself roller-repair project that you  originally estimated at about $5 (labor and material) just got blown out of the  water.  </P> <P> Still, it's significantly less than the cost associated with the full removal  and replacement of the existing door. (We call this our "glass-is-half-full"  philosophy).  </P> <P> We suggest that you first attempt to find a replacement roller at your local  hardware store or home improvement center. You'd be surprised at the broad  inventory of repair or replacement parts that many of these stores have on  hand.  </P> <P> Finally, most sliding glass doors that we are familiar with have more than one  roller. So, just because your repairman lost one of the rollers doesn't mean  that you don't have something to take into the store to use as a comparison.  Simply remove the remaining roller.  </P> <P> A final note: You may find that your sliding door is hard to operate without  rollers so hurry back from the hardware store.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insulation Helps to Silence Dishwasher  </P> <P> Q: I'm shopping for a new dishwasher and want a recommendation on which one I  can rely on for the most quiet operation.  </P> <P> A: According to Consumer Reports, Kitchen Aid and Whirlpool top the list for  quiet operation, but we don't recommend that you stop there. Add extra  insulation as part of the installation of your new work saver.  </P> <P> You'll need a can of 3M spray adhesive, and a small roll of 1-inch spun glass  insulation (your local heat and air-conditioning contractor will be your best  bet in locating the small amount of materials that you'll need). Follow the  instructions on the can of adhesive carefully to achieve a lasting bond. Apply  as many layers of insulation to the machine as possible, and yet still allow it  to fit into the cabinet opening.  </P> <P> An additional layer applied to the inside surfaces of the cavity in the  cabinetry where the dishwasher fits into is also recommended. Consumer Reports  Books publishes a handy reference called Guide to Appliances, which may help  you to get your money's worth when purchasing most appliances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ceramic Tile Sealer Maintains Floor Shine  </P> <P> Q: I'm writing you to ask if you could tell me what I can use on my ceramic  tile kitchen floor to keep it bright and shiny looking. I have used vinegar and  water, ammonia, and Spic &amp; Span. It keeps the floor clean but not shiny.  Any suggestions?  </P> <P> A: You have 50% of the project down pat -- that's the cleaning. The second half  and equally important phase is the sealing of the fresh and clean surface. This  is where many of our "weekend warriors" make a mistake. Many of them believe  that the grout is the only portion of the tile installation that needs to be  sealed. On the contrary, you should seal the entire surface, grout and tile. In  addition to protecting your grout from staining, it will lend itself to a  long-lasting finish that will enhance the beauty of the ceramic tile.  </P> <P> We recommend that you make a trip to your local hardware store or home  improvement center and pick up a container of ceramic tile sealer. There are  many of these products on the market under a variety of labels. To get the most  for your money we suggest that you purchase a sealer that contains acrylic and  silicone resins.  </P> <P> This is a super Saturday morning project that is guaranteed to be well worth  the investment!  </P> <P> </P> <P> Check Panes for Label on Tempered Glass  </P> <P> Q: We have a sliding glass door in the family room of our 20-year-old home. Our  first child will be walking soon, and we are concerned about the type of glass  in the door. Is there any way to tell if we have the type that breaks "safely"  or is it better just to replace the glass?  </P> <P> A: According to the Uniform Building Code, glass contained in doors like yours,  shower enclosures and windows that come within 18 inches of the floor, is  required to be tempered. That means that in the event the glass is broken, it  will break into a million small pieces rather than large jagged chunks that  have the potential of doing tremendous physical harm.  </P> <P> Furthermore, if the glass is tempered, a small tempering identification mark  that reads "tempered glass" will appear in one of the corners. These labels  tend to be rather inconspicuous, so you may need to do a little looking. If you  don't see the tempering mark and you're not certain that the glass is tempered,  we recommend that you replace the glass with tempered. We believe that an ounce  of prevention is truly worth a pound of cure -- this is especially true in this  case.  </P> <P> The Careys are syndicated columnists and general contractors in the San  Francisco Bay area.

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: Expats on a shoestring - The British School in Rome has had to come out from behind its elegant facade and justify itself. William Packer argues the case Alone of the British Schools abroad, The British School in Rome is concerned with study far beyond the usual range of classical antiquity and archaeology. Almost from the start scholarships in painting, engraving, sculpture and architecture were established at the school to match those in archaeology. But if fine art has always been integral to the school, it has also seemed a thing apart. While archaeologists, historians, classicists and distinguished visiting academics of all kinds came and went, the artists simply got on with art. There was no actual harm in that, yet here was a college that offered limitless opportunity for inter-disciplinary curiosity. Under the present director, Richard Hodges, all that has changed. His term has coincided with a period of financial uncertainty and so the number of scholars has been reduced, and the Sargant Fellowship (established for a senior artist - split three ways this year) and a number of smaller awards set up to bring maturer artists to the school for shorter periods. But Dr Hodges' strictures have applied not just to fine art, but to the whole school. What before might have been assumed had now to be sought out, earned, paid for. The British School has had to come out from behind its elegantly defensive Lutyens facade above the Valle Giulia and enter actively into the cultural life of Rome itself. What is more, Dr Hodges realised that while books and libraries and excavations are all very well, it was the visual arts that were, well, visible. Some three years ago, a programme of exhibitions and related talks was instituted, modest enough in itself, for the school's gallery is small, but of quite disproportionate effect. It has brought to a steadily increasing and now loyal Roman audience the work of nearly a dozen British artists so far. All enjoy a certain reputation in Britain, but not in Rome. Several have since been shown by Roman galleries. It has to be said that hitherto the range of artists has been fairly narrow, with almost all of them a sometime winner or on the short-list for the Turner Prize. Of this year's runners, Willie Doherty is showing in the school at the moment, (until December 20) and both Antony Gormley and Shirazeh Houshiary have shown there. The balance has been very much with the sculptural, the minimal and the conceptual. That narrowness is at least admitted and we shall see to what extent corrected. The argument is only against an apparent exclusivity, for a list that has already included Howard Hodgkin, Antony Gormley, Hamish Fulton, Richard Deacon and David Tremlett, with Rachel Whiteread, Lisa Milroy and Bridget Riley to come, is strong enough. The British Council in Rome has seen here an opportunity for itself, and now supports works closely with the school, seeing it as a useful showcase for what otherwise would not have been exhibited. New circumstances and mutual opportunities have been exploited. The exhibition programme is run on a shoestring, with some Pounds 9,000 put up by the school itself and a further Pounds 16,000 coming from other sources, including the Henry Moore Foundation and the British Council. An annual budget of Pounds 25,000 is very small in terms of potential sponsorship, but then so is the funding of the British School itself: Pounds 80,000 would secure all the activities of the school, from archaeology to art, year on year. A capital sum of Pounds 2.5m would set up the School completely for 50 years. Here is an institution, characteristically British in its informality, yet of world class in its scholarship, its reputation in archaeology second to none, and now ever more prominent and active in its engagement with the visual arts. Yet here it is, still insecure in its finances and fabric, and undermined at a distance by academic prejudice and indifference. If that is also very British, we should be ashamed of ourselves. But the outlook is promising, if only because the school itself is so special, and so good in what it does. An historian, Wallace Hadrill, takes over as director next year, the first non-archaeologist in the appointment. He is fortunate in his predecessor, first for the opportunity that Dr Hodges has created and then for the impetus he has already generated in its exploitation. In wishing him well, we are also telling him not to stop.</p>

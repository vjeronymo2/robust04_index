			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Woodrow active Construction group Taylor Woodrow was the day's most actively traded stock, with the group instigating a big buy-back programme aimed at mopping up 10 per cent of its equity. Turnover of 58m shares suggested that by the close nearly 70 per cent of the repurchase target had been achieved. The move pushed the shares 5 higher to 124p. Analysts saw potential follow ups by other building companies as unlikely. With limited borrowings and a big property portfolio - net rentals account for some two-thirds of group operating profits - Taylow Woodrow is seen as unique within the sector. Worries over political instability in the wake of the government's House of Commons defeat on the VAT on fuel Bill hit utilities. One suggestion was that the chancellor may instead opt for a special tax on the proceeds of the impending sale of the National grid, which is owned by the 12 generators. East Midlands fell 23 to 715p, Eastern surrendered 20 to 767p, National Power lost 17 1/2 at 484 1/2p in trade of 5.9m and PowerGen shed 25 1/2 to 512 1/2p. South Wales was one of a handful of stocks in the sector that managed to resist the market trend after the excellent interim figures. The shares put on 9 at 780p. Bid speculation continued to boost Northern, which moved 4 higher to 863p. Water stocks also came under pressure on worries that the government may reconsider a windfall tax on high dividend payments as an alternative source of revenue. Market watchers also pointed out that the latest increase in interest rates would render the sector less attractive to yield buyers. North West tumbled 23 to 500p. Brewing and leisure group Bass forged ahead 15 to 519p, the day's sharpest rise among Footsie constituents, after full-year figures well ahead of expectations. Profits increased by nearly 9 per cent to Pounds 552m, against a range of forecasts between Pounds 534m and Pounds 548m. The 21.1p dividend was also better than anticipated. Brokers upgraded current year forecasts - Kleinwort Benson added Pounds 13m to its original estimate, lifting to Pounds 600m for the current year, and by Pounds 14m to Pounds 669m for 1996. Turnover in the shares rose to 3.2m, twice the daily average. Barclays finished a penny lower at 599p after Hoare Govett reduced its 1994 profits forecast to Pounds 1.95bn from Pounds 2.05bn. The house said the cut reflected redemption of US loan capital, and slightly lower than expected turnover at the bank's BZW division. Dealers said Cazenove, one of the bank's brokers, had also changed its figures. BT was the most active Footsie stock, with 12m shares changing hands, following the publication of Oftel's consultative paper on telecoms regulation. The stock rose 6 to 376p, with Oftel's thinking seen as slightly more generous to BT than expected. The document confirmed stock market hopes for sizeable cost savings at Cable and Wireless, with its Mercury unit likely to face a lower contribution to BT's so-called access deficit. C&amp;W gained 3 at 371p, but Vodafone, perceived as a marginal beneficiary from telecoms changes, dipped 2 to 192p in 6.1m turnover. The latest rise in interest rates added further pressure to an already weakened retail sector. Retailing stocks have fallen sharply in recent sessions on nervousness about Christmas trading, and analysts said the interest rate rise could only add to the gloom in the sector. Kingfisher declined 7 to 434p and Dixons shed 3 1/2 to 184p. MFI lost a penny at 129p. Boots gave up 4 to 481p. Goldman Sachs, which turned negative on the sector at the beginning of the week, yesterday issued a note suggesting the shares were overvalued by 5 per cent. Exploration and production groups Enterprise and Lasmo receded 5 to 376p and a penny to 143p respectively as SGST reiterated its cautious view of the stocks following a meeting with its energy consultant. The oils team came away with its gloomy outlook for oil prices confirmed. Oil major BP suffered from US selling and fell 3 1/2 to 407p. Carlton Communications jumped 16 to 868p after the shares responded to enthusiasm over the company's full-year figures. The 50 per cent boost in profits to Pounds 190m was accompanied by what one specialist des-cribed as 'a quantum shift to openness'. Mirror Group Newspapers slipped 3 to 133p and Telegraph receded 5 to 345p on concern that the government might introduce VAT on newspapers following its defeat over increasing the tax on fuel. Media conglomerate Pearson improved 3 to 586p as the market began to focus on prospects for BSkyB, in which Pearson has a significant stake. Analysts expect that the shares will be priced initially at above 250p when conditional trading begins today, giving a capitalisation of around Pounds 4.3bn. The possibility that De La Rue, the bank note printer, would make an agreed bid of around 900p a share for Portals, the security and specialist paper maker, saw Portals leap 45 to 816p. Nevertheless, analysts argued that even around the 900p level a bid would not be dilutive and De La Rue shares recovered 4 to 967p. Car parts group Avon Rubber tumbled 26 to 494p following weak full-year profits. Other statistics, Page 49</p>

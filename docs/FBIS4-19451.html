			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Do We Need  Vigilante Groups, Mr. Kanther?"]    [Text] [BILD] Minister, did you get back the car radio  that was stolen from you?    [Kanther] No, the thieves have not been identified yet.    [BILD] The crime situation is deteriorating in Germany -- do  you still walk around without fear?    [Kanther] I feel safe. Yet, I do understand the concern of  many citizens in view of the rising crime rate. It is the  responsibility of the state to free citizens of this subjective  threat. This is why I have initiated the anticrime law.    [BILD] What do you think of the idea of citizens taking care  of their protection themselves?    [Kanther] Nothing. We do not need vigilante groups with  armbands and wielding sticks. This does not create security.  Another question is the increased use of volunteer police  assistants. Qualified private security enterprises can also do  good service, for example in the protection of buildings.    [BILD] What sort of work might the volunteer assistants be  asked to do?    [Kanther] Pensioners could be called back from retirement to  help do clerical work. I can even imagine volunteer officers  driving patrol cars. This would release more officers for real  police tasks.    [BILD] Why are you called the "black sheriff?"    [Kanther] Honestly, I do not care what people call me.  However, if this label is intended to mean that I am a firm  supporter of law and order, then I have nothing against it.</p>

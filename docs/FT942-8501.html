			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Thatcher refuses to meet dam inquiry Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, has refused to appear before a Commons committee investigating whether sales of defence equipment to the Malaysian government were linked to an offer of aid to build the Pergau dam. Lady Thatcher, who approved the aid offer in 1988, told the foreign affairs committee last night she did not feel able to break the convention 'that prime ministers and former prime ministers do not give evidence to select committees on specific issues'. Her decision came as a surprise to MPs - there were indications earlier this week that the former prime minister was considering making an appearance before the inquiry. Mr Denis Canavan, a Labour member of the committee, said yesterday the former prime minister had 'chickened out'.</p>

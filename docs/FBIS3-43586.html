			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 6 Jan (AFP) -- The Congolese Government  has adopted a social and economic recovery program which  provides for 20 to 35 percent reduction in salaries of the  country's 80,000 civil servants, a parliamentary source said  here today. This reduction, which is aimed at bringing down the  annual wage bill from 134 to 84 billion CFA francs, will not  affect low income earners and will be negotiated by the  government and civil service unions, the same source added.    The government will encourage early voluntary retirement and  the redeployment of part of the civil service force, through  "backup measures" that will be implemented with the help of the  French Development Agency [CFD], the World Bank, and the  European Union. The plan provides for about 15 billion CFA  francs savings through the reduction of public expenditure,  notably in the sectors of water consumption, electricity, and  telephone; the reduction of diplomatic staff; and the adoption  of a new system of teaching scholarship awards.    The government hopes to improve fiscal and customs revenue  so  as to limit the share of oil revenue which accounts for 70  percent of budget resources. According to official estimates,  the package of measures are expected to bring in "additional 27  billion CFA francs" each year. The plan also provides for the  "restructuring of the status and the mode of management" of  major public and semi-public enterprises.    The state company in charge of the marketing of hydrocarbons  -- Hydro-Congo -- will lose its distribution monopoly and the  Transcongo Communication Agency will be broken up into three  autonomous units. Regarding the debt which hit the figure of  1.600 billion CFA in 1993, the plan provides for a "300 billion  CFA francs bridge-credit," over ten years, with two years grace  period and an interest rate not exceeding 5 percent. This  credit will be used to make an early payment of the 135 billion  CFA secured debt and to clear 50 billion CFA francs multilateral  arrears, of which 35 billion CFA are owed to the CFD.    The rest of the credit will be put into a Reserve,  Stabilization, and Economic Diversification Fund. The granting  of this credit presupposes prior agreement with the IMF. This  will enable the country's debt to benefit from a special  treatment from the Paris and London clubs.</p>

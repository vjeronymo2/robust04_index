Meanwhile, Major General Muhammad 'Abdallah Uwaydah,  chairman  of the TNA's security and defense committee, stressed that the  Sudanese people want to be the vanguard of the defenders of the  Muslim people in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina against the  hideous massacres they are being subjected to by the aggressive  Serbian forces.

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / US presses China to end trade rows MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, is putting pressure on China to resolve a list of trade disputes by mid-August, well ahead of an October 10 deadline set last year. Mr Michael Moskow, deputy US trade representative, said yesterday that Mrs Hills had given the Chinese government a list of trade issues she wants resolved during talks in Beijing starting on August 17. Otherwise she will publish a list of potential sanctions and begin public hearings. President George Bush, who has been portrayed as being soft on China, could gain politically should the US retaliate in October or win substantial concessions from Beijing. It is usual to begin any retaliatory process once a deadline has passed. However, Mr Moskow said a similar threat produced an agreement with Beijing on intellectual property rights earlier this year. He said the two sides had narrowed their differences but that 'a substantial gap' remained. Beijing has agreed not to enforce unpublished trade regulations against foreign importers and to prepare a comprehensive list of restrictions, bans and quotas. It will also eliminate its import substitution policies 'over time'. But it has not agreed to end import licencing or bans on specific US products.</p>

Shim'on Peres has openly announced his  conviction that these talks are useless.    Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin has stressed the  need  to initiate collateral negotiations and to hold a referendum on  the Golan. He has urged Syria to convince the Israelis of its  desire for peace. An observer following Middle East events will  find nothing surprising in Rabin's call. It is an Israeli habit  to falsify facts and distort events.    Anyone who listens to Rabin will come away with the  impression that Syria is the aggressor and that Israel is a  patient and peaceful lamb subject to repeated attack.  Naturally, Rabin ignores the fact of Israel's attacks on Arab  countries after 1948, and the fact that the Golan is Syrian  territory occupied by Israel in 1967 after the UN Security  Council's cease-fire resolution. Rabin ignores the woes,  disasters, and catastrophes that befell the Palestinian people  at the hands of Israeli forces and as a result of expansionist  settlement schemes. Rabin ignores the incessant Israeli attacks  on Lebanon.    Everything has been distorted. The sinful executioner has  been converted into a victim, while the victim is presented with  demands to prove its peaceful intentions.    Experience unquestionably demonstrates that secret  negotiations are just an Israeli technique designed for  blackmail. It has always been a futile policy. The Palestinian  side, which held secret collateral negotiations with the  Israelis in Oslo, has gathered only bitter fruit and  disappointment. This side was dragged into positions that are  outside international legitimacy and its resolutions; the  outcome is an agreement that gives Israel a free hand in all  basic Palestinian affairs, while it gives trifles to the the  Palestinians.    Despite lengthy and complex negotiations in several  international capitals and cities in order to interpret this  agreement, the results are even worse than many people expected.  Israeli officials did not hide their satisfaction with the  substantive concessions they have obtained from the  Palestinians. Some Israeli officials even expressed sadness  over the state of affairs on the Palestinian side. Naturally,  this would not have happened if the Palestinian side was  committed to the constants of the meetings held in Damascus,  Beirut, and Amman, and if it had not stopped the coordination  with the Arab brethren.    Now that the Israeli rulers have gained a lot from the  Palestinian side's violation of the Arab consensus, these rulers  want to play the same game with other Arab parties. They are  urging them to hold secret negotiations on the pretext that it  will speed up the peace process.    The Washington talks are the most appropriate framework for  promoting the peace process -- if Israel really wants peace and  looks forward to a just and comprehensive solution to the  vehement conflict in the region. Israel, however, has no  intention of withdrawing from occupied Arab territories or of  ending the policy of continued settlement building. Israel has  mired the Washington talks in futile arguments and problems,  avoiding the substance of the peace process.    In more than two years, no Arab side has received any answer  to the question of whether or not Israel intends to implement  Security Council resolutions and withdraw from occupied Arab  territories. Instead of translating the land-for-peace principle  into a tangible reality, Israel has raised dozens of security  problems in order to conceal its expansionist ambitions. Today,  Israel demands that the talks be shunted off their track and  away from their framework, as it has done with the Palestinian  side, and that secret negotiations be held at higher levels.  This is intended to ignore the Security Council resolutions  that structure the peace process, dragging the Arab sides into  positions where they will lose the cover of international  legitimacy.    The following questions should be posed to the Israeli  rulers: Why should secret talks bear fruit? Why can't the  Washington talks reach a breakthrough, since we know these talks  are held away from media clamor? Why does Israel refuse to  announce at the Washington talks what it can announce in secret  talks? Or, is it indeed a matter of fostering delusions among  Arab parties --delusions which, in the secret talks, will turn  into time bombs?    Peace cannot be established in vestibules and cellars. It  can only be established by serious and objective negotiations  under the banner of international legitimacy.    If Israel is really serious about achieving peace, the  Washington talks are the most appropriate framework, especially  because they are held under U.S. and Russian sponsorship, close  to the United Nations. These talks will definitely bear fruit  and achieve remarkable progress if Israel commits itself to  withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon.    Instead of casting doubts and creating confusion, it would  be  better for the Israeli rulers to comply with the principles of  the Madrid conference. By so doing, these rulers will see that  peace is at hand.</p>

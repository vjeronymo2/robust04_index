			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A very tough act to follow - The challenges facing the new Sainsbury chief RARELY CAN a chairman have taken over a company with such a successful recent trading record as that of J Sainsbury. But rarely will a chairman have to run so fast just to match, let alone exceed, the achievements of his predecessors. Such is the privileged and challenging inheritance of Mr David Sainsbury, who at noon on Monday succeeded his cousin, Lord Sainsbury, as chairman of the UK's biggest grocery chain. David Sainsbury certainly started well enough. Just two days into the job he was able to announce a solid 19 per cent improvement in interim pre-tax profits. And, at a competently-handled press conference, he went out of his way to stress that there would be few noticeable changes in the direction of the company. 'It has been a very smooth transition,' he said. But to the company's followers, the personality and style of the new chairman offer a fascinating contrast with that of his domineering predecessor, who successfully guided the company for the previous 23 years taking its annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 628m in that time. Quiet where his cousin was assertive, and reflective where his cousin was impulsive, David Sainsbury brings a very different feel to the top of the UK grocery chain. But Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite, suggests the contrast will be no bad thing. 'Both men, it seems, are carriers of a gene that makes them world class grocers but the two personalities could scarcely be more different,' he commented in a recent circular. 'David will be out to prove that his consultative, philosophical style will be as good for the next phase of Sainsbury's growth as John's slightly less benevolent dictatorship was for the group's formative years as a public company.' A neat composed figure who wears sensible glasses and button-down shirts, the 52-year-old Mr Sainsbury likes to stress the continuity and teamwork at the top of the company. When the two cousins worked together they complemented each other well. While Lord Sainsbury was the consummate grocer with a deep interest in the running of the stores and the products they sold (he will continue to help select Sainsbury's wines), David concentrated more on the financial and analytical issues of the business - much as his father had done before him when he was chairman and Lord Sainsbury was his deputy. Lord Sainsbury was certainly a hard taskmaster, ready to tear employees off a strip for shoddy store displays, but David is likely to adopt a more consensual approach - much to the relief of some of his colleagues. However, the sense of complementarity at the top will be maintained as Mr Tom Vyner, who has been steeped in the company's products as a former buying director, has filled Mr Sainsbury's old post as deputy chairman. Nevertheless, Mr Sainsbury emphasises that while there will be no revolution at Sainsbury there will continue to be a rapid evolution. 'Food retailing is a very dynamic and a very competitive business. It is a market of changing fortunes. We are leaders now and it is absolutely my intention to have a bigger lead when I cease to be chairman. But we will only do so by changing our business. I am certain we will be a very different business in 10 years' time from what we are today,' he says. Mr Sainsbury sees growth opportunities in the UK for some time to come, saying there are still 150 sites from which the company would like to trade  -it has only recently opened its first store in Scotland, for example. 'We have always had a fairly steady rate of increase,' he says. 'We have increased space by about 8 per cent a year over the past 20 years and that is something we want to continue to do. 'But if we felt that we were not finding the opportunities to do that in this country then we have already established a foothold in America with Shaw's and may look to expand there.' After an education at Cambridge and Columbia University in New York, Mr Sainsbury joined the family company in 1963 holding a succession of posts, most notably as finance director between 1973 and 1990. His most prominent involvement in public life came from his enthusiastic backing of the now-defunct Social Democratic Party. But he has retained a strong interest in issues of social policy. 'We have got a tradition in Sainsbury's that we do not get involved in politics at a corporate level. We have always had quite different political views in the family. But there are still some issues I feel very strongly about such as training and education, which are very closely related to our company's business philosophy,' he says. It is a view he intends to champion as chairman of the London Business School, if not as chairman of Sainsbury. 'We give the bottom 40 per cent of children a very poor education and I think there is now a lot of evidence to suggest that this has a major impact on productivity,' he says, citing the research conducted by Sig Prais at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Mr Sainsbury will certainly be one of the more cerebral additions to the ranks of UK company chairmen. And after living in the shadows of more famous members of his family, Mr Sainsbury will now stand out more clearly in his own right. It somehow seems appro- priate that the company's staff has now stopped referring to him as Mr David - to dis- tinguish him from all the other family members. From now on he is the Mr Sainsbury.</p>

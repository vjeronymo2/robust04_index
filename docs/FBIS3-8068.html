The experts are to visit the airport, which Bosnian Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said Tuesday in Moscow they had agreed to reopen after  almost two year's closure. Under the agreement, Russian  observers are to guarantee the airport is not used to bring  military supplies into the northeastern city.    The Russian delegation held talks at UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) headquarters after their arrival in the Croatian  capital, an UNPROFOR spokesman said. The delegation includes  officials from the Russian Ministry for Emergencies and is  headed by Sergey Kudinov [name as received], the spokesman added.    UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Thursday [3 March]  however that the Moscow agreement was not enough since it had  not been approved by the Moslem-led Bosnian Government. Akashi  said the UN wanted all parties to agree before the airport was  opened, but that the UN was determined to open it "even without  an agreement, if necessary."</p>

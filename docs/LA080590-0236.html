			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENSE THINKING ON AREA'S GROWTH  </P> <P> In "A Maturing L.A. Grows Up and In" (July 29), Greg Krikorian quotes Dan  Garcia, former Los Angeles city planning commissioner: "Whether we like it or  not . . . infill development provides opportunities to build the city without  continuing our urban sprawl."  </P> <P> That's the kind of density-increasing, pro-development tripe that's  contributing to destruction of the quality of life throughout Southern  California.  </P> <P> Density, not urban sprawl, is the major threat to many fine neighborhoods where  crime, traffic congestion, overcrowded schools, parks and public facilities,  and urban blight are driving people out of their homes.  </P> <P> There's nothing inevitable about loading up our neighborhoods with massive  condos and apartment buildings where California bungalows and duplexes once  stood. All it takes to stop all the "make a quick buck development" is some  politicians and neighborhood leaders with the backbone to say no to increased  density.  </P> <P> In my North Long Beach council district, we've been down zoning for eight  years. We flatly reject the view that we have some vague responsibility to  house the multitudes at the expense of existing neighborhoods. We don't have  to, and we're not going to, no matter what the urban planners say.  </P> <P> My position is that it's preferable to let the next few million new Southern  Californians reside in Antelope Valley, Riverside or San Bernardino counties  than it is to impact existing neighborhoods with a lot of overbuilding.  </P> <P> WARREN HARWOOD  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P> <P>  Harwood is a Long Beach city councilman.  </P></p>

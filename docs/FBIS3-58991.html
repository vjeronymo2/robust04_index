			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Paul Guilbert commentary: "The Shadow of the Presidential </F> Election"]    [Text] After Chirac, Juppe: The rejection by the  president and then the secretary general of the RPR [Rally for  the Republic] of the idea of heading the majority's list in the  European elections, goes beyond reasons of personal comfort in  both cases. "It is not the course I planned," the Chirac said.  "I cannot see myself in that role," the Juppe said. If we add  to this Edouard Balladur's variations on the theme, we quickly  understand that the plan to attach no more than a European value  to the June 1994 election, dissociating it from the presidential  election, was pure otherworldliness, and that instead the  calculations of strategy for the presidential election  determined the motives for refusal or uncertainty by the various  people.    It is not the essential issue which is under debate:  Everybody knows that the single RPR-UDF [Union for French  Democracy] list is not only possible, but technically agreed,  that the formal conditions laid down by Valery Giscard d'Estaing  are scarcely in dispute, that there is a return to the  commonsense thinking shown initially by the prime minister: How  could people tasked with implementing the same policy in March  1993 put themselves forward on different lists one year later?  Therefore the resolution to draw up a joint program, which  could be drafted "in 15 minutes at the corner of a table," to  cite Balladur, is merely a pretense: It enables, in the  meantime, the clarification of what individuals symbolize, which  is particularly important for what comes later.  <H5>  The Pros and Cons </H5>   Why did Chirac, "approached" by his comrades, say no? What  is interesting in his sudden reply is less the expected decision  than his speed in ending the scenario. He could have allowed  the pressure to mount, and maintain the suspense about his  intentions. It is easy to imagine the debate between the pros  and cons. Pro: The opportunity to return to the front of the  stage, to end a tiresome wait, to bring his image into line with  a heroic tradition of Gaullism, which brings him the  unconditional support of the members.    And also the opportunity to be seen as a unifying figure in  the majority. Con: Becoming bogged down in bargaining among  the parties and also the risk of failing in his demonstration of  unity. It is important to remember that, of all the right-wing  leaders, Jacques Chirac is the only one to have formulated a  philosophical condemnation, and not just an empirical rejection,  of Le Pen's policy. In a one-round election without  responsibility, there would be a loss of votes from that side.    By prematurely ruling out the hypothesis of his candidacy as  head of the European list, Chirac simply wants to show that he  is a candidate for a different position, in other words the  presidency of the republic, in keeping with a logic predating  the parliamentary elections, the one which led him to turn down  the leadership of the government, which went by agreement to  Edouard Balladur. On the candidate's part, this is consistent  with availability and distance with which to draw up a plan for  a seven-year term of office. Although disputed or jeopardized  since by the prime minister's omnipotence, it has the merit of  continuity.    Mr. Juppe's refusal is more to do with the present  situation.  The suggestion and then rejection of his name by Mr. Balladur  leads him naturally not to hurry into a role in which he would  be seen as a puppet. His success in the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign  Ministry], his intellectual grasp of problems, his skill as a  negotiator who attaches importance to a degree of Gaullist  rigidity, although seen as a handicap initially, now constitutes  one of his best investments in the future and makes him a more  and more essential figure in political life. In short, Mr.  Juppe is no longer negotiable.  <H5>  The Myth of Delegation </H5>   Does the prime minister's change of attitude toward his  foreign minister as regards the European elections take account  of these facts? Can a man who is bound to be regarded as a  candidate for the presidency of the republic afford to entrust a  man like Mr. Juppe with the formidable springboard of heading  the European campaign? Especially in view of the fact that the  RPR secretary general, Jacques Chirac's favorite candidate,  would then embody the myth of delegation, the lieutenantship of  Gaullist legitimacy, which, as Mr. Balladur is in the best  position to know, can be put to good use.    Amid the obstacles to be overcome and the influences to be  sought within the political world with a view to the  presidential election, it is clear that the candidate Chirac and  the candidate Balladur will not be subject to the same  necessities. Where the RPR leader will have to give assurances  to the UDF -- the reverse of Valery Giscard d'Estaing appointing  a member of the UDR [Union of Democrats for the Republic] as  prime minister in 1974 -- the prime minister, already a UDF  herald, will have to win over the new barons of the Gaullist  family. Did not the hasty statements of [Social Affairs  Minister] Simone Veil and especially [Defense Minister] Francois  Leotard in favor of Balladur standing as candidate have the  effect of countering, by anticipation, the inevitable RPR  obstacles in the prime minister's path?  <H5>  The Big Issue </H5>   The big issue, currently the realm of the opinion polls,  will, when it comes to taking action, be played out in the  strange inner circle of these men who, in keeping with their  custom, tear each other apart but hunt in packs. Will the pack  maintain its unity? Hence the importance of [Interior Minister]  Pasqua, who has not had his say. Of Mr. Seguin [National  Assembly president], who is also capable of showing his wrath.  And of Mr. Juppe, who is in control of his destiny.    Chirac or Balladur? Whatever happens, there will always be a  Gaullist to say: The other would have done better.</p>

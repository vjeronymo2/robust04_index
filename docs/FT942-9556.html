			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Sexual harassment - or simply fascism at work? The Financial Times has reviewed documents which confirm the salient points of this personal account of events in a local authority social services department. Names have been changed to protect the accused. A young shop steward called Helena, is proposing that a supervisor, Colin Maynard, be boycotted by union members. He has been seen on the corridor where he worked until the management agreed to a union demand that he should be banished to another building. I ask: 'What do you mean by boycott?' Another steward replies: 'Have no dealings with him. Make it clear to him that his behaviour is unacceptable to the membership.' Helena asks: 'Is there a seconder?' A hand goes up. Maynard was in charge of a team of female administrative staff, several of whom were unhappy with the way he managed. They took the matter to a women-only subgroup of the union. Following their complaints, and investigation by the organisation's equal opportunities officer, a charge of sexual harassment was brought against Maynard.                      *     *     * He was then removed from the office where his team worked. A union bulletin written by the women's convenor explained the disciplinary action that was being taken under the sexual harassment procedure. It stated that Maynard: Was pedantic about work and would often send a document back to be re-done because it contained one error, a misspelling or a wording he did not like; Picked on certain staff and asked them to re-do items of work; Laughed about staff's errors, criticised their work in front of others, criticised staff in their absence, and had reduced some to tears; Acted insensitively over funeral arrangements and other personal matters and made it unnecessarily difficult for a female shop steward and a woman to attend union meetings; Consistently worried staff over small arithmetical errors on their time sheets; Kept secret records of staff sick leave; Constantly observed staff time-keeping; Interrupted people to correct them while on the telephone; Openly disapproved of staff taking maternity leave; Gave no praise to the women in his team. Perhaps Maynard was a very unpleasant supervisor. But consider the wording of this complaint: keeping 'secret sickness records' sounds mean-spirited and obsessional; but it is only another way of saying that Maynard kept confidential sickness records. That was part of his job. That he 'gave no praise to the women in his team' and 'made life difficult for a female shop steward' implies discrimination; but there were only women in the team. However, the suggestion of sexual discrimination primes the context for the one item of alleged behaviour that has a potential link with gender: that Maynard 'openly disapproved of staff taking maternity leave'. Yet if he was guilty of this, it is not what he was accused of. Whatever Maynard's faults as a manager, the one thing absent from these allegations is sexual harassment. The union's bulletin acknowledges that the sexual harassment charge had 'problems', but said the union agreed to participate to 'ensure that the manager was never in a position to harass women in the way he had been doing for seven years.' At the time, I tried to obtain the union's formal definition of sexual harassment without success. However, the popularly understood meaning of the term is: repeated, unwelcome sexual overtures. And Maynard, a middle-aged married man, had to explain to his wife that he was being disciplined for sexual harassment. Meanwhile, Maynard was deposited in a corner of the divisional director's small office, working on a box-like affair about the size of a schoolboy's desk. When I saw him there, I asked him how he was. He began to cry. Privately, a lot of people, both in the union and out of it, sympathised with Maynard. Several female colleagues told me they abhorred the proceedings against him. But they mostly remained silent. One said she could not dissent publicly because she would then have to resign from the women's committee. I looked for a reason not to involve myself but found myself drawn in. I asked that Maynard's situation should be brought to a meeting open of the full shop membership, since only the women's section had been consulted so far. The union representative was sympathetic, but was worried about the reaction from the women's section. I sympathised. About a year previously I had been deemed by its convenor, Deborah Kirby, to have raised something inappropriately at a meeting where she had been calling for a strike. She shouted at me with a combination of righteous fury and hints of tears. I was paralysed. So, apparently, was everyone else. To his credit, the rep came back to tell me that the Maynard issue would be discussed at a full shop meeting in three weeks. However the meeting was cancelled three times. Then Maynard disappeared and interest in the issue waned. So, four months on, 40 people are discussing the fact that Maynard's small, balding form has been seen in a corridor near his old section. Helena asks that all those in favour of boycotting Maynard raise their hands. There has been no debate, apart from my question. I say: 'Hang on - can we discuss this before we vote?' Helena says impatiently: 'This whole situation was discussed months ago. There's no point wasting everybody's time going over the same old ground.' Several people murmur agreement. 'OK,' she repeats, 'all those in favour . . .' A lot of hands go up. I interrupt again: I splutter that this is a human being you are all voting to do something to - someone who has already had to go through being accused of something he did not do. This is greeted by a chorus of jeers and sighs. But quite a few people are saying nothing. This includes at least one person who has said in private that she abhors what is going on. I am stung with anger: 'Whatever else Colin Maynard did, he doesn't seem to have sexually harassed anybody - has he? All I'm saying is that we should discuss what he's actually done, and . . . ' I was interrupted by Deborah Kirby, the women's convenor: 'Paul, don't you think you're being rather ingenuous here. The original complaint was made months ago. If you had a problem with it, the women who made the complaint are just down the corridor from you. 'Why did you not just go and discuss it with them? We're not prepared to let the women of that team be put through even more distress just to satisfy you.' So the boycott is agreed with only one vote against - mine. After the meeting, I arranged to meet the union's district officer. But when he discovered I was only a rank and file member, he said: 'I'm sorry, I didn't realise. I can't talk to you.' Four of us then wrote expressing our disquiet to the union. None of us received a reply.                      *     *     * So what happened to Colin Maynard? I believe he carried on working where he was put - a middle-aged man with a blot on his record is not well-placed to seek alternative employment. The process described above will be recognisable to anyone with even the sparsest knowledge of the history of injustice. The ingredients were classic: a backdrop of popular dogma, a scapegoat depicted as a monster, group conformity, the formidable leader who over-simplifies, and finally the bureaucrat who will take the power but leave the moral responsibility. It is called fascism.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cautious Tories set date for by-election test THE government yesterday set the Christchurch by-election for July 29, a date calculated to minimise the political shockwaves if it loses the once-impregnable Tory stronghold to the Liberal Democrats. The by-election, caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley, provides another unwelcome test of Mr John Major's battered authority. The campaign in the sleepy Dorset seaside town is expected to be dominated by the government's handling of the economy, its tax and spending plans and by the widespread slump in confidence in Mr Major's premiership. By scheduling the poll for two days after the expected summer parliamentary recess the prime minister hopes to avoid an immediate backlash from the Tory back benches if the seat is lost. He also wants to maximise the pressure on potential Tory rebels in a crucial Commons vote on the Maastricht treaty on July 26, just before the start of the summer break. But a defeat would still reawaken doubts about Mr Major's leadership and increase the risk of a grassroots backlash at the autumn party conference. An opinion poll this week shows that the prime minister's popularity rating has now slumped to a mere 14 per cent, the lowest since modern polling began. Mr Robert Hayward, the Conservative candidate, starts the campaign defending a general election majority of 23,000 over Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat. In normal circumstances the 20 per cent swing required to overturn that majority would be judged well out of reach. But in their crushing victory in the Newbury by-election, the Liberal Democrats achieved a swing of over 28 per cent, suggesting that a victory in Chistchurch is possible if not inevitable. Mrs Maddock's campaign is expected to focus on fears among the large retired population in the constituency that it is likely to be among the main losers from the government's fundamental review of the welfare state. She is likely to seize on Mr John Major's warning in Tokyo yesterday that demographic changes meant public spending on pensions had to be limited. Mrs Maddock is also expected to exploit discontent about the imposition in the Budget of VAT on domestic fuel and over the government's plans for railway privatisation. Tory hopes rest with the possibility that Mr Hayward, who lost his Bristol seat at the last election, can persuade enough disgruntled Tory supporters that economic recovery is now firmly entrenched. Mr Hayward, who is also highlighting law-and-order issues, yesterday accused the Liberal Democrats of 'smears' about government spending plans. Mr Nigel Lickley will fight the seat for Labour, but the party has enjoyed little traditional support in the constituency and its vote is likely to be squeezed further by the Liberal Democrat challenge. General election 1992 result: Robert Adley (C) 36,627; the Rev Dennis Bussey (Lib Dem) 13,612; Alan Lloyd (Lab) 6,997; James Barratt (Natural Law Party) 243; Adrian Wareham (Chauvinist Raving Alliance) 175. Turnout 80.7 per cent.</p>

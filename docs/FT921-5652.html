			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Drug stocks rise again on individual buying CONTINUED STRENGTH in drug-related stocks, on the back of buying by individual investors, pushed the Nikkei average up yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed up 149.01 at 21,487.82. After falling to the day's low of 21,342.62 immediately after the opening, the index reached the day's high of 21,550.86 during the morning session on arbitrage-related buying. Volume edged up to 200m shares from 180m. Advances led declines by 564 to 370 with 182 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.58 to 1,561.07 and in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.45 to 1,192.76. The drug sector was the largest gainer of the day, rising 4.04 per cent, followed by mining and food. The market focused on Aids-related issues, which traders dubbed as 'dream stocks', unaffected by the slowing economy and sluggish company earnings. 'It is the first thematic activity of this year, and indicates that investors have started to take a cautious interest,' said Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities. Reports that the major securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi  -were going to support the market by setting up investment trusts for institutional investors failed to boost the market. A business daily reported that companies, which cannot hold their own shares, would be able to buy their own stock through the funds. However, the brokerages later denied such plans. The market is waiting for Friday's publication of the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment. Market participants had hoped that publication would coincide with a cut in the discount rate. But recent pressure by leading politicians to ease monetary policy is likely to have caused the Bank of Japan, which is keen to protect its independence, to dig in its heels. Kaken Pharmaceutical was the most active issue of the day, rising Y10 to Y1,490. Mochida Pharmaceutical gained by its daily limit of Y450 to Y3,770. The issue did not trade until the final 20 minutes due to the lack of sellers. By contrast, the air transportation sector was the largest loser, falling 2.3 per cent. Japan Airlines fell Y24 to Y852 on last Friday's projections of a pre-tax loss for the current year. All Nippon Airways fell Y40 to Y1,180. Nichiboshin, a non-bank financial institution, fell Y47 to Y485 on concerns about its bad loans to real estate companies. Electronics issues fell on light foreign selling. Hitachi lost Y5 to Y835 and Sony retreated Y10 to Y4,070. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 193.49 to 23,149.06 in volume of 53.7m shares. The index rose above 23,000 for the first time in 12 trading days as investors sought drug-related issues. Roundup THE RISE in Toyko helped lift part of the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG ended off the day's highs as profit-taking and news of a rights issue eroded initial gains. The Hang Seng index added more than 50 points shortly after the opening but closed up 23.13 at 4,952.19. Turnover eased to HKDollars 3.02bn from HKDollars 4.06bn. Jardine International Motor Holdings fell 45 cents at HKDollars 5.70 after news that it hoped to raise Dollars 56.3m through a one-for-four rights issue. SEOUL staged a technical rebound in response to last week's loss. The composite index, which hit a high of 626.73 before profit-taking emerged, ended 8.15 higher at 620.65 on a turnover of Won292.9bn after Won194.3bn on Saturday. SINGAPORE fell as investors took stock of Friday's budget in which the government forecast slower earnings growth this year. The Straits Times Industrial index closed down 16.93 or 1.14 per cent at 1,460.50 in volume of 48.5m shares. KUALA LUMPUR closed broadly lower in cautious trading. The composite index fell 3.13 to 601.93. BANGKOK's SET index closed down 3.75 at 779.10 in turnover of Bt7.36bn. Bangkok Bank shed Bt56 to Bt632 on profit-taking while Bangkok Land gained Bt10 to Bt216. JAKARTA eased 0.56 to 280.43 in volume of 4.2m shares against 5.65m. Inco, the nickel producer, fell Rp50 to Rp3,550. TAIWAN's weighted index gained 1.95 to 5,144.37 in turnover of TDollars 39bn against TDollars 37bn. Investors remained cautious ahead of constitutional reforms due to be implemented soon. MANILA was further depressed by a fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone in New York on Friday. The composite index ended down 11.84 at 1,171.83. AUSTRALIA rose in quiet trading and the All Ordinaries index closed up 11.3 at 1,625.4 in turnover of ADollars 169m. Coles Myer gained 18 cents to ADollars 11.66 while News Corp put on 26 cents to ADollars 17.40. BHP rose two cents to ADollars 13.64. NEW ZEALAND was lead higher by active overseas interest in Telecom which rose 8 cents to NZDollars 2.54. The NZSE-40 index gained 7.52 to 1,500.73. BOMBAY's BSE index soared a record 315.57 or 10.5 per cent to a new high of 3,333.25, boosted by Saturday's budget. The budget scrapped wealth tax on share investments, allowed foreign pension funds to buy stocks directly, cut import and excise duties and made the rupee partially convertible. The exchange authorities also lifted a ban on forward dealings in shares, imposed in January to curb excess speculation. This allowed freer market operation, brokers said.</p>

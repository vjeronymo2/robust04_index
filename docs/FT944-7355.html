			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Bank of Zaire's chief dismissed Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko has dismissed the head of the Bank of Zaire, ending a four-month battle of wills between the central bank governor and Mr Kengo Wa Dondo, prime minister, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. Zairean state radio yesterday said that Mr Mobutu had signed a decree on Tuesday dismissing Mr Ndiang Kaboul, his own appointee. Mr Ndiang has been fighting to save his job since Mr Kengo's government suspended him in July, accusing him of fuelling hyperinflation by flooding the market with millions of new zaire notes. A parliamentary committee earlier voted for Mr Ndiang's dismissal after an audit found he had made huge unauthorised payments in defiance of a government freeze on central bank transactions. Economists regard establishing the autonomy of the Bank of Zaire, which in the past has been tapped for funds by Mr Mobutu and his army generals whenever they ran short of cash, as the key to rescuing Zaire's wrecked economy. The appointment of the centrist Mr Kengo in June broke a long political stalemate between supporters and opponents of Mr Mobuto. He quickly made the independence of the bank a central policy objective and, during a tour of western capitals last month, he was repeatedly told that investors would not put money into Zaire unless he could guarantee the bank's independence.</p>

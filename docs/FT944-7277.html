			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Easy access to Internet The surge of interest in the Internet has prompted manufacturers to launch equipment designed to give novices easier access. Compaq, which believes it is the first large computer company to launch an Internet-ready PC, will supply all its Presario computers with Easynet software, which provides Internet access, from December 1. Prices range from Pounds 1,399 to Pounds 1,799. Carrera Technology, a UK company, has already launched a range of Internet-ready PCs. A modem, Easynet software and a year's subscription to the Internet adds an additional Pounds 349 to the cost of the computer. Compaq: UK, tel 081 332 3000; fax 081 332 3440.

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Land Securities Land Securities' latest fund-raising exercise resembles an old granny withdrawing a little money from the bank to see if she can find a bargain in the sales. The company's characteristic caution ensured it did not borrow more than Pounds 140m in one lump. A rights issue may have seemed the most obvious route but equity finance would have been rather dear. By issuing a convertible bond, Land will be able to use money costing 7 per cent to buy properties yielding 9 per cent. Even if it cannot find suitable properties immediately, it will not hurt much to hold the money on deposit. When the UK's biggest property company gears up to expand, it may well be a bullish sign for the market as a whole. But Land has raised such dribbles of money several times before. This latest move only pushes gearing up seven percentage points to 66 per cent. Land's prudence has been appreciated in recession and its rewards shone through again yesterday as it was strong enough to lift the dividend by 5 per cent. But without greater aggression as the recovery takes hold, its appeal will wane. Indeed, the process may already have begun. Land's shares have risen 55 per cent since sterling's devaluation. That, though, represents an underperformance of about 10 per cent against the sector.</p>

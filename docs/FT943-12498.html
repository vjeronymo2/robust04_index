			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / A look at life from both sides: FT writers on the trend for Europe's top financial staff to switch between public and private sectors Mr Gert Haller, the swashbuckling 50-year-old state secretary at Germany's finance ministry, has been made an offer he could not refuse. Mr Haller, who acts as deputy to Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, in international monetary affairs, is leaving to join Wustenrot, the privately owned German building society and banking group. Mr Haller's departure, to take effect in January, will mark the second important switch at the ministry within 18 months. His predecessor, Mr Horst Kohler, who held the post since 1990, departed last summer, also aged 50, to become head of the German savings banks association. The job changes in Bonn illustrate how, across Europe, frontiers are becoming more fluid between senior financial positions inside and out of government. International financial deregulation, fast growth of capital markets and sophistication of banking groups like Wustenrot are increasing career opportunities beyond the public sector. Since Mr Kohler took over at the German savings association last August, two other middle-ranking civil servants have joined him. 'They find the work more interesting, of course,' one Bonn official says. 'Financially it has to make sense, but we are not talking about a 300 or 400 per cent pay rise. What seems to be most important is that the pensions are properly sorted out.' Germany is not the only country where higher private-sector salaries and more free-wheeling lifestyles exert a strong attraction when budgetary pressures are squeezing civil servants' pay. In the Netherlands, where there is more traditional interplay between public and private-sector financial jobs than in Germany, board members at Dutch banks can earn up to five times the annual wage of Fl 200,000 (Pounds 73,500) oftop civil servants at the finance ministry. And Sir Peter Middleton, permanent secretary at the UK Treasury between 1983 and 1991, is thought to have increased his salary of Pounds 96,210 between threefold and fivefold since becoming chairman of BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays Bank. Departures of European financial civil servants to senior positions in banks do not represent a new trend. But officials now seem willing to take up private-sector jobs at an earlier stage in their careers. This may presage a shift to greater flexibility in employment between the government and business sectors, similar to the 'revolving door' in the US where senior Washington functionaries traditionally rotate between government and non-government posts. Mr Haller's departure from the Bonn finance ministry marks a welcome break from the general picture of 'regrettable impermeability' between the public and private sectors in Germany, according to Mr Fritz von Gadow, an executive at the Dusseldorf office of Spencer, Stuart, the international personnel consultants. He says Germany has too little US-type flexibility. 'It's unfortunate that real life isn't represented in the ministries.' As for suggestions that Mr Haller would have been better advised by going to a higher-profile bank, Mr von Gadow says Wustenrot is a respectable address. 'They have their own bank and are in every sense a big financial services group.' Until now in Europe, regular switches between finance ministries and banks have been mostly confined to countries like France, with a tradition of state ownership in banking. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of now-privatised Societe Generale, Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman of similarly privatised Banque Nationale de Paris, and Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, former chairman of Paribas and Credit Lyonnais, all held senior jobs in the French finance ministry. After several years of privatisation of banks and industrial companies in France, there are now signs that relationships between the public and private sectors are becoming much less cosy. Last week the Paris government announced it is phasing out the practice under which civil servants are allowed to retain indefinitely their ranking while working in the private sector. In countries without large state-owned banks, moves between the helm of public and private sectors have been far less automatic than in France - but they now seem to be less exceptional. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank between l980 and 1991, resigned at 61 to join the Cologne-based Sal Oppenheim banking group - the first Bundesbank chief not to go immediately into retirement on departure. Mr Pohl's resignation was partly caused by divergences with the government over policies on German unification, but it also reflected his desire to increase his salary. Another example of a sideways move comes from Portugal. Mr Manuel Pinho, 39, currently director-general of the Portuguese Treasury, will leave this summer and is expected to take up a job at a so far undisclosed private bank. After working for the US bank Manufacturers Hanover, as well as Credit Lyonnais, Mr Pinho moved to the Portuguese finance ministry to carry out a radical restructuring of Portugal's borrowing programme during the past two years. His spell in government will certainly stand him in considerable stead. 'When I ring someone in government I know they are going to take the call because they know who I am,' says one Portuguese executive who spent a spell as the head of a civil service department before moving into private banking. Another man with experience of life in both public and private sectors is Sir Douglas Wass, now 71, permanent secretary to the UK Treasury between 1974 and 1983. He holds three non-executive chairmanships - Equity &amp; Law Life Assurance, Nomura International and the NCM credit insurance group - and is on the board of three international trade and insurance groups. Sir Douglas warns that officials who move relatively early from public to private-sector jobs have a greater chance of success. 'The culture in government is one of risk aversion and propriety of decision taking. In the private sector it is risk orientated . . . My own feeling is that a successful transfer after the age of 40 or 50 is rare. One becomes too engrained to become a successful entrepreneur.' Experience in the Netherlands underlines this argument. Mr Cees Maas, 47, formerly treasurer-general (the top civil servant) at the finance ministry, left in July 1992 to join the board of Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING Group), the big Dutch financial services company. Mr Maas's predecessor, Mr Pieter Korteweg, who departed in 1986, aged 44, has since headed Robeco, the Rotterdam-based group of international investment funds. Mr Dick Meys, now 51, was director-general for the budget, another senior job at the ministry, until the late 1970s. He is now a board member at ABN Amro, the Netherlands' biggest bank. The present treasurer-general at the Dutch finance ministry, Mr Henk Brouwer, is himself 48. He came to the job after a long spell in the civil service followed by two years working for Philips, the big electronics group. If the trend towards an American-style 'revolving door' picks up momentum in Europe, Mr Brouwer's job path may mark the shape of careers to come.</p>

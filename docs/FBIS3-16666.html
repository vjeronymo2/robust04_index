The above poll was conducted by the REZONANSI Sociological  Service in Tbilisi on 20-21 February. There were 500  respondents.    It is the view of 36.7 percent of Tbilisians that the  republic's leaders are using their positions to organize their  own personal lives.    It has to be said that the view expressed by this 61 percent  of the capital's residents cannot be far from the truth as,  otherwise, it turns out that Georgia is being led by people who  are mentally retarded. If we take into account the superfluous  number of leaders, it is impossible for so many people to have  ended up in one place by chance, unless, of course, they were  specially gathered. One can undoubtedly point out the criminal  action or lack of action of the leader and the heads of  Parliament and government as a result of which they are  condemning a large part of the population to starvation. In a  country where almost all products are sold at world prices, the  minimum wage amounts to 17 American cents.    It also has to be said that, given the excessive size of the  apparatus of state officials and their visibly small salaries,  the republic's leaders are intentionally pushing them toward  corruption. Corruption instituted from the top -- in the police,  the Procurator's Office and judicial bodies, and also in  structures of local administration -- is having and will have  particularly serious consequences.    It is suspected that the damage being done to the republic  was premeditated, as was the fact that, following ratification  of Georgia's membership of the CIS, there was an amazing change  overnight in the provision of electric power, water, and  transport to the population. Regarding the supply of electric  power, prior to ratification of the CIS statutes, the situation  prevailing in Georgia was more catastrophic than that in Armenia  in the winter of 1992-93, which, for Armenia, had been the worst  winter since the outbreak of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh. At  that time, Georgia was the only source of electric power for  Armenia and, in spite of this, the population was being supplied  with electric power regularly and according to schedule and the  subway was functioning normally.    Moreover, prior to ratification of the CIS statutes, the  following situation prevailed in Rustavi [important industrial  city south-east of Tbilisi]: A large part of the town had been  completely without any electricity and water for three weeks.  The population (as in Varketili) [suburb of Tbilisi] had closed  the road that needed to be cleaned by the authorities (if we are  to believe the rumors being circulated, the city's mayor  Areshidze was telling them that they had wanted democracy and  this was it).    Following ratification of the CIS statutes, the supply of  both electric power and water was restored.</p>

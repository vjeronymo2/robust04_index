			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: American Barrick's golden opportunity - Takeover of Lac Minerals would create biggest gold producer outside South Africa When American Barrick's senior managers signed up for Spanish lessons two years ago, they had no idea what would be coming their way in the summer of 1994. The Toronto-based gold producer was planning to expand in Latin America, and the managers used their new linguistic skills to buy advanced exploration properties, and to tie up joint ventures with small resource companies. Barrick has put down roots in this way in Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Venezuela and Chile. These ventures are dwarfed, however, by the assets Barrick will acquire thanks to its apparent victory in the seven-week takeover battle for Lac Minerals, another Canadian gold producer. Lac's crown jewel is its 83 per cent interest in the El Indio mine and adjacent deposits in northern Chile, whose ambitious expansion plans could make it one of the world's premier gold mining areas. Mr Peter Munk, Barrick's chairman, claimed victory on Wednesday after Lac's directors agreed to a sweetened offer consisting of cash and Barrick shares worth an estimated CDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.6bn). Lac isn't quite in Mr Munk's bag yet. Its shares are widely dispersed, with many in the hands of unpredictable arbitrageurs. A rival bid by Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver is, on paper, worth more than the Barrick offer. Barrick's shares are widely considered, however, to be more attractive and more liquid than those of the much smaller Royal Oak. Rumours also persist that another contender may still emerge. Echo Bay Mines, a gold producer based in Denver, Colorado, is most often mentioned. Mr Jim Pitblado, Lac's chairman, acknowledges that his board will have to withdraw its support from Barrick if a better offer materialises. Barrick's bid could falter if only a third of the shares are withheld when its offer expires on September 6. In that event, Barrick would probably extend its bid in the hope that more shares would trickle in. But Mr Munk is sufficiently confident of eventual success that he appeared with Mr Pitblado on Wednesday to spell out his vision of the combined company's future. Less than a decade ago, Barrick was a struggling resources company, unable even to retain the services of some of Canada's leading securities firms. It has grown into one of North America's biggest and most profitable gold producers, due mainly to its canny acquisition in 1987 of the Goldstrike mine in Nevada, and a prescient policy of hedging its production against falls in the bullion price. Goldstrike's output has jumped from 40,000 ozs in 1987 to an estimated 1.7m ozs this year, or about 90 per cent of Barrick's total production. But development work at Goldstrike is now largely complete. That leaves a team of skilled mining engineers looking for new challenges, and Barrick looking for an outlet for the USDollars 1m in cash flowing in from Goldstrike each day. 'American Barrick built its business in North America,' Mr Munk says. 'It doesn't have a large inventory of offshore properties where it can focus on future growth.' In addition to its growing interest in Latin America, Barrick has expanded its presence in east Asia. It has an exploration office in Beijing and earlier this summer opened another in Jakarta. It has also been sniffing around west Africa. The addition of Lac - assuming investors tender their shares - will boost Barrick's annual gold output from an estimated 1.9m ozs this year to about 3m ozs, making it the biggest producer outside South Africa. If Lac's present expansion plans come to fruition, the combined total would rise to more than 3.5m ozs by 1997. However, Barrick has indicated that it will probably sell Lac's Canadian mines. Although they generate sizeable cash flows, these properties have little growth potential. These sales, as well as Royal Oak's obvious interest in acquisitions, could substantially redraw the North American gold mining industry in coming months. El Indio is another story. In an effort to impress shareholders, Lac last month raised its estimate of proven, probable and 'possible' reserves at El Indio and the nearby Nevada property from 3.6m to 9.7m ozs. It has already given the go-ahead for a USDollars 168m mine at Nevada. A bigger expansion is on the cards if the new reserve figures are verified. The rationale behind the takeover battle for Lac, which was initiated by Royal Oak on July 7, was that the Toronto company has in the past failed to make the best of its opportunities. While Barrick's share price has multiplied almost seven times in the past five years, Lac's has remained flat. Lac responded to the criticism by dumping its chief executive, Mr Peter Allen, and stepping up its expansion plans. Barrick is likely to continue the house-cleaning. It noted in its offer document that 'there will be significant opportunities for corporate and operational synergies and economies as the two businesses are brought together'. One question mark is the future of Mr Peter Steen, brought in as Lac's new chief executive less than a month ago from Homestake Mining of San Francisco. It is difficult to visualise the no-nonsense Mr Steen working with Mr Bob Smith, Barrick's earthy president. One Lac insider who will be happy to see the end of the saga is Mr Pitblado. Formerly head of RBC Dominion Securities, Canada's biggest securities firm, Mr Pitblado was a non-executive Lac director until he was catapulted into the chairman's seat by Mr Allen's departure. Mr Pitblado says he wants to get back to his cottage on Stoney Lake, north-east of Toronto, to resume his interrupted summer holiday.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading gold producing companies: Output (tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                      Country of   Output   Output                                domicile     1992     1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Anglo American                 S Africa      275      283 GFSA                           S Africa      123      122 Gencor                         S Africa       75       70 Homestake                            US       57       57 Placer Dome                      Canada       61       57 JCI                            S Africa       51       54 Newmont                              US       49       53 American Barrick                 Canada       41       51 RTZ                                  UK       39       43 Anglovaal                      S Africa       40       42 Rand Mines                     S Africa       44       42 Lac Minerals                     Canada       34       34 Echo Bay                         Canada       24       27 Western Mining                Australia       26       25 Newcrest                      Australia       24       23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

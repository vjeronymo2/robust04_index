			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FROZEN EMBRYO CUSTODY TRIAL STARTS  </P> <P> The trial in an unprecedented custody battle over seven frozen embryos opened  today with lawyers debating whether the mother has the right to bear the  "test-tube babies" against the father's wishes.  </P> <P> Mary Sue Davis, 28, contends that the embryos created through in vitro  fertilization are "pre-born children" and she wants the right to have them  implanted in her womb. Her estranged husband, Junior Davis, 30, argues that use  of the fertilized eggs held in frozen storage would force him into unwanted  fatherhood.  </P> <P> Davis won a temporary court order against his wife's use of the eggs after  filing for divorce in February to end their nine-year marriage. He told  reporters that he does not want his children to suffer the pain of a broken  home.  </P></p>

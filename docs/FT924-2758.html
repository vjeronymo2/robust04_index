			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Portugal ratifies treaty THE Portuguese parliament yesterday ratified the Maastricht treaty by an overwhelming majority. Only 22 members of the 230-seat parliament, including the old-guard Communist Party, the conservative Centre Social Democrats and independents, voted against ratification. One Social Democrat rebel declined to vote. The ruling centre-right Social Democrats and the main opposition Socialist Party backed the treaty. Ratification will require Portugal to change its constitution on sharing sovereignty, allowing foreign residents to vote in local and European parliamentary elections, and ending the exclusive right of the Bank of Portugal, the central bank, to issue money.</p>

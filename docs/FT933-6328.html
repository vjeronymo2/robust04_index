			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK depends heavily on scientific endeavour Sir, find it astounding that throughout the recent debate on science education I have heard no forthright declaration that a dwindling interest in the sciences is against the interests of society. Equally astonishing is the lack of recognition of the inconsistency this represents in a society so heavily dependent on the fruits of scientific endeavour. More young people than ever before are rejecting science education at A-level. Consequently, fewer are opting for science degrees unless obliged to do so by the unavailability of places on arts courses. Much of the solution lies in how science is presented to young people. The quality of science teaching must be improved, and the portrayal of the role of science in society must be heightened to inspire young people to rise to its exciting challenges. Health, hunger, protecting the environment and employment are just some of the issues to which science holds the key. The chemicals industry is a major wealth creator that depends on a supply of top-quality scientists. But other sectors, too, are major employers of science graduates. Above all, a wider awareness of science will create better informed consumers which, in turn, will spur UK science-based industry to even greater achievements.

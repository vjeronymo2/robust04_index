			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, the local government  and the Cuban emigrants agreed to form mixed commissions to find  more flexible mechanisms for immigration paperwork and cultural  exchanges.    During debates at The Nation and the Emigrants Conference in  this capital, the two parties also agreed that the U.S. blockade  on Cuba is a obstacle on the path toward the adoption of  practical measures to normalize ties between Cuba and its  nationals abroad.    Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the meeting, said the  emigrants  presented various proposals during the second day of sessions,  among them a proposal to define the rights and duties of  permanent residents in other countries.    Other proposals include the creation of an emigrant visa,  the  possibility that those living abroad may study on the island if  they pay tuition, and quick processing of paperwork for short  trips to Cuba for humanitarian purposes. Another proposal made  by the visitors was to establish Cuban consulates in various  U.S. cities to better meet the needs of the Cuban community  there. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said Washington already  knows of Havana's desire to establish consulates in cities where  most of the emigrants live.    Robaina previously spoke about the official immigration  policy and pointed out that it is impossible to resolve in a  three-day meeting problems that have accumulated for three  decades. He added that the conference is intended to hold  discussions, to better understand each other's positions, and to  initiate a process.    According to Alfonso, the foreign minister noted that it is  the Cuban Government's practice to keep people's feelings in  mind before taking important measures, especially after 35 years  of aggression and scars that have not completely healed.    He added that any measures would initially include the  identification of areas requiring atention, followed by the  measures to be taken, and finally, a process to explain  everything to the entire country.    Another explanation was that it is impossible to attain the  same rights and responsibilities for people living in Cuba as  for those living abroad for different reasons, as it happens  with almost all existing laws in the world.    A total of 19 speakers, including 16 guests, spoke following  Robaina's special appearance. Alfonso described it as a  high-level dialogue.    In the course of the dialogue, Robaina said the Foreign  Ministry will now coordinate the work of all Cuban institutions  responsible for handling immigration matters. The objective is  to give systematic, efficient, and harmonious treatment to these  problems, he said.    According to the latest official report by the commission  that organized the conference, the arrival of a new group of  emigrants today brought the number of guests to 215 people from  29 countries.</p>

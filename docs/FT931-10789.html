			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Barclays escapes action over data: Banks may face code on approaches to customers THE office of the Data Protection Registrar yesterday said it had no immediate plan to take legal action against Barclays Bank over the bank's policy of putting personal and account details of new customers on a central database. The announcement followed a meeting between officials and senior legal advisers of the bank over Barclays' insistence that all new customers give consent for its subsidiaries to have access to account details for marketing purposes. Mr John Lamidey, the assistant data protection registrar responsible for financial services, said the office had no immediate intention of seeking an enforcement order against the bank under the 1984 Data Protection Act. However, Mr Lamidey said he would raise his concerns over with the British Bankers' Association, and might produce guidance for banks on the methods they could use to persuade customers to give consent for the use of data. Barclays said that it had been assured that the registrar was not contemplating action against it, and that it was neither breaking the Data Protection Act nor the banks' code of practice for personal customers. Barclays said it would in future have discussions with the registrar to ensure that it complied with the act and the code of practice in its policy on internal disclosure of personal data held on computers. The bank said it had previously sought approval from the data protection registrar for clauses in application forms for its products such as Barclaycard credit cards saying that customers would have to give consent for the use of data. However, it wanted to ensure that its future policy on the use of customer data was approved by the registrar. It would also comply with any future guidance on consent issued through the British Bankers' Association. The meeting was arranged this week after Mr Lamidey expressed public concern that banks might be evading their code of practice and breaking the act by insisting that new customers gave consent for internal disclosure of data. The code of banking practice, which was introduced by the banks last March, says that customers should give consent for their bank to disclose details of accounts to third parties, even if the third party is a subsidiary of the bank. However, banks are keen to gain permission for the internal disclosure of information because their subsidiaries selling products such as life insurance want to to market products to bank customers who are most likely to buy them. Banks are currently reviewing rules on the confidentiality of customer information in a British Bankers' Association working party. The association promoted the establishment of a voluntary code of practice last year.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> SACRIFICES TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT FAVORED;  </P> <P> SURVEY: RESPONDENTS SAY THEY WOULD SORT TRASH AND FORGO CAR AIR CONDITIONERS.  BUT THEY DRAW THE LINE AT HIGHER TAXES TO HELP SAVE ENDANGERED WILDLIFE.  </P> <P> Southern Californians say they would tolerate significant life style and  economic inconveniences to protect the environment but would not pay higher  taxes to help save endangered wildlife, a new Los Angeles Times Poll found.  </P> <P> The region gave the environment about the same priority as the rest of the  nation and expressed strong inclinations to make sacrifices for environmental  protection, including separating their trash and forgoing car air conditioning.  </P> <P> The poll also found that Southern Californians blame public indifference for  environmental problems and are more concerned about local issues rather than  global ones, such as the greenhouse effect.  </P> <P> They overwhelmingly oppose offshore oil drilling, tend to support policies  restricting coastal development and feel wary about swimming in Southern  California's polluted waters or eating fish caught from them.  </P> <P> Although the survey reflected respondents' intentions, and not necessarily  their behavior, it nevertheless revealed strong support for a wide variety of  measures now being considered by officials to protect Southern California's air  and other natural resources. These include the banning of drive-through  restaurants and the closing of environmentally fragile public lands.  </P> <P> More than half of those surveyed said they believe that the environment should  be protected even if it costs "a great deal" of money and means that "some  people" will lose their jobs. Nearly three-quarters of Orange County's  respondents expressed this view, a reflection of the county's relative  prosperity. The lower the incomes of the respondents, the less likely they were  to give the environment priority over economic concerns.  </P> <P> Los Angeles and Orange County residents tend to be less satisfied than the rest  of the nation with their environment, the poll found. Only 21% of those polled  in Los Angeles and 28% in Orange County rated their environment better than  other places, compared to 34% in San Diego, 36% in the rest of Southern  California and 42% in rest of the nation. Almost half of all Southern  Californians polled said their quality of life has declined, compared to only  38% for the rest of the country.  </P> <P> The Times polled 2,690 people across the country over five days in late  November, taking the largest sample from Southern California. The survey has a  margin of error of 3 percentage points, with the results likely to vary by that  much in either direction.  </P> <P> In a comparison of the nation's regions, the poll found that New England has  the most environmentally committed residents, followed by the Midwest,  Mountain, mid-Atlantic and Pacific states. The South was the least  environmentally concerned, according to the poll.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the most popular environmental remedy with residents may be  the least burdensome: giving up wasteful food packaging that is straining the  capacity of landfills. Nearly all of the Southern California respondents said  they would be willing to accept simpler packaging, including a ban on insulated  foam cups and restrictions on plastics to reduce waste.  </P> <P> More than 90% said they were willing to separate trash for recycling and give  up smog-producing leaf blowers, barbecue-lighter fluid and aerosols, and  wasteful disposable diapers, razors and lighters. Driving less often to reduce  air pollution was slightly less popular (86%), as was giving up car air  conditioning and drive-through restaurants and banks (82%), forgoing visits to  environmentally sensitive public lands (79%) paying higher taxes to clean up  water (73%) and living in smaller houses to conserve forests (70%).  </P> <P> I. A. Lewis, director of the poll, said the large numbers who indicated they  would make such sacrifices merely reflect the respondents' attitudes, which he  likened to "New Year's resolutions."  </P> <P> "There is always a difference between attitude and behavior," Lewis said. "It's  not to say they don't mean it, that they're not strongly committed to the  environment. But they don't always end up doing" what they say.  </P> <P> Still, the embracing of such ideas is certain to encourage efforts by state and  regional air quality officials to reduce smog by measures that require  life-style adjustments.  </P> <P> Already, officials have approved plans to reformulate aerosols and  barbecue-lighter fluids and are considering banning gasoline-powered leaf  blowers and drive-through restaurants and banks. Car manufacturers are  attempting to develop air conditioners that will not give off substances that  destroy the Earth's ozone layer, which protects life from ultraviolet  radiation, and federal officials have closed some public lands to conserve  wildlife.  </P> <P> Southern Californians were less receptive to other environmentally sound but at  times inconvenient practices. Nearly as many of the region's respondents said  they request plastic shopping bags as ask for paper, even though some kinds of  plastic bags do not decompose in landfills. The rest of the nation showed more  sensitivity to the problem, choosing paper over plastic by more than a 2-1  margin. Both groups, however, were about evenly divided over whether plastic  bags should be banned.  </P> <P> The poll found that Southern Californians want to protect wildlife as long as  such protection does not mean higher taxes. A majority said they opposed  raising taxes to save such threatened species as the California condor and the  northern spotted owl, and those willing to pay would limit the levy to an  average of $103 a year.  </P> <P> However, asked whether they were more sympathetic to efforts to protect  endangered species or to industries that are hurt by such attempts, those  polled came down solidly on the side of animals. That finding may be bad news  to the Pacific Northwest timber industry, which complains that efforts to save  the spotted owl have reduced logging in old-growth forests. Nearly 60% of  Orange County respondents sided with wildlife over industry, followed by 50% in  Los Angeles and 46% in San Diego.  </P> <P> In what may be a discouraging finding to some conservationists, 55% of those  polled in Southern California said they oppose killing animals even if they are  driving other species to extinction. Interference by man has caused an  unnatural explosion in the population of some animals that prey on endangered  species, but animal rights' activists have stymied efforts to protect these  vanishing creatures by killing their predators.  </P> <P> The poll also found that environmental issues could decide a political race if  the candidates held distinctly different positions on a pressing issue.  Forty-eight percent of the Southern Californians polled said they would switch  parties to vote against a candidate who favored expanding the economy at the  expense of the environment, even if that candidate represented the voter's  other views, while 28% said they would switch to vote against a candidate who  favored the environment.  </P> <P> Asked to say which of eight problems was the nation's most "important,"  Southern Californians ranked the environment fourth along with the national  budget deficit and behind drugs, crime and AIDS, and above a decline in morals,  disarmament and foreign trade.  </P> <P> Compared to the rest of the country, Southern California is less satisfied with  President Bush's handling of the environment, according to the survey. Only 39%  of Southern Californians said he has done a good job on environmental issues,  compared to 46% of those living elsewhere. Lewis, who directed the poll,  attributed Bush's poorer rating at least in part to the large number of  Democrats in Los Angeles County, which accounts for half the region's  population.  </P> <P> The poll found more concern about local environmental problems (49%) than  global ecological concerns such as destruction of the ozone layer (40%). Nearly  50% of the respondents said air pollution was the most important environmental  problem today, 41% singled out toxics, such as hazardous chemicals in the water  supply, and 26% cited pollution of rivers. Other problems cited in order of  their importance were traffic, global warming, wildlife, uncontrolled  development and the loss of open space.  </P> <P> Forty-two percent of the Southern Californians surveyed said they drink bottled  water, compared to only 16% in the rest of the country, and more of the  region's respondents said the reason was concern about toxins rather than  taste. Bottled water was preferred by about half the San Diego and Los Angeles  respondents and 40% of the Orange County residents.  </P> <P> Nearly half of those asked said swimming is unsafe in the region's waters.  Forty-four percent said they would not eat fish caught off Southern California,  with Los Angeles County respondents almost equally divided on the question.  </P> <P> Oil drilling off the coast was opposed by two-thirds of the Southern  Californians polled, and 50% said they support the California Coastal  Commission, which was created to protect the shoreline from rampant  development. The commission got a vote of confidence from a majority of the  respondents in Orange and San Diego counties, where development along the coast  has spawned contentious debate.  </P> <P> The public is most responsible for endangering the environment because it  "doesn't seem to care," according to 44% of Southern Californians polled. The  survey also found substantial numbers who blamed government (32%) and business  (31%) for environmental problems. Only 6% singled out farmers, despite regular  complaints by environmental groups over farmers' use of potentially hazardous  pesticides, and only 1% laid the blame on hunters.  </P> <P> In a ranking of who should bear the burden of cleanup, Southern Californians  most often cited government or business or said both sectors should share the  responsibility with private interest groups.  </P> <P> Lewis said the relatively large responsibility placed on business for harming  and cleaning up the environment may be a legacy of the Exxon Valdez oil spill  earlier this year.  </P> <P> "The real big problem here is for business," he said. "There is a black eye  there that is going to take them years to get over."  </P> <P> </P> <P> VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P>  Answers to questions by 1,067 respondents interviewed in Southern California  and 1,623 repondents in the rest of the nation.  </P> <P> 1.

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q AND A: REMODELING OFTEN A BETTER CHOICE FOR HOMEOWNERS THAN  BUYING UP  </P> <P> QUESTION: My husband and I are debating whether to add a fourth bedroom and a  family room to our present home or sell it and buy a larger home. We have  looked at every brand-new home in our vicinity. While they are very nice and  are more up-to-date than our current residence, we like our location, the good  schools and the short commute to our jobs. But some of our good friends  recently remodeled their home and they almost got divorced. It was a mess.  Finally, they took a two-week vacation to get away from the construction.  Because we need more space for our growing family, we must make a decision  quickly. What do you recommend?  </P> <P> ANSWER: My home builder friends will crucify me, but because you are happy with  your neighborhood, I recommend you add on and remodel your home. In most  situations, this choice is much cheaper than buying an equivalent new home.  </P> <P> Perhaps you have noticed extensive home remodeling and additions in your  neighborhood. Homeowners all over the nation are realizing it is usually far  cheaper to upgrade their current home than it is to sell and buy a larger, more  expensive home.  </P> <P> Another major advantage is, in most towns, you will keep your old lower  property tax assessment except for the value of the addition and remodeling.  </P> <P> But before you hire a contractor, please interview at least three. Ask your  friends for recommendations. Be sure to write down all the work you want  performed so all contractors will be bidding on the same job.  </P> <P> Before you hire a contractor, check each one out very carefully by inspecting  at least one of their previous jobs and phoning at least three of their  previous customers. In most states, you can also check with the state  contractor's license board and the local Better Business Bureau to learn of any  complaints filed against each contractor.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, as in many businesses, the home remodeling business has some bad  apples. But there are also many excellent contractors who work primarily on  referrals from satisfied customers.  </P> <P> Personally, I have had excellent experience with most remodeling contractors,  but occasionally I have problems with contractors who take on work that is  beyond their skills. Keep in close touch with your contractor to prevent  mistakes. Don't become a pest but check the work every few days to be certain  all is well and the work is being performed according to the written contract.  It is better to prevent problems than correct them.  </P> <P> Recommended Books for Home Shopper  </P> <P> Q: I am a renter who wants to buy a home. But I don't like the idea of being at  the mercy of real estate agents, mortgage companies, builders and the like. I  want to learn about the process of buying a house. Do you know of a good book  about how to purchase a home without getting swindled?  </P> <P> A: Yes. One excellent new book is "How to Buy a House With No (or Little) Money  Down" by Martin M. Shenkman from John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, $12.95.  Another good book is "Before You Buy Your House or Apartment" by William J.  Klein from Warner Books for $9.95. Both are available in stock or by special  order at local bookstores.  </P> <P> What to Do If Your Real Estate Loses Value  </P> <P> Q: About three years ago we moved away from Montana. We considered selling our  home there for about the price we paid, but decided instead to rent it to  tenants. Since we moved away the home has declined in value.  </P> <P> Worse yet, it is now worth about $5,000 less than our VA mortgage balance. Our  tenant recently moved out. We consulted several realtors there and after  figuring the sales commission, we would be lucky to get rid of the house by  finding someone to take over our mortgage, but we would have to pay the  realtor's sales commission. What should we do?  </P> <P> A: It is a shame you didn't sell that house when you moved away from Montana.  Unless you plan to return to your old home, I recommend selling it because  managing long distance rentals is very difficult. As you discovered, being out  of touch with local conditions has now cost you dearly.  </P> <P> As you probably know, I recommend listing homes for sale with local realtors.  However, you may want to try selling your home by running ads such as "nothing  down, take over mortgage payments."  </P> <P> I presume your older VA mortgage is assumable. If that doesn't work, then  listing it with a realtor and paying the sales commission out of your pocket is  the most viable alternative. Incidentally, many mortgage lenders who suffer  foreclosure losses now go after defaulting borrowers, so don't think you can  walk away from that VA mortgage without the risk the lender may come after you  for any loss. Ask your attorney to explain further.  </P> <P> Assessor Erred in Setting Low Tax  </P> <P> Q: We bought a brand-new home about five years ago. The first year our property  tax was very low because at the time the tax was assessed, the home was only  partly completed. However, our tax has never been increased since then, except  for increases in the tax rate. Can the tax collector come after us for the tax  he forgot to reassess? If we sell the property, can the assessor come after us  for unpaid taxes?  </P> <P> A: Yes. In most states the tax assessor can levy a tax on escaped assessments.  But I am not aware of any state that has a law requiring the property owner to  notify the assessor of his mistake. If you sell the property, in most states  the tax assessor cannot go after the former owner for unpaid realty taxes but  he may be able to assess the property for back taxes. Consult a local real  estate attorney for further details.  </P> <P> New Books Describe Setting Up Living Trust  </P> <P> Q: Just a quick note to thank you for recommending some time ago that property  owners avoid probate by putting their assets into a living trust. My husband  and I followed that valuable advice. It involved some work getting the legal  descriptions of our properties, having the deeds prepared, and then recording  them.  </P> <P> A local lawyer charged us $750 but it was well worth the modest cost. Less than  a month after we completed the living trust my husband died at age 43 of a  heart attack.  </P> <P> Since we owned 11 properties, I was expecting all sorts of delay and  complications, but his entire estate was subject to only minimal paper work,  mostly the tax returns, which the lawyer handled for less than $1,000. But I  haven't read anything in your columns lately about living trusts. Why don't you  encourage people to use them to avoid the costs of probate?  </P> <P> A: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss living trusts again.  Frankly, I don't get many questions about how to avoid unnecessary probate  costs, so the topic doesn't arise very often.  </P> <P> Since I last wrote about how to save on probate costs, two excellent new books  have been published. One is "Living Trust" by Henry W. Abts III (published by  Contemporary Books, Chicago, $19.95).  </P> <P> The other is "Plan Your Estate" by Denis Clifford (published by Nolo Press,  Berkeley, $17.95). Both are available in stock or by special order at local  bookstores. I especially like Clifford's book because it contains simple  tear-out living trust forms.  </P> <P> Can an Agent Sue If Buyer's Terms Refused?  </P> <P> Q: Our home is listed for sale with a fine realty agent. Last week another  agent showed the house to prospective buyers. I was home when they inspected  the house. They were thoroughly obnoxious people who nit-picked the house. I  was sure they wouldn't buy it.  </P> <P> But the next day they submitted a full price, all-cash offer with only a  contingency for professional inspection of the house. However, my husband felt  we should reject the offer because we feel these people will be trouble. We  rejected the offer because we didn't like the buyers, but we told the agent we  didn't like the inspection contingency. But now the realty agent is threatening  to sue us for the sales commission because she brought us a full-price offer.  Can she win?  </P> <P> A: No. If the listing agent or a cooperating agent brings a home seller a  full-price, all-cash offer with no contingencies, the seller is not obligated  to sell to that buyer. But the seller would owe the agent a full sales  commission since the agent produced a full-price cash offer.  </P> <P> A real estate listing is much like newspaper ads for merchandise, which legally  are invitations for purchase offers at the advertised price, not promises to  sell at the asking price.  </P> <P> However, when a realty agent produces a full-price, all-cash offer with  contingencies, such as your agent produced, if the seller does not accept it,  the listing agent is not entitled to any sales commission since the agent did  not produce an offer exactly matching the listing price with no contingencies.  Please consult a real estate attorney for further details.  </P> <P> Manage Apartments to Save for Home  </P> <P> Q: My wife and I have been trying to save for a down payment to buy a home. But  then my wife got pregnant and had twin boys, who are now 4-months-old. We  decided it would be best for her not to go back to work because after paying  child-care costs, she wouldn't have much net income.  </P> <P> Our problem is, these developments have devastated our savings program. Before  the babies, we were saving about $500 per month, but now we can barely make  ends meet on my salary. Any ideas how we can get a down payment to buy a house?  </P> <P> A: Probably the best way to stop the outflow of rent money so you can start  saving again for a down payment is for you and your wife to become managers of  an apartment complex. Since she is home all day, she can manage the complex and  show vacant apartments during the daytime. If you are handy, you can take care  of minor repairs in the evenings and on weekends.  </P> <P> Good apartment managers are hard for owners to find. Look through the  classified want ads in most major newspapers and you will find lots of owners  looking for apartment managers. If the apartment complex is large enough, you  can probably get a free two-bedroom manager's apartment plus a little  compensation. Then you can save all the money you are currently spending on  rent. In a few years you will have a handsome down payment.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 17 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio explained today to his U.S.  colleague, Bill Clinton, the decision to revise the functions of  the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC], state paramilitary  groups that humanitarian organizations accuse of violating human  rights.    In a letter addressed today to Clinton and released by the  Presidency Public Relations Office, De Leon said that he has  ordered turning the PAC, which operate in areas that are no  longer indispensable, into "Peace and Development Committees."    The patrols, which consist of civilians whom the Army equips  and controls, were created during the defacto government of  General Efrain Rios Montt (1982-83) to fight the guerrillas in  the interior.    These groups, made up mostly of Indians, have been accused  by  national and international humanitarian organizations of  committing abuses against the indigenous population, which is  why they have demanded that the government dissolve them.    General Mario Enriquez, Guatemalan defense minister, has  recognized that the Army has some 520,000 patrolmen in various  parts of the country, supporting 40,000 soldiers of the Armed  Forces.    In the letter, de Leon also tells Clinton of the "first big  objective" of his agenda, which is to consolidate democracy and  the state of law "as a part of political order," for which he  appreciates the "support and permanent backing of the United  States."    For it, he says, there is a commitment to respect human  rights and the multicultural reality of the country, to fight  impunity and corruption, to promote decentralization, and to  promote the people's participation.    He also informed him of the recommendations by Christian  Tomuschat, an expert UN human rights adviser, which have been  fulfilled, such as the restructuring of the presidential general  staff, a military group that was also accused of serious abuses  and telephone espionage.</p>

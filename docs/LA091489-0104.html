			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS UNITE TO RAISE MORE FUNDS FOR DRUG WAR  </P> <P> Senate Democrats, determined to use the power of the purse to reshape President  Bush's week-old drug plan, united Wednesday behind their own alternative that  would raise spending by $2.2 billion more than Bush requested and cut all other  discretionary federal spending by 0.5% to pay for it.  </P> <P> But Senate Democratic leaders offered to negotiate a compromise program with  Senate Republicans and Administration officials rather than force a showdown.  </P> <P> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) made no immediate reply, but  Republican sources indicated that he would agree to try to work out a deal with  the Democrats, who outnumber Republicans in the Senate, 55 to 45. Republicans  planned to caucus Thursday to consider a response.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Lack Votes  </P> <P> If no compromise can be reached, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.)  said, Democrats would offer their plan, which was prepared by Sen. Robert C.  Byrd (D-W.Va.) as an amendment to an appropriations bill. But he acknowledged  that it would not pass over determined Republican opposition because it takes  60 votes -- five more than the Democrats control -- to break a filibuster.  </P> <P> The White House, which had denounced the Democratic plan Tuesday as "price-tag  politics," said Wednesday that it would give "reluctant support" to another  approach advanced by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.). His measure would raise  anti-drug spending by $1.8 billion and pay for it with a cut of 0.25% in most  other federal programs.  </P> <P> "If we really wanted to get on with the job, . . . my bet is: That's it, that's  the solution," White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman told a House  Appropriations subcommittee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Absolutely Unacceptable'  </P> <P> But he condemned Byrd's approach as "absolutely unacceptable" and said that a  third proposal to finance Bush's funding request by across-the-board cuts in  other programs would cut too deeply into Pentagon programs.  </P> <P> In other testimony, William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of  National Drug Control Policy, resisted Democratic pressure for more spending on  anti-drug programs than Bush had asked but acknowledged that disputes over  funding are inevitable. "I think it's important not to make the war on drugs  hostage to political differences," Bennett said.  </P> <P> Any bargaining over the shape of the drug package would face an implied  deadline of Oct. 1, the first day of fiscal year 1990.  </P> <P> Using blunt language, Mitchell said that members of his party regard the  President's plan as "wholly inadequate" to win a war against drugs. He said  that Democratic senators are united in support of Byrd's plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Redirect Funds  </P> <P> Mitchell, speaking to reporters after Democrats had a 90-minute caucus on  drugs, also said that Bush's strategy must be redirected to put more funds into  education and treatment and less into law enforcement.  </P> <P> Emerging from the session, Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said that he strongly  supports Byrd's approach, adding: "If we can't cut one-half of 1% from every  department, we're not serious about winning the war on drugs."  </P> <P> Byrd was named chairman of an eight-member negotiating team for the Democrats,  which included Hollings as well as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph  R. Biden Jr. of Delaware.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the House Democratic Study Group issued a report charging that  Bush's plan would shortchange 23 states by reducing their federal funds by more  than the amount his drug plan would provide to them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cuts in Four Programs  </P> <P> Under the President's proposal, a total of $751 million in budget cuts would  offset his proposed increase of $716 million in new anti-drug spending, the  group said. Four programs -- juvenile justice assistance, programs for newly  legal immigrants, economic development grants and public housing subsidies --  would account for $604 million, or 80%, of the reductions.  </P> <P> The Democratic group, an informal group of liberal and moderate Democrats, said  that California would lose almost four times as much in federal aid as it would  gain under expanded anti-drug programs. Forty-three states would lose half of  their new drug fund allocations because of offsetting cuts in other federal  programs, the study concluded.  </P> <P> Staff writer Douglas Jehl contributed to this report.  </P></p>

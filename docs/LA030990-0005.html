			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNINGSIDE  </P> <P> We are different in many ways. One of us is male, black, a native of Alabama;  the other female, white, a native Californian born a decade and a half earlier.  </P> <P> What do we have in common? We've known each other 7 years and are now  co-workers and, we are both dismayed about the conditions you reported at our  common alma mater, Morningside High School in Inglewood (Metro, Feb. 20). We  are especially saddened that today's students are not receiving the pleasure of  a solid education in a nurturing environment that we did. Why?  </P> <P> B.

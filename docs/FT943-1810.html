			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / The mega-deal is back on Wall St: Is the flurry of takeovers in the US good for shareholders and customers So General Electric is going to buy Time Warner for more than Dollars 15bn. That is, if it doesn't sell half of NBC to Time Warner instead - though of course Disney wants to buy the whole television network for Dollars 5bn. Whatever. Then again, GE is also thinking of using that spare Dollars 15bn to buy American Express. Or perhaps it will be content with ITT's financial services businesses. Or ITT might hand over these businesses to GE in part exchange for NBC . . . These are just some of the rumours that have swirled around Wall Street in the past week (forcing GE, for one, into the unusual position of denying any interest in either Time Warner or American Express). And when the rumour mill is working flat out, it is a sure sign that the US takeover business is back in full swing. It has been five years since this sort of takeover mania hit the US financial markets. This year, with more than Dollars 220bn worth of deals announced in the first eight months, the tally could match even the record Dollars 335bn of 1988. Why is it happening? And is it a Good Thing for companies' shareholders, workers and customers? The pattern of takeover activity provides one answer to the question 'why'. Nearly two-thirds of the deals consummated since the beginning of last year have come in a handful of industries: pharmaceuticals and healthcare, entertainment and the media, defence, telecommunications and financial services. There are specific reasons why each of these sectors faces upheaval. The defence industry has been forced to consolidate by a halving of the US defence procurement budget since 1986. The healthcare sector is facing pressure from employers, who are resisting the continuing rise in insurance premiums for their workers. Producers and distributors of television programmes are being drawn together by the promise of new technology and by deregulation. So is the outburst of multi-billion dollar deals across a number of industries just coincidence? Hardly. There are three underlying reasons why it is happening now. First, all the financial planets are in alignment. Put simply, companies are in a better position to pay for acquisitions than they have been for some time. US corporate debt levels are down after the leveraged 1980s, and cashflow is stronger. According to the Commerce Department's census bureau, the average pre-tax return on equity for US manufacturing companies was an annualised 23 per cent in the second quarter, a level it had not reached since the middle of the 1980s. Also, borrowing is easy and cheap: US bond yields, though up sharply this year, are still as low as at any time in the 1980s, and banks are falling over themselves to lend. At the same time, the stock market continues to bump along close to its all-time high. This gives companies a valuable takeover currency in the form of their own shares, which can be used in full or part consideration. Last year, just a third of takeover deals were all-cash, half the level of the late 1980s. The second underlying factor is that, with the recession well behind them, company bosses have more time to consider expansion - and the takeover, once seen as the weapon of the asset stripper, greenmailer or corporate raider, has become respectable again. Third, the political backdrop remains conducive to mergers and acquisitions. Despite some fears in business circles at the outset of the Clinton administration, the Justice Department has made little attempt to stem the flow of deals. In sectors such as defence and healthcare, mergers which reduce overall industry costs fit neatly with administration policy. And this week, after a long review, the anti-trust authorities cleared the Dollars 11.5bn takeover of McCaw Cellular by AT&amp;T, despite claims by rival telecommunication companies that the deal would turn AT&amp;T back into the dominant industry giant it was before the enforced break-up. But are the latest takeovers beneficial? For many US workers, the answer seems to be no. A large number of recent deals has been justified on the grounds of cost saving. In banking, for instance, the general rule of thumb for an acquirer is to cut the costs of its acquisition by 40 per cent. Service industries, in particular finance and healthcare, are experiencing some of the biggest job cuts. One effect has been for some companies to make cuts before becoming takeover fodder themselves. For shareholders, this suggests that the picture is a healthy one. When making acquisitions, promises of lower costs are generally easier for managers to fulfil than promises of higher revenues from entering new markets. 'In most cases, these mergers make economic sense. It is good for us in general,' says Mr Jose Arau, an investment analyst with the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), which has Dollars 27bn invested in US equities. Like others, he draws a distinction between the 1980s - 'the takeover artists, buying companies for a quick buck' - and the deals of the 1990s. Some buyers are paying too much for their acquisitions, says Arau: Calpers voted during the summer against Mellon Bank's takeover of the Dreyfus mutual funds group, although the deal did ultimately succeed last month. But in general he insists the prices being paid are good for the shareholders of acquiring companies. Companies are not just using economies of scale to justify acquisitions. Many are also arguing that takeovers will enhance their growth prospects, though such claims tend to arouse a degree of scepticism in the market. In the media and entertainment industries, the flurry of activity is driven in part by the belief that more powerful transmission mechanisms fostered by digital technology will lead to a sharp increase in the services available from television screens. But how much more will consumers be prepared to pay for such services - and will it justify the valuations now being put on media and entertainment properties? For customers, meanwhile, the takeover wave poses an important long-term question: will the emergence of a smaller number of bigger companies in certain industries lead to higher prices or less choice? Few of the current mergers or acquisitions are being justified on the grounds that they make the companies involved more competitive in world markets: instead, they are all about increasing market power in the US. To the extent that unit costs come down (and productivity rises) in industries such as healthcare or banking, it will be good for consumers. But at what point are the benefits of scale outweighed by the oligopolistic tendencies that can result from the dominance of the few? To judge by the Justice Department's lack of intervention so far, it does not yet fear the line is being crossed. A related concern for consumers and anti-trust authorities arises from the fact that a number of recent deals in the pharmaceuticals and entertainment industries have been 'vertical mergers' - that is, between producers and distributors. In the past year, three of the four biggest US drug distribution companies (known as pharmacy benefit managers) have been bought out by producers. The prospective deals between television production companies and broadcast or cable television networks follow a similar pattern. One explanation is that technology is everywhere changing the relationship between producers and distributors. In financial services, for instance, banks and insurance companies are looking forward to the day when they can scrap many of their branches and rely on the information superhighway to plug them directly into their customers' television sets. Who will then control the distribution mechanism? In the years ahead the Justice Department will need to review closely the questions about consumer choice raised by such developments. In the meantime, though, its relaxed attitude suggests that the Wall Street takeover party has a while left to run.</p>

Finally, if we conclude that management agreements or similar arrangements should be treated as attributable interests, how should our rules apply in the case of designated entities? Specifically, we seek comment regarding the following issues: Are there policies or other considerations that would warrant applying management contract attribution rules differently in the case of designated entities? Should management agreements be attributable for purposes of application of the 10 percent cap relating to entrepreneurs' block licenses? Should management contracts affect eligibility for provisions provided for designated entities? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Resale. Similarly, we request comment on whether any resale agreements should be considered an interest attributable to a reseller in the context of a PCS spectrum aggregation cap, PCS-cellular cross-ownership restrictions, or a general CMRS spectrum cap. The Commission has defined resale as an ``activity wherein one entity subscribes to the communications services and facilities of another entity and then reoffers communications service to the public (with or without `adding value') for profit.'' We have required cellular licensees to provide resale, except that a cellular licensee may restrict resale by a facilities-based competitor after the competitor has been licensed for five years. We note that resellers of commercial mobile radio services have been classified as CMRS providers, and they may offer services that compete with other commercial mobile radio services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. In most instances, we are not concerned that a reseller could exercise effective control over the spectrum on which it provides service or have the ability to reduce the amount of service provided over that spectrum because other resellers could enter into such resale arrangements. Under these circumstances, we see no reason to attribute the spectrum of the underlying service provider to resellers for purposes of spectrum caps. Some parties, however, have expressed concern that resale agreements may be used to circumvent the spectrum caps. In the context of common carrier regulation, it seems unlikely that any resale agreement short of a transfer of control could reduce the quantity of service available to the public. As a result, we currently do not think that resale agreements should be considered attributable interests, but we invite comments from parties that believe there are competitive concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Joint Marketing Agreements. We also request comment on whether joint marketing agreements should constitute an attributable interest in the contest of a PCS spectrum aggregation cap, PCS-cellular cross-ownership restrictions, or a general CMRS spectrum cap. Under a joint marketing agreement, two or more CMRS providers would pool their resources to market their services to consumers. One aspect of this joint venture may be to market the services of various CMRS providers under a common name. We believe that such joint ventures may be beneficial to both licensees and consumers because of the savings that could be realized by pooling resources for advertising and direct sales. These savings could then be passed on to the consumer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

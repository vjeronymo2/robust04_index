			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Observer: Omelette of egg-heads Provided President Heseltine coughs up Pounds 100,000 or so, we may soon see a practical test of the Law of Economists' Equilibrium. It states that for every economist holding any given view, there'll be another holding precisely the opposite. The project originates with Paul Ormerod, economics chief at the Henley Centre research group. He plans to get Britain's foremost dismal-scientists to spell out their personal rules for making forecasts, then stick all the formulae into a capacious computer. He hopes the resulting omelette of economic egg-heads will produce predictions that are appreciably more reliable than the cock-ups apt to result when individual economists peer into the future. A trial of the in-put stage has already been held with the aid of the London Business School's amiable chief forecaster Geoffrey Dicks. The reason he was chosen is apparently that his mind works in a way that is easy for a computer to understand - besides which it nary matters that London Business School has been among the least accurate of forecasters lately. Other luminaries who've shown interest include Treasury chief economist Alan Budd. So, given funding from Michael Heseltine's trade and industry department, the project should go ahead. If it does, and the equilibrium law holds good, the net result will of course be nothing whatever.</p>

In a letter sent yesterday to Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, the Iraqi permanent envoy said the  U.S., British, and French aircraft on 7, 8, and 9 January  continued to violate the Iraqi airspace and conducted 101  hostile sorties out of bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.    The Iraqi envoy enclosed a list detailing these violations  and asked that the letter be distributed to the Arab League  member states.</p>

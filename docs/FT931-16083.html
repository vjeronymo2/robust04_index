			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: TT declares bid for AB unconditional TT Group, the industrial holding company which has recently been transforming itself into a more specialised electronics company, yesterday declared unconditional its recommended offer for AB Electronics. At the first closing date TT had received acceptances in respect of 52 per cent of AB shares. It bought a 6.3 per cent stake last July and a further 1.1 per cent during the offer. TT also announced that the open offer of shares to raise Pounds 7.7m was subscribed 1.4 times. Since the bid was launched TT's share has risen from 186p to yesterday's close of 240.5p, up 3.5p on the day. As a result the value of TT's share offer has risen from 50p to 65p, while the cash alternative has remained at 45p. In spite of this disparity, the company received acceptances for the cash alternative in respect of 438,251 AB shares. The share offer remains open until further notice. Advisers to TT said the share price had been depressed ahead of the bid because of talks taking place with AB. Mr John Newman, TT chief executive, had also spent time raising TT's profile with institutions.</p>

In two surprises, Mr. Rabuka did not  name a deputy prime minister and in addition he has announced  that he will now take responsibility for foreign affairs and  external trade. Mr. Rabuka has also reduced the size of his  cabinet from 18 to 12. Ashran Singh reports:    [Singh] Paul Manueli, the only member of parliament from the  island of Rotuma, returns as minister of finance. A member of  Fiji's highest chief's assembly, Adi Samanunu Cakobau, is the  minister responsible for Fijian affairs, a key ministry. In  this capacity she will also be chairperson of the powerful Great  Council of Chiefs.    The other ministers are:    Harold Powell, minister for commerce;    Kelemedi Bulewa, attorney-general;    Ratu Ovini Bokini, minister for agriculture, fisheries and  forests;    Ratu Jo Nacola, minister for multi-ethnic affairs;    Taufa Vakatale, minister for education;    Ratu Timoci Vesikula, minister for lands;    Lieutenant-Colonel Jonetani Kaukimoce -- responsible for  health, social welfare and housing;    Ratu Josefa Dimuri, minister for information;    Berenado Vunibobo is the minister for home affairs,  immigration, labor, industrial relations, youth and employment.    Reflecting on the fact that there are no Indians in this  cabinet, Mr. Rabuka said he wants to seriously consider  expanding his coalition to include the National Federation  Party, which has 20 Indian members in Parliament.

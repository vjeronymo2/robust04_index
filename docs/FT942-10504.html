			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Rise and rise of a Malaysian businessman - Tajudin Ramli is set to take over the controls at the state airline Mr Tajudin Ramli started his corporate career in the early 1980s in bicycles, buying a controlling stake in the Malaysian unit of the British Raleigh group. Now Mr Tajudin is one of Malaysia's leading entrepreneurs, with multi-million dollar interests in telecommunications, tourism and transport. Last week Celcom, a unit of Mr Tajudin's listed Technology Resources company (TRI), announced it had won a licence to set up international telecommunications links. Celcom already has a more than 60 per cent share in Malaysia's fast growing cellular communications market. A private company controlled by Mr Tajudin is also in the satellite business: it has bought and launched two Russian communications satellites with the idea of leasing space to regional users. Now, Mr Tajudin's Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS) a locally listed company, has plans to take over the running of Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the country's national carrier and one of south-east Asia's biggest airlines. Mr Tajudin is one of Malaysia's most closely watched businessmen. His activities are the talk of Kuala Lumpur boardrooms. However, there are growing concerns that Mr Tajudin is trying to expand too fast. 'No one can keep control over such a fast growing business empire,' says one Kuala Lumpur analyst. 'He's taken on too much - hardly a day goes by without some new deal being announced.' Malaysia and Thailand are the fastest growing mobile phone markets in the world. In spite of competition from new system operators, the number of subscribers to TRI's Celcom unit network is expected to increase by between 8,000 and 9,000 a month over the next two years. Brokers and investors seem generally optimistic about TRI. TRI made a pre-tax profit last year of MDollars 103m (USDollars 38.9m) compared with MDollars 16.8m in 1992. Over the last 12 months TRI shares have risen from MDollars 1.46 to MDollars 11.50 on the Kuala Lumpur exchange. However there are doubts about Mr Tajudin's move into Malaysia Airlines. 'Like telecommunications, airlines are primarily about service,' says Mr Tajudin. 'There is a big shake-up coming at MAS. I will be concentrating on the airline from now on.' In what was one of the biggest deals in Malaysian corporate history, it was announced late last year that Bank Negara, the country's central bank, would sell a 32 per cent stake in MAS to the Tajudin-controlled MHS. The cost of the stake was estimated at MDollars 1.79bn. However, final clearance for the MHS/MAS deal seems to have been delayed. The original purchase proposal was to have been funded through the issuing of 112m new MHS shares at the then market price of MDollars 16 a share. But the Kuala Lumpur stock market has fallen by more than 20 per cent since the beginning of the year and MHS shares have dropped to around MDollars 11. With underwriters shying away from the deal there is talk of a restructured MAS takeover package. MHS is a relatively small company specialising in support services to Malaysia's oil and gas industry. Pre-tax profit in the year to end-1993 was MDollars 21m, down from MDollars 31m the previous year. Recently MHS has been on an aggressive acquisition hunt. Last year it purchased a 33 per cent stake in the Schriener Aviation group of the Netherlands for Dollars 4.8m and a 25 per cent stake in World Airways, the US charter operator, for Dollars 27.4m. It has been involved in protracted takeover negotiations with Bristow, the UK helicopter operator. While Mr Tajudin says he wants to build MHS into an international aviation company, doubts persist about its financial strength and its ability to manage such a large and complex operation as MAS. The Malaysian carrier has recently been flying into some financial turbulence. An over-ambitious fleet expansion programme in the 1991-96 period, involving the purchase of 72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn, has placed severe strain on the balance sheet. At the same time passenger numbers on many routes have dropped. Pre-tax profit for the six months to September 1993 was MDollars 6.4m, a 96 per cent drop on the equivalent period the previous year. There is also a political dimension to Mr Tajudin's business dealings. Mr Tajudin is a protege of Mr Daim Zainuddin, Malaysia's former finance minister and a close confidant of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister. Mr Daim is known as one of Malaysia's wealthiest businessmen and a corporate wheeler dealer. Mr Tajudin's business rivals say Mr Tajudin used his political connections to win lucrative telecommunications licenses. In return, the government asked the entrepreneur to reorganise MAS. Mr Tajudin shrugs off such rumours, saying he merely responded to opportunities offered to him. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the present finance minister, has become involved in increasingly public wranglings with the influential Mr Daim, while Malaysia's regulatory authorities are said to be unhappy with some aspects of Mr Tajudin's business activities. But Mr Tajudin insists everything is going to plan. 'At various times people have said I was mad, putting money into companies like Celcom and MHS. But I have proved them wrong. You have to have vision, that is very important.'</p>

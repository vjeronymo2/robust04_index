			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Dramatic gearing for UK holdings in Japan - The appreciation of the yen has combined with the climb in Tokyo equities With the wonderful benefit of hindsight, it is easy to see that a prime buying opportunity existed at this time last year. Investors had become totally despairing of Japan. Equities had fallen almost 60 per cent from their December 1989 high and still appeared to be in free-fall. And the Dollars 32bn pumped into the Japanese market by foreign investors during the previous 12 months was beginning to be recognised as good money thrown after bad. Those adventurous investors have had their reward. The Tokyo market is up by only 29 per cent on a year ago, and consequently is still some 45 per cent below that 1989 high. But this is a lot better than most other markets. The cream has come, however, in the form of the added currency contribution. Over the past year the yen has risen by 18 per cent against the dollar and by 50 per cent against sterling. This has resulted in a sterling total return from Japan of 96 per cent and a dollar equivalent return of 54 per cent. Confining the statistics to the first six months of 1993 shows that Japan is certainly on track to dominate fund performances this year. Europe has produced a reasonably solid performance, but Wall Street has done little more than tread water. The net result has been a total return on the FT-A World Index of 17 per cent in sterling terms and 16 per cent in dollar terms. The implication of this first half outcome is that UK-based pension funds will have been struggling to keep up with any indices. On the home front, the rise of 3 1/2 per cent in the UK component of the World Index conceals a gain of just 2 per cent by the top 100 companies, but a gain of 16 per cent by the rest of the market. This divergence within the UK market is an industry-, as well as a size-effect. The divergence began on Black (Golden?) Wednesday in September last year when the UK suspended its membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Investors have been chasing the cyclical stocks and sectors higher ever since, scenting the possibility of some economic recovery following the collapse in sterling and the decline in interest rates. Contrarian investors who built up overweight holdings in these areas earlier in 1992 have a right to feel smug. The sterling performances achieved by the overseas portions of the UK-based funds are likely to have been very diverse. The combination of an overweight position in continental Europe and an underweighting in North America will have served to improve performance relative to the FT-A World ex-UK index. Offsetting this, of course, will be the typically underweight position in Japan. The main determinant for many funds will be the extent to which their exposure to other Far Eastern markets, which tends to be far higher than the index, has compensated for Japan. Those investors caught short in Japan are probably heaving a sigh of relief now that the political and economic scene is frozen, pending the outcome of the election later this month. The consensus view seems to be that the market and currency will follow suit, and do little until some of the uncertainties are removed. In fact, most international investors appear to have resigned themselves to a dull second half to the year. There are no signs of the froth which accompanies bull peaks, but neither are there bargains in obvious abundance. All eyes will be on Wall Street for signs of any definite trend. US stock ratings are high by historical standards but, nevertheless, they can be justified by the interest rate background and the low returns available on alternative, domestic assets. The problem comes, as it will come shortly, when interest rates start to rise out of their recent trough. Indeed, there is every likelihood that the pattern of previous presidential cycles will be repeated: the need for a tightening in both monetary and fiscal policies following a pre-election period of considerable easing. This implies an equity market correction in the not too distant future. Investors in the UK market also have to face up to the fact that an interest rate trough could well have been reached. It could be late into next year, however, before the consequences of rising interest rates have to be faced again, assuming that inflation continues to behave itself in the meantime. The main risk to the market in the short term is that ambitious expectations for a sharp earnings recovery fail to be met. With the market on a rating last seen in mid-1987, investors in the UK market are already taking a lot on trust. Most of the rest of Europe lags some way behind the US and the UK in terms of the economic cycle and so the imponderables are even greater. The current year prospects for Germany, in particular, are still the subject of sharp downgradings and any renewed growth in 1994, if it occurs at all, it is expected to be modest. On the face of it, therefore, it looks like the second half of the year is going to be quiet. There are no obvious big opportunities; just early signs of potential pitfalls. But, no doubt, contrarian investors would argue that such widespread malaise is a sure indicator of dramatic market behaviour to come.

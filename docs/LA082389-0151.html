Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CAN'T HOST SOCCER GAME, CHILE TOLD  </P> <P> FIFA, world soccer's ruling body, rejected an appeal today by Chile to let it  host a crucial World Cup qualifying match against Venezuela and ruled the match  should be played in Argentina. A FIFA communique said the match on Sunday will  take place in Mendoza.  </P> <P> Chile's soccer association appealed to FIFA on Tuesday to overturn its ban on  the country hosting the Venezuela match.  </P> <P> FIFA imposed the suspension last Friday as one of a number of sanctions  following disturbances at the Aug. 13 match between Chile and Brazil at the  capital's stadium. The FIFA communique said charges against the Chilean  association included poor organization of the game, during which home fans  threw objects at the visiting team, the referee and linesmen.  </P></p>

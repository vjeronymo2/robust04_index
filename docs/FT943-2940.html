			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / The battle for the forecourt: European carmakers fear the consequences if their exclusive dealer networks are reformed European carmakers go to the barricades next week in a last-ditch effort to protect their privileged exclusive dealer networks across Europe. For several months they have been locked in a lobbying battle in Brussels against the plans of the European Commission's competition directorate for liberalising the continental car market. At stake is reform of the so-called block exemption, which was granted to the European motor industry for 10 years in 1985, and which allows carmakers to operate selective and exclusive distribution systems in contravention of European competition rules. The exemption expires at the end of June 1995, and next week the 17 European commissioners are due to decide how radical a dose of reform should be imposed on the carmakers. Behind the issue are sharply contrasting visions of how cars should be sold and serviced in Europe. Is the consumer best served by the dedicated exclusive dealerships allowed under the present system? Or should the dealer networks be exposed to another order of competition, with multi-franchising  -the sale of competing brands on the same site? This could offer customers a wider choice in one location, while independent service garages would gain access to the carmakers' closely guarded technical information and exclusive parts business. A firm proposal for the new motor industry regime will be published shortly after next week's meeting of the Commission. Following consultation with governments and the opposing ranks of the car producers and European consumer organisations, the terms of a new block exemption should be set before the end of the year. Battle has already raged on this issue in Brussels for several months: the competition directorate's first draft for a new block exemption was leaked to the motoring press in May. The competition mandarins did not pull their punches. In an 'explanatory note' they claimed that 'the experience acquired over the last 10 years shows that this regulation has not contributed in any significant way to either the opening up of national markets or the development of flexible and efficient structures in the distribution of cars and spares'. The block exemption had to be revised in order to 'remedy these defects and stimulate competition'. The competition directorate led by Mr Karel van Miert suggested reforms to ensure that dealers - in the main small and medium-sized businesses  - have greater commercial independence from the manufacturers. Big publicly quoted dealer groups such as those familiar in the UK are virtually unknown in continental Europe. Access for independent producers and distributors of spare parts to the carmakers' dealer outlets should be facilitated, and the consumer's position improved, said the draft. The carmakers were incensed by the proposed reforms. They argue that the present regulation, far from stifling competition, guarantees it; and that what the industry needs above all is stability as it fights to restructure and regain world competitiveness against Japanese and newly resurgent US rivals. 'There are those who wish, in particular within the Commission, to subject this industry to an unprecedented and arbitrary experiment . . . (and) undermine the whole foundation of automobile distribution in Europe,' says Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of the Fiat group and president of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea). The campaign for reform has been led by consumer groups. Mr Jim Murray, director of the Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc), says the block exemption has been 'an unmitigated disaster for consumers.' Beuc accepts the need for competent, trained personnel to carry out garage servicing - the notion of 'selectivity' allowed in the current regulation. But it claims there is 'no basis whatsoever' for allowing manufacturers to operate 'exclusive' as well as selective distribution systems - that is, to limit the number of outlets on a geographic basis, and to restrict those outlets from stocking more than one brand. 'Why shouldn't new car buyers have the chance to compare different brands at a single outlet?' asks Mr Murray. 'This is the sort of consumer-friendly distribution we would like to see in place after 1995.' The consumer lobby argues that the exclusive system shields dealerships from competition and is not needed to maintain standards. 'We accept that standards should be set for safety, for technical expertise, training and solvency, but we don't need exclusivity to set these standards,' says Mr Murray. 'Standards should be set for all motor dealers and there should then be free competition between all dealers who meet these standards.' Beuc also complains that the block exemption as currently operated interferes with the single market. It points out that the original regulation of 1985 was granted on condition that new car prices across Europe should not diverge beyond a range of 12 per cent in the long term and 18 per cent for periods of less than one year, and that individual consumers in one member state should be free to buy cars from another. On both counts the block exemption has failed, it claims. The most recent car price study by the Commission, published this summer, showed that 22.5 per cent of the models produced by European manufacturers had price differentials of more than 20 per cent. As far as cross-border car-buying is concerned, Beuc claims that consumers who try to buy cars abroad meet with enormous difficulties, both from dealers and carmakers and from institutional barriers. It is a long catalogue of woes, but the carmakers have mounted a heavy lobbying effort to counter the consumers' arguments, with the industry directorate headed by Mr Martin Bangemann acting as a willing ally inside the Commission. The defence offered by Acea centres on the theme that cars cannot be distributed like washing machines or food. The carmakers claim that the competition directorate has provided 'no factual evidence whatsoever' to support the case for radical reforms. Competition has increased greatly during the last 10 years, says Mr Rudolf Beger, Acea executive secretary. Between 1986 and 1993 the number of car brands sold on the German market jumped by 50 per cent from 44 to 66. The number of models and versions sold in France has risen by 47 per cent from 515 in 1986 to 758 in 1993. In the after-sales and service market, competition has also grown significantly with independent chains for easy repairs such as Speedy, Midas and Kwik-Fit. According to BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, independent repairers already control 48 per cent of the BMW service market in Germany and 52 per cent in Italy. Acea claims that its independent research shows that customer satisfaction in the automobile industry has reached a very high level. German car owners, for example, are said to be among the most satisfied consumers - well ahead of users of airlines, travel agents, hi-fi shops, hospitals or television stations. What is more, surveys in the US show that customer satisfaction with conventional one-make dealers is consistently higher than with dealerships selling various brands, says Mr Beger. The carmakers argue that prices for consumer goods for which there is no selective distribution differ often by more than 100 per cent from one European country to another - much more than car prices. In any case, exchange rate fluctuations are the biggest cause of diverging car prices, not selective distribution, they say. As for cross-border car-buying, Acea says that it is already happening. Following the devaluation of the Italian lira, Acea estimates that 150,000 to 200,000 cars were re-exported from Italy last year. The argument over block exemption is strident, but there is much at stake. Over the next 10 years a typical volume carmaker will invest around Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.7bn) in its distribution system. With most new cars reaching the same high standards of quality and reliability, service at the dealership is increasingly being seen by carmakers as the new frontier for competition. The question the Commission must answer in the coming weeks is what rules will apply on the forecourt for the next 10 years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- European cars: the single market remains elusive  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Competition ..

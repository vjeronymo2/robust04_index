			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 14 ARRESTED IN STING OF ILLEGAL CONTRACTORS IN HIGH DESERT;  </P> <P> PALMDALE: INVESTIGATORS FOR THE LICENSING BOARD POSED AS PROPERTY OWNERS. ANGRY  LICENSED CONTRACTORS PROVIDED THE STATE WITH THEIR COMPETITORS' NAMES.  </P> <P> Investigators for the Contractors State Licensing Board conducting an  undercover "sting" lured 14 masons and landscapers to a house in Palmdale this  week on the pretext of hiring them, then arrested them for working without a  contractor's license.  </P> <P> The investigators targeted workers whose names were provided by licensed  contractors angry at being underbid by unlicensed competitors, said an official  of the state licensing board.  </P> <P> "They are tired of losing jobs to these individuals," said Dennis Bishop,  supervising deputy of the board's unlicensed activity unit. "They operate on a  little lower monetary level as far as their bids are concerned."  </P> <P> The unit, formed in October, 1989, has conducted 15 similar undercover  operations in the Southern California area this year, Bishop said. The  operation in Palmdale netted the largest number of arrests in the unit's  history, and was the first in the Antelope Valley, where the booming  construction business attracts unlicensed contractors.  </P> <P> In the Palmdale sting, investigators took names and phone numbers they received  from irate licensed contractors in the area, and made 21 appointments over a  three-day period, from Tuesday to Thursday, at a house borrowed for the  operation. When a contractor arrived, one of the investigators posing as the  owner described landscaping or masonry work he wanted done, and the contractor  made a bid on the job.  </P> <P> "We ask them for a contract, and they write it up," Bishop said. When the  contractor was unable to provide a license number, he was placed under arrest  by one of two members of the unit who are sworn peace officers.  </P> <P> Some of the contractors provided false numbers, which the investigators easily  identified by checking records in Sacramento by phone.  </P> <P> Unlicensed contractors can work for less because they usually pay their  employees in cash, and often do not pay taxes or have workers compensation  insurance, Bishop said. The consumer may lose in the long run, he said, because  the licensing board can make a contractor redo a shoddy job, but the only  recourse against unlicensed contractors is to sue.  </P> <P> In addition, because many unlicensed contractors have no workers compensation  insurance, the homeowner becomes liable for injuries to the workers.  </P> <P> Contracting industry spokesmen praised the board for the crackdown.  </P> <P> "The unlicensed people are part of the underground economy," said Mike Leeson,  executive vice president of the American Building Contractors Assn., noting  that they are not required to pay many of the fees or post the $5,000 bond  licensed contractors must shoulder. "They're the scum of the earth."  </P> <P> "It's not that unlicensed people are bad people, because some of them really do  nice work," said Dave Burwell, vice president of the High Desert Chapter of the  California Landscaping Contractors Assn. But, he added, "most people that are  involved in landscape scams do not have a license."  </P> <P> The 14 arrested, who face fines of up to $1,000 and up to a year in jail, were  released on their own recognizance and will be arraigned in Antelope Valley  Municipal Court on Jan. 3 and 4.  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: US drug groups suffer setbacks WARNER-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals company, disappointed Wall Street with a 5 per cent fall in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 155.9m or Dollars 1.16 a share, against Dollars 164.6m or Dollars 1.22 a year earlier. Its shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 . Upjohn, another big drugs group, posted a third-quarter loss and is cutting 1,500 jobs. Warner-Lambert's sales rose to Dollars 1.49bn in the quarter from Dollars 1.44bn. The company blamed previously disclosed regulatory issues involving its manufacturing operations and broader-based industry pressures for its earnings decline. Warner-Lambert has run into trouble with the Food and Drug Administration over record keeping and other violations at its manufacturing plants, especially in Puerto Rico. Manufacturing difficulties have cost it about Dollars 150m in lost sales this year. Mr Arvind Desai, an analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said the poor results also reflected intensifying generic competition for the company's Lopid cholesterol-reducing agent. The company predicted flat earnings for the whole of 1993 of about Dollars 4.78 a share. Upjohn suffered a third quarter deficit of Dollars 30m, or 19 cents, including restructuring charges of Dollars 183m. A year earlier it earned Dollars 131m, or 73 cents, including one-time charges of Dollars 15m. It is cutting about 1,500 jobs worldwide, eliminating or reducing manufacturing capacity and writing-down certain intangible assets as well as increasing its liability reserves. Excluding one-time items, net income rose 5 per cent in the quarter. Sales edged 1 per cent higher to Dollars 900m.</p>

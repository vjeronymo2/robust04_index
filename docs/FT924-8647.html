			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Hanson threatens to sue Costain HANSON, the large Anglo-US conglomerate, last night threatened to sue Costain after the UK construction group announced it was accepting a higher offer for its profitable Australian coal mining business. Costain said Altus Finance, part of Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, had agreed to pay USDollars 245m (Pounds 158m) for the coal mining business and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property interests. Costain had agreed to sell only the New South Wales coal-mining operation for USDollars 200m to Peabody Coal, a Hanson subsidiary. Mr Irl Engelhardt, president of Peabody, the world's second largest private coal producer, said: 'We are consulting our legal advisers on this. Peabody has acted in good faith and we have an enforceable contract.' It is the second time in less than two weeks Hanson has been trumped. The group last week pulled out of its Pounds 790m offer for Ranks Hovis McDougall after Tomkins, a rival British conglomerate, bid Pounds 935m for the UK milling, baking and grocery products group. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive of the British construction group, yesterday denied the company had broken the terms of the agreement with Peabody announced three weeks ago. He said: 'Under the sale agreement we were permitted to consider a subsequent unsolicited offer, if this was considered by our legal advisers to be in the best interest of our shareholders. We can understand Hanson's disappointment but we have a duty to look after our shareholders first.' Hanson claims the Altus offer resulted from talks begun before the Peabody deal was announced. Altus will take over borrowings of ADollars 120m (Pounds 54m) making the deal worth more than Pounds 200m to Costain which needs to reduce its borrowings. Costain said the offer, after expenses, was worth Pounds 26m more than the offer from Peabody. Part of the increase was due to a better offer for its coal mines. Altus, which controls a Pounds 1.6bn portfolio of financial and industrial holdings, has been seeking to diversify away from financial investments. It is 67 per cent owned by Credit Lyonnais and 32 per cent by Thomson-CSF, the French state defence group. Lex, Page 22; Observer, Page 21</p>

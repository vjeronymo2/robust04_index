			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (I) Resilient flooring material including associated mastic and backing shall be assumed to be asbestos-containing unless an industrial hygienist determines that it is asbestos-free using recognized analytical techniques. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For removing roofing material which contains ACM the employer shall ensure that the following work practices are followed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Roofing material shall be removed in an intact state to the extent feasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Wet methods shall be used where feasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Cutting machines shall be continuously misted during use, unless a competent person determines that misting substantially decreases worker safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) All loose dust left by the sawing operation must be HEPA vacuumed immediately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Unwrapped or unbagged roofing material shall be immediately lowered to the ground via covered, dust-tight chute, crane or hoist, or placed in an impermeable waste bag or wrapped in plastic sheeting and lowered to ground no later than the end of the work shift. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) Upon being lowered, unwrapped material shall be transferred to a closed receptacle in such manner so as to preclude the dispersion of dust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) Roof level heating and ventilation air intake sources shall be isolated or the ventilation system shall be shut down. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) When removing cementitious asbestos-containing siding and shingles or transite panels containing ACM, the employer shall ensure that the following work practices are followed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Cutting, abrading or breaking siding, shingles, or transite panels, shall be prohibited unless the employer can demonstrate that methods less likely to result in asbestos fiber release cannot be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Each panel or shingle shall be sprayed with amended water prior to removal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Unwrapped or unbagged panels or shingles shall be immediately lowered to the ground via covered dust-tight chute, crane or hoist, or placed in an impervious waste bag or wrapped in plastic sheeting and lowered to the ground no later than the end of the work shift. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Nails shall be cut with flat, sharp instruments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) When removing gaskets containing ACM, the employer shall ensure that the following work practices are followed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If a gasket is visibly deteriorated and unlikely to be removed intact, removal shall be undertaken within a glovebag as described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The gasket shall be thoroughly wetted with amended water prior to its removal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The wet gasket shall be immediately placed in a disposal container. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Any scraping to remove residue must be performed wet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) When performing any other Class II removal of asbestos containing material for which specific controls have not been listed in paragraph (g)(8)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section, the employer shall ensure that the following work practices are complied with. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The material shall be thoroughly wetted with amended water prior and during its removal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The material shall be removed in an intact state unless the employer demonstrates that intact removal is not possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Cutting, abrading or breaking the material shall be prohibited unless the employer can demonstrate that methods less likely to result in asbestos fiber release are not feasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Asbestos-containing material removed, shall be immediately bagged or wrapped, or kept wetted until transferred to a closed receptacle, no later than the end of the work shift. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Alternative Work Practices and Controls. Instead of the work practices and controls listed in paragraph (g)(8) (i) through (v) of this section, the employer may use different or modified engineering and work practice controls if the following provisions are complied with. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The employer shall demonstrate by data representing employee exposure during the use of such method under conditions which closely resemble the conditions under which the method is to be used, that employee exposure will not exceed the PELs under any anticipated circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) A competent person shall evaluate the work area, the projected work practices and the engineering controls, and shall certify in writing, that the different or modified controls are adequate to reduce direct and indirect employee exposure to below the PELs under all expected conditions of use and that the method meets the requirements of this standard. The evaluation shall include and be based on data representing employee exposure during the use of such method under conditions which closely resemble the conditions under which the method is to be used for the current job, and by employees whose training and experience are equivalent to employees who are to perform the current job. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class III asbestos work. Class III asbestos work shall be conducted using engineering and work practice controls which minimize the exposure to employees performing the asbestos work and to bystander employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The work shall be performed using wet methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) To the extent feasible, the work shall be performed using local exhaust ventilation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Where the disturbance involves drilling, cutting, abrading, sanding, chipping, breaking, or sawing of thermal system insulation or surfacing material, the employer shall use impermeable dropcloths, and shall isolate the operation using mini-enclosures or glove bag systems pursuant to paragraph (g)(5) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

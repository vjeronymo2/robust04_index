			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dutch group buys H&amp;C food units for Pounds 81.6m BolsWessanen, the Dutch food and drinks company, yesterday captured 10 per cent of the growing Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.51bn) European breakfast cereals market with the purchase of UK and French food units for Pounds 81.6m from Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the UK conglomerate. BolsWessanen is buying Telford Foods and H&amp;C Cereales, suppliers of own-label corn flakes, rice crispies and other cereals to supermarkets in the UK and France. The group is paying H&amp;C Pounds 74.4m in cash and taking on Pounds 7.2m in debt. The deal will give the Dutch company about 50 per cent of the European market for private label breakfast cereals, estimated to be worth about Pounds 200m a year at factory prices. The Dutch company's existing business claims about 4 per cent of the European market for breakfast cereals. Sales of the enlarged company were expected to total about Fl 300m (Dollars 167m) a year. Cereals operations have performed well for H&amp;C and heavy investment has helped the division win substantial business in the private label market in the UK and France. The UK is the largest single European market for breakfast cereals, consuming about 57 per cent of the 675,000 tonnes eaten every year, or about 7kg per person. However, the potential for own-label breakfast cereal in Europe has attracted increasing competition and led to the beginnings of a price war. This was a factor in H&amp;C's decision to sell the business, said Mr George Paul, chairman. H&amp;C has raised more than Pounds 250m through disposals in the last month, following the sale in July of its Indonesian plantations for Dollars 273m. Yesterday's disposal is expected to dilute H&amp;C's earnings, although this would be slightly offset by the tax position, the group said. H&amp;C is likely to finish this year with net cash for the first time in many years. H&amp;C is expected to seek acquisitions in the UK to build up its chemicals and building supplies businesses.</p>

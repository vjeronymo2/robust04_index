As a plant spokesman has reported to Interfax, the reactor  disconnected after the safety system was effected by the  separation of two circular pumps, supplying water to cool off a  turbine capacitor.    In his words, to bring down pressure, steam was released  into  the atmosphere from pipelines, and the discharge was accompanied  by persistent noise. He described the incident as not being  dangerous for the plant's personnel or the environment.    An investigation is underway. The level of radiation at the  nuclear plant has not changed.    As has been reported, the station's third reactor was  switched off at 13:37 local time on Monday by the warning safety  device but was switched on again five hours later.</p>

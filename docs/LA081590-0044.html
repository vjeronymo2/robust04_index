			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLITICAL COMMITTEE PAYS $300 FINE UNDER  PROTEST  </P> <P> A small Torrance political action committee has paid a $300 city fine for  failing to file campaign finance reports, but leaders of the group say they  believe the city clerk should have notified them of the filing rules.  </P> <P> Frank Rizzardi, treasurer of the Protect Our Property Committee, said he paid  the fine last week.  </P> <P> "We paid the $300 because we have not been notified of an appeal process, and,  second, we don't have the money to hire an attorney," he said.  </P> <P> City Councilman Bill Applegate complained this spring that he could not find  any city records on Protect Our Property, which had excluded his name from an  endorsement letter issued during the city March election campaign. The city  clerk's office, after a review, concluded the group had last filed a report in  1986.  </P></p>

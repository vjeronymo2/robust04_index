			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / US lawyer acquitted on BCCI fraud charges: Justice Department to consider reviving federal case against Altman US JUSTICE Department investigators will meet this week to consider reviving charges of bank fraud over the BCCI affair after the collapse of the case against Washington lawyer Mr Robert Altman. He was acquitted on Saturday in a New York state court of charges that he helped the now-collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International to gain secret control illegally of a US bank. The federal charges against Mr Altman and his colleague, Mr Clark Clifford, the 86-year-old former US defence secretary who did not stand trial in New York because of ill health, were dismissed earlier this year at the request of the Justice Department, which did not want its case to interfere with the state prosecution. Legal experts, however, believe that the failure of New York prosectors to convict Mr Altman on eight fraud and bribery charges would make it difficult for the federal government to revive its own charges, which were similar to those brought in the New York case. The acquittal on Saturday was a serious blow to Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney who has spent three years investigating the complex web of BCCI's activities in the US and abroad. He has won three convictions related to the banking scandal with hundreds of millions of dollars of fines levied. But the Altman case was the centrepiece of his investigations. In the US, the leadership on investigating BCCI came from Mr Morgenthau, partly because the Bush administration's Justice Department had been slow in pursuing the case. On Saturday, Mr Morgenthau said that in spite of the verdict his office's investigation of BCCI would continue. The case had begun to go Mr Altman's way last month, when the trial judge dismissed four of the eight criminal charges against him because of a lack of evidence. After the jury delivered its verdict Mr Altman said the case should never have been tried: 'The government put on a five-month trial, and we put on a five-minute defence. There was absolutely no merit to this.' Mr Altman, who still faces civil actions relating to the BCCI scandal, insisted that neither he nor Mr Clifford knew that BCCI had secretly gained control of the Washington-based banking group First American. Mr Altman and Mr Clifford were both senior officers of First American. Jurors said after the trial ended that the prosecution had not presented enough evidence to convince them of Mr Altman's guilt. They also said the defence had undermined the credibility of prosecution witnesses. Defence lawyers argued in their closing statements that Mr Altman was being used as a scapegoat by banking regulators to cover up their own failure to uncover BCCI's illegal ownership of First American. At the time that federal charges were dismissed, government officials reserved the right to file the same, or even tougher, charges against the two lawyers if the state trial did not lead to a 'successful conclusion'. Yesterday, a Justice Department spokeswoman said Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, would make the final decision. A number of key BCCI figures who have been indicted in the US, including Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former BCCI chief executive, are in Abu Dhabi or elsewhere, beyond the reach of US prosecutors.

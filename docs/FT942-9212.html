			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chelsfield increases stake in Merry Hill shopping centre Chelsfield, the property company headed by Mr Elliott Bernerd, has increased its holding in the Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The company, which bought the scheme in partnership with Saudi Arabian investors, has paid Pounds 7.1m cash and extended a shareholder loan to increase its stake. The centre, which was purchased for Pounds 128m last September, has been revalued at Pounds 185m, reflecting increased rental income from the project and the uplift in the property investment market. Situated in Dudley, it is one of the four largest shopping centres in the UK, comprising some 1.4m sq ft of covered shopping mall space and approximately 400,000 sq ft of retail warehousing. The centre's annual rent roll is expected to reach Pounds 16m by the end of this year. Senior lenders to the project, which originally made a Pounds 90m 10 year senior loan, have agreed to extend additional facilities which will replace a Pounds 19m mezzanine loan, which was formerly guaranteed by the Saudi Arabian investors. Chelsfield also announced yesterday the acquisition of a 50 per cent interest in St Catherine's House in central London. The company has bought its 50 per stake in the building through a joint venture company, formed with a private German investor, for Pounds 35m.</p>

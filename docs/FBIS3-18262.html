			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ZDF Political Barometer: `Danger of </F> Losses Increases for the FDP'"]    [Text] In view of the current critical economic situation,  the readiness for reducing demands in wage negotiations is very  high in Germany, and support for possible strikes is only weak.  This has been revealed by the February poll of the Mannheim  research group dealing with elections. It was carried out among  2,000 citizens in the east and west for the political barometer  of the ZDF. A total of 82 percent of Germans in the old and 76  percent in the new laender believe that wage increases should be  renounced at present if jobs can be saved in this way; 13  percent of west Germans and 20 percent of east Germans favored  wage increases irrespective of the impact on the labor market.  <H5>  Against Strikes </H5>   Against this backdrop, little support for strikes in the  metal working industry is noticeable in the west (in the east,  the question was not asked for reasons of time): Only 25  percent would approve of efforts by the trade unions to achieve  their demands through strikes; 70 percent opposse it. This  clear rejection is noticeable among supporters of all parties.  At 42 percent, the largest degree of approval of strikes has  been observed among Green voters.    The general political atmosphere has changed in different  ways in eastern and western Germany in February. Above all, it  is remarkable that the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]  has for the first time since the 1990 Bundestag elections  dropped below the 5-percent mark in both eastern and western  Germany. The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union  [CDU/CSU] is clearly winning support in western Germany but  losing in eastern Germany. Nationwide, it would receive 35  percent (4 percent more than in January). For the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the mood in the east and west  has deteriorated. It has lost 2 percent and stands now at 42  percent. The FDP can rely on 4 percent (- 1 percent).  Alliance 90/The Greens are losing slightly in the west and  clearly winning in the east. At present, they can rely on 11  percent support (+ 1 percent). All the other parties together  received 9 percent (- 1 percent), including the Republikaner at  an unchanged 2 percent and the Party of Democratic Socialism  [PDS] at 4 percent, as in January.    These figures represent the current political mood in  Germany. If a new Bundestag were elected at this point, the  German citizens would attach more significance to long-term  fundamental political convictions. Without taking into  consideration the current mood, the question "For which party  would you vote if the Bundestag elections were held next  Sunday," revealed the following picture: CDU/CSU 37 percent  (+ 1 percent), SPD 39 percent (no change), FDP 6 percent (no  change), Alliance 90/The Greens 9 percent (- 1 percent), and  other parties 9 percent (no change), including the Republikaner  at 4 and the PDS at 3 percent. Thus, at 48 percent, a coalition  between the SPD and the Greens would enjoy a parliamentary  majority in February.  <H5>  Good Rating for Bluem </H5>   Satisfaction with the work of the government further  increased in eastern and western Germany -- measured on the  basis of a scale reaching from + 5 (very satisfied) to - 5  (very dissatisfied): Figures improved from - 1.2 in December  to - 1.0 in January and to - 0.9 at present. The achievements  of the SPD as opposition in Bonn, however, showed a less  favorable trend -- 0.2 in December 1993, 0.1 in January, and 0.0  in February.    Not only the government but the chancellor personally are  being assessed better than four weeks ago. Nationwide, Helmut  Kohl received a rating of - 0.3 following - 0.4 in January.  Norbert Bluem also improved his rating -- from 0.5 to 0.6. The  overall assessment of Theo Waigel has clearly deteriorated --  from - 0.4 to - 0.7, and that of Wolfgang Schaeuble from 1.0  to 0.7. The rating for Rita Suessmuth has slightly deteriorated  from 1.0 to 0.9.  <H5>  Little Sympathy for Rau </H5>   Klaus Kinkel received 0.4 percent (0.5 percent in January).  Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whom the population still considers one  of the most important German politicians, was the most popular  figure in eastern and western Germany in February: He scored  2.5 percent (after 2.6 in January).    Rudolf Scharping's popularity has again declined slightly  (December 1.3 percent, January 1.1 percent, February 1.0  percent). Johannes Rau suffered a severe setback: His rating  declined from 1.9 to 1.4. The approval rating for Regine  Hildebrandt, the Social Democrat minister from Brandenburg, who  is only known to 57 percent of the population, deteriorated  slightly from 1.7 in January to 1.6 in February.    Who should be chancellor of Germany? The share of those who  would like to leave everything unchanged has again increased in  February. In December, 31 percent wanted Helmut Kohl to head  the government, in January 34 percent, and in February 36  percent. However, the majority still voted in favor of his  challenger Rudolf Scharping. The number of those who do not  know has further decreased from 18 percent in December to 15  percent in January and 13 percent in February. Support for  Scharping is clearly greater in the east than in the west. For  Kohl, it is the other way round.    When asked about the desired president, the population  prefers Johannes Rau after the official nomination of Roman  Herzog as the candidate of the CDU/CSU: A total of 25 percent  would like him to succeed Richard von Weizsaecker; 12 percent  support Roman Herzog and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and 5 percent  Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. Every third German is still undecided  on this issue.    The general economic situation in eastern Germany was  assessed slightly worse in February than in January: A total of  54 percent (52 percent in January) consider the situation bad;  43 percent believe that it is partly good and partly bad, and 3  percent think that it is good. As far as competence for a  solution to the economic problems in eastern Germany is  concerned, an SPD-led government is considered clearly more  capable of achieving that than the present coalition. A total  of 35 percent of east Germans consider the Social Democrats more  capable of overcoming the crisis; 21 percent trust in the  present government, and 11 percent assess both as the same. Yet  nearly a third (32 percent) do not think anything of this  alternative.  <H5>  Bad Marks for the European Union </H5>   A far-reaching adaptation of living conditions in the east  to  the level of the western laender has so far not been achieved in  the view of the population (91 percent). The assessment is  slightly more optimistic in the old laender. The west Germans  are also more confident about the question of when the  adaptation will largely be completed; 31 percent believe that a  maximum of five years will be required, 47 percent think that  this process will last five to 10 years, and 16 percent believe  that it will take even longer. In eastern Germany, every fifth  citizen expects the adaptation to be completed in five years'  time; 56 percent consider a period of five to 10 years  necessary, and 23 percent consider more than 10 years necessary.    Four months before the next European elections, a negative  assessment of the European Union prevails: Only 15 percent  believe that membership in the European Union brings more  advantages than disadvantages for the German population; 45  percent think that advantages and disadvantages outweigh each  other, but 35 percent see more disadvantages. In the east, the  assessment is even more unfavorable than in the west. Moreover,  most Germans (72 percent in the west and 73 percent in the east)  feel that they are not sufficiently informed about the European  Union.    In view of the skeptical assessment of the European Union,  the majority of Germans favor settling problems by individual  states. A total of 73 percent believe that, above all, the  governments of the individual countries should adopt measures to  curb unemployment. Those polled expressed similar preferences  concerning economic development: A total of 61 percent want the  government to deal with this issue. As far as the fight against  crime is concerned, 55 percent favor initiatives by their own  government. Only in the sphere of foreign and security policy  does a majority want a European-Union-wide solution.</p>

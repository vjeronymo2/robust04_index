			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Manufacturers' profits 'spurred by cheap finance' MOST of the restructuring undertaken by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980s, widely admired by their US and European competitors, failed to improve Japanese companies' profitability, according to a report published by the Bank of Japan. Much of the apparent improvement in Japanese companies' financial performance in the last decade was a reflection of cheap finance rather than improved efficiency, it says. The report casts doubt on one of the central tenets of manufacturing strategy in the 1980s widely adopted in the US and Europe, that Japanese industrial competitiveness was mainly a reflection of the flexibility and efficiency of Japanese factories. It says that Japanese companies must radically restructure to markedly improve the earning capacity of their core businesses. Japanese companies are not only facing a sharp downturn in their domestic market but also a steep rise in the cost of capital which could severely impair their financial performance. The Japanese approach to lean manufacturing has been widely followed by western manufacturers. It involves the rapid introduction of new models with a growing stress upon their design and technical sophistication to add value. Japanese electronics and automobile plants are designed with the flexibility to produce a wide range of models tailored to specific segments of the market. The Japanese shift to lean-manufacturing was widely thought to be the foundation for Japanese industrial competitiveness. But, according to the report: 'In the economic expansion phase from 1987, improved financial balances shrouded an ongoing decline in the earning capacities of core divisions. However, financial divisions are not likely to contribute to profit to any great extent and thus it is crucial that enterprises again revamp their earning capacity.' It says the improvement in Japanese companies' pre-tax profits to sales ratio in the last decade was mainly due to a fall in financial expenses reflecting the extremely low cost of capital during the late 1980s. The gradual fall in operating profit margins suggests that management efforts to rationalise production, add more value to products and move to small lot production of a greater diversity of production, has not improved enterprises' core earnings capacity. The report says companies will have to cut costs and revise their medium-term business plans to cope with higher financial costs.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] The U.S. Pentagon keeps offensive war materiel near  Cuba. The naval base in Guantanamo illegally occupied by  Washington, located in the eastern part of the island, is not  the only source of aggression.    The Cuban Parliament's International Relations Department  has  issued a report on the extent of U.S. military strength  maintained near the island of Cuba. The document, publicized by  PRENSA LATINA, notes that Cuba endures a partial military  blockade and that the decision to restore the U.S. Homestead Air  Force Base in Florida is an important part of this. In addition  to this installation, which has been refurbished after being  razed by a hurricane, there is an increased presence of  airplanes and growing air and naval activities in Key West, only  180 km from Cuba.    On the pretext of closely following the crisis in Haiti, the  Pentagon deployed approximately 60 warships near Cuba's eastern  tip. During the first two months of 1993 [year as heard] there  has been increased military surveillance of the island.    The U.S. military deployment near Cuba has been going on  since the triumph of the Revolution. But it is strange that it  has continued in spite of the events that climaxed in the  collapse of the Soviet Union. The allegation that Cuba  represented a threat because Moscow has become as anachronistic  as the economic blockade, which Washington also maintains in  spite of much criticism from both within and outside the United  States.    Well-known analysts have recommended an easing of the  military pressure on Cuba. One of these is (Donald Shultz), a  national security policy scholar who lectures at the Strategic  Studies Institute of the U.S. Army's War College. Last year, an  inter-American magazine that researches global affairs published  an article in which (Shultz) recommends that the White House  distance itself from extremist elements of the Cuban immigrant  community and promote measures, even military measures, that  display trust. (Shultz') advice has gone unheeded, at least as  far as the Pentagon is concerned. The same is true of the  economic blockade, which has been sustained and toughened, in  spite of growing criticism.    No wonder a Cuban parliamentary commission recently declared  that the way to resolve differences with the United States is to  create external conditions conducive to the freehanded  realization of the Cubans' social model.</p>

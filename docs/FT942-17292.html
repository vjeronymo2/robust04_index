			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Trade News: Information technology on EU-US agenda European business leaders and Commission officials meet their US counterparts today in an attempt to relieve tensions over market access and standardisation in the European and US information technology sectors, writes Gillian Tett in Brussels. The meeting, in New York, marks the Commission's first public attempt to consult US officials about its ambitious plans to develop an information network infrastructure in Europe, unveiled by Mr Jaques Delors, Commission president, last year. A working group of European industrialists, led by Mr Carlo de Benedetti and Viscount Etienne Davignon, are due to present proposals on financing and operating these highways to Brussels later this month. However, Commission officials admit progress is limited in their attempts to agree the type of common information technology standards necessary to develop any transatlantic or global information networks. Coming amid US complaints that European policy on IT telecommunications patents has been overly restrictive, standardisation is expected to be a key issue at today's meeting, Commission officials said.</p>

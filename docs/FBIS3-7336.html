			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-san: "The Method of Strength Does Not </F> Work on Us"]    [Text] The Korean peninsula is in a grave situation due to  U.S. imperialists' aggravating provocative maneuvers for a new  war. Following U.S. President Clinton's order given on 22 March  to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea and the announcement  that more than 40 missile launchers and an 800-member Patriot  battalion will be moved to South Korea, war conspiracies are  being plotted in the U.S. Defense Department everyday, and  corresponding actual fighting measures are being taken.    According to reports from Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary  Perry raved on 24 March that if the UN Security Council decides  to impose sanctions against our country, the United States will  send additional troops and weapons to South Korea.    Concurrently, the 25 March issue of the South Korean paper  CHOSON ILBO quoted U.S. military sources as saying that a plan  was being worked out by the U.S. military to hurl 600,000-strong  military strength including two Marine divisions, more than 200  warships, over 1,600 planes from the U.S. mainland within 80  days, repeat 80 days, in case of emergency on the Korean  peninsula.    Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Slocombe  said on 24 March at a hearing at the defense committee of the  U.S. Congress that U.S. carrier task fleets are in full  readiness for mobilization to cope with a possible contingency  on the Korean peninsula and the mobilization system of the U.S.  imperialist aggression forces in South Korea was under  reexamination. He raved that apart from the U.S. imperialist  aggression forces in South Korea, 22,000 U.S. Marine forces, an  Army special unit, and 50 each of the F-15C interceptor planes  and F-16 multipurpose fighters from the island of Okinawa in  Japan, and U.S. carrier military strength from Yokosuka port can  be mobilized additionally.    Facts show that the U.S. military is in a posture to take  military actions as soon as the UN Security Council takes  sanction measures. Due to the U.S. war maniacs, darker clouds  of war are approaching the Korean peninsula, and a dangerous  situation on the brink of war is being created.    This was the first time since the Korean War in 1950 that it  was reported the U.S. Marine forces, planes, and various  warships could be swept in herd to the Korean peninsula like a  pack of wolves.    The reason the world is watching the Korean peninsula with  grave concern is because it is considered that a new nuclear war  might erupt right here.    Currently, the United States is devising a sinister plot  to commit to the Korean war not only its elite force from its  mainland, but also the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces  occupying South Korea that are familiar with our country's  topography and most of the U.S. armed forces stationed in  Okinawa, Japan. Moreover, the heads of the U.S. military are  dispatching in advance its aircraft carriers and submarines to  places that will be favorable in their operations.    The U.S. Naval fleet consisted of 30 ships, and the  nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson have not only been  already mobilized near the waters of our country, but on 24  March the U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine, Birmingham  entered Yokosuka port.    On the surface, the United States is finding fault with us  by  saying that it is dissatisfied with the nuclear inspection on us  and so on, but this is only an excuse. In reality, the series  of military moves prove that the United States is expanding step  by step its oppressive strategy on Korea in accordance with the  war scenario it already wrote.    Moreover, what cannot be overlooked is the fact that reports  are being made that U.S. Defense Secretary Perry will crawl into  South Korea and Japan to personally examine and command  on-the-spot the conditions for promoting military operations.  Historically, this kind of act is carried out frequently on the  eve of war. Such was the case during the 1950 Korean war and  during the 1990 Persian Gulf war.    We are dealing with high vigilance over the fact that the  U.S. defense secretary is personally acting as the leader in  preparing to invade us. Currently the United States formed a  special strike force to revive the adventurous military  operation, which was carried out in Grenada and Panama, against  our republic.    However, the United States can by no means frighten our  people through this kind of barbarous operation and achieve its  goal. As we have repeatedly elucidated, we don't want war, but  we are by no means afraid of war. We are ready for both  dialogue and war.    The attempt to swallow us up is a foolish act of trying to  break a boulder deeply rooted in the center of the earth, with a  rotten egg. No one can touch our sacred territory and defame  our nation's dignity.    Those who enjoy fire die by being burnt without exception.  The United States must not carry out rash and thoughtless acts.  It will be favorable for the United States to correctly see who  it is dealing with and act rationally.</p>

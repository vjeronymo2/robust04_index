			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: CSO concerned with facts only Sir, Mr Boam (Letters, October 21) suggests that the Central Statistical Office is too gloomy about consultants' overseas earnings. The CSO is concerned with facts, not feelings or beliefs. We go out to nearly 4,000 consultancy firms to establish those facts and we have no reason to doubt the accuracy of our survey. We could only speculate at present on why Mr Boam's figures might be different, but we would be glad to look at whatever information he is able to provide on the basis of his survey. Martin Brand, Central Statistical Office, Government Buildings, Cardiff Road, Newport, Gwent NP9 1XG</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / People: Alexander Proudfoot Peter Isaac, European president of the management consultancy ALEXANDER PROUDFOOT, chaired by Lord Stevens of Ludgate, has left after 20 years with the group. The news broke yesterday, after an internal memo circulated in the company and jointly signed by Isaac and Proudfoot's chief executive, John Prosser, was leaked to the media. Proudfoot has been going through tough times recently; at its interim results in September it reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 5.6m. A spokesman for the company said yesterday that Isaac's departure was not connected with its recent financial problems. But the company's European business, which Isaacs took over in November 1992 when Prosser was made chief executive, has been performing poorly. Staff levels have been reduced from more than 1,500 a year ago to about 1,300 now, as part of a Pounds 15m a year cost-cutting programme. Neither Prosser nor Isaac was available for comment.</p>

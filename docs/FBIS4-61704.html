			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ukraine's People's Deputy Volodymyr Mefodiyovych </F> Pylypchuk, member of the Ukrainian Supreme Council Presidium and  chairman of the Commission for Issues of Economic Reform and  National Economy Management: "Does the Donbass Experiment Have  a Chance?"]    [Text] I must say that I would use the accountant's  approach here. An accountant always estimates what is positive  and what negative in a project and then comes up with a balance.  I do not see anything positive about this experiment. Suppose  a federalization had taken place and Ukraine's Donbass had been  left to develop its own economy, either federal or  state-controlled. Then the question would arise in Kiev, or in  the state: Where to purchase coal? In Russia, where it is  dozens of times cheaper, or in Donbass. You would, of course,  say in Russia.    Let us imagine that Donbass had joined Russia, as the  separatists want. Let us imagine for a moment that this had  taken place, although this cannot happen without bloodshed.  Have you imagined it? In Russia, coal is dozens of times  cheaper than that extracted in Donbass, and the difference is  even greater now -- even today, dozens of Russian coal mines are  going bankrupt, because there are no markets. Tell me, whose  coal would Russia buy? Donbass coal, which is dozens of times  more expensive than Russia's? You cannot tell businessmen what  to purchase -- they choose the coal and foodstuffs that are  cheaper. Who can now say what would happen to Donbass in such a  case? Today, Ukraine purchases Donetsk coal, because Donbass is  our region, and we must support its existence, no matter what  prices they set; we even allow them to be monopolists. If  Donbass joins the Russian Federation economically or even  administratively, Russia will not buy its coal, because it is  too expensive. Ukraine will not purchase it, as it will prefer  Russian or Polish coal. What will happen to the people?  Between 5 and 7 million people will be left without means for  subsistence. Is this an advantage?    Second. No single state gives away territories voluntarily;  and Ukraine will not give away Donbass. There are examples. It  is already the seventh year that the war has been going on in  Karabakh. Have the warring sides made any breakthroughs? No.  How many human lives have been lost?! The same here. If  somebody in Donbass tries, on the quiet of the experiment, to  separate and draw a new border between Ukraine and Russia, this  border will be washed with blood, and much blood.    In this connection, I would like to appeal to normal people,  residents of Donbass: Restrain those who are firing up your  territory. It does not matter who does this; the same applies  to the Crimea. Either pro-Russian or pro-Ukrainian forces,  chauvinists, or nationalists -- one spark would suffice to set  this territory on fire. You must come to your senses and stop  those who are looking for trouble.</p>

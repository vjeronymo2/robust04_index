			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> 2 RESIDENTS BILKED OF MONEY IN SCAMS  </P> <P> Two Santa Paula residents have lost money in a scam in which victims are  approached by someone appearing to be sick or lost, Santa Paula police said.  </P> <P> The first scam occurred Sept. 22 when a Santa Paula woman was approached by a  woman who claimed to be ill. A man then offered to help, and after a period of  time, the conversation turned to money. The victim was escorted to Santa Paula  Savings &amp; Loan, where she made a bank withdrawal and gave the undisclosed  amount of money to the couple.  </P> <P> On Oct. 5, an elderly man was approached by two men who said they were lost.  The two gained the confidence of the victim and persuaded him to withdraw money  from his bank account, saying they would use their vehicle as collateral. The  men disappeared after receiving the money. Police did not disclose how much  money was taken.  </P> <P> A Santa Paula woman was approached Oct. 19 by a woman who said she was lost. A  man offered assistance, and the conversation soon turned to money and the  woman's bank account. The intended victim became suspicious, however, and  walked away from the pair.  </P> <P> On Monday, a Santa Paula woman received a telephone call from someone claiming  to be from her bank. The woman was told that an unlawful withdrawal had been  made from her account and the bank would send a representative to take her to  the bank to clear up the matter.  </P> <P> The woman said that no one came to her house, so she called the bank and was  told no one had called her. She then began looking through her bank statements  and found her most recent statement missing. She believes the statement was  taken from her mailbox, police said.  </P> <P> Santa Paula police are seeking information about the suspects. GERRY BRAILO  SPENCER  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE, GAYS PATROL VIOLENCE-PRONE AREA  </P> <P> It was an uncommon sight, reflecting an uncommon partnership: Three police  officers and about 14 gay men, most clad in leather, together walking the dimly  lit streets of Silver Lake.  </P> <P> The two groups collaborated Friday night to patrol the community's gay bars,  which homosexuals complain are common sites for "gay-bashing," violence against  homosexuals because of their sexual orientation. Police and gay community  leaders say they hope it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.  </P> <P> Or a friendship, period.  </P> <P> "I definitely think it represents progress," said Mark Haskins, an organizer of  the Silverlake Neighborhood Action Patrol (SNAP), a 1-year-old, struggling  effort to deploy volunteer patrollers about once a month in hopes of curbing  gay-bashing. "It's two groups that have a history of adversarial relationships,  going into a new era of commitment to licking the problem of gay-bashing."  </P> <P> Friday night's foot patrol marked the first time in Silver Lake that police and  gay activists have directly joined forces to address attacks on homosexuals.  Northeast Division police officers accompanied SNAP volunteers on a late-night  trek through Sunset Junction, a graffiti-scarred area around Sunset, Santa  Monica and Griffith Park boulevards and Fountain Avenue.  </P> <P> Bill Capobianco formed SNAP in February, 1989, after a homosexual employee of  his Silver Lake clothes store was beaten after leaving a bar.  </P> <P> In the beginning, the patrol was heavily supported and volunteers walked the  streets every weekend, said Capobianco. But after a few months, support waned.  And last year, after one patrol was shot at with an air gun that shoots paint  balls -- usually used with protective clothing in mock war games -- and another  was harassed by a gang, volunteers became less willing to participate.  </P> <P> Now, many volunteers, including Haskins, say they will not patrol Silver Lake  unless police accompany the group.  </P> <P> The patrons of Sunset Junction's five bars say they long have been the target  of assaults, verbal abuse, intimidation or derogatory graffiti. One study shows  such incidents may be on the rise. The Los Angeles County Commission on Human  Rights, in a report released in February, recorded 86 hate crimes last year  against homosexuals. That number was up 41% from 1988, and two-thirds of the  incidents involved assaults, the study found.  </P> <P> Most gay advocates said even that number is conservative, because many  incidents are never reported to authorities. The Gay and Lesbian Community  Services Center in Hollywood, which operates a hot line for gay-bashing  victims, last year received about 170 complaints. Many of those involved  incidents in Silver Lake, center officials said, but they could not give  specific figures.  </P> <P> However, "gay-bashing" is an elusive subject, difficult to define or quantify.  About one-third of the incidents reported to the gay and lesbian center were  complaints about police who homosexuals considered overzealous in their patrols  of gay bars for health and safety violations.  </P> <P> Northeast Division police, on the other hand, do not perceive gay-bashing as a  major problem.  </P> <P> Officer Ben Lee, whose beat includes the Sunset Junction area, said he cannot  remember the last time he received a gay-bashing complaint.  </P> <P> In fact, police seldom receive complaints about the Silver Lake bars, he said,  and generally leave them alone. "They pretty much take care of their own and  kind of police themselves," Lee said.  </P> <P> "The only reports I get," he said, are complaints from homeowners about  homosexuals "cruising in cars or walking around in neighborhoods after the bars  close."  </P> <P> Northeast Division officers are instructed to make a note on their reports any  time racial or sexual hatred is a motive in a crime.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen a huge number of those incidents occurring," said Detective Rob  Watters, who reviews those reports. "I think there was one I was aware of in  the last six months. There was one in Rampart," the adjoining police division,  he said. "I don't see it as a huge problem in the Northeast area at this time."  </P> <P> Homosexuals are reluctant to report the attacks to police -- often because they  don't believe their complaints will be taken seriously, said Donna Wade,  co-chairperson of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Police Advisory Task Force.  </P> <P> Police and gay advocates in the past have also disagreed on what constitutes  gay-bashing. When Mario Martinez, 26, was shot between the eyes on Feb. 28,  1987, and robbed of his leather jacket after he left a Silver Lake bar, the gay  community angrily demanded protection from gay-bashing. But police considered  it a random robbery, not a homosexual-targeted crime.  </P> <P> Another difficulty in quantifying gay-bashing, even members of the gay  community agree, is that the assailants are sometimes homosexuals themselves,  who are picked up at Silver Lake bars or on the "cruise" and who beat their  partners after going home with them. The county commission's study found that  more gay-bashing incidents occurred in residences than in public or at places  of business.  </P> <P> In spite of the scarcity of solid documentation, the perception of  vulnerability remains extremely high in the Silver Lake gay community,  activists said.  </P> <P> Gay-bashing also occurs in West Hollywood, the other gay enclave in Los  Angeles, gay advocates said. But they said attacks may be more violent around  Sunset Junction.  </P> <P> The bars' clientele, mainly gay men, attract attention in an area where gang  activity abounds, Haskins said. And the density of the bars -- all within  walking distance of one another -- makes the area a prime location for crimes  aimed at homosexuals.  </P> <P> In spite of the gay community's uneasiness with the police, SNAP's leaders  decided to appeal to police for help. With assistance from Councilman Michael  Woo, a meeting was set up last month.  </P> <P> Officers Paul Afdahl and Lee attended. They told the group the Police  Department supports neighborhood patrols by community groups. Without promising  to make it a practice, they agreed to accompany the group on a trial patrol.  </P> <P> As a result of that meeting, 14 gay male volunteers joined three police  officers Friday night. Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, whose 13th  District encompasses Silver Lake, also joined the patrol.  </P> <P> As Woo and Haskins led the group past graffiti-marked walls, down dark streets  and past an old mattress blocking a cracked sidewalk, Lee and Officer Paul  Afdahl chatted comfortably with the volunteers, most of whom wore leather  jackets and jeans and were members of the Avatars, a club for men who like to  dress in leather. They were accompanied by Officer Glenda Browne.  </P> <P> The patrol passed several bars -- the Detour, Cuffs, the Gauntlet, Red's -- and  virtually every man interviewed told of being accosted or attacked while  visiting one of them. Mark Acuna, a Claremont artist, said he had been jumped  twice by youths while in Silver Lake, motivating him to join the patrol. Friday  was his third time as a SNAP volunteer.  </P> <P> "For years we were good little boys and kept quiet," said Acuna, a burly  51-year-old who wore a leather jacket and knitted cap. "Well, some  neighborhoods have decided to take back their streets. We've decided to take  back ours.  </P> <P> "To get from a bar to your car, you do it with a feeling that anything might  happen to you," he said. "But I've personally never been afraid. I think to be  afraid is to submit that they can get away with it."  </P> <P> During the first tour of the area, the patrol saw none of that. Few people  walked the sidewalks and passengers in cars offered only quizzical stares.  </P> <P> But at the end of the route, the patrol stopped suddenly in front of a dark,  narrow alley. Two young men drinking in the shadows were startled, then  embarrassed as the police officers ordered them to dump out their beers.  </P> <P> A quick frisk produced a "fist dagger" -- a thick, T-shaped steel spike with a  two-inch blade -- on one of them. The sight of it made members of the patrol  grimace. One youth was arrested for possession of a deadly weapon. The other  was questioned and released.  </P> <P> There was no evidence, however, that the pair were laying in wait to attack gay  passers-by.  </P> <P> But the members of the patrol had their suspicions. "If there had been just one  or two people walking down there, it could have been a very ugly situation,"  said Dana Atkinson, an organizer of the Avatars.  </P> <P> Later, Woo capitalized on the night's only incident.  </P> <P> "I saw with my own eyes a great example of why this patrol is needed," said  Woo, as the group finally returned to the coffee shop at which it had met two  hours earlier. "Who knows? Perhaps we prevented some violent attack from taking  place because we were on the patrol."  </P> <P> The two officers were more guarded in their assessment.  </P> <P> "This is the first coordinated, visible effort between the police and the gay  community," Lee said. "The first time is very important as image setting.  Because of our limited manpower, we can't do it every week. But I think it's a  good first step in establishing a better rapport."  </P> <P> Capt. Frank Patchett, commander of the Northeast Division, said the division  lacks the resources to maintain regular foot patrols with the gay group, but  would do its best to provide support any time the group schedules a walk.  </P> <P> "I don't have enough officers to put a foot beat in that area," Patchett said.  "I'd like to have that luxury, but we don't."  </P> <P> As an alternative to a foot beat, Patchett said, he has worked out an  arrangement with the Rampart Division, which is responsible for the south side  of Sunset Boulevard, to deploy a special weekend patrol of the gay bar area in  unmarked police cars.  </P> <P> He said he has two objectives, to discourage young adults who may be planning  to harass homosexuals and also to discourage the activities of gay men that  annoy residents of the area.  </P> <P> "We get a lot of complaints from residents in the neighborhood of gays driving  around and committing sex acts," Patchett said.  </P> <P> "The other side-benefit of this is that the gays will probably go someplace  else. I hope the neighborhood will quit complaining about the gays and the gays  will have some sense of safety being able to walk around the streets."  </P> <P> After two hours with the gay volunteers Friday, Woo and the police left. The  remaining volunteers set out on a second tour of the area, with two of the men  driving a car alongside the patrol.  </P> <P> This time, three separate groups of hecklers in cars shouted derogatory  comments and whistled. Without the police and Woo, muttered Charlie, a La  Crescenta hardware store clerk, the patrol "gets a little more serious."  </P> <P> When the group stopped to talk to Rudy, a security guard who strolled the  parking lot of a popular bar, the heavyset, bearded Latino warned of the influx  of gangs.  </P> <P> "Be forewarned what you're getting into," Rudy said sternly. "If you want to  control the turf, there'll be blood spilled. Be prepared."  </P> <P> There wasn't any that night. At about 2 a.m., the group returned to the coffee  shop. The men slapped each other on the back, hugged and applauded the  four-hour effort. For many, the event meant overcoming both their fears of the  street and the police officers whose assistance they had sought.  </P> <P> "It was uncomfortable to a certain extent," said Gerald Caponi, a 28-year-old  from Orange County. "When I see a police officer around the area I don't know  what their attitude is. I feel endangered from both ends.  </P> <P> "But we'll go through anything to protect our territory," Caponi said.  </P></p>

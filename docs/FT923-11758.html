			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Financial talking classes lack credibility Whenever a real chance appears of regaining price stability, so-called opinion formers lose heart and ask: what is wrong with a little inflation? The worst offenders are the financial talking classes, and it is they rather than the government that display the main credibility gap. Most human endeavours fail; but that is no reason for gloating at the prospect of defeat when there is the best chance of success in more than a generation. Shakespeare's Henry V said before Agincourt: 'He which hath no stomach to this fight, let him depart.' If it were a financial battlefield in Britain, it would be deserted before a shot had been fired. Saying why inflation is bad is a thankless task: not because the arguments are weak, but because they are stronger than any one person is able to call to mind at any one time. They resemble the case for honesty or sanctity of contract in that they embody far more accumulated human wisdom than any one person can hope to command. For practical purposes, however, we need only recall the remark of Eugene Black, an early head of the World Bank, that a little inflation is like a little pregnancy; it is liable to increase. Tim Congdon has in the July Gerrard and National Economic Review made a valiant attempt to give some specific instances of the harm done by inflation continuing to hover around 2 or 3 per cent per annum. The first is in the labour market, where the whole iniquitous institution of the annual pay round is based on the assumption of permanent inflation. The practice takes up scarce management time and is the most important reason for union activities. He also points to the key importance of the interest rate assumption in any long-term contract. Unpredictable oscillations in inflation between zero and 5 per cent 'would remain a costly nuisance to savers and investors and to companies and their banks'. High and volatile inflation is not the only reason for the state of the world banking system - credit sprees followed by painful contractions occurred under the Gold Standard - but it has made a powerful contribution. To my mind, the clinching argument is that there is no long-term trade-off - in plain English, no true choice - between inflation and unemployment. If so, we might as well enjoy the benefits of stable prices without an endless debate on what they are. Few would deny that there is a transitional cost of reducing inflation in terms of recession and high unemployment - monetarists, moreover, betray their most cherished principles when they speak as if the cost could be avoided by leaving the ERM. There is, however, plenty of casual evidence that the effort to reduce inflation hits a resistance barrier when any government tries to go below the creeping rate to which we have become used even in the better periods since the second world war. One conspicuous example is the perversity of commercial landlords who insist on fierce rent increases for small businesses when contracts are renegotiated because their universe is bounded by the assumption of continuing substantial inflation. The desire not to prolong the transitional agony longer than necessary is one reason for wanting to know when the goal of stable prices has been achieved. We are not very well served by the Consumer Price Indices, the British version of which is known as the Retail Prices Index. How ambiguous the message is from such indicators is shown in the chart. The headline measure saw an apparent trebling of the inflation rate from 3.3 per cent at the beginning of 1988 to 10.9 per cent in the autumn of 1990, followed by a collapse to 3.9 per cent this June. If we take off transitory knock-on influences such as mortgage interest rate changes, the poll tax, VAT increases and the Gulf-induced fluctuations in petrol prices, we get a much smoother picture of inflation. There are other problems today. On a 12-month basis, the underlying rate is still well above the headline one; on the basis of more recent evidence it is below it. The British problem with the RPI is far from unprecedented. Professor Robert Gordon reminds us of a much worse problem that the US had before 1983.* The country's Consumer Price Index then made the fatal error of treating home-owners as if they were all paying an adjustable-rate mortgage. The distortion reached a maximum in the first quarter of 1980 when the CPI registered an annual rate of increase close to 18 per cent at a time when the GNP deflator never exceeded 9.3 per cent. The bad CPI news 'led a panicked Carter administration to impose temporary credit controls, which in turn caused a sharp V-shaped recession'. By contrast the Fed, under Paul Volcker, maintained a steadfast policy throughout 1979-82 that ignored temporary shifts in the CPI and instead went by the underlying measures. This episode not only led to a complete revision of the treatment of housing in the US CPI, but to greater emphasis on alternative measures including a 'core' inflation rate. Gordon says that the surest recipe for transition to Brazilian-type inflation is an unholy quartet of monetary accommodation, supply shocks, full indexation of public sector wages and transfer payments, and 'incorrect inflation measures that allow higher nominal interest rates and indirect taxes to feed into measured inflation, fuelling the spiral of higher wages, benefits and prices'. The author recommends an alternative CPI for policymakers in every country 'that excludes interest rates, indirect taxes and, optionally, food and energy costs'. There are, however, even more important long-term problems. Most consumer price indices try to adjust for quality improvement, but with incomplete success. The author believes that US consumer durables have been improving in quality by roughly 1.5 per cent per annum over and above anything reflected in the CPI. The rate of American inflation is also overstated by what he calls 'outlet substitution bias', for example a shift in US retailing to discount chains and other new outlets which is wrongly perceived as a move down-market. He disputes the frequently expressed view that there has been no increase in US real wages for 20 years, by attributing this stagnation to an upward bias in the price index. For policy purposes we need more up-to-date and better publicised versions of the underlying inflation indicators, which CPI and RPI measures rarely are. But as far as the long-term goal is concerned, I doubt if we can do better than follow the Alan Greenspan test of regarding stable prices as a state of affairs where inflation no longer plays a significant role in business calculations. This avoids prejudging the question of exactly which particular rate needs to be established in which particular index. We shall know all right when the Greenspan conditions have been established. We still have a long way to go. *Measuring the Aggregate Price Level, CEPR, 25, Old Burlington St, London, W1X 1LB.</p>

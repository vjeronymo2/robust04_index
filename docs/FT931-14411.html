			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Flats face dearer terror insurance MANY OWNERS of flats in areas judged by insurers to be vulnerable to terrorist attack could face sizeable increases in insurance premiums. The increase, which could be up to Pounds 180 a year for a flat worth Pounds 200,000, may be necessary because insurers want to bring large blocks of flats into a pool to cover terrorist damage, financed by a special charge on policyholders. The proposal is on the agenda at a meeting this week at which the Association of British Insurers and the Department of Trade and Industry will discuss details of how the pool will work. Insurers agreed last month to establish the pool after the government said it would provide reinsurance cover.  Following losses of Pounds 800m from an IRA bomb attack in April, insurers announced in November that cover against terrorism would no longer be made automatically to owners of commercial property. It had been assumed that cover for residential properties would be unaffected. Mr Tony Baker of the Association of British Insurers said, however: 'Insurance companies want flats to be in the pool. They can't take them on their own books.' Mr Baker said yesterday that some leaseholders could be affected where the freehold of their building was owned by an outside landowner. Commercial policyholders will pay voluntary levies on top of existing premiums to obtain cover through the terrorism pool. These levies will vary according to the location and value of properties. It is understood that up to Pounds 5m, most policyholders would face increases of between 0.018 per cent and 0.09 per cent of the value of the property depending on its location. The rate would fall progressively to between 0.007 per cent and 0.023 per cent for properties valued in excess of Pounds 500m. Other issues on the agenda will include the liabilities of insurance companies for any terrorism claims on policies bought before the exclusion clause was introduced but which will remain in force until later this year. Meanwhile, an industrial risk manager suggested that the charges for properties based in central London were 'excessively penal'. Mr Alan Fleming of the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce, which represents more than 300 companies, suggested the cost of the scheme should be spread more widely.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lamia Lahoud] </F>   [Text] An agreement between Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] and Fatah, similar to the one reached in Gaza  recently, is being negotiated for the rest of the territories,  Hamas leader Shaykh Bassam Jarrar, of Ramallah, said earlier  this week.    Jarrar, one of the 405 Hamas deportees who returned several  months ago from south Lebanon, was arrested again on Monday.  Before his arrest, he told THE JERUSALEM POST that Hamas would  carry out attacks against Israelis in areas not under  Palestinian control. According to Fatah sources, Jarrar has  considerable support among the more radical young elements in  Hamas.    Fatah leader Marwan Barghuthi confirmed Jarrar's statement.  But he insisted Fatah's aim in making the agreement is to  persuade the fundamentalist group to cooperate with the  Palestinian authority and stop its opposition to the autonomy  accord.    Israel has warned the PLO that an agreement to turn a blind  eye to Hamas attacks against Israelis outside the autonomous  areas will annul the Israel-PLO agreement. Fatah leaders in the  territories angrily retort that an agreement with Hamas is an  inter-Palestinian affair designed to keep Hamas quiet and does  not concern Israel.    "In areas under our control we can ask Hamas to stop attacks  against Israelis in order not to destroy the autonomy accord.  Outside our areas, we have no control," said Barghuthi.    Barghuthi, a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Command, is  one of the deportees who returned two weeks ago. He said he had  been involved in negotiations with Hamas in Jordan while working  for the PLO office in Amman.    He argues that it is against Fatah's interest to let Hamas  continue attacks against Israel while Fatah talks peace. These  attacks, he said, increase popular support for Hamas.    Shaykh Jamil Hamami of eastern Jerusalem, who declines to be  called a Hamas member following the wave of arrests of Hamas  activists in recent days, refers to himself as a member of the  Islamic movement. Hamami said autonomy will be implemented  despite Hamas's efforts to sabotage the agreement, and he is  certain Hamas will try to reach an agreement with the  Palestinian authority to avoid internecine bloodshed. It will  be difficult, he admitted, because the PLO will be bound by an  agreement to ensure calm and cooperate with Israel on security  measures, but "both Hamas and Fatah will find ways to avoid  confrontation."    Hinting that Hamas may temporarily use political means  rather  than violence, Hamami nevertheless insisted that Hamas will  continue to attack Israelis. "No one can forbid us to attack  the occupation force. We will strike at the Zionist pirates  wherever we find them," he said, adding that for Hamas, Haifa  and Yafo are occupied Palestinian lands too.    Nor would the Hamas denounce attacks against Israelis to  gain  a release of its prisoners, Hamami insisted. The PLO has asked  Israel to release Hamas prisoners if the movement denounces  violence against Israeli civilians. But he said the release of  prisoners is not a gift from the PLO or Israel, but a  Palestinian right.    "They are negotiating a prisoner release while Israel is  arresting hundreds of Hamas people. This should be an  indication to the PLO that Israel is not serious about peace,  and 'Arafat should stop the negotiations," he said.    "These statements could mean that Hamas is changing its  policy and will recognize a peace treaty with Israel, or they  could be a trial balloon to see what Hamas could gain from it,"  said Riyad al- Maliki, spokesman for PFLP [Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine].    Hamas leaders themselves still don't seem to know what to  do.  "We will wait and see, and adapt our methods to the new  circumstances," admitted Hamami.</p>

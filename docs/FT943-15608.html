			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Management: Trouble with the children . . . - The CSA has faced severe administrative problems Ros Hepplewhite, chief executive of the UK's Child Support Agency, apologised this week for the anguish her organisation has caused to divided families over the last year. But despite promising wide-ranging changes to the CSA's operations - including more staff and greater government funding - many MPs wonder whether the most unpopular executive agency in Whitehall faces management problems that will only be solved by a root-and-branch reform later this year. Presenting the agency's first annual report this week, Hepplewhite admitted that the CSA - which was set up to force absent fathers to pay maintenance to their former families - had recently caused more anguish than any other government department. The agency - which operates under the Department of Social Security - has been accused of making inaccurate assessments of how much absent fathers should pay; of being unnecessarily heavy-handed in its dealings with applicants; and of being unable to answer telephone calls and letters from parents and MPs. Hepplewhite also admitted the agency had not provided basic financial information to parliament about its overall operations. In the report, the CSA did not give a final figure for how much has been paid in maintenance over the last year. Nor did it give a firm figure for the benefit savings that higher maintenance payments had created for the Treasury. The CSA's problems were exacerbated by the speed with which the organisation was set up in the wake of the Child Support Act. Hepplewhite admitted that the organisation had started operating in April 1993, without all the management information that was desirable at the time. 'We had a short lead-in time to get the organisation running,' she said. She has pledged to introduce changes. Seven-hundred staff are to be taken on to help process applications. Andersen Consulting, the management consultants, will advise on changes. And a new computer will help to collate the financial and accounting information that parliament needs. But will these changes put the organisation on a more stable footing? One of the biggest problems for the CSA is that piecemeal changes tend to slow down the organisation in the short term. Earlier this year, the government introduced a number of specific policy changes to the CSA's operations, including a change in the formula by which maintenance payments are made. However, as the CSA said in its report: 'Implementing these changes obliged us to reconsider the assessments we had made in our first 10 months, and staff had to be diverted away from processing new applications.' Any alteration to the rules can also discourage absent fathers from making their required maintenance payments because they believe the law is subject to regular change. Moreover, some MPs argue that there is a conflict in the CSA's twin goals of enforcing maintenance payments on absent fathers and creating benefit savings for the Treasury. According to Hepplewhite, the CSA operated at a slower pace in its first three months to ensure its systems were operating effectively. But, it was discovered that the organisation was failing to meet targets for benefit savings that had been set by the government. More effort was put into processing the volume of applications. But, as a result, there was less emphasis on ensuring that each CSA worker processed a single application for maintenance from beginning to end, thereby reducing the quality of customer service. This conflict of goals may be at the heart of the organisation's problems. As one MP put it: 'Mrs Hepplewhite may hope that her changes will improve the CSA. But what is really needed is a change in the tasks it has been set by the government.'</p>

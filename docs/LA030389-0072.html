			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A COMMON CAUSE FOR PACIFIC BASIN;  </P> <P> NATIONS SHOULD FINALLY ORGANIZE TO TACKLE TRADE, DEBT ISSUES  </P> <P> It is now more than 20 years since a distinguished Japanese citizen, Prof.  Kiyoshi Kojima, proposed that a Pacific Basin organization be set up. For a  generation, a great deal of thought, technical skill and good will have been  invested in elaborating the concept. It is proper that we have allowed time to  turn the problem around in our hands, identify the interests that such an  organization must satisfy if it is to be successful and identify the problems  it must overcome. This interval also provided the time to develop an underlying  sense of community. But there comes a time when symposiums and learned essays  should give way to action.  </P> <P> Clearly, what the Pacific Basin requires now is an economic, not a political or  military, organization. Existing security treaties and understandings appear  adequate, at least for the present. On the other hand, there is much for a  sound economic organization to do. But what kind of organization?  </P> <P> Evidently, one cannot envisage right now a Common Market or free-trade area for  a region with economies at such different stages of growth. In fact, a basic  requirement for success is that countries at early stages of growth feel not  merely unthreatened in such an organization but also look upon it as a source  of support.  </P> <P> What should such an organization do? And, especially, how should it begin?  </P> <P> Clear thinking about the Pacific Basin has, by and large, been obstructed by  analogies with the European movement toward economic unity. But the European  experience does hold one good lesson for the Pacific Basin nations: The  European movement acquired credibility when it proved capable of solving what  was then the most important political-economic problem in Western Europe. The  problem in 1948-1949 was how to ensure equitable access to the dominating coal  and steel resources of West Germany. The solution -- fair to Germans and to all  others -- was the Coal and Steel Community. The success of that enterprise was  the political and psychological basis for the Common Market.  </P> <P> In light of that lesson, the first thing a Pacific Basin organization should do  is come to grips with the two biggest problems now obstructing political  harmony and sustained economic prosperity in the region: the related problems  of trade and the debts of many developing countries.  </P> <P> So far as advanced industrial countries are concerned, I define the trade  problem as the development of large, chronic surpluses and deficits, inducing  in the deficit countries -- notably, the United States -- mounting pressures  for extreme protectionist solutions.  </P> <P> Before I make a concrete proposal on trade policy in the Pacific Basin, let me  say something about Third World debts, for they are a substantial part of the  trade problem of the developed nations as well as the critical barrier to  economic growth in important parts of the developing world. (Incidentally, I  assume a future Pacific Basin organization will include some of the major Latin  American countries.)  </P> <P> Just as we can't solve the surplus-deficit trade problem by exchange-rate  manipulation without relinking domestic and foreign economic policy over a wide  front, we can't solve the debt problem wholly by conventional financial  measures. It is an integral part of problems of trade and growth in the world  economy.  </P> <P> For six years, we have dealt with Third World debts as primarily a financial  matter: Creditor banks in advanced industrial countries lent the debtors enough  each year to pay interest and pushed the principal down the road.  </P> <P> The results have been appalling. In the heavily indebted countries, gross  national product per capita declined between 1980 and 1986 at an average annual  rate of 1.8%; gross capital formation as a percent of GNP fell by one-third;  imports fell by 20%; the ratio of interest payments to exports doubled.  </P> <P> The impact of this tragic episode of regression on the advanced industrial  countries has been, of course, a significant loss of export markets. U.S.  exports, for example, are estimated to be between 20% and 40% below the level  they would have been if the heavily indebted countries had enjoyed normal  growth rates.  </P> <P> Proposals to resolve the Third World debt problem are of four broad types:  Procedural reform (such as multi-year debt rescheduling and extension of  maturities); changing the nature of claims (debt-equity conversions and  interest capitalization); new institutions (an inter-governmental institution  that would take over the direct claims of banks on borrowing countries and  provide relief to debtors), and direct debt relief (a reduction in debt  servicing charges).  </P> <P> The time has come for bold, decisive action to end the Third World debt crisis,  with Western Europe taking the lead in dealing with the African debts and the  advanced industrial countries of the Pacific Basin taking the lead with the  Latin American and Asian debts, notably those of the Philippines and Indonesia.  </P> <P> In a matter of this kind, bold, decisive action pays off, as the Marshall Plan  proved. That plan was completed in a shorter time and at less cost than  originally envisaged. In part, this happened because its scale and decisiveness  raised morale in Europe and encouraged vigorous action by Europeans. In this  case, an additional factor argues in the same direction: A bold, decisive plan  to end the Third World debt crisis could induce a return of a large part of the  flight capital that has complicated the task of the debtor countries. I suggest  the answer lies in a new institution within which the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund would play an important but not exclusive role,  plus a substantial measure of debt relief.  </P> <P> As a first step, therefore, I propose that a meeting of governments interested  in exploring the possibility of setting up a Pacific Basin organization take  place soon at the ministerial level. Its five-point agenda might look something  like this:  </P> <P>  -- Measures to end within three years or less chronic trade surpluses and  deficits in ways consistent with high-growth rates, minimum protectionism and  avoidance of major crisis in the international financial system.  </P> <P>  -- Long-run rules for trade that would avert in the future the buildup of  large, chronic trade surpluses and deficits and unmanageable debt levels,  including rules relating the domestic economic policies of nations to their  external trade and financial positions, taking into account variations  appropriate to their stages of growth.  </P> <P>  -- Measures to deal decisively and promptly with debt problems of developing  nations in Latin America and the Pacific.  </P> <P>  -- Other possible Pacific tasks.  </P> <P>  -- Organizational issues.  </P> <P> For each item, relatively small, expert groups -- well-balanced between  advanced industrial and developing countries -- might be appointed to develop  proposals for consideration.  </P> <P> It is often forgotten that the pre-1914 world economy -- on which we sometimes  look back with nostalgia -- was not held together by free trade. The United  States, the European continent and Japan all mounted and sustained substantial  tariff and other barriers to trade. What held the pre-1914 system together was  the political acceptance of the rhythm of the business cycle as a kind of act  of God.  </P> <P> But severe, protracted depressions are no longer politically acceptable.  Therefore, we shall have to manage our way out of the unsupportable current  trade surpluses and deficits; and the rules of the game for the long run must  accept a higher degree of management than our rhetoric -- especially the  rhetoric of politicians and after-dinner speeches -- allows.  </P> <P> It is time to invoke the great rule of Jean Monnet, one of the founders of the  Common Market: Do not come together to argue and negotiate; come together to  solve a common problem. And the problem is much deeper than free trade or  protectionism.  </P></p>

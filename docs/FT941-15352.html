			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Yen for a better life: Former Japanese salarymen Loyal to his superiors, eager to work long hours and willing to sacrifice family and friends to the company's cause, the Japanese salaryman has been the driving force behind the country's postwar rise to become an economic superpower. But as the Japanese economy goes through a severe recession, and the government prepares another stimulus package - due to be unveiled next week  -the salaryman's unquestioning dedication to his employer is waning. In May, Mr Kunitake Fujita, 51, left IBM Japan, where he had worked loyally for 28 years, to take up a career as a social welfare worker, helping disabled people earn a living. Each day, the former IBM personnel manager commutes 80 minutes from his home in central Tokyo to the plain, two-storey Aoba Work Centre, a private organisation that aims to provide disabled people with skills training and an income. The centre is next to a fermented bean factory - a world away from his days in the high-technology, glass-and-concrete headquarters of IBM Japan. But his new job fulfils him in a way that life at IBM never did. 'I believe my work at IBM contributed to social good but only in an indirect way. Here, I feel every day that I am contributing to society and that gives me a purpose in life.' Until Mr Fujita decided to leave IBM, he had not thought about what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. What changed all that was a four-week holiday, which was a reward from IBM for his long service. Mr Fujita had never had so much free time, and found the experience disturbing. 'I found that I did not know what to do and that I was completely cut off from society. It is frightening to see yourself doing nothing, frittering the time away.' This gave him his first glimpse of what life would be like after retirement for someone who had depended so much on company life for his own personal fulfilment. Nine months later, he was one of 1,600 employees who signed up for the IBM's early retirement programme, which he had helped to draw up as the company tried to cut costs. Similar motives led Mr Shingo Shibayama to leave his job in the legal department of Mitsui and Co, a trading company, to become a teacher at the age of 57. Like Mr Fujita, Mr Shibayama was a dedicated company man with more than 30 years' service. He had thrived in his job as a legal specialist, travelling to different parts of the world. 'The trading house is like a theatre as big as the grand Kabuki theatre and I was very happy to go on stage there.' But he says Mitsui employees who are not offered an executive position by the age of 57 must choose between moving to a subsidiary, or becoming an adviser known as a madogiwazoku (or someone who sits by the window with little work to do). Neither fate appealed to Mr Shibayama. If he went to a subsidiary, he would have had to retire at 63. 'I am a work-aholic,' Mr Shibayama says. 'My generation has lived for work alone. I cannot imagine myself not working. I have hobbies, but I can't stand being at home. After so many years of company life, home has become a place where I just eat and sleep.' So when the offer of the post of professor came from Nisho Gakusha, a private university in Chiba prefecture, just outside Tokyo, Mr Shibayama decided to take it. He would then have the chance of working until about 70. A determination to carry on working for as long as possible also led Mr Tetsushi Saitoh, 55, to give up his job as an executive at Marubeni, a trading house. Now Mr Saitoh gets up at 2.30 every morning to work the early shift at a convenience store he runs with his son in Shzuoka, two hours on the train from Tokyo. He worries about how well the products on the shelves are selling, about whether he is able to satisfy customers' needs. Like Mr Fujita and Mr Shibayama, he was able to take advantage of a retirement programme of a kind run by many blue-chip Japanese companies to encourage employees to start new careers. Generous terms often mean they can maintain income levels relatively easily. Although it is a far cry from the high-flying lifestyle of employees at Japan's large trading houses, Mr Saitoh takes pride in his store and in the decision he made. 'I decided to do this myself. That is completely different from having to do something because the boss tells you to.' The best thing about running a convenience store, he says, is that there is no retirement. Like others who have made the transition from big companies, his salaryman's instinctive loyalty and stamina are undiminished.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: UK supercomputer sale raises hackles THINKING Machines, a US supercomputer manufacturer, is expected to lodge an official protest against the decision by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California to buy a supercomputer from Meiko Scientific, a British-owned company. The Dollars 15m sale, if completed, would be the first of its kind to a US government laboratory from a non-US company. The deal has already been clouded by controversy surrounding Meiko's sale of high-performance computers to Israel in 1991, after Washington refused export licences to US manufacturers. Mr Danny Hillis, president and co-founder of Thinking Machines, a US leader in the field of 'massively parallel supercomputers', which combine the power of hundreds of microprocessor chips to achieve record processing speeds, said he did not believe Meiko had met all the specifications. 'Our issue is: has there been a fair bidding process?' It appeared that the Meiko supercomputer might be a prototype, whereas the laboratory had specified that it would buy only a proven product. He also believed that Meiko might be infringing some of his company's patents. Thinking Machines must wait until Lawrence Livermore finalises a contract before it can obtain full details of the Meiko computer. It will then have 10 days to file a formal protest, forcing the government laboratory to prove that it has conducted the procurement competition fairly. Mr David Alden, president of Meiko, maintains that Meiko won the contract in an open competition with US manufacturers. He also rejects charges that it made 'ill advised' exports to Israel. Meiko obtained export licences from the British Department of Trade, he said, and the computers sold to Technion University were not true supercomputers.</p>

It was the first meeting of the Defense Committee  after the new government assumed office. At the meeting, the  prime minister assured the chiefs of armed services that the  government would fulfill all their requirements at any cost  because the country's defense is among the government's top  priorities. The meeting decided that Pakistan would not depend  on any one country to meet its defense needs; instead the  country's defense resources would be diversified.    A glance at the issues discussed by the cabinet's Defense  Committee indicates that a comprehensive review of Pakistan's  defense matters was made at the meeting. Such a review is very  important and inevitable for a country like Pakistan as its  defense is always faced with serious danger. Although a ray of  hope has emerged in the last two months about an improvement of  relations with the United States, it is, however, premature to  predict about the final decision of the U.S. Government on  Pakistan's military and economic assistance.    The U.S. Government is reportedly considering some proposals  to make the Pressler Amendment ineffective. However, it is not  possible to say anything definitely now about the U.S. Congress'  final decision on these proposals. In the meantime, Pakistan  cannot sit idly and do nothing to meet its defense needs,  especially when it is dealing with an unfriendly neighbor. The  neighbor appears to be unwilling to adopt a positive and fair  attitude on the Kashmir issue. On the contrary, it is  increasing all sorts of repression and violence as the struggle  by the Kashmiri freedom fighters is intensifying.    A few weeks ago India decided to resume talks with Pakistan,  but it has not been witnessed making any effort for the success  of these talks. It has intensified its atrocities. Having such  a neighbor, how can Pakistan remain complacent, even slightly,  about its defense? In view of the Indian attitude, the foreign  minister has already expressed his pessimism about the outcome  of the proposed talks. Armed Forces Chief General Abdul Waheed  has expressed the view at the cabinet Defense Committee meeting  that distressed by the situation in Kashmir, India might even  embark on an adventure on the Kashmir frontier. The army  chief's opinion is a realistic one. We should never adopt an  attitude of complacency and indifference regarding India's  designs.    We should endeavor to meet our defense needs from every  possible source and maintain full preparedness while  simultaneously expecting an improvement in our relations with  the United States. The holy Koran also advises Muslims to do  everything possible for the defense and not to ignore it. Some  uninformed quarters in Pakistan complain about an increased  expenditure on defense. They forget that if a nation's defense  system is not strong, it cannot expect any leniency or softness  from its enemy. We understand that the Defense Committee has  adopted a realistic approach by deciding to acquire arms and  equipment from Europe, China and any other possible source to  meet the defense requirements of the three services of Pakistan.  This is a correct decision.    Pakistan has repeatedly made the proposal to declare South  Asia a nuclear-free zone. But the Indian response has always  been negative. Keeping this negative attitude in view, one can  easily realize what designs India is nurturing. We hope that  all the decisions of the Defense Committee will be fully  implemented and no effort will be spared in making Pakistan's  defense impregnable.    Also, we would like to make it clear that a country's  defense  cannot be made impregnable by merely amassing weapons and  equipment. The country should also have a broad and strong  industrial base and a self-reliant economy, and it should move  toward the goal of self-reliance and have a stable and smooth  political system. While striving to acquire weapons and  equipment for our armed forces, we should also take effective  steps for the country's economic and industrial progress.    Similarly, we should also make every possible effort to  ensure the country's political stability and continuity. By the  grace of God, Pakistan has vast resources. If we utilize these  resources with prudence and far-sightedness, then there is no  reason we should not be able to effectively defend our  motherland and raise the living standard of our people, too. We  hope that the new elected government will initiate a process of  reconstruction and reforms in all aspects of our national life.</p>

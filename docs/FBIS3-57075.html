			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 22, BNS -- Lithuanian national  security institutions categorically denied press reports that  Vytautas Karinauskas, former head of the 1st KGB department in  Lithuania, is employed in the National Security Service [NSS].    Suppositions appeared Friday [21 January] in the RESPUBLIKA  newspaper.    "He is definitely not in the staff of the service,"  well-informed sources said and added that the basic principles  of the NSS remain unchanged -- former KGB leaders cannot be  employed in Lithuanian security.    Experts said, however, that Karinauskas may have been  invited  for consultations when certain structures of the NSS were being  created. The 1st KGB department was engaged in espionage.    Experts characterize Karinauskas as a "Western-minded"  person, who has considerable experience of work abroad and is a  "top level professional." Experts said Lithuanian national  security services often lack such features.</p>

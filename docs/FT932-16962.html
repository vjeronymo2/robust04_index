			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Golds put industrials in shadow JOHANNESBURG drifted lower following Wednesday's hectic trade. The overall index, down 15 at 3,544, incorporated falls of 13 to 4,413 in industrials and 14 to 1,191 in golds. This followed a chart-topping performance for the market over the first three months of 1993. South Africa led the FT-Actuaries World Indices, both in sterling and US dollar terms, with gains of 19.65 and 18.97 per cent respectively. The figures reflect recovery in the financial rand, up 7 per cent against the dollar and 9 per cent against sterling this year, after a 34 per cent drop against the dollar in 1992. In local currency terms, South African equities still managed a rise of 11.14 per cent. The overall index performance masks the conflict between gold mining stocks and a muted industrial sector. By the end of March the JSE Gold index was up 51 per cent over three months, against a 1 per cent gain in industrials. Brokers were saying yesterday that there could be more to come in golds, which have attracted income funds and gold funds from around the world in pursuit of the high dividend yields available, and the assumed protection from international strife. 'Even today you can get yields of 10 per cent, net of withhold-ing tax,' commented one broker yesterday.</p>

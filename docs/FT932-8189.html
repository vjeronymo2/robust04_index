			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Satellite TV film violence criticised THE LEVEL of violence on satellite television films was attacked yesterday by the Broadcasting Standards Council, the government watchdog which monitors sex and violence on television. Lord Rees-Mogg, the council's chairman, said satellite channels such as BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake - are showing too many violent films. The report was based on a survey of the viewing habits and responses of 600 people during 1991 and 1992. They were asked to register the number of occasions when they saw what they considered to be 'unjustifiable' levels of sex, violence and bad language, both before and after 9pm. The definition of 'unjustifiable' was left to the discretion of the viewers, who were asked to register on a scale of 0-5 the degree of offence it caused them. According to the survey less than 1 per cent of viewing is described as having any 'significant' levels of 'unjustifiable' sex, violence or bad language. That doubled to 2 per cent on the BBC and ITV after 9pm, when programming with more adult content is permissible. However, that post-9pm 'unjustifiable' figure grew to 6 per cent to 7 per cent in the case of satellite television. Dramas, drama series and films accounted for 70 per cent of all reported excesses in the post 9pm period. Viewers favoured warnings of strong language after 9pm.</p>

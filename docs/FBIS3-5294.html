			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Fiscal policy speech by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to </F> the 129th ordinary Diet session -- live]    [Excerpts] The Japanese economy is constantly in a severe  phase due to cyclical factors and the bursting of the bubble  economy. However, Japan is being asked to construct a  prosperous and vigorous economic society toward the 21st century  to deal with the aging society. It is also being asked to play  a suitable role in the international community. The government  has to overcome the current economic difficulties as early as  possible. At the same time, through the reform and opening of  the economic society, it needs to construct a vigorous and open  economic society in which the people can prosper, as well as to  contribute to the international community for the sake of stable  growth of the world economy.    [Passage omitted on explanation of current domestic and  foreign economic situation] While carefully watching the  current domestic and foreign economic situations and seeking the  direction Japan should take toward the 21st century, the  government intends to make an all-out effort to tackle the  following tasks.    The first task is to implement measures for economic  recovery. As I said earlier, the Japanese economy is faced with  continuous stagnation in such fields as consumer spending and  capital investment. Nevertheless, public investments and  housing construction have been pushing up the economy, and  inventory adjustment and capital stock adjustment have  progressed. Also, the consumption of durable goods is expected  to increase. Signs of recovery like this are steadily emerging.  To strongly reinforce such signs of the beginning of an  economic recovery to move our economy onto the track of a  full-fledged recovery as early as possible in fiscal 1994, and  to secure stable growth from fiscal 1995, we recently formulated  an unprecedented comprehensive economic package exceeding 15  trillion yen. The package includes plans to increase domestic  demand, such as income tax cuts worth Y5.85 [yen] trillion and  increased public investments, as well as measures to tackle  pressing economic problems. The package is rich in both quality  and quantity, thus literally a comprehensive pump- priming  program. The government intends to implement these  comprehensive stimulus measures as one package, and to stimulate  the economy as soon as it possibly can with the third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the fiscal 1994 budget.  I am confident that these measures will eliminate the  pessimistic outlook and lead to an increase in domestic demand  and consumer spending, thus contributing greatly to efforts to  achieve a full-fledged economic recovery. [passage omitted on  effects of lowered official discount rate on the economy and on  need to stabilize foreign exchange rates]    The second task is to actively promote financial reform. The  government has formulated several economic stimulus packages to  shore up the faltering economy, and has reluctantly decided to  issue more construction bonds to make up for an increase in  expenditures for public works projects included in the packages.  [Passage omitted on the financial structure's dependence on  government bonds]    The third task is to realize tax reform before the end of  the  year. To make the aging society a vigorous and prosperous one,  it is very important to establish a taxation system in which  income, consumption, and assets taxes are well balanced, as well  as to realize tax reform with public consent. Based on this  view, the Tax Commission energetically discussed tax reform and  compiled a report last November in which it showed the basic  idea of realizing a fair and vigorous aging society. After  receiving the report, the government and the ruling parties  began discussions and agreed to enact legislation for tax reform  before the end of the year. In line with this agreement, the  government will continue to study tax reform while hearing  opinions of people from various circles to realize tax reform  before the end of the year.    The fourth task is to establish harmonious economic  relations  with foreign countries and contribute to the growth of the world  economy. As world trade and direct foreign investment are  expanding, the world economy more and more requires the system  of mutual dependence. I believe that in such a situation, Japan  needs to make efforts to establish harmonious economic relations  with other countries, and to actively contribute to the growth  of the world economy. To realize steady growth of the world  economy with no inflation, Japan will cooperate with other  countries in the process of formulating economic policy  coordination at G-7 meetings of finance ministers and central  bankers. At the same time, it will exchange views with other  countries at the APEC meetings of finance ministers. The  Uruguay Round trade negotiations, which lasted for almost seven  years, were successfully concluded on 15 October, 1993. The  success of the talks have placed confidence in the international  economic order. Based on the results of the Uruguay Round  talks, Japan will make efforts to maintain and strengthen the  multilateral trade system to contribute to the growth of both  the domestic and world economies. Concerning tariffs, in view  of the need to open Japanese markets wider to foreign  competition, the government plans to lower tariffs on raw sugar  and abolish tariffs on auto parts. [Passage omitted on Japan's  economic assistance to developing countries and former  planned-economy nations]    The fifth task is to put life into the financial and  securities markets. In order for the nation's economy to  continue to grow, it is essential that the smooth supply of  funds necessary for economic activities is assured. The  recently announced overall economic stimulus package is aimed at  enabling implementation of measures on the financial and  securities markets along with other measures. It presents  policies on the financial market that should make possible the  smooth supply of funds, facilitate disposal of bad assets,  reduce interest, and improve liquidity of credits. It also  presents the government's basic thinking on ways of dealing with  the bad assets of banking institutions. This thinking will  remain the administrative guideline relating to solving the  problems of banking institutions' bad assets.    With regard to the measures for invigorating the securities  market, the government is getting ready to present to the  current session of the Diet a bill aimed at introducing a system  on securities transactions which will ease controls on companies  acquiring their own companies' stocks. The government will  continue to push for actions to simplify procedures and ease  controls on securities market transactions, for instance by  enabling corporations to raise capital by issuing corporate  bonds at market prices.    Watching the conditions of the stock market henceforth, the  government will also study ways of facilitating corporations'  going public.    By implementing all these measures in a package, the  government intends to secure an environment which will enable  the monetary and securities markets to perform their expected  functions well.    Now I will explain the key points of the 1994 budget to you.    In view of the existing very serious financial situation of  the government and difficult economic conditions of the country,  the 1994 budget together with the 1993 supplementary budget is  meant to give great consideration to its role of stimulating the  economy. On the other hand, in order to contain the issuing of  deficit-covering bonds [tokurei kosai] which can only prompt  worsening of the financial structure, the government has  thoroughly reviewed the situation in order to trim down its  expenditures. The government has also done its best to allocate  funds to projects in priority areas, and to place emphasis on  qualitative results in formulating this budget.    In the area of expenditures, the government has tried to  economize and rationalize expenses by, for example, careful  reviewing existing systems and policies. The government has  thus contained the scale of the general expenditures to  Y40,854.8 billion which is only 2.3 percent higher that the  amount for the initial 1993 budget. [passage on containing  employment of public officials, details on government bond  servicing, grants to local government omitted] As a result, the  scale of total expenditures has come to be Y73,081.7 billion,  which is an increase of 1.0 percent over the intial budget of  1993.    Now I will explain the revenues to you. In the area of  taxation, in order to meet the given needs from economic, social  and administrative policies, the government will implement  reduction of income taxes and the inheritance tax, and take  equally appropriate actions on land taxes. The government also  intends to review and adjust -- to a more appropriate level --  the taxes on nonprofit foundations, review and improve existing  special exception measures related to all taxes, and take other  various necessary measures. As regards the overall tax  administration, the government will continue to make efforts to  ensure appropriateness and fairness, with the trust and  cooperation of the public.    In the area of nontax revenues, the government -- in view of  the very serious financial conditions -- is now making all-out  efforts to increase revenues, for instance by taking the action  of converting the special account on automobile liability policy  into the general account.    With regard to government bonds, the government intends to  issue construction bonds worth Y10,509.2 billion to secure  financial resources to support the so-called NTT [Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Company] project reimbursement expenses.  In addition, the government will issue deficit-covering bonds  worth Y3,133.8 billion exclusively to meet the tax revenue  shortfalls that will arise from the reduction of income taxes.  [passage about deficit- covering bonds, financial investment  plans, other details in the revenue budget omitted]    As far as defense expenditures are concerned, in view of the  very tight finances, we are holding down defense spending as  much as possible under the revised Mid-Term Defense Buildup  Plan, while maintaining and improving the balance in overall  defense capability. The government is doing all it can to  maintain and improve defense capabilities, while keeping the  overall structure of defense in balance. [passage on grants to  local governments omitted]</p>

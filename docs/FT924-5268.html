			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Tawse deeper in loss EVER DECLINING demand in its markets caused Brown &amp; Tawse Group, the steel and pipes distributor, to fall more sharply into losses in the six months to September 30. It is passing the interim dividend. Pre-tax losses grew from Pounds 181,000 to Pounds 2.76m in the period. The interim dividend last time was 2.85p. Turnover declined to Pounds 63.2m (Pounds 72.3m). Mr Gil Black, chairman, said that the shrinking demand first seen in the group's markets in 1989, continued unabated. But Mr Phillip Ashforth, finance director, added that 'occasional green shoots' had been seen at Jay Fasteners and there had been signs the southern region was bottoming out, though there were no trends for sustained recovery. To help cut costs further, Mr Richard Wilson, chief executive since September 21, has engaged Coopers &amp; Lybrand to undertake a detailed operational review. Mr Ashforth said it was likely that the mother company, Brown &amp; Tawse Ltd, would be restructured. Working capital was under 'continuous scrutiny' and capital expenditure, down to Pounds 3.4m last year, was a little under Pounds 1.5m in the half. Net borrowings rose from Pounds 16.1m at the year-end, when gearing was 35 per cent, to just over Pounds 20m at the end of the half, giving gearing of almost 49 per cent. Losses per share emerged at 8.5p (0.5p).</p>

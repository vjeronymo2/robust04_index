			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Havana TRABAJADORES in Spanish of 11  April 1994 on pages 4 and 5 reports that approximately 4.8  million medical certificates were issued in 1993. This  represents an estimated 60.2 million missed workdays. The  article reports that while this represents a reduction in  comparison to 1992 figures, the economic costs rose from 181.8  million pesos to 192 million pesos. The State Committee for  Labor and Social Security (CETSS) explains the discrepancy by  noting that more days off were prescribed per certificate due to  the optical neuritis epidemic, which affected 58,000 people, a  conjunctivitis epidemic, and "other ailments." However, the  article says, the neuritis epidemic accounts for only 3.31  percent of the more than 60 million workdays lost. The tourism  industry has a lower rate of absenteeism and issues fewer  medical certificates even though the workers "are exposed to the  same viruses, the same epidemics, and work hard, although not as  hard as construction workers or cane cutters," the article  explains.    Dr. Ramon Crespo Almeira, secretary general of the health  workers union, said that, while most doctors are conscientious  in issuing certificates, measures have been taken against those  who have not followed the rules. Crespo also explained that it  is up to administrators in the work places to verify  certificates and to investigate other causes of absenteeism  instead of "blaming the doctors."</p>

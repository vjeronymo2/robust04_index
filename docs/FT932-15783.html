			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Rising trade deficit could cause friction - Risks in economic recovery ECONOMIC recovery will result in a significant deterioration of the US merchandise trade deficit, perhaps to a shortfall of as much as Dollars 140bn (Pounds 92.5bn) next year, according to White House projections. A trade deficit of Dollars 140bn in fiscal 1994 would be the largest since the record shortfall of Dollars 152bn in 1987. It was Dollars 84bn last year. A rise in the US trade shortfall could lead to increased trade friction, especially with Japan. The expected deterioration in the deficit (projected to fall in a range of Dollars 110bn-Dollars 140bn in fiscal 1994) reflects White House projections of economic growth of 3.1 per cent this year, rising to 3.3 per cent next year. The domestic counterpart to the widening trade deficit is a more rapid increase in domestic investment than in domestic savings, reflecting planned new incentives for business capital formation. The administration is projecting net private investment next fiscal year of Dollars 190bn-Dollars 220bn compared with Dollars 102bn in fiscal 1992. Economic growth is expected to slow to 2.7 per cent in 1995 and then stabilise at 2.5 per cent a year from 1996 to 1998. Unemployment is expected to fall steadily to 5.5 per cent in 1998. Inflation is projected to remain at or close to 3 per cent through the next five years. Officials stressed that the 'baseline' budget deficit projections were based on the Congressional Budget Office's more conservative economic forecast. This projects growth rising to a peak of 3 per cent next year and then declining to 1.8 per cent by 1998, with inflation declining to 2.2 per cent. On the White House's more optimistic forecasts, officials claimed the deficit could fall as low as Dollars 160bn by fiscal 1997. However, the figures make no allowance for the healthcare reform plan expected next month. The restructuring of healthcare - nearly one seventh of the economy - is likely to result in large increases in both spending and taxes. Democrats hailed Thursday's budget as the biggest deficit cutting programme in US history. Yet the detailed figures show it would have only a modest impact on the structural budget deficit, which allows for cyclical changes in economic activity. This would fall from Dollars 252.3bn this year to Dollars 205bn in fiscal 1994 and then climb to Dollars 241.2bn by fiscal 1998, or 3 per cent of gross domestic product. The debt to GDP ratio would rise from 51 per cent last year to 58 per cent in 1998.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Markets: Dealers cut up rough as rates fall - London HOWEVER welcome to mortgagees, this week's cut in base rates, from 7 to 6 per cent, smacks of panic at the top. The cut certainly took the equity market by surprise. There was an expectation that interest rates would be reduced in the March budget and not before. The FT-SE 100 index jumped 63.8 points on Tuesday when the cut was announced, though much of that gain was lost over the rest of the week. Indeed, since the highs of the beginning of the year, the market had weakened as hopes of a cut had been deferred. The cut was also clearly unexpected in the gilt-edged market. The timing caused some annoyance to operators there who had been happily preparing for Wednesday's Pounds 2.5bn auction of stock by taking short positions. Perhaps it was a fit of the sulks from the gilt dealers that left the auction barely covered. Such is the self-importance of the stock market that it assumed the inconvenience to them of the timing showed ineptness, and added to rumours that the Bank of England was hardly consulted before the decision was taken. Tuesday's move also appeared to take little account of what might happen to the pound. Sterling held steady for a bit after the rate cut, but then dipped again. As an aside, when interest rates were last this low 15 years ago, a pound could buy four D-marks. It all adds up to a feeling that there has been a shift in emphasis by the government, away from controlling inflation towards getting the economy moving at all costs. The previous week's unemployment figures, showing an acceleration in the monthly increase, and the probability that the next month's figure will take the jobless total to more than 3m, may have been the final straw for the government. Once one cut is made, the market starts looking for the next, and there are now many who expect a fall to 5 per cent, perhaps at budget time. At the same time the Government's backbenchers are pushing for an easy budget in March, on the grounds that any green shoots must be protected, unlike the crocuses now daringly pushing upwards and risking the frost. Any over-generosity in March, the theory goes, can be reversed, if need be, in December when the second budget of the year is coming. Where that leaves the budget deficit meanwhile is a question proponents of this argument prefer to ignore. The market is divided between those who think that recovery is imminent  - and that if anything the risk is that the government's efforts could be overstoking the fire - and others who believe it takes much longer for lower rates to work through to improved confidence, both consumer and corporate. Both sides point to the US economy. One view is that low interest rates have worked there and the economy is picking up. The other is that US rates have been much lower for much longer than UK rates and it takes a long time for cheap money to have the desired effect. Either way, all economic statistics and company news over the next few weeks will be closely studied. No doubt many official figures and chairmen's statements will give contradictory indications. This week's trade figures looked awful, the worst since June 1990. But they can be explained by saying that devaluation just makes imports look bigger, and the benefit of a lower pound has not come through to exporters yet. The good old J curve, the dismal scientists' standby when things that ought to be getting better actually get worse, was called in as an explanation. Similarly, Lord Hanson's remarks at his company's annual meeting on Tuesday could be taken to support either view. He said he could see signs of recovery, but they would take a long time to feed through to profits because of the amount of stock in the pipeline. It is the speed of the recovery in corporate earnings that will decide the progress of the equity market, since the market is already on a high multiple. Here too there is a wide divergence of views, with forecasts for earnings growth covering an unusually wide range. At least there are some companies which believe they are on the recovery path. Asda and Burton this week called for new capital from shareholders, Asda taking Pounds 347m and Burton Pounds 163m. Both said that the money would be used to revamp and revitalise their store chains. Indeed the two companies' statements were so similar that Asda, which came first, might almost have a breach of copyright claim against Burton. These, Wessex Water's Pounds 144.5m fund-raising this week, plus a number of smaller issues, are expected to be the start of a flood of rights. Asda said it chose the date to get in first, though it does not actually need the cash right now. Institutions, which can see Pounds 50bn of gilt issues heading their way, are likely to be fairly choosy about which companies they will support with new capital. Both Asda and Burton had what amounted to rescue issues in 1991  -a year when rights issues totalled around Pounds 11bn. Perhaps this year's list will repeat many other names from 1991. This week's total of equity fund raising topped Pounds 700m, and if that is only the start, much of the institutions' cashflow must already be spoken for. In fact, with interest rates this low, companies could find debt capital cheaper than equity. But like consumers with big mortgage and credit card debt, the preference may be to repay debt before going out on a shopping spree again. Even so, Wessex Water wanted the money for the purchase of Pounds 113m of NFC's waste division. Hopes for a revival in takeover activity may be premature, though. Two hours after the base rate cut, Lord Hanson told shareholders that not many bargains were around.</p>

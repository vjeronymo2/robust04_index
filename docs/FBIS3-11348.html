			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gabriela Coutino] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 17 March -- We the  cattlemen do not respond to provocations, but we will definitely  not accept the government's intended expropriations. We demand  that the ejidos, the small properties, the Constitution, and the  law be respected, said Cesar Gonzalez Quiroga, president of the  National Confederation of Cattlemen [CNG].    Octovio Albores Cruz, state leader of the National Peasant  Confederation [CNC], reported that the Chiapas government will  form an investigative commission on squatting. The CNC will  participate in this commission to see that the presidential  resolutions are based on documents and appropriately carried out.    Albores Cruz maintained that the union he chairs does not  support squatting. Nevertheless, he warned that once all the  appeals run out and if there is no reply to the peasants'  demands, "I will not be ashamed to say: Let them squat."    Peasants from the San Cristobal de las Casas region are  demanding compensation for nationalized lands, small properties,  and agriculture colonies of 27 ejidos of Cintalapa Municipality.    During a special session of the CNG National Assembly to  support the Chiapas cattle ranchers, Cesar Gonzalez Quiroga  urged the ranchers to remain calm, although he insisted that the  sector has been accused of being Satanic, which is unjust. All  the cattle ranchers of Chiapas and Mexico are working people, he  noted.    Gonzalez Quiroga said in a annoyed tone: "We have respected  the institutions; we have not taken up arms; we are not accusing  anyone; we do not have white guards [guardias blancas]. We have  tractors, plow, and a willingness to work. We will continue to  act within the institutions because we believe that matters  should be solved correctly."    In Gonzalez Quiroga's opinion, the Chiapas conflict is a  priority and a cause of concern for all Mexicans. He also  expressed his desire for a true peace process. He added,  however, that once the peace process has concluded, the CNG take  up its problem once again.    He was then asked: "When will the cattle ranchers' good  sense  prevail?"    I cannot answer for each and every one of them. The call is  for calm and for the problem to be solved. The government is  willing to solve the problem. We have faith and trust in  President Carlos Salinas.    Meanwhile, Alberto Marin Toache, president of the Regional  Cattle Ranchers Union of Northern Chiapas, said that so long as  squatting -- an attack on private property -- continues, "there  will not be peace."    Marin Toache said: "Signing a document does not achieve  peace, particularly because we do not have faith that the  signing of a document with the Zapatists will produce a lasting  peace or that the document is valid."    To sign something firm, the cattlemen's leader insisted, all  those involved must participate, because the unknown, the  hooded, and the masked can retract tomorrow.</p>

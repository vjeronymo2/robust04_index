			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Babcock in Pounds 56m Greek deal GREECE'S Public Power Corporation (PPC) has awarded a Dr19.6bn (Pounds 56m) contract to Babcock Energy Systems, the British engineering company, to upgrade a power station at Lavrion, near Athens, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The PPC intends to help reduce atmospheric pollution in Athens by developing generating capacity outside the city and converting diesel-fired units to natural gas during the 1990s. The project involves transferring a steam turbine from the Keratsini power station in Athens to Lavrion, 40 miles from the capital, which will steam link to two existing gas turbines to form a combined cycle unit, raising the plant's capacity from 114 to 180 MW.</p>

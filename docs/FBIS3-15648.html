			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Hryhoriy Omelchenko, chief of the </F> Security Service Military Counterintelligence Department for  Fighting Organized Crime and Corruption, by unidentified  UKRAYINA MOLODA correspondent in Poltava; date not given:  "Democracy Is a Mother of Order, But Mafia Is Immortal"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] I cannot  ignore your recent statement about $18 billion allegedly  deposited in Western, mostly Swiss, banks by 500 "select"  Ukrainian citizens and your readiness to make public the entire  list of the owners of this fabulous wealth. This statement will  undoubtedly win you more votes in the elections. However,  people that have even a slight idea about professionalism would  laugh at this, saying that having looked for Polubotok's gold in  England [reference to claims that Ukraine should try to recover  the money once deposited by a Ukrainian nobleman in a British  bank]; now we will wait to receive $18 billion from Switzerland.  Where is your list? Where are the facts and documents  acknowledged by foreign financial bodies and governments that  can help recover at least one "dirty" dollar?    [Omelchenko] Let me explain something. The mass media  carried not very precise reports about the news conferences on  the results of the international seminar on fighting the spread  of money laundering, held in Kiev on 15-17 December 1993.  Speaking at that news conference, I pointed out that foreign  media had cited experts and written about $15 or even $18  billion belonging to Ukrainian citizens, commercial, and state  structures and deposited in Western banks. According to our  experts, that figure is exaggerated and the actual sum is $7 to  $8 billion.    What makes us think so? Let me cite some figures. In 1992,  some 1,500 licenses were issued in Ukraine for exporting various  products and raw materials. Not taking into account barter  operations, those products were worth more than $5 billion.  However, the hard currency fund of Ukraine received only $97.7  million. In the first half of 1993, more than $4 billion worth  of products and raw materials were shipped out of Ukraine, while  the budget received only a little more than $100 million. By  summing up these figures we can deduce the volume of foreign  deposits. I spoke about this at the news conference.    Given that almost two-thirds of Ukraine's hard currency is  being kept in Swiss banks, I have asked the chief of the Swiss  Federal Ministry of Justice Criminal Department a couple of  questions. The questions concerned the possible ways to carry  out an investigation of the legality of Ukrainian citizens'  currency operations. In particular, I wanted to know whether  Switzerland would answer our official legal motion to provide  information about concrete Ukrainian deposit-holders suspected  of violations of the law.    With regard to recovering the "dirty dollars," our  "Godfathers" have nothing to worry about. The laws of the Swiss  "bank empire" are very liberal for people like them. Remember  that even after the International Court in the Hague confirmed  the validity of Philippine claims on the $20 billion embezzled  by former dictator Marcos, the money remained in Switzerland.    However this does not mean that Ukraine should hold off on  ratifying the Council of Europe convention on the laundering of  money, and the search, arrest, and confiscation of illegally  acquired profits. Since 1992, the Ukrainian Secret Service  leadership has repeatedly requested that the Supreme Council  discuss this issue. [passage omitted]</p>

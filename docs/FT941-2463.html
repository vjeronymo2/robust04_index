			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / The Monday Interview: Getting out now the going's better - Luciano Benetton tells Andrew Hill about his decision to eschew politics If there is one man who has a right to appear calm, as Italy prepares for next week's landmark elections, it is probably Luciano Benetton. Benetton, 60 next year, founded the Benetton Group with his brothers and sister in 1965, and built it into Italy's best-known and most successful clothing company at a time when the now discredited political regime was at the height of its power. During three decades in which many other enterprises were obliged to pay off local and national politicians, Benetton's reputation remains untarnished. Luciano Benetton now heads a worldwide network of more than 7,000 shops in 110 countries, including Albania and Cuba. Indeed, the only real controversy which has touched the group has been of its own making, in the form of a notorious series of advertising campaigns, culminating most recently in the image of a dead Bosnian soldier's blood-stained battle fatigues, which was banned in certain countries. It was all the more striking, therefore, that Italy's small Republican party should have persuaded Benetton two years ago to stand for election to the Italian parliament's upper house, the Senate. Benetton was one of several respected personalities not previously active in Italian politics who have been helping to supervise the country's technocratic government. However, he will take part in the poll as a mere citizen, not as a candidate for re-election. Is the birth of Italy's 'Second Republic' really the right moment to retreat from active politics? 'I became involved in Italian politics as part of a wider movement striving to overthrow the old political party system,' Benetton says. He now believes Italy has nearly achieved that goal; nearly, but not quite. 'I'm a bit less worried now than before, but there's still a considerable amount of confusion.' More prosaically, he points out that politics takes too much of his time. 'I think specialists are required for politics and you cannot be a specialist in too many things,' he says. 'I would have had to give up my job, which I'm not prepared to do.' It does not seem to worry Benetton that specialists are in short supply for this election campaign. Indeed, the front-runner is another entrepreneur, Silvio Berlusconi, who is leading the polls at the head of a new party, Forza Italia, and fielding a list of candidates mostly new to politics. Benetton is an admirer of Berlusconi's business acumen, but he remains to be convinced about his political skills. 'He (Berlusconi) has said that if he wins, he will create 1m new jobs and reduce taxes for many categories of Italians - well, I think he needs to prove it,' Benetton says. 'It's certainly not going to be an easy task. In this country a lot of money was squandered, a lot of public money was very badly employed and I think that Italians cannot really be told that just one person is going to solve all the problems of the public deficit, just like that.' It is easy to understand why Luciano Benetton feels happier out of politics. The caring, 'green' image of the Benetton Group is largely the work of its chairman. The group's headquarters in a white-painted villa near Treviso in north-east Italy seem a long way from what its chairman describes as the 'boring' but inevitable bluster and hyperbole of the election campaign. Any similarities between Benetton's style and that of other prominent Italian industrialists are superficial. For example, he dismisses the suggestion that the family holding company's 4 per cent stake in a new daily, La Voce, is an attempt to match the media ambitions of other entrepreneurs. The company is simply part of a consortium, he says, investing partly out of 'curiosity', partly out of confidence in La Voce's founding editor, Indro Montanelli, a disgruntled former Berlusconi editor. Benetton is politically to the left of Berlusconi, whose party is allied with the federalist Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance. Although Benetton represented the Republican party, he now seems more likely to favour the recently formed Democratic Alliance, part of the left-of-centre Progressive grouping. In any case, Benetton believes that such distinctions are less and less relevant to the business of managing Italy: 'I believe that the economic programmes (of left and right) should not be too different, because, after all, certain issues which were taboo for many years, such as privatisation and (reduction of) public debt, will have to be faced by any government.' He cites the approach of the technocratic governments of the past two years as an example of what could and should be done. 'Rather than seeing people inventing something new I'd like to see good administrative management being pursued.' In practice, however, Benetton predicts uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of next week's election. He, like many Italians, believes electoral reforms and political alliances will have to be refined, and a second election called. This could usher in a period of more stable British-style politics, dominated by two or three parties. It seems unlikely that short-term confusion in Italian politics will upset the general calm at Benetton Group headquarters. Helped by devaluation of the lira in 1992, and by the abolition of Italy's wage indexation system, the group has continued its tactic of dropping prices to fight the global recession. 'As a company we only want to be able to operate in a country which has a structure and a system that enables us to compete with other countries,' he adds. 'We don't have any specific expectations (of a new government). As Italians, we know that the country will have to change and will have to implement some major projects, in particular the state will have to reduce its presence. But this is important to us as citizens, not as Benetton Group.'</p>

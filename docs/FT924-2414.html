			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wassall puts pressure on Evode WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate that has made a Pounds 94.3m hostile bid for Evode, yesterday said the chemical group was close to breaching a further covenant which could trigger immediate redemption of its Dollars 43m (Pounds 28m) US redeemable shares. Evode has already admitted it had been in breach of its interest covenants relating to the Dollars 43m unlisted US redeemable shares since March 1991. But it argues that the breach is of no concern because shareholders had waived their rights, from the breach of covenants, to appoint a director to Evode's board. In a document sent to Evode's shareholders, Wassall said the company was in danger of breaching a further covenant that would allow holders of the US redeemable preference shares to demand immediate repayment. Evode said it was close to breaching another covenant but only because of the change in accounting rules. It said it was confident of modifying the covenants with the two US preference shareholders, US West, one of the US 'baby Bell' telecommunications companies, and GE Capital. Wassall said Evode was the worst performing manufacturing company out of 12 chemical groups. Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, said Wassall's figures were misleading and that the recent 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to October 3, from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 10.2m, underlined the argument that Wassall's 80p a share offer undervalued the company. Evode's shares fell 2p to close at 94p.</p>

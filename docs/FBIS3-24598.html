Ugarova, Biochemistry </F> Institute imeni A.V. Palladin, Ukraine Academy of Sciences,  Kiev; UDC 577.152.34]    [Abstract] The method of affine chromatography on agarose  with the immobilized dye blue cybacron F3GA (Blue-Sepharose 6B  CL) was used to isolate two thrombin-like enzymes from the venom  of common and eastern pit vipers (Agistrodon halys  halys) and Agkistrodon halys Blomhoffii). The  new enzymes, which were given the respective names Ancistron-H  and Ancistron-B were isolated in homogeneous form. The new  thrombim-like enzymes are serine proteases with respective  molecular masses of 34 and 29 kDa, respective isoelectric points  of 6.6 and 6.3, and respective specific coagulation activities  of 410 and 110 NIH units/mg of protein. Upon incubation with  fibrinogen, they only cleave fibrinopeptide A from the  A_a_-chain, leaving the B_b_- and _g_-chains intact. Both  enzymes were demonstrated to hydrolyze arginine esters and  thrombin-specific chromogenic peptide substrates and to manifest  weak caseinolytic activity and no fibrinolytic activity. The  newly isolated enzymes were used to develop simple  coagulation-based diagnostic indicators to determine the  fibrinogen level in blood plasma during heparin therapy without  the need for any special equipment. Ancistron-H may also be used  for clinical purposes. Tests conducted on rabbits confirmed the  possibility of using it in vivo as a defibrination agent.  Specifically, intravenous [IV] injection of Ancistron-H in a  dose of 300 NIH units per kilogram of body weight resulted in  the death of all of the test animals within 2-5 minutes as a  result of the development of acute thrombosis of the truncal  vessels and in the vicinity of the right ventricle. After IV  injection of Ancistron-H in a dose of 100 NIH units per kilogram  of body weight, all the test animals remained alive; however,  blood taken from them 30 minutes later showed advanced  hypercoagulation. Blood samples taken 120 minutes after the  animals were given IV injections of Ancistron-H in a dose of 25  NIH units per kilogram of body weight, on the other hand,  confirmed the development of deep hypofibrinogenemia. The  possibility of using Ancistron-H for analogous purposes was also  confirmed in experiments studying the effect of a decrease in  fibrinogen level on metastasized L carcinoma in mice. IV  injection of Ancistron-H into the mice's venous sinus in a dose  of 2.5 NIH units per kilogram of body weight induced a decrease  in fibrinogen level to 30 percent of the norm, which in turn  reduced metastasis by a factor of 2.7-3. Experiments on mice  also confirmed the possibility of using Ancistron-H to prolong  the effect of liposomal drugs during correction of the process  of intravascular blood coagulation.

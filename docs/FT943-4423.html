			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Serbia awaits blockade reward There are mounting signs that the international community is preparing to reward Serbia for its month-long blockade of the Bosnian Serbs and that the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, may be willing to allow international observers to monitor the embargo. The German foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, yesterday said he welcomed a decision by the five members of the international contact group on Bosnia to ask the UN security council to discuss easing sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. In a statement, Mr Kinkel said Serbia's blockade was a 'positive development' which 'should be rewarded appropriately'. Mr Kinkel's French counterpart, Mr Alain Juppe, said on Wednesday that Serbia had agreed in principle to allow non-military observers to monitor its embargo of the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Juppe said the details still had to be worked out.</p>

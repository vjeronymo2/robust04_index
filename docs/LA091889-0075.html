			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL SPARKS A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE  </P> <P> The Alice-in-Wonderland effect hit me the minute I walked onto the playground.  </P> <P> It was as though I'd walked through a mirror and once again I was a child  brimming with the jitters of my first day of school.  </P> <P> I had come to James H. Cox Elementary School in Fountain Valley to write a  story about 6-year-old Jessica Brunner starting first grade. As the children  assembled on the blacktop all around me, it seemed to prove the adage: The more  things change, the more they stay the same.  </P> <P> Unexpectedly, I was drawn back into the swirl of feelings that are so universal  they have become living cliches: the excitement and fear of that first day at  school, the openness and enthusiasm of a child's approach to the world, the  blind trust that so many good things lie ahead.  </P> <P> Even though my first day of kindergarten was 26 years ago and 3,000 miles away  on a cool, blustery day in New York, it wasn't so different from that hot  California morning nearly two weeks ago.  </P> <P> As Jessica walked silently up the school driveway holding her mother's hand, my  own school memories of kindergarten and first grade flickered past me, as if  through a camera lens.  </P> <P> Click: The autumn wind was so strong on my first day of kindergarten that it  swept me along as I walked to school, pushing me into a trot. Brown, red and  burnt-orange leaves spiraled down as my mother and I made our way through the  narrow streets of our Long Island town to join the other children streaming  into the brick elementary school.  </P> <P> I was so excited to be in a classroom that it seemed my mother had disappeared  the instant I let go of her hand. I know now that she watched me from the door  for a little while before she left, reluctant to let her youngest child go.  </P> <P> In Jessica's classroom, her teacher showed the children how to push in their  chairs before leaving the classroom at recess and how to stack them neatly on  their desks at the end of the day.  </P> <P> Click: In my kindergarten classroom 26 years ago, Miss Scanapicco, our teacher,  showed us how to spread our towels on the chilly green linoleum floor for nap  time. Later, we got to sit at the big table and pry open little cartons of milk  to drink with our school-issued graham crackers.  </P> <P> Jessica and her class lined up by the door, anxious for playtime after a  morning of patient concentration. Released onto the grass outside, they burst  into shouts.  </P> <P> Click: My classmates and I crowded through the coatroom, then filed onto the  playground. It seemed impossibly big and adventurous, with a jungle gym,  merry-go-round, slides and other things. On a visit years later, I marveled  that the crumbling asphalt and battered play equipment had inspired such  expansive excitement.  </P> <P> When Jessica's teacher asked her bright-eyed pupils what they would like to  learn this year, their hands shot up into the air with suggestions. They wanted  to know all about reading, science, animals, insects, math.  </P> <P> Click: In first grade I learned to tell time, practicing by pushing the arms  around and around on the face of a huge cardboard clock. It seemed that in an  instant I had learned a long-sought-after secret and gained entree into the  grown-ups' world.  </P> <P> Jessica and her friends practiced writing their names over and over on the  black lines of a yellow workbook, and then drew pictures of themselves with  brightly colored crayons.  </P> <P> Click: I flashed on another first-grade memory. In this snapshot, I was  practicing writing the letters of the alphabet on off-white paper with tiny  turquoise flecks. Painstakingly, I squeezed the forms between the solid and  dotted blue lines.  </P> <P> These pictures sped through my mind and the characters in them began to move,  just as the figures in separate frames of film come to life when fed through a  movie projector.  </P> <P> As I sat at the back of Jessica's classroom, watching her recite the Pledge of  Allegiance with her class, I felt the weight of the distance I had traveled  since my own first day of school.  </P> <P> It seemed eons ago that I was as cheerful and optimistic as Jessica and her  classmates. Somewhere along the way, I learned to guard myself, to hesitate, to  calculate.  </P> <P> And as I watched Jessica smiling at her new friends, it seemed that in learning  those things, I had learned far too much.  </P></p>

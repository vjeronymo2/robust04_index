			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Cookery: Serious salads for summer Salads that consist of a few fragile leaves are all very well for ladies who toy with lunch, but now that the summer holiday season is here, lunchtime salads need to be substantial enough to satisfy grown men and ravenous teenagers. Salade Nicoise used to be one of my regular summer lunchtime standbys. Greek salad with cucumber, tomato, thyme, oregano, feta cheese and black olives is another old favourite. I am partial to a waxy potato salad with a robust mustardy dressing, a snowstorm of mustard and cress and thick slices of good meaty Cumberland sausage or bratwurst. A cheese, egg and crouton-rich Caesar salad, with or without anchovies, is excellent albeit lightweight. Better is a salad of raw baby spinach mixed with segments of orange and slivers of fennel laced with snippets of fried bacon, sauteed chicken livers and chopped hard-boiled egg. SAVOURY SUMMER SALAD Drawing inspiration from both Salade Nicoise and Greek salad, this makes an attractive lunch dish for four or a first course for more people. 1 1/4 lb or so French beans; 1 lb salad potatoes (preferably La Ratte, Charlotte, BF 15 or Pink Fir Apple); 2 1/2 -3oz walnut pieces; 2-3 shallots; 2-3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves; 4 tablespoons vinaigrette dressing; 2 dozen black olives; 4-5oz feta cheese; 2-3 pot marigold flowers (not tagetes or French marigolds, which are poisonous); a nosegay of nasturtium flowers, carefully inspected and shaken to rid them of any wildlife. Chop the shallots finely. Put them into a salad bowl, pour on the vinaigrette and leave to soak while you prepare the other ingredients. Spread the walnuts on a baking tray and toast them in an oven heated to 375'F (190'C) gas mark 5 until their colour deepens and their flavour intensifies. This will happen swiftly so watch them like a hawk. If overcooked they become horribly bitter. Steam or boil the potatoes and beans until just tender. Slice the cooked potatoes thickly and strip away the skins or leave them on, as you wish. Add the potatoes and coriander to the shallots and toss until everything gleams with the vinaigrette dressing. Add the beans, which can be left whole or cut in half, and the olives and toss again to anoint the beans. Crumble the cheese into small pieces and sprinkle it over the salad together with the toasted walnuts. Toss once more, briefly and very gently this time. Turn the salad out on to a large flat serving dish. Pull the petals from the marigolds and scatter them over the top. Finally, tuck the nasturtium flowers into the salad here and there. Serve with good bread. AUBERGINE FATTOUSH Here is an agreeably quick and easy way to cook aubergine. It is equally good whether or not the aubergine is salted prior to cooking, so I omit that preliminary. This dish will serve two to four depending on appetite and on what else is served. If you make larger quantities it is probably best to saute the vegetables in batches - just   1/2 lb or so at a time. 1 plump, glossy and firm aubergine weighing 8-10oz;  1/2 lb courgettes; 1 tablespoon virgin olive oil; 1 lemon;  1/2 -1 naan bread; 2 tablespoons or more chopped coriander leaves; 1 1/2 tablespoons or more chopped mint; 1 tablespoon or more chopped parsley. Partially peel the aubergine, stripping the skin from stalk end to base, so it is striped with peeled and unpeeled bands. Then cut the aubergine across into  1/2 - 3/4 in thick slices, cut each slice into two half moons, then into wedges. Cut the courgettes into pieces about the same size as the aubergine chunks. If the courgettes are young and slim, thickly sliced rounds are appropriate. If they are large round the girth, each slice will need cutting into wedges. Thoroughly heat a large saute pan. Sizzle half a tablespoon of olive oil in it and saute the courgettes over fairly high heat for three minutes only, so they retain some crunch. Tip them into a shallow serving dish and add another half tablespoon of oil to the pan. When it is sizzling add the aubergine. Toss quickly in the modicum of hot oil and saute over high heat for three minutes until just tender and streaked with gold. While the vegetables are cooking, damp and refresh the bread with a splash of cold water. Shake off excess liquid and grill for one minute on each side. Cool slightly before tearing into bite-size pieces. Tip the cooked aubergine on to the courgettes. Add the herbs, toasted and torn bread, a good grinding of pepper, a little salt and at least 1 table-spoon of lemon juice. Toss to mix well. Taste and add extra herbs, lemon and / or salt as needed. Serve soon while the bread is flavoured with the other ingredients but before it turns soggy.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Fear of persecution as Haitian boat people return ADVOCATES of refugee rights fear thousands of Haitian boat people forced to return from the US will be persecuted in their home towns and villages, AP reports from Port-au-Prince. Red Cross officials said the US authorities told them that the Coast Guard cutter carrying the first 150 returnees was expected to dock today. The cutter Steadfast left Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba yesterday after a US Supreme Court ruling on Friday cleared the way for the repatriation. Earlier returnees appeared to draw little official interest at the bustling Port-au-Prince seafront, but rights advocates contend that the returnees become targets when they arrive at their homes. They say the Haitian security apparatus functions most effectively at local level. 'Many of those who return will die,' said Mr Paul Latortue, a Haitian economist who teaches at the University of Puerto Rico. The US military has operated a tent city at Guantanamo Bay since the September 30 military coup in Haiti and subsequent trade embargo against the Caribbean nation sent more than 14,000 Haitians fleeing in small boats. Red Cross workers will give the returnees about Dollars 15 (Pounds 8.20), some assistance with transport and a food-aid card.</p>

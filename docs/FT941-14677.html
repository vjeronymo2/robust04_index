			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Fortune Oil in Pounds 5.5m Chinese joint venture Fortune Oil, the London-quoted energy company partly owned by Chinese state interests, has entered into a Pounds 5.5m joint venture to sell liquefied petroleum gas in southern China. The 25-year agreement is with ZGC, a local gas company in Zhanjiang, a coastal city of some 3m inhabitants in Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong. Vitol Energy, one of Fortune's main shareholders, is also involved. Fortune's share of the investment will be about Pounds 1.5m. The company was created last year via the acquisition by Blackland Oil, a former USM company, of Kingsleigh Petroleum of Hong Kong. It was the London market's first 'red chip' company with direct Chinese state ownership.</p>

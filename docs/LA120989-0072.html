			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. ADOPTS LENINGRAD AS ITS 16TH 'SISTER  CITY'  </P> <P> The City Council adopted Leningrad as Los Angeles' newest "Sister City" Friday,  but in light of continued complaints of human rights abuses in that Soviet  city, the formal resolution was amended with a call for political reform.  </P> <P> Councilman Joel Wachs, who proposed the link between the two cities, said he  hoped the new relationship would "extend the cause of peace, freedom and  understanding between the people of the Soviet Union and the people of this  country."  </P> <P> Los Angeles has 15 other such agreements with cities throughout the world, but  the relationship with Leningrad is the first between Los Angeles and a Soviet  city. Both cities are the second largest in their respective countries.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS SHED SUPERPOWER ROLE, STRESS EUROPEAN TIES  </P> <P> A new European power will make its debut at the all-European summit meeting in  Paris this week -- the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not be attending the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as the leader of one of the two global  superpowers, except to end a role that the Soviet Union has played for four  decades.  </P> <P> Instead, he will be anchoring his troubled country firmly in Europe, which he  calls "our common home" and which his advisers describe as "the growth  Continent."  </P> <P> Moscow, to put it directly, is taking itself out of superpower politics and  resuming its position as "a great European power," in the words of Soviet  foreign policy specialists.  </P> <P> The implications of this shift in Soviet policy are far-reaching, affecting the  balance of power around the world, ending the bipolar Soviet-American rivalry,  extending the unification of Europe and strengthening the development of  international institutions.  </P> <P> While other important elements are also at work, the fundamental transformation  of Soviet foreign policy in the past five years has been crucial to the recent  international realignment, and Soviet foreign affairs specialists predict more  changes, particularly in Europe.  </P> <P> "Europe is coming into an absolutely new stage of its history," Alexander  Churbanyan, a leading Soviet specialist on Europe, said last week in an  interview. "In the next two or three years, we will be creating a new  architecture, politically, economically and socially, for Europe, and not just  for this decade but for the start of the century we will be entering.  </P> <P> "For the Soviet Union, this is of the utmost importance because it means our  reintegration into a civilization from which we have been cut off, not just for  the 45 years of the Cold War, but even longer. . . . And this reintegration  will come, we hope and believe, at the point of 'takeoff,' economically and  politically, both for Europe and for us."  </P> <P> Although it retains a substantial nuclear arsenal and conventional military  power, a special relationship with the United States and interests in Asia and  the Middle East that befit it as a transcontinental nation, the Soviet Union  considers itself very much a down-sized superpower today, lacking both the  resources and the desire to play the global role it previously pursued.  </P> <P> "We never understood ourselves as a real superpower," Sergei A. Karaganov,  deputy director of the Institute of Europe, a leading Soviet think tank, said  in an interview. "We saw ourselves as underdogs, in fact, and in trying to  compensate we pretended that we and our allies were the equal of the United  States and its allies. In fact, we overreached, and it brought us very few  pluses politically and none economically.  </P> <P> "We are renouncing this status -- that is one quite significant meaning of the  Paris conference -- and we are resuming the role that Russia has played  historically, that of a great European power. Our efforts to match the United  States as a superpower hastened our decline and masked that of Washington."  </P> <P> To those who have advocated this basic rethinking of Kremlin foreign policy and  attempted to turn the loss of its superpower influence into an advantage, this  transformation frees the Soviet Union to concentrate its energy and resources  on resolving its own multiple political and economic problems.  </P> <P> "This reduces the potential for foreign conflicts and gives us a freer hand in  foreign policy," Karaganov argued. "But the key thing its that it allows us to  concentrate on what is really decisive for our security and prosperity -- the  restructuring of our economy and our political system. The Soviet Union's  difficulties are, in some respects, the concern of all Europe; certainly, they  are the greatest threat to our security today. . . .  </P> <P> "If we resolve these problems, we may in time reverse our country's  international decline, which has been going on for some years. If we don't,  well, then we are really talking about the survival of the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> But Karaganov, Churbanyan and others argue that the restoration of the Soviet  Union's place in Europe will have important consequences for the country's  political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> "The postwar division of Europe was a strategic disaster for the Soviet Union,  a blunder of enormous magnitude," Karaganov asserted. "Yes, we gained a buffer  in Eastern Europe, and Stalin had the satisfaction of seeing socialism spread.  </P> <P> "But look at the hatred that brought the Soviet Union, the suspicion, the  isolation. We were forced into alliances with weak countries. We were cut off  from European civilization and the continental economy. Internally, it created  a system of conservative politics and institutionalized the military-industrial  complex. . . .  </P> <P> "To put it another way, 1989 brought our liberation along with that of Eastern  and Central Europe," he said. "With the reduction of NATO troops, particularly  that of American forces on our Western borders, our security is enhanced. Our  neighbors no longer view us as occupiers. The European Community is opening its  market to us and investing here. Real changes are coming."  </P> <P> And Soviet foreign affairs specialists increasingly are convinced that Europe  is where their country should position itself. To them it means greater  security, political stability, economic growth and cultural ties.  </P> <P> What they are now discussing is the "architecture" of this new Europe, hoping  to shape it to Soviet needs.  </P> <P> "When we proposed the concept of a common European home, many in the West saw  it as a tricky new Soviet attempt to dominate the Continent," Vladimir G.  Baranovsky, a European specialist at the Institute of World Economy and  International Relations, another prominent Soviet think tank, said in an  interview, "and there were probably grounds for suspicion.  </P> <P> "But the pan-European movement has won wide acceptance. Hans-Dietrich Genscher  (the German foreign minister) talks about the 'new European political order,'  and President Francois Mitterrand (of France) speaks of the 'confederation of  Europe.' The idea of the 'common European home' was ours, and we are happy to  see others develop it because we will need a new framework to replace that  (which was) built in the Cold War and now, thankfully, gone."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is pushing for the transformation of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, which for the past 15 years has been mostly  a series of multilateral negotiations and occasional ministerial meetings, into  a full-fledged institution of the new Europe to deal with the aftermath of the  Cold War and the new problems likely to develop in the future. A key project is  creation of a conflict-prevention center, but further arms-reduction talks are  also a priority over the next three years.  </P> <P> "Problems are not going to disappear, the euphoria will quickly wear thin and  the reality of this 'new Europe' will be harder than people think," Alexei G.  Arbatov, a specialist in security and arms control, commented in an interview.  "And the ways in which we dealt with problems and with one another during the  Cold War are no longer appropriate. . . .  </P> <P> "We still have huge standing armies, but it matters a great deal how we reduce  them so we do not disrupt the stability we have achieved. We have the  possibility of internal unrest that could now spill across borders. There is  the issue of migration from the East, there is the potential for old rivalries  and nationalisms to stir again and there is the possibility perhaps of an  upheaval like the breakup of Yugoslavia. These could even make some yearn for  the 'good old days.' "  </P> <P> A senior Western diplomat, asking not to be quoted by name as he briefed  journalists on the Paris meeting, said that the United States and its North  Atlantic Treaty Organization allies are ready to support this transition.  </P> <P> "If the Soviet Union wants to use this process for legitimate security goals,  let's help them," he said.  </P> <P> A senior Soviet diplomat, who also has been involved in the CSCE since the  preliminary talks began in Helsinki in 1972, described its evolution as "a  demonstration of flexibility, pragmatism and adaptability."  </P> <P> "If there was the political will, this all-European process provided the way,  and we are convinced that it will continue to do so and deserves to be  institutionalized further," he said, asking not to be quoted by name.  </P> <P> "This is a process that our country is quite happy with. It is productive, it  enhances security, it encourages a multilateral approach to problems, it  stresses cooperation rather than confrontation. The gains may have been  incremental, but they now add up to quite a change."  </P></p>

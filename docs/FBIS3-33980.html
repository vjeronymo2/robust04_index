The Chinese team, which will also include officials of the  China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) -- the manufacturer  of S-20 submarine -- was earlier scheduled to arrive here by  January 31 for detailed negotiations on the possibility of  selling out three units of S-20 to Pakistan.    Official sources told `The News' on Thursday: "Now the  Chinese team will reach here towards the end of first half of  February."    The CSSC is offering its on-trial newly-designed S-20  submarines to Pakistan. The cost of three units will be nearly  540 million US dollars.    Meanwhile, week-long talks with Swedish team for T-96 have  already been completed and detailed negotiations with the  visiting French team are currently under way for Agosta 90B  submarine which is an ungraded but non-nuclear version of Agosta  being manufactured by DCN-I of France.    Official sources confirmed that talks for the purchase of  submarines are being held only with three countries, France,  Sweden and China. These sources say that "though possibility of  negotiations with any other country cannot be totally ruled out,  at present Pakistan has not invited any other country, except  these three, for negotiations on the particular subject."    Defence sources told 'The News' that Pakistan wants to sign  the contract for the purchase of three submarines as early as  possible once the on-going process of pre-contract negotiations  with these three countries are completed.</p>

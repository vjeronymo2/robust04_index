			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Soley hearings on press under way LABOUR MP Mr Clive Soley stepped up his campaign yesterday for a statutory body to handle complaints against newspapers when he held the first of a series of parliamentary public hearings on freedom and responsibility of the press, Jimmy Burns writes. Evidence was submitted by victims of inaccurate press reporting to a cross-party committee as part of a privately funded inquiry into the likely impact of Mr Soley's bill. Mr Soley said there was a 'growing consensus' that the statutory provision of the right to correct inaccuracies in newspaper reporting was the only way of making the newspaper industry 'acknowledge the failure of self-regulation'. Those giving evidence yesterday included a former maid of Princess Anne wrongly accused of having stolen her employer's private letters, and a former Northern Irish journalist who gave evidence in camera because his life had been threatened as a result of a misleading newspaper report. Mr Soley's Freedom and Responsibility of the Press Bill has its second reading in the House of Commons on January 29 and the committee will take further evidence from newspaper editors and the Press Complaints Commission.</p>

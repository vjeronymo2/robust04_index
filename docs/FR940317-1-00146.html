			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) If the injured party or his attorney fails to cooperate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the claims office, the RJA is authorized to direct the MTF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel to withhold billing information and should vigorously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursue the Government's right to recover. In addition, as outlined in 32 CFR 537.23, the RJA is authorized to direct the MTF to withhold release of medical records until the injured party provides the statement and other information required by &sect;536.226(a)(2); the RJA may not, however, direct the MTF to withhold medical records if the injured party's attorney merely refuses to enter into a representation agreement. In appropriate cases, the claims office should intervene in pending litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If the injured party's attorney improperly withholds or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disburses money collected on behalf of the Government, the RJA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should immediately initiate action to recover the money owed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through litigation or through State disciplinary proceedings after appropriate coordination in accordance with AR 27&hyph;40 and AR 27&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Claims personnel may obtain an assignment from the injured party or his attorney for the reasonable value of the care that the United States provided if this will facilitate collection. The absence of an assignment does not affect the Government's independent right under the FMCRA, however, and an assignment is normally not necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.227  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> The MTF Third Party Recovery Program (TPCP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOD Claims offices and MTFs manage complementary programs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recover for medical care furnished at DOD expense.

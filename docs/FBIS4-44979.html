			<p>CSO     [Text] Madras, May 4.    Elections to town panchayats, municipalities and municipal  corporations would be held before November this year and elected  councils to these bodies would be formed by that month, the  Local Administration Minister, Mr. T.M. Selvaganapathy,  announced in the Assembly today.    The Minister was replying to the discussions on Bills  seeking  to bring the Municipalities Act in conformity with the Central  Government's Nagarpalika Act.    He expressed his inability to hold the elections in the next  three months, as the Government had to take follow-up action on  several heads after the passage of the legislation.    He said the Government had to prepare the electoral rolls,  identify the seats and posts for reservation for SC/ST  [expansion not given] and women and frame the rules under these  statutes. Hence it required the six months time-limit provided  for in the Act for the holding of the elections.  <H5>  Mayoral Poll </H5>   With the upgradation of the municipalities of Tiruchi,  Tirunelveli and Salem into municipal corporations, direct  elections would be held for six posts of Mayors. Of these six  posts, two would be reserved for women and one for SC/ST and the  reservation would be by rotation.    Chairpersons of municipalities would be elected directly and  one-third of the posts would be reserved for women. For SC/ST,  the reservation would be on the basis of their population for  which the 1991 census would be the base. These reserved posts  too would go by rotation.    Municipalities with more than three lakhs population would  have independent ward committees, for which suitable provisions  had been made in the new Act, he said.    Mr. Selvaganapathy detailed the salient provisions of the  Bill, and said the new statute would enable these local bodies  to associate themselves in the planning process.  <H5>  Turns Down Demand </H5>   He turned down a demand that MLAs [Member of Legislative  Assembly] and MPs [Member of Parliament] participating in these  elected councils should have no voting right. The 74th amendment  to the Constitution made it mandatory. Likewise election to the  post of Mayor too had to be directly by the people under the  Central Act, he said.    In the discussions, Mr. Gnanasekaran (Cong.-I) welcomed the  mandatory election to these local bodies once in five years. He  wanted the Government to hold elections within three months  after the passage of the bill.    Mr. M. Sundardoss (Cong.-I) opposed direct election to the  post of Mayor of municipal corporations. The reservation for  women and SC/ST should not be by nominations, but by enabling  these segments to win the elections through proper  identification of the wards for them.    Others who participated included Mr. Deivanayagam (Cong.-I),  Mr. O.S. Amarnath (AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam]) and Mr. V. Thambusamy (CPI-M [Communist Party of  India-Marxist]).    After the Minister's reply, the Bills were passed.    The House also adopted after a brief discussion the Bill  which amended the Public Property (Prevention of Damage and  Loss) Act.    The new Bill provides for punishment of the persons who  actually caused damage or loss to the private property and to  make the political parties or communal or ethnic groups which  organised procession, assembly, meeting, agitation,  demonstration or other activities leading to violence also  liable to pay compensation.  <H5>  Authorised Officer </H5>   Replying to the discussion on the Bill, the Leader of the  House, Mr. V.R. Nedunchezhian, said that the Commissioner for  Revenue Administration would be the authorised officer to whom  the petitions for compensation should be made.    He also said that this legislation would itself be a  deterrent to those indulging in violence. In the absence of this  measure the Government would be handicapped against taking  action against the culprits.</p>

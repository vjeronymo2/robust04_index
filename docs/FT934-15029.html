			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Polish investors buy cement plant POLAND is to sell one of the country's most modern cement works, in Ozarow, to a group of domestic investors led by the Polish Development Bank (PBR), Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the outgoing privatisation minister, announced yesterday. The decision comes in a letter of intent signed yesterday with the state-owned PBR as well as management and unions at the plant. It follows the sale in July of stakes in two Polish plants, which account for a quarter of Poland's cement output, to Cimenteries CBR of Belgium for DM90.4m (Dollars 56.5m). CBR has since sold a 43 per cent share of its equity to Heidelberger Zement, Germany's largest producer of building materials. The Ozarow plant has a 15 per cent share of the market and expects to report a 100bn zlotys (Dollars 5m) net profit on sales of 850bn zlotys, which represents a 30 per cent increase on 1992 sales. It was completed in 1977, along with Gorazdze, one of the two plants sold to CBR. 'I think this decision should be in line with the next coalition's thinking,' said Mr Lewandowski of the way the new left-of-centre government, which is expected to be formed following last month's elections, would view the letter of intent on Ozarow. He criticised the Belgian group for not informing him that it was on the verge of the sale to the German group as negotiations of their purchases in Poland were proceeding. He also said that the International Finance Corporation, a World Bank affiliate which is advising the ministry on the privatisation of the cement sector, had failed to warn him of the impending change in ownership at CBR. 'If I had known I would have re-evaluated my decision,' Mr Lewandowski said. He added that at least 25 per cent of the remaining shares in Gorazdze would be be sold to the Polish group, which is made up of banks, private companies and management. This would see the creation of a base for a Polish capital group in the cement industry.</p>

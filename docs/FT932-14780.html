			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Price war behind 18% fall in Apple net A FEROCIOUS price war in the US personal computer industry led Apple Computer yesterday to report an 18 per cent drop in second-quarter net income, despite strong demand for its products. The company said net income totalled Dollars 110.9m, or 92 cents a share, compared to Dollars 135.1m, or Dollars 1.09 a share, in the same period of last year. Revenues, however, rose 15 per cent to Dollars 1.97bn from Dollars 1.72bn. The company's gross profit margin dropped to 38.5 per cent of net sales, compared with 44 per cent in the second quarter of 1992. It blamed this on new product introductions and 'pricing actions aimed at aggressively positioning Apple for faster unit growth'. The company has been suffering a shortage of products because of the introduction of new machines and short supplies of strategic components. But it said these problems eased toward the end of the quarter and it believed it was 'well positioned for revenue and unit growth in the second half'. Mr John Sculley, chairman, said that 'demand for Apple systems remains strong, our revenue growth accelerated during the quarter, and we are growing market share'. Sales volume of the company's Macintosh PC products rose 38 per cent in the second quarter relative to last year, with US sales up more than 50 per cent. For the first six months Apple reported net income of Dollars 272.2m, or Dollars 2.25 a share, compared with Dollars 301.1m, or Dollars 2.45 a share, on revenues up from Dollars 3.58bn to Dollars 3.97bn. Domestic net revenues grew more than 23 per cent in the second quarter, compared with the same period of 1992, and the company said net international revenues were also growing.</p>

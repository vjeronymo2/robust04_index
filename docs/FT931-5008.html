			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / IMF approves credit for Poland THE IMF has approved a Dollars 655m (Pounds 461m) stand-by credit to Poland partly aimed at reducing the country's Dollars 46bn debt, George Graham reports from Washington. The Fund suspended an earlier arrangement with Poland in 1991 as the country failed to meet targets for curbing inflation and cutting the budget deficit. The Polish parliament last month approved a tight budget aimed at lopping the deficit to 81,000bn zlotys (Pounds 3.4bn) or 5 per cent of GDP, opening the way for the IMF to give its approval to a new economic plan. The IMF said yesterday the Polish authorities had asked for a quarter of each disbursement from the stand-by credit to be set aside for debt reduction, and said it would be prepared to increase the credit if a debt reduction agreement could be reached with commercial bank creditors.</p>

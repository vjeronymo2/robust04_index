			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by staff reporter Zheng Yuanyuan (6774 0954 </F> 0954): "United States Wants Western Europe To Take On Greater  Responsibilities"]    [Text] Paris, 9 Jun (RENMIN RIBAO)--Clinton visited Italy,  Britain, and France between 2 and 8 June. He attended  commemoration activities for the 50th anniversary of the Allied  landings in Normandy and also exchanged opinions with the  leaders of the three countries in order to improve the  partnership with the European allies.    On 7 June, Clinton gave a speech to the French National  Assembly, and this attracted extensive attention from the mass  media. The speech mainly expressed the following three points:  First, post-Cold War Europe is facing some serious challenges,  mainly from ethnic and religious contradictions and the  consequent conflicts and civil wars inside the former Soviet  Union and the East European countries. Second, the United  States "supports a strong Europe," and, at the same time, will  not rescind its military commitment to Europe. Third, a strong  Europe should be built with all the countries of East and West  Europe tied by security, economic, and democratic bonds.    Clinton expressed support for a powerful Europe, but this in  fact indicates that the United States hopes Western Europe will  take on greater responsibilities for resolving the many  difficult problems of post-Cold War Europe. Therefore, Clinton  gave up, to a certain degree, his predecessors' attitude of  having reservations about European integration, especially in  the aspect of European defense. This is a major change. After  the end of the Cold War, the United States became the sole  superpower in the world, but its strength is declining and it  lacks the ability to continue to act as the "world's policeman"  to extinguish the flames of war in various hot spots. The  Clinton administration has thus adopted a policy of no direct  interference in local conflicts that do not directly endanger  the "fundamental interests" of the United States. In such  circumstances, the United States has decided to let Europe  shoulder greater security responsibilities. That is, Europe  will be encouraged to expand and strengthen its own  organizations and institutions in order to restrain and  eliminate local conflicts.    Supporting a powerful Europe is something the United States  can do at present to reduce its responsibilities without running  any risks. This is because a lot of uncertainties remain in the  outlook for the East European countries and about their  participation in the European Union. A European defense system  remains in an "embryonic" state, and it will take time for it to  develop. Therefore, a so-called "strong Europe" will not  challenge the leading position of the United States in the  alliance for the time being, and the United States could also  strengthen itself while Europe undergoes the prolonged  adjustment process from turbulence to stability. On the other  hand, this will be a giant challenge for Western Europe, as it  will have to make greater efforts to solve issues which concern  the destiny of Europe.    To encourage Europe take on greater responsibilities, a  major  step taken by the United States was to improve relations with  France. France is a very influential member of the European  Union. Clinton chose to give the speech in France because he  wanted to make a good impression on France and thus ease the  tense relationship between the two countries in the past few  years caused by the GATT negotiations and the Bosnia crisis. At  present, France is trying hard to add a "social chapter" to the  world trade talks in order to restrict imports from developing  countries and to protect French products. Therefore, it needs  U.S. support. Clinton and Balladur reached a consensus in their  talks and agreed that the two countries should set up an expert  team to work out a draft for discussion at the G-7 summit in  Naples. Clinton also showed flexibility on handling the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. He needs France's understanding and  tolerance toward the U.S. policy of "not sending ground troops."  So Clinton praised France's "great contribution" to the  settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and consented to a  "European peace plan."    Reaction to Clinton's European trip and his speech to the  French National Assembly varied in the three West European  countries. Clinton's praise of the European Union, especially  Franco-German cooperation, delighted Mitterrand, the founder of  the European Union, but left Britain feeling deflated because  the "Anglo-American special relationship" was played down.  Public opinion in Italy, however, held that Clinton's visit  showed mistrust of the new government.    Finally, it should be pointed out that during his trip to  Europe, Clinton did not forget to call for strengthening the  internal unity of the Atlantic alliance. He tried to use the  Normandy commemoration activities to review the historical  experience of "being comrades-in-arms fighting a bloody battle  against common enemies" 50 years ago in order to strengthen  NATO's internal cooperation with the United States as the core.  However, the cohesive force between the two sides of the  Atlantic Ocean is getting weaker, and Clinton's call did not  gain an explicit response. In his talks with Clinton,  Mitterrand said that France would be a faithful partner, but  also an "unruly partner." He also explicitly indicated that  France would not return to NATO's integrated military structure.    Clinton's trip to the three West European countries shows  that Europe remains the focus of U.S. global strategy, but it  also indicates that European-U.S. relations will encounter more  difficult problems in the course of readjustments while Western  Europe takes up greater security responsibilities.</p>

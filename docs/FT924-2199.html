			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Australia faces an identity crisis - The growing level of foreign ownership Picture a typical Australian. He wears an Akubra hat and Drizabone raincoat, drives a Holden car, and lunches off Vegemite sandwiches washed down with Castlemaine XXXX beer or a glass of Jacob's Creek wine. Many Australians would see such a 'typical Aussie' as a caricature. But most would also regard the locally-made products as cultural icons, each of which expresses something about what it means to be Australian. Yet only Akubra is Australian owned. Holden and Vegemite are US-owned, Castlemaine is run from New Zealand, Drizabone is British, and Jacob's Creek, part of the Orlando Wyndham group, is French. These are not isolated cases. More than half of the Australian beer industry is foreign-controlled, as is about 70 per cent of processed food production, 90 per cent of daily newspaper circulation, and much of the wine industry. The Labor government has taken a relaxed view of the growing level of foreign ownership, arguing that each case should be dealt with on its merits. The Foreign Investment Review Board approves 95 per cent of applications from overseas companies to acquire stakes of more than 15 per cent in Australian companies. But concern about the level of foreign ownership is beginning to emerge among economic nationalists such as Mr Harry Palmer, president of the Australian Owned Companies Association, who wants a ban on further foreign acquisitions. Most attention is focused on a gradual restructuring of the food industry, which analysts say could leave Australia without a single locally-owned major manufacturer. The most recent deal is a ADollars 430m (Dollars 296.8m) offer by United Biscuits of the UK for the snacks business of Coca-Cola Amatil, which will transfer 56 per cent of the Australian snacks market to British hands. The deal is not typical because the snacks business is in effect being transferred from one foreign owner to another - CCA is itself 51 per cent owned by Coca-Cola, the US drinks company. However, Mr Jonathan Rabinovitz, food industry analyst at Potter Warburg Securities, says it provides a good illustration of the three main driving forces behind the restructuring. These are: shedding of non-core businesses by companies which expanded their product mix in the 1980s; expansion of core food activities by the major manufacturers; and growing international interest in Australia and New Zealand as a base for building business in the rapidly expanding Asian market. Mr Rabinovitz says the deal allows CCA to concentrate on its profitable beverage bottling business, while adding to the core business of UB by delivering market leadership in an important regional market. UB has also made clear that it sees the deal as an opportunity to establish an Asia-Pacific bridgehead from which to compete with PepsiCo, the US soft drinks company, with which it is battling for worldwide market share. Some of the same driving forces can be identified in other recent food industry developments, including: The NZDollars 566m (Dollars 292.6m) purchase by Heinz, the US food group, of the Wattie food business in New Zealand from Goodman Fielder Wattie. Mr Tony O'Reilly, Heinz chairman, has made clear that he plans to use Wattie's efficient plants to attack the Asian market. GFW's ADollars 330m acquisition of the Uncle Toby's food group in Australia as part of its attempt to become the biggest manufacturer of cereal-based branded food products in the Asia/Pacific region. The acquisition by Pacific Dunlop of the Petersville Sleigh brands from the collapsed Adsteam group, formerly controlled by Mr John Spalvins. Pacific Dunlop already has a strong presence in Asia/Pacific markets. The battle for control of Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, for which Campbell Soup of the US is bidding ADollars 8.80 a share, valuing the group at ADollars 1.2bn. Campbell wants to use Arnotts to spearhead a major sales drive in Asia. Arnotts has rejected the bid, and is basing its defence partly on an appeal to the FIRB to prevent ownership passing overseas, which it claims will involve no advantages in terms of technology or marketing skills. Mr Rabinovitz says the strong attraction of Australia to international companies, combined with the relative weakness of the surviving locally-owned companies, suggests the Campbell bid is likely to be 'just the beginning of the ultimate domination of the food sector' by multi-nationals. 'First, the low probability of successfully tackling the multinationals head on is unlikely to justify the risks . . . of going it alone offshore without an alliance with a strong and already established multi-national. 'Second, on their home front, Australian food companies (will) face a tough trading environment as the multi-nationals increase their already strong grip on the domestic market,' he says. Mr Rabinovitz suggests that the milling group Defiance Mills and the dairy-based companies National Foods and QUF Industries are prime candidates for takeover by one of the larger global players. GFW, the largest food business in Australasia, is better protected, but has performed poorly in recent years and faces limited domestic growth opportunities. 'It makes eminent sense for GFW to seek a strategic alliance with one or more multinational food groups in the future. Alternatively, (it) may prove attractive to a major food group seeking to bolster its own core operations,' he says. Much may depend on the outcome of the Arnotts battle. The final decision on whether to allow the bid to proceed will be taken by Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, who has said he will take into account Campbell's ability to assist Arnotts in increasing sales to Asia. That is not the same as saying that the bid will be decided on grounds of economic nationalism, but it does mean that Campbell will have to convince Australians that the bid is in the national interest, as well as in shareholders' interests.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will set up a forum to promote tourism between the two countries  as one way to help correct the bilateral trade imbalance, the  Ministry of Transport said Monday [20 June].    The program aims to double the total number of tourists to  each country every year to about eight million people by the  year 2000.    Officials said the ministry has agreed with the U.S.  Commerce  Department to set up the joint forum for the program and to hold  the first meeting in the U.S. sometime in fall.    Some 3.5 million Japanese visit the U.S. every year at  present, while 500,000 Americans come to Japan annually.    Japanese tourists pump about 10 billion dollars more into  the  U.S. economy per year than is generated in tourism-related  spending in Japan by Americans.    If the number of tourists on each side was doubled and thus  Japanese tourism spending in the U.S. double-folded, it would  help put a dent in the huge trade imbalance which is currently  in Japan's favor, the officials said.    The program is also expected to deepen people's  understanding  of one another's nation, they said.</p>

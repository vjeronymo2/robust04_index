			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Aim is for more police efficiency - Criminal justice THE NEXT stages of the government's pledge to give priority to fighting crime will be contained in a wide-ranging Criminal Justice Bill. It will address an array of issues, from providing stronger powers to detain young offenders to abolishing suspects' right to silence and applying tighter restrictions on the granting of bail. A separate Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill announced in yesterday's Queen's Speech is designed to make the police service and administration of local courts more efficient. The Bill will: Abolish the suspect's so called right to silence, allowing courts to draw an inference from a suspect's refusal to answer questions at the police station or during court proceedings. Tighten the bail laws by giving powers of immediate arrest for breach of police bail, allowing the prosecution to apply for bail to be revoked and removing the presumption in favour of bail for people alleged to have offended while on bail. Introduce powers to send children as young as 12 to a new generation of secure training centres for persistent offenders for up to two years Strengthen the criminal law and introduce a new procedure for evicting squatters within 24 hours. Tighten the trespass laws to deal with hunt saboteurs and New Age travellers. The Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill contains measures to streamline the administration of magistrates' courts in England and Wales, by consolidating management areas and giving the Lord Chancellor power to approve important appointments, including those of justices' clerks, and to vary their standard terms of employment - a decision which the clerks say threatens their judicial independence. The bill will set a core of national objectives for the police service, while at the same time giving chief constables greater managerial and financial flexibility. Its most controversial proposal is to streamline police authorities, reducing local authority representation and giving the home secretary powers to appoint members. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, announced a 27-point programme against crime at the Conservative Party conference last month and has since declared repeatedly that 'prison works'.</p>

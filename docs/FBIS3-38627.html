			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andreas Paraskhos] </F>   [Excerpt] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said  today that the final draft of the report on the  confidence-building measures [CBM's] prepared by Cypriot  Government experts answers the most important question raised  when the term confidence-building measures was added to Cyprus'  political dictionary. That question is: Will implementation of  the CBM's mean the possibility of recognition, direct or  indirect, of the Turkish Cypriot pseudostate? Kasoulidhis said  that it appears, at last, that the CBM's can be implemented  without the danger of recognition of the pseudostate.    [Begin Kasoulidhis recording] It appears that there are ways  that can be agreed upon to implement the CBM's without the  direct or indirect recognition of the pseudostate.    The foreign minister is expected to carry the final draft of  the report with him when he returns from London tonight. The  constitutional and legal processing of the report took place in  London. [end recording]    The experts' report is currently in the hands of Foreign  Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis. [passage omitted]</p>

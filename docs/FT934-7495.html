			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not a distinguished policy Sir, Readers are accustomed to the Financial Times's support for an independent central bank. International evidence is that fiscal policy is more subject than monetary policy to electoral manipulation. Some economists who favour independence of the central bank face up to the implications of that evidence and call for constitutional restrictions on the ability of politicians to run budget deficits. The Maastricht treaty, with its restrictions on government deficits and debt, is a large step in that direction. Now, Michael Prowse ('What Nafta says about democracy', November 15) invokes the authority of Hayek to argue that policy on international trade should be insulated from 'perverse short-term' political pressures. Mr Prowse prefers Nafta, which he regards as the epitome of 'rational' policy, to democracy. I had not noticed that the numerous undemocratic regimes, of all ideological stripes, that the 20th century has produced were particularly distinguished by their rational economic policy. But the tide is clearly against me and such observations. The British government, in its eagerness to reclaim the benefits of the 19th century, continues with privatisation and proposes the abolition of health and safety legislation. From the FT, I infer that the process will be complete only with the repeal of the Reform Acts. After all, what is the point of universal suffrage to elect a government that must then be restrained from doing anything? Gerald Holtham, 13 Lansdowne Gardens, London SW8 2EQ</p>

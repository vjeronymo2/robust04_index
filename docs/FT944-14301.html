			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Elegance and energy - Smart Guide / Mexico City What is the best part of town to stay in? Well-heeled business travellers head for Polanco, the most exclusive and expensive part of town, or the Zona Rosa (Pink Zone), which is more down-market but livelier. The two are only five minutes apart, and fast becoming one. At all costs avoid the south of the city, which is up to an hour from the business district. Polanco is fashionable partly because it bears little resemblance to the rest of Mexico. The main street, Masaryk, has been renamed Rodeo Drive, and boasts numerous posh shops. Polanco is home to the best hotels and many fine restaurants, and is close to everything important. The Zona Rosa includes the stock market, most of Mexico's brokers, and plenty of nightclubs. Hotels? For years, foreign businessmen stayed at the Camino Real (Dollars 200 a night) in Polanco, tolerating its poor service and a 10-minute walk to their rooms in return for stunning architecture and large spaces. But that was before the Four Seasons. The Four Seasons (Dollars 225) in the Zona Rosa opened earlier this year, and is booked weeks in advance. A few hours spent at the front desk will tell you who is in town, and a few more at the bar will tell you what they are doing. If you cannot get in, the boring but efficient Presidente Intercontinental (Dollars 250) and Nikko (Dollars 210), both in Polanco, are popular. For the adventurous, the penthouse suite or a high-up double room at the Ritz (Dollars 75) in the historical centre offers splendid views. What about restaurants? The most elegant and expensive are Champs Elysees in the Zona Rosa and Fouquet's at the Camino Real, where you could be in Paris, except that the customers are generally Mexican politicians. Many businessmen prefer the glitzy La Galvia in Polanco, with its nouvelle Mexican food. Pomodora, opposite the stock exchange, offers the city's best Italian food. The current hit restaurant is Polanco-based Los Alcatraces (Mexican cuisine) where lunch lasts for three hours or more. Try to book days in advance, but even then you may not get in. Foreigners like Cicero Centenario in the historical centre: Mexican food and mariachi music in a converted brothel that has little ventilation. Is there much entertainment? Mexicans have such long lunches that they generally rest in the evenings. A must for the first-time visitor is Garibaldi Square, where you can be serenaded by mariachi bands while drinking tequila. The Salon Mexico is the hot place to dance, and the trendiest bars are La Tirana and Bar Milagro. The even hipper Barba Azul in the Colonia Obrera is recommended for those willing to take off their business suits. The most suitable places for a working drink are the hotels: Camino Real or Four Seasons. What are the local quirks? Mexicans take their time over business, and do not look kindly on people in a hurry. Many like to be friendly with those they are working with, so do not try to pack too much into a day. Mexicans often keep unpredictable hours: some work from 8.30am to 6pm, others from 10am to 9pm. Some never take long lunches, others always seem to. Be flexible, and expect appointments to be rearranged at the last moment. How do I get around? Taxis are plentiful, but drivers often know less about the city than a businessmen who has spent three days in it. Use hotel cars or bring a map so you can direct the driver. What if I have a spare day? The seriously minded would spend it in the national archaeology museum, having done some homework first. If you want to be outdoors, the pyramids at Teotihuacan are the usual first stop. Or you can visit the local Indian market at Tepoztlan (an hour away), climb the volcanic mountain and take a margarita at the fashionable Ciruelo restaurant.</p>

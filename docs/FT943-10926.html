			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: LDDS to pay Dollars 895m for telecoms group LDDS, the acquisitive US telecommunications group, said last night it would pay about Dollars 895m for IDB Communications of California, an international satellite-based phone carrier. The IDB acquisition is an important step for LDDS. LDDS is currently trying to acquire the WilTel Communications unit of Williams Companies, but so far Williams has rejected its Dollars 2.5bn offer for WilTel, which operates the fourth-largest long-distance telecommunications network in the US. The acquisition of a satellite telecommunications business such as IDB, however, should strengthen LDDS's hand in its battle to win control of WilTel, say industry analysts. Under the terms of a complex stock-for-stock and stock-for-debt agreement, IDB shareholders will receive at least 0.45 LDDS shares for each IDB share if LDDS shares are valued at Dollars 22 or more, and at the most 0.52 LDDS shares for each IDB share if LDDS shares are valued at Dollars 16 or less. Based on the current LDDS share price of Dollars 19 1/2 , LDDS will pay about Dollars 700m for IDB stock. Also, Dollars 195m in convertible subordinated notes issued by IDB will remain outstanding, and note holders will receive the corresponding exchange ratio adjustment to their current stock conversion price. Mr Bernard Ebbers, president and chief executive of LDDS, described the acquisition as the 'first step' in the company's strategy to 'penetrate the lucrative segments of the international market'.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELL-DRILLING FIRM CLARIFIES ITS DISPUTED LETTER OVER OIL REVENUE  </P> <P> A company that wants to sink up to 30 oil wells in Hermosa Beach has clarified  a letter that opponents charge gives misleading figures about how much revenue  the city of Redondo Beach has received from wells there in the last 33 years.  </P> <P> Macpherson Oil Co., based in Santa Monica, has a prospective contract with the  city to sink wells at the city maintenance yard at Valley Drive and 6th Street.  Its plan has come under attack before the Planning Commission, which is holding  hearings on a draft environmental impact report for the project and a  conditional-use permit for it.  </P> <P> Company President Don Macpherson Jr., in the disputed letter that was sent to  residents in late August, stated that "in the 33 years of production, Redondo  Beach has generated over $70 million in oil revenue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memo to Council  </P> <P> Macpherson clarified the letter in a memo to City Council members last week. He  wrote that his letter "did not state, nor was it intended to imply, that the  city of Redondo Beach has generated over $70 million in oil revenue."  </P> <P> Rather, the letter meant to give Macpherson's estimate of the total value of  the oil retrieved from the field under Redondo Beach. Macpherson said his  company arrived at the dollar amount by multiplying the average per-barrel  price of oil each year since 1956 by the production for that year, then added  the annual revenues. Records show that 8.8 million barrels of oil have been  recovered from Redondo Beach since 1956.  </P> <P> According to Sheila Schoettger, Redondo Beach's harbor director, the city has  received about $14 million as its share of oil revenues over the 33 years. The  city's contract calls for it to receive 18% of the tidelands and 2% of the  upland oil revenue.  </P> <P> Extrapolating from the Redondo Beach experience, Macpherson said that because  oil costs more today, Hermosa Beach in the next 35 years stands to make an even  greater royalty than Redondo Beach has. Macpherson said based on a city  consultant's figure for the amount of oil underground, he estimates that the  city would receive $22.8 million in 1989 dollars. The consultant, Richard  Hester of Glendale, estimated that there are 9.4 million barrels of oil under  Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> Macpherson's own consultants, however, estimate the reserves at three times  that.  </P> <P> In 1986, the city awarded Macpherson a 35-year lease to drill for the oil.  Under the present contract, the city would receive 18 2/3% of the revenue from  the sale of the oil.  </P> <P> Macpherson's clarification letter was prompted by comments of two drilling  opponents who had challenged the figures at a recent hearing before the  Planning Commission.  </P> <P> "I would say it's not just misleading, it's false," George Sacks said. "Any  clarification like that doesn't correct it, it just proves it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Production Has Fallen Off'  </P> <P> Brent Harris, a financial analyst and opponent of the project, said that how  much Redondo Beach received is not the issue.  </P> <P> "Whether (the revenues) are $70 million or not, it is clear that (Redondo  Beach's) production has fallen off dramatically" and this has significance for  Hermosa Beach because Redondo Beach is draining oil reserves from under Hermosa  Beach.  </P> <P> In 1986, the State Lands Commission, in a letter to then-Hermosa Beach City  Manager Gregory Meyer, concluded that wells in Redondo Beach were drawing oil  and gas from deposits under Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> Oil production in Redondo Beach has dropped to about 45,000 barrels a year,  down from a peak of 705,000 in 1958.  </P> <P> But Macpherson said that Redondo Beach only could have drained oil from the  border lands between Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach and that the bulk of the  deposits remain untapped.  </P> <P> The current arguments are the latest in a dispute over whether the city should  go ahead with the project.  </P> <P> Harris, in a letter to the City Council, estimated that the city could lose  money on it. He said Macpherson's estimates of oil prices are overly  optimistic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Burdened by Costs  </P> <P> Harris also said the city would be burdened by the costs of buying and cleaning  up the South School, as well as relocating the city maintenance yard. Under the  current plans, the city would move maintenance work elsewhere to make way for  the drilling rig, while a portion of the South School site would be used by  Macpherson for an oil separation facility.  </P> <P> Macpherson said Harris' estimates are "riddled with errors, omissions and false  assumptions."  </P> <P> In a response to Harris' estimates, he said that if the project is  unsuccessful, the city would not suffer a loss because it is not investing the  money for the project. He also said that the city's purchase of the South  School site would have no effect on the revenue it would receive from the  project and that the project could go forward without the site. He also said  the maintenance yard could continue at its present location unless it needs to  expand.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach City Manager Kevin Northcraft said the city is planning to  purchase the South School site regardless of the oil project. They are  negotiating the purchase with the Hermosa Beach City School District.  </P></p>

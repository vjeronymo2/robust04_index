			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH STUDENTS MARCH TO PROTEST SCHOOL CONDITIONS  </P> <P> Thousands of students, some hurling eggs and others smashing windows, marched  nationwide Friday in the largest protests in two weeks of strikes over violence  and overcrowding in French high schools.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Michel Rocard promised to create thousands of new jobs to  improve crumbling, crime-ridden high schools.  </P> <P> But a student leader said Rocard had failed to address basic demands for more  teachers and security guards.  </P> <P> "What we are asking for is to have toilets where we can go without being  hassled by five guys," said one Paris student, a 16-year-old girl.  </P> <P> After listening to a delegation of student leaders, Rocard issued a statement  pledging to create 6,000 new slots for teacher assistants and 3,000 monitors.  He also promised 1,000 new maintenance posts.  </P></p>

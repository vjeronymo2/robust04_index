			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Finish the job Ever since President George Bush ordered the Gulf ceasefire, he has faced a living reminder that his victory over Iraq was less than complete. President Saddam Hussein's mere survival humiliates; his brazen flouting of United Nations Security Council resolutions constitutes part of the threat to Mr Bush's re-election. That is the stark background against which the latest western activity against Iraq must be assessed. By leaking threats to bomb government buildings and mooting establishment of an air exclusion zone to protect Shia Moslems in the south, the US and its allies signal a desire to step up the pressure on Mr Saddam. But by implication, they also highlight their own failure to deal with the Iraqi dictator thus far, and President Bush's vulnerability. It is a bind from which he is unlikely to free himself without doing something that may be beyond his capacity before the presidential election in November: finishing Mr Saddam once and for all. There are those who argue that the west is now suffering the consequences of not having gone all the way at the end of the war, that had they marched on Baghdad 18 months ago the allies might not now be sitting helplessly by while Mr Saddam cocks a snook at UN weapons inspectors or unleashes warplanes against his people. But that is far from certain, and even if it were would be scant consolation today. The allies' real problem stems from a failure to think creatively, or consistently, about the consequences of victory. When the Shias of the south rose up against Baghdad at the end of the war, none of the western nations came to their aid. Mr Bush adamantly refused to support a rebellion that he argued might dismember an established state and aggrandise its neighbour, Iran. Yet at the same time, Britain and the US were prodded by TV coverage into providing a 'safe haven' in the north for the Kurds. Unfortunately, current events have the same reactive flavour. Mr Bush was caught off guard by the recent confrontation over a weapons inspection of the Iraqi agriculture ministry, and threatens to bomb government buildings in Baghdad. He is stung by publicity concerning the plight of the Shias, and persuades his allies to co-operate in banning Iraqi aircraft from the south. On its own, the latest action can do little to improve the lot of the Shias; the allies need to go further, and establish a comprehensive security umbrella with a view to denying Baghdad control as they have with the Kurds. But they must not lose sight of the ultimate aim, which should be, through a combination of military, economic and political pressure, to force Mr Saddam's removal and the installation of a government more representative of Iraq's diverse peoples. As things stand, almost anything the allies do that falls short of that goal can be presented by Mr Saddam as a victory over the west.</p>

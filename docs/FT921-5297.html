			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: IRI unit sells 7.1% of Elsag Bailey FINMECCANICA, the holding company which controls the engineering interests of Italy's IRI state holding group, has sold 7.1 per cent of its Elsag Bailey subsidiary to a group of foreign investors including Credit Lyonnais and Mercury Asset Management (MAM). Elsag Bailey, a precision engineering group with 1990 sales of L1,353bn (Dollars 1.09bn), was floated on the stock exchange last July. The latest deal will reduce the IRI group's stake in the company to around 72 per cent from 79 per cent after the flotation, if warrants are fully exercised. Elsag Bailey, based in Genova, had net profits of L26.5bn in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available. The company specialises in continuous process control automation equipment, and on machinery for automating services such as letter sorting. Credit Lyonnais has bought a 4 per cent holding through its Clinvest subsidiary, while MAM's stake has not been disclosed. The deals, which were co-ordinated by Wasserstein Perella the US investment bank, took place on the Italian block market at L4,625 a share. Elsag Bailey's shares were fixed in Milan at L4,650 yesterday. Like much of the IRI group, Finmeccanica has been facing a growing financial squeeze owing to heavy investment commitments at a time of sharply-reduced government funding recently. Elsag Bailey itself has grown rapidly of late through a series of acquisitions, notably in the US. However, its gearing has also risen sharply, and the latest deal, which Finmeccanica said was with 'long-term' investors, should raise around L30bn. Milan-based building entrepreneur Mr Salvatore Ligresti has acquired a 5 per cent stake in German tyremaker Continental for DM110m, according to German press reports.</p>

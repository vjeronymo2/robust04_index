			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Snia, Rhone-Poulenc in new link-up SNIA FIBRE of Italy and Rhone-Poulenc of France yesterday announced plans to merge their textile nylon businesses, continuing the restructuring of the European fibres industry. The deal, if concluded, would create Europe's largest textile yarn manufacturer, with annual sales of about FFr2.6bn (Dollars 450m). It follows Du Pont's acquisition of ICI's fibres operations, which was completed last week. Snia and and Rhone-Poulenc already have a carpet fibre joint venture which is the second-largest European manufacturer. In the latest venture, Snia claims to have 17 per cent of the west European market, while Rhone-Poulenc is to contribute about 20 per cent. The 50-50 joint venture will have a capacity of about 100,000 tonnes a year. Although west European capacity is more than 350,000 tonnes a year, demand is only 240,000 tonnes, according to the Committee of Rayon and Synthetic Filament. The French company said it did not expect difficulties from competition authorities, because Europe had to be able to compete against Asian manufacturers. Du Pont has about 25 per cent of a market which is growing at only 2 per cent a year because of competition from other fibres such as polyester. Radicci of Italy is the third-largest manufacturer. The consolidation will put pressure on the remaining small manufacturers in Italy, Spain and Germany. Mr Robin Anson, of Textiles Intelligence, the market research group, said the deal would allow some rationalisation of the two groups' activities. 'Integrating our respective nylon textiles activities will allow us to optimise synergies in research, production and marketing, with the aim of reinforcing our position in the European market,' said Mr Michel de Rosen, managing director of Rhone-Poulenc fibres operations. Rhone-Poulenc said the two businesses, which employ about 3,000 people, were complimentary. Snia was strong in nylon 6 and had considered building a plant to make nylon 66. This is where the French company is strongest. Snia's operations are mainly in Italy, while Rhone-Poulenc's are in Germany and France. The French group's fibre operations in Brazil and Slovakia are not included in the deal. Offer oversubscribed, Page 24</p>

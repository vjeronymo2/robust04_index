			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: In the tracks of Quixote across a land of fantasy - As Jimmy Burns crosses La Mancha in search of a hero, reality and fiction begin to merge With a name of a conquistador and the bearing of a well-nourished Castilian peasant, Jose Diaz Pintado Carreton struck me as just the person I was looking for in my quest for Don Quixote. He ran a small electronics shop in the central square of Argamasilla del Alba, specialising in Japanese organs, but it was not because of his dedication to new technology that I had been guided to him. Don Jose, plump, moustachioed, and with a boisterous laugh that made his organs rattle, was an Academico de Argamasilla, with a life-long hobby of dedication to Spain's most universal literary hero. We shared a bottle of wine and a large piece of chorizo. He erupted with laughter when I asked him what university he taught at. 'I am not an academic. I'm an eternal fan, an aficionado dedicated to supposition, speculation, and pure faith.' Don Quixote sets off on his travels from an unnamed 'place in La Mancha', that region of Spain's central plain which lies between Madrid and Andalucia. Consequently, each little town for 200 kilometres south of the capital claims Don Quixote as its own. But Jose was insistent that Argamasilla - today a dusty agricultural town filled with olive pickers and vine diggers - was the place where it all began and where it ended. Here was the library where his hero had studied his books of chivalry. Here was the prison where he had languished. 'I've spent my life trying to find out why. Was it because he didn't pay his taxes or because he wolf-whistled a noble lady; either thesis is possible.' No use arguing with Jose that Don Quixote never existed, and that the man imprisoned in Argamasilla was Miguel Cervantes, his hero's inventor. I had been travelling long enough in La Mancha to understand that this is the kind of region in which one can easily believe in anything. A few days earlier I had flown to Madrid, seeking out Europe's self-proclaimed cultural capital. The Prado, as always, was a joy, but before getting to the now-permanent Thyssen exhibition, I had already sought escape from the frenetic traffic, the pollution and the sense of collective malaise which my Spanish friends say is a symptom of recession. I left armed with Cervantes' masterpiece in my bag, and the thoughts of the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset in my head: 'Castille, felt as visual unreality,' wrote Ortega some 70 year ago, 'is one of the most beautiful things in the Universe.' After the office blocks and the traffic jams came the open plains of La Mancha, not green, certainly, but not barren or uncompromising either: Castille here is a kaleidoscope of changing shapes and colours. First comes the reddish earth where the vines are lined one behind the other; then the mountains of the south looming on the horizon like sea monsters washed on to some hugely distant shore. Along the way there is an extraordinary sense of space, broken occasionally by a flock of sheep or a clump of olive trees where the vines leave off. Not since motoring through Patagonia had I felt a similar sense of anguish mixed with heightened expectation. I was hungry and thirsty, too. Deliverance from the motorway came in the form of the first necessary port of call on my literary journey: Puerto Lapice. It was into this village that Don Quixote had ridden 'weary and dying of hunger . . . looking in all directions to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's hut' where he could take shelter. Having parked the car, we wandered on foot through the streets of brilliant whitewash, where fruit was being pressed and horseshoes forged in inner courtyards, but where otherwise nothing seemed to be happening under the sun. My companion stopped to cash a traveller's cheque in the bank, and was told by a young clerk that she had never handled such an instrument. It was lunchtime, though, and it was not hard to find a local inhabitant with a sense of priorities. 'The Venta de Don Quixote,' said a woman in black, pointing down an avenue of white. In the venta, or inn, a rusty set of armour lay abandoned next to a stone trough, and a group of waiters in starched shirts stood by empty tables in an open courtyard lined with blue tiles. ' . . . Now there chanced to be standing at the inn two young women of easy virtue who were on their way to Seville with some water carriers . . . As everything that our adventurer thought, saw or imagined seemed to follow the fashion of his reading, . . . he convinced himself that it was a fortress with its four towers and pinnacles of silver . . .' The only female strangers I saw - one with a mass of black curls, the other with stunning blue eyes - were cleaning the kitchen floor and seemed in a hurry, not to move on to Seville but to get back to Madrid, from where they had reluctantly emigrated. I shadow boxed with the armour before allowing myself to be led to a table in the spirit of Sancho Panza. We drank a litre of Valdepenas wine, and guzzled beans, chorizo and bits of smoked ham served in an earthenware bowl. The stew, or olla, has been La Mancha's peasant fare for many centuries, and no amount of fast food chains - of increasing prominence in metropolitan Spain - has managed to eradicate it. Beyond the venta, up in the hills, above another glittering village of whitewash and blue tiles - Campo Criptana - were the windmills. That afternoon they stood defiantly as a wind gathered and whistled across the prairie, picking up dust. A young Dutch couple sat leaning against their rucksacks, staring at a red sun. When they saw me, the man asked: 'Do those windmills make bread?' I told him: 'Those you see there are giants with long arms; some of them have them six miles long.' The Dutchman smiled: 'Well it makes a change from looking at cathedrals.' He had recently been in Toledo. For a long time we stood there, saying nothing else, just listening to the wind and watching our children dance between the 'giants'. With their black hair and wild gestures and laughter, they seemed caught in a dream of gypsies which my hero on occasions stumbled on. Beyond us a madman, his trousers half-way down to his ankles, was gesticulating at one of the giant's arms with a walking stick. His expletives were almost incomprehensible, but I gathered he had been abandoned by his wife. Later that afternoon I stopped for the night at the next village on the Quixote trail, El Toboso. Here the house of Dulcinea, the rough peasant cook my hero took for a princess, has been preserved as a museum, next to a convent where the nuns intersperse their prayer sessions with biscuit-baking. We took a room above an inn, where the largely male clientele seemed either tall, bearded and very thin, or short and stocky - Quixotes or Sanchos almost to a man. We were fed on gachas, a quite indigestible dish also of long-standing tradition in Castilian peasant kitchens: bits of pork fat fried with garlic and hot peppers. I was conscious that Don Quixote had searched for his princess after midnight, so, restored with a large brandy, I set off into the night. The tall tower of El Toboso's 16th century parish church stood out above the narrow streets, its pale stone illuminated and turned golden in the sea of black. Except for those in the inn, the whole population appeared to have retired. The only beings were a dog distantly barking and a ginger cat that followed me for an hour, purring and sliding his back along the whitewash. Near the local convent, Dulcinea's house was closed for the evening. The next day, armed with a map provided by the parish priest, Don Nicolas - another Quixote expert - I went looking for the Cave of Montesinos - scene of Don Quixote's mostly demented dream - in the lake district of La Mancha. The lakes are small lagoons which have gathered mirage-like and somewhat miraculously in an area surrounded by arid lands. The cave was well off the main road, across a countryside of petrified trees and loose bramble. Luckily the crippled vegetation was not too overgrown so I did not need to use a sword, as my hero had done, to cut my way through the cave's mouth. But neither did I have a rope and Sancho to lower me in. I stepped forward cautiously, using a torch. For many centuries the wizard Montesinos had waited for Don Quixote deep in this cave. Thanks to him, the mad knight discovered enchanted castles and Dulcinea del Toboso, and re-emerged a better man, his courage proved, his dream fulfilled. I was frightened out of my wits by a large bat. It was the the only other living creature I encountered before chasing my own shadow and running out, back into the sunlight. All around me the plains of La Mancha were melting to the sound of crickets. Spain: A Literary Companion, by Jimmy Burns, was recently published by John Murray, London (Pounds 16.99).</p>

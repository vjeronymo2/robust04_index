			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Money Markets: Little move in rates Sterling's latest surge on the foreign exchange markets encouraged a few traders to believe that an interest rate cut was in the offing. But the UK market was mostly unimpressed by sterling's performance and was guided far more by the political situation in Germany. Period rates in the Interbank market showed no sign of change. London's sterling deposit rates remained firmly locked into a 10 1/2 per cent relationship with base rates. The three-month interbank rate, an important indicator of future base rate movements, remained at 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent. One year money again ended at 10 3/8 - 1/4 , repeating Friday's close. Only movements in the short sterling futures market gave the hint that traders are expecting the Bank of England to signal a cut in base rates soon. The June short sterling contract ended at 89.79, just below its high for the day, having opened at 89.65. The closing figure indicated an implied interest rate in June of 10.21 per cent. 'That indicates that the market believes that the next move in interest rates will be down,' said one trader yesterday. In the Discount market, some traders said that they were reluctant to part with bills, even though the Bank of England forecast a shortage at the day's opening of Pounds 1.15bn. One trader claimed that this reluctance was due to a wish to push up the cost of short-dated money. Alternatively, traders may not have needed to sell the bills in the first place. The Bank of England struggled to relieve a hefty shortage by way of bill purchases, unsupported by any 'repo' facility. It purchased Pounds 69m worth of Band-4 bank bills at 10 1/16 per cent in the early round. Later in the morning, the shortage was revised to around Pounds 1.05bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 11m of Band-3 bank bills at 10 5/32 per cent and Pounds 58m of Band-4 bank bills at 10 1/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank revised its estimate of the shortage, lifting the figure to around Pounds 1.2m. It purchased Pounds 279m worth of Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 10m of Band-4 Bank bills at 10  1/16 per cent. The market eventually took Pounds 505m from the Bank by exercising late borrowing facilitites to raise total official intervention operations to Pounds 932m.</p>

Federal councillor Kaspar  Villiger has ordered the legal division of his department to  throw some light on the affair, indicated the DMF Thursday. The  role played by police chief Peter Regli, in particular, will  have to be cleared up.    The Zurich canton police had discovered the uranium after  receiving an anonymous telephone call. The caller said that he  had deposited the merchandise at a freeway rest area in  Kemptthal (Zurich), so that it could be disposed of in a  competent manner. According to the DMF, the police were tipped  off at the instigation of police chief Peter Regli, the deputy  chief of the State Information Service.    The police inquiry concerning the case itself is under way.  At the same time, the chief of the DMF has instructed the legal  division of the department to establish the role played by the  GRS in the affair. The flow of information and the contacts  between the caller and the deputy chief will be subjected to  close scrutiny.  <H5>  GRS Informer </H5>   The caller knew the police chief personally because he had  done his military service with him in the air force. However,  when interviewed by ATS, Daniel Eckmann, the spokesman for the  DMF, said that the anonymous telephone call had come from a GRS  informer. Supposedly, the man involved was an arms dealer living  in Zurich.    It is claimed that he asked for advice from police chief  Regli, who had then suggested that the caller turn to the  competent police body, maintained Mr. Eckmann. The uranium  courier had then explained to him that his life had been  threatened if he went to the police. For that reason, the  police chief contacted the police himself so that the uranium  could be brought into safety as quickly as possible.    Evidently, stressed the DMF spokesman, a procedure of this  kind is no everyday matter. It is not normal for the deputy  chief of the State Information Service to be involved in such an  operation involving the safe disposal of uranium.  <H5>  Transparent Explanation </H5>   Kaspar Villiger wants to establish all the facts "which will  make it possible to evaluate the political and legal aspects of  the intervention in their entirety," quoted the statement issued  by the DMF. Police chief Regli ought to "have a transparent  explanation" for all the circumstances leading up to the uranium  being brought to safety. The DMF will take account of these  explanatory remarks accordingly.    Peter Lehmann, the spokesman for the Public Ministry of the  Confederation, confirmed an article in the German-language  weekly "Cash," in which the person who supposedly deposited the  uranium was an arms dealer living in Zurich. It is alleged that  this dealer was arrested last 27 October at Zurich-Kloten  airport. When interrogated by officials from the Public  Ministry, it is claimed that he admitted having transported the  merchandise from Eastern Europe to Zurich at the request of an  unidentified contact so that it could be eliminated from the  market.  <H5>  25,000-Franc Fine </H5>   It was thanks to an official from the police force of the  Zurich canton that it had been possible to identify the arms  dealer, following his recording of three anonymous telephone  calls. The arms dealer could be charged with violating the  federal law on atomic energy. Under Article 35 of the law he  could be sentenced to pay a fine of up to 25,000 Swiss francs  for the illicit trafficking of radioactive material.    According to specialists at the Paul-Scherrer Institute, who  were called to the scene when the discharge of radioactivity had  been established, the level of uranium radiation had not been  very high. It is alleged that it would only have posed a danger  to human beings after exposure to it over a two-hour period at  close quarters.</p>

Wan Xueyuan, Chai Songyue, Liu Xirong, Long  Anding, Zhang Qimei, Xu Zhichun, and other provincial leaders  attended the conference.    Xie Qingjian, president of the provincial people's bank,  delivered a work report, entitled: "Comprehensively Implement  the Guidelines on Banking Work To Promote Sustained, Rapid, and  Healthy Development of Zhejiang's Economy."    In his speech, Governor Wan Xueyuan stressed: The year 1994  is crucial to our efforts to deepen reform and promote  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy.  Governments at all levels and banking departments should show  concern for, support, and understand each other to create a more  harmonious environment for economic construction. He urged  banking departments to give more thought to Zhejiang's  development and come up with more ideas to perform concrete  deeds for the benefit of the people in Zhejiang.    Chai Songyue, executive vice governor, fully affirmed  Zhejiang's accomplishments in banking last year. [passage  omitted]    Speaking of this year's banking tasks, Chai Songyue said the  general requirements of this year's banking work are: While  strictly controlling the overall credit supply and strengthening  macroeconomic control, we will press ahead with banking reform  actively but prudently, do everything possible to raise funds  for production and construction, continuously optimize credit  structure, and vigorously increase fund reserves in an effort to  deepen Zhejiang's reform, open the province wider to the outside  world, promote a healthy development of its economy, and  maintain social stability.    Chai Songyue emphatically pointed out: Banking departments  should always uphold the guiding ideology of serving economic  construction and carry forward the fine traditions of supporting  local economic construction. [passage omitted]    Speaking of strictly controlling loans for fixed assets,  Chai  Songyue said: Exercising strict control on investment in fixed  assets is not a negative policy. It is a positive policy to  help prevent inflation and optimize economic structure. The  goal is not control itself; the goal is to help us develop  better. Specifically, we must do the following: 1) New loans to  fund fixed asset investment this year are forbidden for starting  low-standard, duplicate projects. Loans used to finance real  estate development must be controlled within the mandatory  targets set by the state. Loans for use as circulating funds  must not be transferred to investment in fixed assets. 2) New  loans for investment in fixed assets under the state plan must  be used to complete key state and provincial projects and to  meet the funding requirements of newly started projects approved  by the state and province. Funding requirements for these  projects must be guaranteed on a priority basis. 3) While  controlling the size of key construction projects and meeting  their funding requirements, special efforts must be made to  support enterprises to carry out technological transformation.  The proportion of technological transformation loans in the  total amount of loans extended should be increased. Banks  should use funds paid back from fixed asset loans to help key  enterprises carry out technological transformation. [passage  omitted]</p>

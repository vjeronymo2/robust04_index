Zhirinovskiy and his entourage were seen off at Warsaw  Okecie  airport by Janusz Bryczkowski, leader of the Polish National  Front, at whose invitation the LDPR leader was staying in Poland.    Zhirinovskiy's departure, in contrast to his arrival on  Friday evening, took place without incident because there were  no other people present in the airport departure hall apart from  security service men, both plainclothes and uniformed, and  journalists.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "MFN on Cards as China Plays Ace"] </F>   [Text] China played its ace card yesterday. If there were  any lingering doubts that Bill Clinton would renew its Most  Favoured Nation (MFN) trading privileges, a decision many  believed was already inevitable, then the sudden release from  prison of democracy activist Wang Juntao removed them at a  stroke. With an astute eye on the U.S. political scene, China  handed Mr Clinton the gilt-edged gesture he so desperately  needed to honourably fulfil his pledge of no MFN without  "significant progress" on human rights.    For good measure, Beijing even threw in a second smaller  carrot, with the revelation it had reached unspecified  "understandings" with the International Committee of the Red  Cross over another issue that has been at heart of the MFN  debate; that of access to mainland prisons.    The news will come as an unexpected gift to Chief Secretary  Anson Chan Fang On-sang as she today begins her mission to lobby  Washington for a renewal now almost assured, even as she  contemplates the unfortunate impact the death of former  President Richard Nixon will have on her previously jam-packed  schedule.    Much of the credit for Wang's release must go to his brave  and indefatigable wife Hou Xiaotian, who by ceaselessly  campaigning for his freedom, at great personal risk, made his  plight a matter of international concern. Now she has helped to  achieve what was once believed almost impossible -- Wang was,  after all, freed after serving little more than four years of a  1 3-year jail term -- relatives of other dissidents may be  encouraged to adopt a similar approach, thus causing further  headaches for the Chinese security authorities. But that is a  small price for Beijing to pay to reap the benefits of a  strategy which became startlingly clear yesterday. Having  repeatedly humiliated Washington in recent months, especially by  rounding up dissidents during the visit to Beijing of U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, China has now thrown in a  last-minute concession -- therefore not only securing MFN  renewal, but also ensuring Washington will think long and hard  before ever linking trade to the mainland's human rights record  again.    That will be good news for Hong Kong, which has had to live  with the uncertainties caused by the annual arguments over MFN  for the past four years. It is sad to see sick dissidents being  exploited in such a cynical way. But it can only be hoped that  his release will be followed by many more: especially fellow  victims of the 1989 crackdown, such as Chen Ziming and Bao Tong,  who were jailed on similar charges.</p>

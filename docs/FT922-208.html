			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Chile's ruling coalition wins municipal election PRESIDENT Patricio Aylwin's government has won a solid vote of confidence in the first municipal elections to be held in Chile since 1973, with the ruling coalition of Christian Democrats and left-wing parties polling 53.3 per cent of the votes in Sunday's contest. The president, who is now more than half way through his four-year term, said the vote gave him a clear mandate to reform the anti-democratic constitution inherited from the military. Having cleared the municipal hurdle, the government appears set to win presidential and parliamentary elections, to be held in December 1993. Chile's right-wing opposition alliance fell short of expectation, polling 29.8 per cent of the votes - four points below their showing in the 1989 general election.</p>

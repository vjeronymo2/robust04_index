			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The nation's mayors, declaring their readiness to cooperate with the Bush  Administration, urged the incoming President to add $10.7 billion to President  Reagan's budget for urban aid. "The last Reagan budget recommended additional  cuts in urban programs which, over the last 10 years, have shouldered an  overwhelming burden in the battle to reduce the deficit," the mayors said in a  statement issued at the close of their annual winter meeting in Washington. The  mayors said that during Reagan's eight years in office, the cumulative budget  for key urban programs was cut by nearly 82%. Mayor Arthur J. Holland of  Trenton, N.J., president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said a delegation of  mayors met with Bush a few weeks ago and left with the impression that "the  President-elect was sensitive to our needs and would do everything he could to  help meet those needs."  </P></p>

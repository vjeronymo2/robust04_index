			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Ryabushev report: "Sea Warm in Crimea. Will </F> Relations Warm?"]    [Text] Simferopol -- "There will be no war in the Crimea,"  our correspondent was told yesterday by Colonel General of the  Militia Valentin Nedrigaylo, Ukrainian deputy minister of  internal affairs. "We will do everything to ensure fulfillment  on the peninsula of the Ukrainian presidential edict on the  transformation of the Crimean MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]  into a Ukrainian MVD Main Administration."    For two weeks now Nedrigaylo has been in the Ukrainian  mission in Simferopol guarded by national guardsmen and trying  to achieve the resignation of General Kuznetsov, who was  appointed by the Crimean Supreme Council as the republic's  minister of internal affairs.    "Nobody agreed his candidacy with us," Nedrigaylo said.  "Kuznetsov cannot be a minister since the Crimean MVD no longer  exists. He has never worked at law-enforcement organs and has  not taken the militia oath of allegiance to Ukraine. We will  not be paying him or his nonexistent minister. Consequently,  our deputy minister Colonel Chernyshov should head the Main  Administration for the Crimea at the decision of the Ukrainian  MVD. The size of the militia in Ukraine is currently larger  than the size of the Defense Ministry. We could have removed  Kuznetsov by force long ago and made the Crimean militia carry  out the Ukrainian president's edict. But we do not need  bloodshed."    Across the road, guarded by the "Berkut" Crimean  Special-Purpose Militia Unit, stand people loyal to their  disgraced general guarding staffers from the former Crimean MVD.    "Leonid Kravchuk's actions are illegal," Valeriy Kuznetsov  complained. "He has broken the law ratified two years ago by  the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments on the demarcation of  powers between Kiev and Simferopol. Under the Crimean  Constitution I was appointed a minister in the republic's  Supreme Council, and only the Supreme Council and President  Yuriy Meshkov can remove me. As for my pay, I do not need any  -- my Afghan pension suffices. Moreover, the Crimean militia has  now begun to be financed out of the Simferopol rather than Kiev  budget."    Each of these generals now has his own version of the truth.  Their own concepts of honor and duty, their own treasury, their  own security, and their own troops. And the hardest task for  them is to prevent gunfire, which could lead to a conflict with  unpredictable consequences. In order to resolve this situation  Simferopol and Kiev are impatiently waiting for the next round  of talks between the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments. There  is relative calm on the streets of Simferopol. But at Yalta, on  the southern coast, the sanatoriums are still empty and a bucket  of cherries costs the equivalent of 4,000 rubles. Bread is half  the price it is in Kiev and a quarter of the Moscow price. For  the first time the price of fuel has gone down, and the station  tanks are full of Russian solar oil. If you have rubles you can  feel good and relax in the Crimea. The sea is warm. Is it not  time for a warming of the relationship between the politicians  of Ukraine, Russia, and Crimea?</p>

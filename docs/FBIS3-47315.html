He said: "From the point of view of improving the  Japanese people's quality of life, it is important that Japan  deals with economic issues voluntarily." He stressed Japan  should actively promote more transparency in its market by  deregulation. On the other hand, he also indicated that Japan  would continue to ask U.S. companies to improve their  competitiveness and exert more sales efforts, saying: "It is  necessary not only for the buyers, but also the sellers (the  United States) to be well-prepared."</p>

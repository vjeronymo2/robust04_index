			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 5 (CTK) -- Government coalition party  experts today failed to reach any compromise on senatorial  elections and will probably not meet again, Radim Spacek from  the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) told journalists.    He added it was now up to the coalition party leaderships to  "define the ground" for further negotiations.    Senatorial elections will probably be held along with  communal elections in the autumn. The 81-seat Senate, in which  one-third of the deputies will be elected every two years, is  defined in the Czech Constitution but has not been created yet.    The coalition parties are split over the method of electing  the senators. The strongest party, the Civic Democratic Party  (ODS) of Premier Vaclav Klaus insists on 81 one-mandate  constituencies, a proposal criticized by the other coalition  parties -- the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's  Party (KDU-CSL), the ODA, and the Christian Democratic Party  (KDS) -- which say the ODS wants to ensure for itself dominance  of the Senate.    They propose the creation of 27 three-mandate  constituencies.    The opposition parties are opposed to the Senate's very  existence.    Spacek said that ODS representatives "will discuss any  variant of senatorial elections as long as talks are about 81  constituencies."</p>

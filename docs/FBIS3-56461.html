In his view,  this decision "is likely to bring about serious negative  consequences."    Kovalyov emphasized that it had been a mistake to regard  Russia's Choice as the government party.    "I kept repeating in every speech I made that we could not  be  a government party without having a decisive influence in the  government," he said.    The Russia's Choice group intended to nominate Mikhail  Mityukov to the position of deputy speaker. In his words, the  group will not let Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy chair the International Affairs Committee.    "We will vote against this, and democratically-minded  deputies have enough votes to make this impossible. What is  more, I suspect that the communists also do not intend to let  the LDPR have that position," Kovalyov explained.    He said that his group will support election of either  Vladimir Lukin of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc or former  first deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin to that  position.</p>

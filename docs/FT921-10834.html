			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Teaching attracts 92% more students APPLICATIONS for teacher training places this year are running at almost double the rate of last year, and have far exceeded provisional forecasts, according to figures released by the Universities Central Council on Admissions (Ucca) yesterday. By mid December the total number of applications to universities for teacher-training courses from this September had reached 51,412 - 92 per cent up on the year before. Teacher-training applications to polytechnics have risen by a similar proportion. The surge in applications is particularly great for prospective teachers of maths, physics, business studies and craft, design and technology - among the most acute shortage subjects in the 1980s. The effect of the recession on a larger graduate market is clearly a factor. According to the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, a year ago unemployment was running at more than 6 per cent for recent university graduates and 10 per cent among polytechnic graduates. It is unlikely to be much lower this year. The increase may also be partly because of government policies aimed at making teaching more attractive. Bursaries of between Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 2,000 are payable to trainee teachers in shortage subjects. The independent review body for teachers' pay is expected to recommend an increase well above the inflation rate - in spite of a similar increase last year. Applications for places on other courses in higher education are also sharply up on last year. University applications from UK residents at 188,769 show a rise of 14 per cent on last year, with polytechnic applications at 222,559 (about 22 per cent up). The figures exaggerate the increase, since a larger proportion of applicants than previously have applied to both sectors. However, the rise more than matches the 8 per cent increase in student numbers which has projected by the government for this year compared with last year to meet its target of one in three 18-year-olds proceeding to higher education by 2000. Teaching apart, courses in geography, media studies, social sciences, psychology and engineering show the biggest increases in applications to universities. Overseas student applications to universities are slightly down on last year, while overseas applications to polytechnics and higher education colleges are up by more than a third. THE NATIONAL Union of Teachers yesterday attacked Conservative support for the widespread return of grammar schools. It said that any attempt to revive the selection of pupils by academic ability was the 'road to disaster'. The call came after Education Secretary Kenneth Clarke signalled that grammar schools would play a leading role in a more diverse education system if the Tories won the election. The 180,000-strong NUT said: 'Selective education failed two thirds of children in this country. It neglected those at secondary moderns and condemned them to second-class treatment.'</p>

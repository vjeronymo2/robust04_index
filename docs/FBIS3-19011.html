According to a CNEL study, Italian firms with foreign  shareholdings leapt from 270 to 350 in the two years from 1992  to 1993. Most of the 80 newcomers were small and medium firms,  while big groups, with the exception of IFI [Italian Financial  Institute]-Fiat, did not raise investments in this period, or  even disinvested. "The lead role played by small and medium  firms is proof of the vitality of the system, as Italian  investments abroad appear to complement rather than replace  exports," CNEL said.    One other figure highlighted by the study was the ratio of  Italian shareholdings abroad with those of foreign firms in  Italy. Until 1992 this was about even in terms of staff employed  in the companies concerned. But in 1992-93 it rose by 150,000  employees for the 350 Italian-funded business abroad, compared  to 50,000 for the 150 foreign firms in Italy.    As for the markets where the new Italian money is heading,  CNEL highlighted Eastern Europe, with its high development  potential and low cost of labour, followed by various areas in  the Far East, especially China. Investments to the European  Community (now Union) and North America fell proportionally in  the two years.    The study also found a marked drop in foreign investments in  Italy between 1989 (176 firms) and 1992, with just 68 firms with  some or all foreign capital (foreign investors in fact prefer  takeovers, the study said). But there was a slight recovery  last year, to 84 firms.    CNEL said the devaluation of the lira, which might have been  expected to generate an influx of foreign money, instead had  little effect, "raising the need for a policy that can stimulate  and develop the presence of multinationals in Italy, especially  in the areas of the South which, with just 16 percent of the  total, continue to receive a modest quota of total investment."    CNEL stigmatized a perceived tendency to exclude foreign  firms from privatisation sell-offs as the fruit of "creeping  nationalism and also possible interests against competition."  It said this tendency must be rooted out if Italy is to have  "efficient ownership solutions that will raise international  competitiveness."</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries tumble on data surprise US Treasury bond prices fell sharply yesterday as Wall Street returned from the long Easter weekend holiday to absorb some unsettling new economic data and await this week's sizeable auctions of Government paper. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond broke through the psychologically significant 8 per cent barrier and was quoted in late afternoon trading at around 8.027 per cent, for a price of 99  5/8 , down 1 1/8 on the day. The three-year issue was quoted at 98 27/32 , down  5/16 , to yield 5.936. Concern over this week's auctions kept many retail buyers on the sidelines and prices on the slide for most of the day. The Treasury will sell Dollars 14.75bn of two-year notes on Wednesday and Dollars 10.25bn of five-year notes on Thursday. The market was also reacting to two pieces of economic news released last Friday, when US credit markets were closed: some unexpectedly strong figures for housing starts and fresh testimony before Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Home building figures for March jumped by 6.4 per cent, the fourth monthly increase in a row and far above analysts' expectations. And that increased the market's concern that the US could be facing a stronger-than-expected economic recovery, with attendant inflationary pressures. However, the relative strength of the US recovery remains a matter of contention, with generally strong economic data for February being superseded by relatively soft indicators for March. Other data for March released over the past few weeks has presented a picture of a sluggish recovery. Last week, for example, brought figures showing March retail sales fell 0.4 per cent after rising by 1.3 per cent in February and 2.1 per cent in January. Mr Greenspan's cautious testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Friday was broadly neutral for the market. He said the recent indicators were all in 'the context of moving forward in a modest way' and he estimated that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the first quarter. While he did not believe this was adequate, he added: 'We do project a higher rate of growth moving on through the rest of the year and into next.' Despite yesterday's dip, many bond market analysts see the current economic configuration as modestly bullish for the long end of the Treasury market over the next months. Noting that the broad monetary aggregates are still stuck at the bottom of the Fed's target range, they predict economic recovery will remain sub-par for many months ahead. This in turn leaves open the possibility of still more easing by the Federal Reserve over the next few months, on top of the 25 basis point cut in the Fed Funds rate announced earlier this month. However, the long bond seems unlikely to break out of its current 7.80 to 8.00 yield range until the market becomes convinced that inflation really is under control and the Fed is not becoming dangerously accomodating. This week is unlikely to bring much change in the underlying mood, since relatively few economic statistics are scheduled for release. Thursday will bring figures for March durable goods orders, with the consensus forecasting 1 per cent growth following a 0.3 per cent fall in February. The sharp decline in recent months in the Japanese real estate and equity markets has led some analysts to worry that the repatriation of Japanese funds from the US might have serious knock-on effects on America's fixed income and equity markets. However, the theory was knocked on the head last week by Mr Greenspan, who noted in his Congressional testimony that Japanese investors held only a small fraction of outstanding US equities and government debt. Ms Susan Hering, a fixed income research analyst at Salomon Brothers, said Japanese investors owned just 2.2 per cent of marketable US Treasury securities at the end of 1991, according to official tallies. She argues fears of major repercussions from a Japanese sell-off may be exaggerated, citing the relatively small size of the holdings; the likelihood that any sell-off would be gradual; and the fact that private US credit demands are in secular retreat, leaving the economy well positioned to absorb hefty government debt.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Last    1 week    4 wks    12-month    12-month                       Friday       ago      ago        High         Low  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fed Funds (weekly   average)              3.88      2.50     3.75       11.00        2.00 Three-month Treasury   bills                 3.72      3.70     4.15        8.29        3.76 Six-month Treasury   bills                 3.89      3.86     4.37        7.70        3.89 Three-month prime CDs   4.00      4.08     4.32        7.17        4.01 30-day Commercial   Paper                 3.87      3.80     4.25        7.12        3.90 90-day Commercial   Paper                 3.90      3.80     4.30        7.02        3.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Last      Change            1 week    4 wk.

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSSEIN, PLO RADICAL WARN ISRAEL TO RETREAT  </P> <P> President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Palestinian guerrilla chieftain Abul Abbas  warned Israel on Tuesday that failure to withdraw from the occupied territories  will invite eventual retaliation.  </P> <P> In separate remarks on the killing Monday of 19 Palestinians in the Old City of  Jerusalem, the two Arabs demanded international condemnation of the bloody  incident.  </P> <P> Hussein, in a statement read by a studio announcer on Baghdad Radio, told the  Israelis: "You have no choice but to leave the land of Palestine and Muslim  shrines." He said Iraq has developed a long-range missile that would "serve  like the stones of Palestinian youths."  </P> <P> Several times in the last 10 months, Iraq has threatened to use missiles  against Israel but only in response to an Israeli attack on Iraq with "weapons  of mass destruction." In Tuesday's remarks he mentioned no such condition.  </P> <P> "O Zionists," Hussein's statement said, "the heavier your weapons, the more  arrogant you are and the more sins you commit."  </P> <P> Later in the day, demonstrations protesting the killings were held at several  sites around Baghdad.  </P> <P> Abbas, the guerrilla leader, spoke out at a news conference, saying he holds  the United States and Israel equally responsible for what he termed a "vicious  massacre."  </P> <P> He called on Washington to refrain from using its Security Council veto to  block any U.N. condemnation of the incident. If the world body fails to take  action, he said, "our reaction will be very severe . . . against Israel in a  direct way."  </P> <P> The Security Council should require the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the  West Bank and Gaza Strip and their replacement by an international peace force,  Abbas said. This proposal has been put forth before by Palestinian leaders.  </P> <P> Abbas, head of the maverick Palestine Liberation Front and a member of the  Palestine Liberation Organization's ruling council, talked with reporters at  PLF headquarters in Baghdad.  </P> <P> Compared to past statements, his performance was relatively tempered and  appeared to be aimed at creating divisions between European countries and the  United States. He singled out France for praise of its Middle East policies.  </P> <P> He linked the violence in Jerusalem to the Persian Gulf crisis and asserted  that it was the first step in an Israeli plot to invade and occupy Jordan,  where popular sentiment is strongly pro-Iraqi.  </P> <P> A thickset, unsmiling man, Abbas was behind the 1985 hijacking of the Italian  cruise ship Achille Lauro, in which an elderly American, Leon Klinghoffer, was  shot and pushed overboard. Last May, Abbas' forces mounted an abortive raid on  Israeli beaches. Washington and Jerusalem have branded him a terrorist.  </P> <P> "Will the international community expect us to keep silent in the face of this  massacre?" Abbas asked. "What will you say in the future if there is a reaction  from our side? Will you say it's a terrorist action?"  </P> <P> He insisted that Palestinians have a "legitimate right to armed defense."  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / River bank Midland Bank, which was taken over by Hongkong Bank in June, is to lease Thames Exchange, one of the largest buildings in the City, for the combined group's treasury operations, Vanessa Houlder writes. James Capel, the stockbroker owned by Hongkong Bank, will also move into the 190,000 sq ft building adjacent to Southwark Bridge. Its decision to move follows bomb damage to its existing building in April. Thames Exchange, which was built by Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese civil-engineering contractor, was completed a year ago. The building was chosen because it can accommodate up to 800 dealing positions on its trading floor. Midland's treasury team will move out of the first two floors of Midland Montagu's building on Lower Thames Street, while 120 dealers from Hongkong Bank will move from premises in Bishopsgate. The letting of Thames Exchange is the largest deal this year in the City. According to Savills, chartered surveyors, a total of 280,000 sq ft of offices were taken up in the City in July.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Leaders of an Islamic Palestinian organization have  pointed out that the implementation of self-rule will not  prevent the organization from exercising its rights to attack  Zionist forces and settlers with arms in Palestine. The  organization noted that, since the self-rule will be implemented  on 2 percent of the Palestinian land only, the leaders seek to  draw up a new plan that would enable them to evade any  confrontation with the Palestinian police.</p>

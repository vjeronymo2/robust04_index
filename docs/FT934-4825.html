			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Levitt sentence defended: Fellow group director is fined Pounds 750 and disqualified for 18 months The judge in the trial of Mr Roger Levitt yesterday defended his decision to impose a community service order on the former financial services salesman. Mr Justice Laws gave further detailed reasons for the sentence while imposing a Pounds 750 fine on the fourth defendant in the case, Mr Alan McNamara. Mr McNamara, a former commercial director with the Levitt Group, was also disqualified from being a company director for 18 months. The judge stressed that the sentences were strictly in line with the charges to which Mr McNamara, along with Mr Levitt and Mr Mark Reed, the Levitt Group's former managing director, had pleaded guilty. These related only to the deception of Fimbra, the regulatory body that over-saw the Levitt Group. Fimbra officers had been given false documents, including fee-notes, invoices and minutes of a board meeting, which all purported to show that Pounds 21m injected into the company by Mr Levitt had been earned as a result of advisory work. The judge told Mr McNamara yesterday: 'You do not fall to be sentenced for cheating anybody out of any money whatsoever - as I hoped I had explained last week.' In imposing the service orders on Mr Levitt and Mr Reed, the judge said the fraudulent trading they had admitted to occurred in the closing stages of the Levitt Group saga. 'The persons, including banks and private individuals who had lost money as a result of the affairs of the business, had already lost it by the time false documents were put up to Fimbra,' he said. Mr McNamara pleaded guilty last week to recklessly providing false and misleading information to the regulators under Section 201 of the Financial Services Act. The judge said this was a less serious offence than that admitted by Mr Levitt and Mr Reed since it did not involve dishonesty. The judge said Mr McNamara was in a different category from Mr Levitt and Mr Reed. He had been 'swept along' by others, notably Mr Levitt. However, he rejected the argument by Mr Howard Godfrey QC, for Mr McNamara, that a conditional discharge was the appropriate sentence. Mr McNamara's offence was too serious, he said. 'The regulatory authorities cannot do their work for the protection of investors, whose individual funds may be modest, if they are unable to rely on information given to them because it turns out to be wholly false,' he said. Mr McNamara was originally charged with fraudulent trading alongside Mr Levitt and Mr Reed. This was reduced to breaching the Financial Services Act as part of the Serious Fraud Office's plea-bargaining. Had this been the original charge against Mr McNamara he would have pleaded guilty to it three years ago, Mr Godfrey told the court.</p>

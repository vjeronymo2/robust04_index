			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sugar takes majority control of Spurs Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, yesterday took majority control of the football club by acquiring 500,000 shares from Mr Tony Berry, former chairman of the Blue Arrow employment services group. The transaction, announced following consultation with the Takeover Panel, takes Mr Sugar's stake from 47 per cent to 50.1 per cent. Mr Berry sold the shares at 100p each. He is a long-term ally of Mr Sugar, who is also chairman of Amstrad. The deal gives Mr Sugar 8.15m shares in the company, while Mr Berry's stake has declined to 300,000. Tottenham Hotspur said last night: 'The aggregate number of shares in which Mr Berry and Mr Sugar - who are deemed to be acting in concert for the purposes of the City code on takeovers and mergers - are interested remains unchanged at 8.45m.' Shares in the club remained unchanged yesterday at 105p.</p>

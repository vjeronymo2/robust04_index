			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: European paper tops performance charts for June EUROPE'S high-yielding government bond markets topped the bond performance charts for June, reflecting expectations that interest rates in Europe will continue to fall. Italy showed the strongest performance in local currency terms with a gain of 4.65 per cent last month, according to JP Morgan's Government Bond Index Monitor. Spain showed a return of 3.61 per cent - as the general election result in early June sparked a rally in the market, - followed by Denmark, with 3.44 per cent, and the UK, with 3.36 per cent. 'Pressure continues to mount for high European real interest rates to decline,' JP Morgan points out in its monthly report. Although France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Ireland all eased during the month, the combination of slow growth, rising unemployment and concern about structural deficits has raised hope of further easing in interest rates. 'Bond markets worldwide provided investors with positive returns during June. These local currency gains were recorded as the marketplace adjusted to the realisation of deep-seated economic weakness throughout Europe, and the concomitant implications for future yield curve movements', JP Morgan says. The US bank points out that while the Italian-German 10-year yield spread has narrowed from about 627 basis points at the start of the year to 461 basis points, 'yields in Italy still have room to moderate, especially in view of recent currency stability'. For US-based investors, the strength of the dollar has meant that the US Treasury bond market has provided the biggest monthly return, with a gain of 2.04 per cent, followed by Japanese government bonds with a return of 1.94 per cent.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Czech banks warned on loans Loan losses have wiped out the capital of some Czech commercial banks, according to an investigation by the country's central bank. 'There could be some banks in the system that have negative capital adequacy,' said Mr Ota Kaftan, head of banking supervision at the Czech National Bank. Three small institutions have already collapsed, and Agrobanka, the fifth-largest bank, had to seek an injection after loan losses destroyed its capital. Further failures would mar an international image which has, in the latest quarter, allowed three of the largest banks to raise syndicated loans at only 65-70 basis points over the London interbank rate. Komercni, Obchodni and Investnici banks, the main borrowers on international markets, have evaluated their portfolios according to strict, international standards at least since their 1993 results. The CNB has, however, exposed a much higher level of bad debts than previously recorded for the sector as a whole. The key ratio of non-performing loans to assets jumped from 12 per cent in August to 20 per cent in September, the first month in which the new international methodology was applied. Accounting, according to international standards, will force those Czech banks which have not yet translated their accounts to recognise loan losses that may exceed their capital. Ceska Sporitelna, the savings bank traded on the Prague stock market, is the largest lender on the interbank market and is particularly exposed to defaults by smaller banks. The CNB said an adjustment for collateral and government guarantees improved the picture, and warned that the figures could be misleading.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ONEX CORP. COMPLETES AUTO PARTS ACQUISITION  </P> <P> Holding company Onex Corp. said it has completed its almost-$180-million  acquisition of Strasburg, Va.  </P> <P> -based Automotive Industries Inc., which makes molded plastic car parts and  modules.  </P> <P> The deal, first announced in January, was to be completed in mid-February but  financing took longer to arrange.  </P> <P> Tony Johnson, a partner in the deal, said the automotive sector's downturn in  January resulted in stretching out financing plans.  </P> <P> Hidden Creek Industries, a partnership between Onex and Johnson, purchased the  parts maker from Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle PLC as part of an investment  strategy to acquire automotive and industrial manufacturers.  </P> <P> Automotive Industries employs 2,000 workers at five plants in the United States  and three in Canada.  </P></p>

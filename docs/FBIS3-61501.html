Mikulskaya; UDC 635.1/8:631.34]    [Abstract] A 2.8-m-wide experimental pneumatic vegetable  planting disinsection unit for class 1.4 tractors developed by  the Scientific Production Association of Belarussian  Agricultural Mechanization is described. The pneumatic vegetable  planting disinsection unit consists of a vacuum chamber which  carries an axial-flow controlled output fan and guides for  changing the flow direction as well as insect intake chambers.  The operating procedure is outlined in detail. A pilot prototype  of the PDO-4.2 disinsectization unit has been developed on the  basis of this device and has passed preliminary tests at the  Belarussian Machine Testing Station. The device manufactured by  the pilot plant of the Central Scientific Research Institute of  Rural Mechanization and Electrification in Agriculture has been  integrated in the vegetable agriculture mechanization system of  the Belarus Republic.

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Ofgas acts to boost competition British Gas and Ofgas, the industry regulator, have agreed that 500m therms of gas will be made available next year for release to British Gas's competitors. The amount is similar to that released in the first two years of the programme, which was set up to stimulate competition in the supply of gas to large industrial and commercial users. Since its inception the independent gas marketing companies have captured about 70 per cent of the firm-contract market.</p>

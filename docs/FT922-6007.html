			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sharp fall at Mitsubishi Materials MITSUBISHI Materials, a leading Japanese maker of metals and ceramics, posted a 25.7 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y20.3bn (Dollars 156m) for the year to end-March. Net profits also plunged, by 20.2 per cent, to Y32.8bn on a special gain related to land sales. Weak sales of gold and declines in demand and prices for other metals amid the domestic economic sluggishness were behind the poor profit performance. In contrast, aluminium can sales posted gains due to increasing environmental concerns. The company, which changed its name from Mitsubishi Metal after merging with Mitsubishi Mining and Cement in December 1990, posted a 3.5 per cent sales gain for the year to Y787.8bn. However, in the period ending in March 1991 cement sales relating to a subsidiary involved in the merger contributed for only four months. Calculated at the same rate over the entire period comparable turnover for the year just ended was off Y113bn, Mitsubishi Materials said. For the current term, Mitsubishi Materials expects a partial recovery in metals demand as well as continued gains in its aluminium can operations. Sales are forecast to gain 4 per cent to Y820bn and pre-tax profits 3 per cent to Y21bn. However, in the absence of further land sales net profits are seen falling 69 per cent to Y10bn.</p>

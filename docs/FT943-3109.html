			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: EdF takes stake in Swedish generator Electricite de France, the French state utility, has negotiated the purchase of a 5.5 per cent stake in Sydkraft, Sweden's second largest electricity producer. The deal forms part of EdF's strategy of making foreign acquisitions as well as expanding its sales abroad. EdF, the world's largest electricity producer, said it would pay SKr1.1bn (Dollars 150m) for the stake, which would give it 9 per cent of the voting rights in Sydkraft. Like EdF, Sydkraft is an integrated generator and distributor of electricity. It serves 1.2m customers in southern Sweden, and last year made a net profit equivalent to FFr1.5bn (Dollars 270m) on turnover worth some FFr8bn, EdF said. Sydkraft's shareholders are mainly Swedish, in particular the city of Malmo, which led the negotiations with EdF. However, Preussenelektra, a subsidiary of Veba, the German energy conglomerate, already has a larger stake in Sydkraft than the one EdF plans to take. EdF is stepping up its international acquisitions. Two years ago it bought into an Argentine electricity distributor and last year it took stakes in Spanish and Portuguese power generating companies. However, for the moment the French government has no intention of opening the French utility's capital to outsiders.</p>

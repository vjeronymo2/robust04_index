			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Entrenched in the past? Sir, Any long-term holders of shares in one of the five major UK composites are entitled to feel aggrieved at the present low ebb of their investment, with quoted prices little more than they were 10 years ago in some cases. And they have also suffered reduced dividends through massive losses. Although these have been reversed, we are now told that current improved insurance rates may not hold. This bodes ill for the future. According to prices in the FT's London Share Service of April 2, the five UK composites are worth in total some Pounds 12bn. Even if you include the two major UK life companies, Legal &amp; General and Prudential, the total reaches some Pounds 20bn. This is only the same figure as that of Allianz alone, and not far in excess of the other London quoted overseas group, American General. Surely economy of size must indicate that mergers should have taken place long ago. And is it possible that individual groups have desisted from this course of action in order to postpone the inevitable disclosure of trading problems? This might perhaps include large book losses arising from excessive purchases of property at the height of the recent boom, and the antics of high pressure salesmen employed to sell their products on a commission-only basis. Or is it simply to preserve the identity of the once glorious empires of times gone by - times that are unlikely ever to return? I suspect there will shortly be some lively annual meetings called.

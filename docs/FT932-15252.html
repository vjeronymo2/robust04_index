			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank of England sets date for Ecu500m notes tender THE Bank of England has set its Ecu500m tender of three-year notes for April 20, providing some vital liquidity to a market which has been starved of paper in recent months, writes Tracy Corrigan. It is the second T-note tender by the Bank of England, following its Ecu1.2bn tender in February, since the collapse of the Ecu market forced the T-note programme to be put on hold last autumn. But prospects for further supply in the Ecu market remain rather grim. Only the UK and France among European sovereign borrowers are showing substantial commitment to the market through regular programmes. But France has already raised 45 per cent of this year's Ecu financing (which accounts for 15 per cent of its total funding), and the only other European sovereign borrower to tap the market so far this year was Finland, with an opportunistic Ecu500m deal in February. Otherwise, the market has had to rely on agency funding.</p>

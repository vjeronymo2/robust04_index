			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: NZ government offering well received INSTITUTIONAL support returned to the New Zealand bond market yesterday, with the latest government tender closing oversubscribed, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. This was in contrast to the previous one a fortnight ago, a failure which provoked considerable uncertainty in financial markets. The latest tender, which sought NZDollars 350m, attracted bids of NZDollars 1152m for the three maturities offered. However, yields barely moved, indicating, according to the treasury manager of a leading bank, that the market was unsure of where the economy was headed over the next 12 to 18 months and was not prepared to take a strong position. He said the bids came from institutions and banks needing to do business, but no one was prepared to take the market anywhere. In the tender, the 1995 bonds saw an average yield of 8.10 per cent; 1996 bonds yielded 8.8 per cent; and March 2002 showed a yield of 9.35 per cent.</p>

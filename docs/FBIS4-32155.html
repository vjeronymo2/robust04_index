			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>   [Text] Sofia, June 17 (BTA) -- "There is every evidence  that the position of the incumbent Bulgarian Government on human  rights and the rights of Muslims in Bulgaria in particular is  the right one," Dr. Ahmad 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid, secretary  general of the League of Arab States, told a news conference  today at the end of his official visit. The visit, paid at the  invitation of Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, is  the first one by a leader of the collective body of the Arab  states to Bulgaria. During his visit, the guest acquainted  himself with the Bulgarian Government's positions on the Arab  region and on a number of international problems.    "The problem of Muslims in Bulgaria has been raised at all  my  meetings at different levels," Dr. Majid said. "Based on what I  have been told, I can draw the conclusion that at the moment all  Bulgarian citizens enjoy equal rights irrespective of their  religion," he went on to say. Concerning Bulgaria's request for  assistance in removing the question of Bulgarian Muslims from  the agenda of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the  guest promised to inform the organization's leadership about  everything he had learned in Bulgaria and expressed his hope  that the request would be met.    The possibility of Bulgarian companies taking part in  building the infrastructure in the region of Jericho and the  Gaza Strip was also discussed with Dr. Majid. "Bulgaria has  been maintaining active relations with the Arab countries, it  has taken part in the building of their infrastructure and I  think it is perfectly natural for it to take part in the  construction in that area," Dr. Majid said.    Asked about the stand of the League of Arab States on the  latest developments in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM], Dr. Majid expressed his hope that  Macedonia would continue to develop normally, avoiding any  conflicts and bloodshed. "No doubt what is happening in  Macedonia now has a negative effect on its neighbours, Bulgaria  included," he stated.    Earlier today Dr. Majid was received by President Zhelyu  Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. He met National  Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov too.    It was stressed at the meeting with President Zhelev that  Bulgarian-Arab cooperation should be restored and activated.  "In a historical, geographical and economic aspect, Bulgaria  has always maintained good contacts with the Arab states," Kamen  Velichkov, the president's foreign political adviser, said after  the meeting.    The positions of Bulgaria and the Arab League on some major  issues in the Balkans and the Middle East were clarified at Dr.  Majid's meeting with the chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament.  Both sides agreed that Bulgaria would only benefit from the  quick settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.    Meeting with Prime Minister Berov, Dr. Majid showed interest  in the difficulties Bulgaria has got to overcome in the  implementation of economic reform and in its transition to a  market economy; he was also interested in the progress of  negotiations on Bulgaria's foreign debt with the international  financial institutions, government spokesman Raycho Raykov said  after the meeting. Prime Minister Berov stressed the fact that  despite the difficulties, Bulgaria's transition to a  market-based economy is peaceful. The guest wanted to know if  foreign investments are protected in Bulgaria; he was assured  that they are and that Bulgarian and foreign investors are  treated on an equal footing.    Dr. Majid visited St. Aleksandur Nevski Cathedral in the  centre of Sofia. He took a walk round the open market-place in  the square in front of the cathedral where Bulgarian artists and  craftsmen sell their works. He seemed to be especially  interested in Bulgarian crafts and crochetwork. Tomorrow Dr.  Majid will be visiting the Rila Monastery. He is leaving the  country on Sunday.</p>

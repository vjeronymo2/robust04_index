			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Kohl demands tough public spending cuts CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday demanded harsh cuts in public spending as the Bundesbank warned that his government's policies were partly to blame for an unexpected surge in money supply growth last month. Mr Kohl told a cabinet meeting that every department had to make economies. They had to be found and negotiated within a few weeks, in time for inclusion in the 1994 draft budget, to be finalised on July 13. His warning coincided with the release of central bank figures showing growth in the M3 measure of money supply had shot though the bank's upper target level of 6.5 per cent during April, despite a significant slowdown in bank lending. M3, regarded as a key indicator of future inflation, expanded at an annualised adjusted rate of 7.3 per cent, after trailing well below the lower target level of 4.5 per cent during the previous three months. In a pointed commentary on the figures, the Bundesbank said a large proportion of its DM13bn (Pounds 5.2bn) profits for 1992 - credited to Bonn during the month - had already gone into circulation. 'As a result public sector cash transactions have given monetary developments a renewed push'. The provisional figures, released during a meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council which elected to leave key discount and lombard interest rates unchanged, underline the government's difficulties in meeting Bundesbank demands for spending restraint. Recession is biting into state revenues and forcing up welfare and unemployment payments. The need for renewed efforts to prune public sector spending stems from a forecast shortfall in tax revenues of DM25.8bn next year and a total of more than DM100bn for the period up to 1996. One encouraging sign in the figures was a marked deceleration in the rate of bank credit growth, a major influence on M3. Lending to enterprises and individuals in April rose DM13.3bn after an increase of DM30bn in March. Credit expansion in the six months to the end of April had grown at an annualised rate of just over 8 per cent compared with almost 9 per cent in the period to the end of March. Meanwhile, monetary capital formation, the transfer of funds into longer-term deposits and instruments not included in M3, had weakened and rose only DM2.9bn after a DM13bn increase in March.</p>

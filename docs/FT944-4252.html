			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Life sales by phone 'would need discounts' Significant cuts in charges for life insurance would be needed before most people would be prepared to buy policies over the telephone, according to a survey conducted by MORI-On Line. The poll found that 60 per cent of those questioned would be ready to buy a Pounds 100-a-month premium life insurance or an investment policy premium on the telephone if charges in the first year were 40 per cent less than they would pay in buying from a sales agent face-to-face. On average, only 11 per cent said they would be prepared to buy financial services over the telephone without a discount. The range was from 15 per cent for life insurance to 9 per cent for pensions and mortgages. While life insurers are allowed to set their charges differently for various ways of selling - for example through a direct sales force and through independent advisers - they have shown little enthusiasm for doing so. The danger for them is that if a customer can buy the same policy more cheaply through a particular form of distribution, then the more expensive one is undermined. The survey showed that just over three-quarters of those questioned preferred face-to-face contact with sales agents as a way of buying life insurance. Merchants, a financial services management consultancy which commissioned the poll, highlighted the finding that 80 per cent of those questioned said that the new regime for giving customers more information about policies - including charges and commission levels - would make them shop around for the lowest charge rates. Answers to the previous question showed, however, that only about four in 10 of respondents were aware that the new requirements were coming into force.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Environment  Ministry today decided to prevent the import of dangerous waste  coming mainly from Germany and described as material destined  for further processing.    A newly issued regulation binds the Czech buyers of such  shipments to take them over still on foreign countries'  territory, Marie Seborova told journalists today.    Seborova, director of the Czech Environment Inspection  Office, said that the measure would prevent situations similar  to that occurring at the railway station in Decin, North  Bohemia, a few days ago. Twenty-two railway carriages loaded  with dangerous waste were detained and side-tracked there in  May. The trouble culminated when German customs officers  refused to take the carriages back, citing administrative  reasons.    Metallic scrap is allowed to contain a maximum of two  percent  of non-metallic waste. Both experts from the firm buying the  scrap and laymen can distinguish whether or not the limit was  surpassed, Seborova said.    Eleven carriages to be returned to Germany are still waiting  in Decin. Environment inspectors fear the exporter may attempt  to transfer the returned waste on another border crossing back  to the Czech Republic, Seborova said.</p>

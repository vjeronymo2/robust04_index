			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Riot police in Athens battle with anarchists POLICE charged hundreds of Greek anarchists rampaging through central Athens yesterday, hurling petrol bombs and setting office buildings alight, Reuter reports from Athens. For the second night running, police used batons to disperse more than than 500 anarchists who set fire to two banks, a post office, the building housing an office of the ruling New Democracy party, about six bus ticket booths and a fire engine. The youths moved through the capital by trailing behind a march marking the anniversary of the 1973 Athens student uprising against the military junta which ruled Greece between 1967 and 1974. On Monday, Greek anti-riot squads fired teargas and battled with some 200 anarchists who swarmed through streets near the polytechnic.</p>

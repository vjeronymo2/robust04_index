			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cold comfort from Alaska for BP - The problems facing the UK oil company's US subsidiary THE boardroom upheaval at British Petroleum last week came at a difficult time not only for the group, but especially for BP America, the US subsidiary that is examining ways to reverse its flagging performance. BP America, whose Alaskan oil fields last year provided more than half of BP's worldwide crude oil production of 1.36m barrels, is of critical importance to group strategy for a number of reasons. Not only are the Alaskan oil fields one of the most valuable assets owned by any British company outside the UK, but some 47 per cent of total BP oil and gas reserves are in the US. Operating profit from the US, before stockholding gains and losses and interest expenses, was Pounds 1.04bn last year - the single biggest con- tributor to the group figure of Pounds 2.6bn and more than twice the level generated in the UK. Of the Pounds 1.04bn US profit, some Pounds 988m came from oil production, mainly in Alaska. Unfortunately, BP America's 1991 operating profit was 29 per cent lower than the previous year, due mainly to sharply lower refining and marketing earnings, losses from the chemicals division and a decline in Alaskan output income that Wall Street analysts say is destined to continue throughout the 1990s. Worse still, energy sector analysts in the US are almost universal in predicting a gloomy outlook for BP America - in terms of profits - for the next couple of years. The Cleveland-based operation has also been harshly criticised by several analysts who perceive a reversal in strategy on the downstream (refining and marketing) side of the business and an almost inevitable decline in the amount of cash that will be thrown off by the all-important Alaskan operation. Problems in the US are nothing new for BP. Indeed it was Mr Robert Horton, ousted as chairman last Thursday, who was despatched in 1986 to Cleveland to clean house and plot a new strategic thrust. Mr Horton slashed employee numbers and within a year of arriving helped engineer the Dollars 7.7bn purchase of the remaining 45 per cent of Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) that BP did not already own. The Sohio link had been forged back in 1969 when BP traded its Alaskan oil interest for an initial 25 per cent of the Ohio company that was originally founded as John D Rockefeller's sprawling Standard Oil Trust. Just before the Sohio refining and marketing business was melded with the Alaskan oil operation and transformed into BP America, British managers forced Sohio to take a Dollars 1.4bn writedown on half of its exploration leases, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico. BP later also unloaded Kennecott Copper, which was bought by Sohio in 1981. Then, armed with a network of 8,000 petrol stations, two thirds of which were former Gulf Oil outlets acquired in 1985, BP America proceeded with an ambitious expansion strategy that was aimed at creating an integrated US energy business. A central pillar of this strategy was an attempt to correct the geographic imbalance that stemmed from having a huge crude oil output from Alaska, but refining operations located in faraway places such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Louisiana. By October 1988, after Mr Horton had already returned to London as a managing director, the effort moved ahead with the Dollars 152m purchase of a Mobil refinery in Washington state and a campaign to bolster west coast downstream operations including a network of petrol stations in California. The west coast strategy came crashing down just four weeks ago, when BP, as part of its asset disposal plans, put both its California and Florida filling stations up for sale. A further element of the shift came just 24 hours before Mr Horton's ousting last week, when US job cuts included not only half of the Cleveland headquarters staff, but up to 500 positions on the refining and marketing side. 'BP's American strategy,' says Mr Frank Knuettel, an energy analyst at Prudential Securities, 'has been changing more rapidly than the guard at Buckingham Palace'. 'The foray into the west coast has met with disaster,' opines Mr Michael Young, a BP watcher at Smith Barney in New York. Rising costs related to the need to upgrade BP refineries in light of the Clean Air Act in the US - which are estimated by analysts at between Dollars 800m and Dollars 1bn between now and 1997 - are one factor making for the gloomy outlook. Another is the depressed state of margins on this side of the business. Nor is the outlook from Alaska especially rosy. Mr John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, notes that as the largest single producer of Alaskan oil 'BP is obviously here to stay and will continue to be a major force in the US oil market.' While no one questions the importance of Alaska, BP America acknowledges that output from Prudhoe Bay is declining by 10 per cent a year. By the end of the 1990s, output is likely to have fallen from its 1991 level of 717,000 barrels a day to less than 200,000 a day. In addition, BP's hopes of extending the life of it Alaskan investment by drilling in the nearby Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - the last potential major field left in North America - have been on hold since the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in 1989. Unit operating costs in Alaska are meanwhile rising as the decline in output continues. This leads Mr Knuettel to a pessimistic overall assessment that is shared by other analysts: 'BP America today is not particularly different from Sohio prior to the 1987 takeover - except that now their main source of income is decelerating and the Clean Air Act is going to be very costly to them.' Against this backdrop, BP group directors are expected to be presented shortly with a series of US options. The underlying problem appears to be that there are no easy solutions for BP America because it is hard to identify current businesses that can be grown without an acquisition or a scale of investment in the US that the BP group debt burden may well preclude.  --------------------------------------------------------------------      BP AMERICA'S CONTRIBUTION TO 1991 GROUP OPERATING PROFITS*  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               British Division                                    BP America  Petroleum Plc                                               Pounds m       Pounds m  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Exploration and production                         988         1,802 Refining and marketing                             123           945 Chemicals                                          -12            -7 Nutrition                                            5            37 Other business and corporate activities            -61          -222                                         Total    1,043         2,555  -------------------------------------------------------------------- * Replacement cost operating profit before stockholding gain or losses and interest expenses.  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

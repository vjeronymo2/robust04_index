			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: IHT limit is 'grotesque' I am resident and domiciled in Switzerland and my wife is resident and domiciled in Italy. We are both in our 70s and, although we have chosen to live apart, she would normally benefit from my estate if I were to pre-decease her. I understand that if I were to resume a domicile in the UK and she remained in Italy, I would be allowed to leave her only Pounds 55,000 free of inheritance tax, whereas she could receive any amount available free of inheritance tax if she were domiciled in the UK. I believe the figure - which seems grotesque - was set in 1982. Is there any way of pressing the authorities to review the question? The purpose of the Pounds 55,000 limit (set by the Finance Act 1982) was, broadly speaking, to discourage British citizens from marrying foreigners. The limit is based upon domicile, as distinct from nationality; but, in fact, the great majority of people who are domiciled in one of the three constituent countries of the United Kingdom are British citizens and the great majority of people who are domiciled overseas obviously are not. Your wife might like to raise the matter with the European Commission on behalf of nationals of EU states other than the UK. The European Court has confirmed that discrimination on the basis of residence can constitute unlawful de facto discrimination between nationals of one state and another; so it is pretty certain that discrimination on the basis of domicile (as determined under English, Scots or Northern Ireland law, as the case may be) constitutes de facto discrimination between nationals of EU states. Your wife could write to the Directorate General II, Economic and Financial Affairs, Financial Integration and Capital Movements, Rue de la Loi 200, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

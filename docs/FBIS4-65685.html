			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Schwerin (DPA) -- The new EU [European Union]  structural funds for eastern Germany will be made available as  soon as possible. A group of experts will be set up to remove  any existing problems of a structural improvement concept. This  is what the minister-presidents of the new laender and the  president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, agreed  upon in Schwerin on 13 May.    Since the beginning of this year, the new laender have  formed  part of the highest category of EU aid, the so-called target-1  regions. From 1994 to 1999, they will receive a total of  approximately 27.5 billion German marks [EU] from the EC  structural fund. So far, it was not clear in what way and for  what purpose the structural funds were to be used. The EU, the  Federal Government, and the new laender have negotiated for  months on a common aid concept for eastern Germany. That is why  the EU funds could not flow into the new laender.

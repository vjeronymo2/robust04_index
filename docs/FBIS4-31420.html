			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu at Bucharest's </F> Otopeni Airport on 8 June upon his return from an official visit  to Croatia -- recorded]    [Text] We have just returned from an official visit to the  Republic of Croatia. In keeping with the established program,  we met with President Franjo Tudjman and Prime Minister Nikica  Valentic, with members of the government and other officials  from the local administration leaderships, such as the Zagreb  City Hall and the Pula City Hall, and with other prominent  figures from the area and from Rijeka. We also visited several  economic units.    At the same time, the visit gave us the opportunity to  discuss all matters pertaining to the development of bilateral  relations, beginning with political issues, whereby the Croatian  officials requested Romania's further support, in view of our  principled position of applying equal treatment to all states in  the former Yugoslav space. They asked that we should play a  more active role in solving the current problems in that area.  We also gave priority to economic matters, with both sides  pointing out the many opportunities for developing and expanding  our relations of cooperation and trade exchanges and for setting  up joint companies. Of course, we are dealing here with a pretty  broad program. However, the important thing is that all  officials we met there asked that Romania should become involved  in the projects for the reconstruction of the areas affected by  the war. Here is a propitious field for an active participation  of Romania, with various companies, in these programs.    We also had a talk with the economy minister from the  Croatian-Muslim Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who also asked  for an active presence by Romania in the reconstruction areas.  Of course, we are directly interested in all these projects,  which have been assured of foreign financing.    I would like to add here that three important agreements  were  signed on the occasion of the visit. I am referring to the  agreement on mutually guaranteeing and protecting investments,  the agreement on maritime transportation, and an agreement on  cooperation in the health sphere. We are in the process of  finalizing an agreement on avoiding double taxation and an  agreement between the Chambers of Trade and Industry of the two  countries. Generally speaking, I would say that all the visited  units expressed their interest in the resumption of our  cooperation ventures, since there has been a sort of tradition  -- one may say -- of cooperation in machine building, in the  production of naval engines by Romanian and Croatian shipyards,  as well as in metallurgy, the food industry, and the  pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we discussed a broad range  of opportunities.    In conclusion, I would say that this visit to Croatia has  practically been a continuation of the very efficient dialogue  that took place during the respective visits of the two  presidents -- I am referring to President Ion Iliescu's visit to  Croatia and President Franjo Tudjman's visit to Romania -- and  took place in the spirit of the Treaty of Friendship and  Cooperation existing between the two countries. We jointly  agreed that a number of delegations -- particularly from the big  companies and concerns -- should come to Romania in the  forthcoming period to put the final touches to the agreements we  have reached during this visit.    Of course, we also discussed various other problems, such as  our relations in the cultural, education, science, and sports  spheres. We have already concluded a few accords in this  respect. However, our greatest shortcoming is when we come to  concretely implementing all these understandings. Consequently,  in the forthcoming period, we plan to work out concrete action  programs for a two-year period, which can facilitate a constant  flow of information in both directions, a better understanding  between the two sides, and obviously mutual support for the  economies of both countries.    I would add here our intention -- which is also in  accordance  with the requests of our hosts -- to open a direct  Bucharest-Zagreb air link, which can also ensure further  connections with other areas, including such far away targets as  Singapore, Australia, and Brazil, where there is a substantial  Croat diaspora. This would be quite useful, and I hope that we  will manage to achieve this goal in the coming months.</p>

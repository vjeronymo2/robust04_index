			<p>BFN     [Text] Ivan Yermakov, one of the major candidates to be  chairman of the Sevastopol City Council and former envoy of the  Ukrainian president in this city, accused Kiev "of striving to  cancel or torpedo the elections to the local power bodies."  Commenting the latest changes in provisions for the elections in  his interview with INTERFAX, he said that Ukraine's leadership  "tries to buy time by any means in order to introduce something  else after the presidential elections in Ukraine and to prevent  elections of strong leaders in the region. Such leaders present  obstacles to Kiev."    On June 16 Ukraine's parliament adopted an amendment to the  decree on the elections to local power bodies which stipulates  that a candidate who collects more than 25 percent of the votes  will be considered elected. Earlier it was enough to collect  more than 10 percent.    In Yermakov's opinion, this decision "disperses the  electors'  votes." He stressed that earlier voter turnout did not exceed  50 percent and now "it will be difficult to gather people to the  elections during the period of summer vacations, especially for  a repeated round of voting."    "The necessary 25 percent to win actually represents half of  those who will come to vote. Meanwhile, as many as 11 people  are on the list of candidates," Yermakov declared.    Yermakov, who is also chairman of the Union of Prosperity In  Unity invited all candidates to negotiate so that everyone would  receive a deserved place in the team and would stand in the  common row for cooperation for the sake of the city's  well-being."    "If we do not make these steps together, then an envoy  appointed by another Kravchuk from Kiev will guide the city,"  Yermakov declared.    According to Sevastopol's state administration, a total of  34.7 percent of the Sevastopol residents intend to vote for  Yermakov; Alexander Penkin, second in command of the Black Sea  Fleet -- 13.1 percent; and former commander of the Black Sea  Fleet Aleksey Penkin -- 10.1 percent.</p>

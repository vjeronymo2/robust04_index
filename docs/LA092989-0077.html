			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Jerald Silva's masterfully painted watercolor nudes are caught somewhere  between Ingres' psychological portraits and strictly formal figure studies  toying with light, form and technique. Confusion arises because the female  figures are so often bland individuals at the mercy of the artist's technical  display. Yet occasionally they survive the assault with dogged inner strength.  </P> <P> This intensity enlivens the somewhat languid action in paintings like "Woman  Rising," where a seated nude, gazing determinedly straight ahead, is pictured  about to push off from a red chair directly at the viewer. Behind her on a  steam-fogged picture window are wet, drippy finger marks that catch her  willpower and radiate like an expressionistic halo.  </P> <P> Silva's dexterity with the figure and his ability to make watercolor steam drip  is wonderful. Loose, but accurate he can make color imitate just about any  light effect. Yet it's only when he stops fiddling with all the gee-whiz  effects and settles in to say something that the paintings really come to life.  His steamy "Olympia" is a wonderful visual pun on sexuality. Most moving is a  cunning and unsympathetic self-portrait. (Andrea Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway,  to Oct. 21.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Carrington says his peace role continues LORD CARRINGTON, the British chairman of the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia, yesterday denied reports that he intended to resign from his post. The reports had been fuelled both by a declaration adopted by last week's Group of Seven summit, suggesting that a broader international peace conference might be desirable, and a statement last Sunday by Sir John Nott, a former British defence secretary, that Lord Carrington's mission had outlived its usefulness. 'I was asked by the European Community whether I would do this and I don't think you give up because things have gone very badly, unless those who appointed you want to,' Lord Carrington said. If the EC peace mission were to be wound up and the whole process were to start again under the United Nations or another authority, it would not make any difference, he added. 'The problem is that they (the warring parties in Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia) do not want peace at the moment,' he said. Lord Carrington has nevertheless invited leaders of the various factions to a meeting in London tomorrow. The heads of the G7 industrial nations and those of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) who met in Helsinki shortly afterwards fully supported the EC conference as the right framework for reaching a durable political solution in the former Yugoslavia. However, their statement on the subject clearly hinted at growing dissatisfaction with the EC forum. France has been particularly active in canvassing an international peace conference, to the irritation of the British government, which has remained loyal to Lord Carrington's mission. Sir John Nott added grist to the mill when he said that a single country such as the US or France, with its historical links with the region, or possibly the United Nations, would do better at brokering peace negotiations, when the time was ripe. There is little consensus about the usefulness of the Community peace conference among the governments of the republics of the former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / BBA's era of big deals closes BBA, the engineering group, attempted to draw a line under the last eight years of big deals and rights issues as it reported profits before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 33.1m (Pounds 32.9m) in the first half of the year. Mr Vanni Treves, chairman, said: 'We are entering a new stage of consolidation. We do not want to issue more equity for the foreseeable future.' In place of the succession of cash calls to fund new deals, Mr Treves said the group would focus on four core businesses. The remaining parts, with turnover of about Pounds 200m, would be sold. The new strategy coincided with the departure of Mr John White, managing director, due to illness. Mr Treves rebutted speculation from some analysts and shareholders that the board had been unhappy with Mr White's performance over the last few years. 'If Mr White had not caught a virus he would still be chief executive,' he said. It is understood that BBA's directors, led by its two non-executives, Mr Lionel Stammers and Mr Robert Cooper, had been working on an 'orderly succession', in the longer term, to Mr White before he became ill. This was speeded up when Mr White became poorly and the group is now looking at four possible candidates to take over as managing director, although Mr Treves said: 'There is no sense of urgency.' Redundancy and reorganisation costs of Pounds 7.3m were much bigger than expected. The figure is expected to rise to Pounds 14.6m by the end of the year, mainly because of the severity of the German recession. 'We misread the German tea leaves,' said Mr Treves. Borrowings fell from Pounds 187m to Pounds 163m, representing gearing of 35 per cent. The group's disposal programme, which could raise about Pounds 130m, will significantly reduce debt by the year-end. Under the new FRS3 accounting standard, pre-tax profit rose from a restated Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 50.3m, which includes exceptional items of Pounds 17.2m. Operating profit rose to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 40.9m) on increased sales of Pounds 742m (Pounds 649.1m). Earnings per share declined to 4.2p (4.8p). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.25p.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tadashi Omae, general coordinator for the </F> Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission: "With  Inspections, To Watch With Impartial Stance and Handle  Infractions Resolutely; Year's Activities of Securities and  Exchange Surveillance Commission"]    [Text] More than a year has passed since the  Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission was established  on 20 July 1992. Ever since, the surveillance commission has  worked to get itself set up in various respects, such as firming  up the organization and in-service training for its staff,  endeavoring to put its operations into effect quickly and  concretely, and so far, it has conducted its assigned duties in  a generally orderly manner. The surveillance commission is  required by law to report publicly its business affairs.  Responding to that on last 15 October, it pulled together the  situation of its activities to date and published it as  "Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and Exchange  Surveillance Commission." In the following, I wish to report on  the year's activities since the surveillance commission started  out, based on the contents of the report.  <H5>  Report's Significance </H5>   Under laws establishing the Ministry of Finance, the  surveillance commission "must annually publish the situation of  its business affairs."    Amidst the soul-searching on the so-called security scandals  of 1991 and the study of countermeasures to that, the  surveillance commission was set up as part of the measures to  review the inspection and surveillance setup. For the  securities market and other institutions to discharge their  functions smoothly, it is essential that investor trust be  sustained that fairness of trading in the market is guaranteed  and that the market is fair. In that sense, if the surveillance  commission--having ensured fairness in securities trading and so  on--handles its functions properly and lets such activity be  widely known, it can contribute much to upholding investor trust  in market fairness. From such a viewpoint, reporting on the  activities of the surveillance commission is considered  obligatory; and, giving consideration to the objectives of the  laws, we have concretely considered the substance and  methodology of the report.  <H5>  Report Methodology </H5>   The report of the surveillance commission pulls together  business affairs that the surveillance commission handled during  the year and in its contents considers a fair amount of the  things it had to do. It was prepared in the form of a pamphlet  and mailed to those concerned so that it might also be offered  for perusal at outlets of the surveillance commission, financial  authorities, and institutions with voluntary controls. Also, a  summary of the report was carried in the official gazette.    We thought that putting out the report in this manner would  make it possible to have a wide sector of the public know about  the surveillance commission's activities.  <H5>  Gist of Report </H5>   In the "Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and  Exchange Surveillance Commission" pulled together this time we  covered activities which the surveillance commission engaged in  from 20 July 1992, when it was set up, through 30 June 1993. The  "Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and Exchange  Surveillance Commission" consists of an introduction and main  text. The introduction describes the details of setting up the  surveillance commission, its organization, and a summary of the  surveillance commission's business, while the main text  separately describes the chief duties of the surveillance  commission: Chapter 1. "Inspections"; Chapter 2. "Examinations";  Chapter 3. "Investigating Infractions"; Chapter 4. "Advisories";  Chapter 5. "Inspections of Financial Institutions by Minister of  Finance"; Chapter 6. "Institutions With Voluntary Controls"; and  Chapter 7. "Other Activities."    Based on the report's contents, the following sets forth the  surveillance commission's activities for the year.  <H5>  Inspections </H5>   1. Based on the inspection authority granted by the minister  of finance, the surveillance commission conducts on-site  inspections of securities firms and other financial institutions  with permits for security business from the standpoint of  ensuring fairness in things like securities trading.    2. For conducting inspections, the surveillance commission  laid down a basic inspection policy and basic inspection plan in  August 1992 for the 1992 business year (July 1992 through June  1993).    In this basic inspection plan for conducting inspections of  securities firms, et al., we set out to conduct accurate  inspections using the following points of emphasis:    a) Many-sided checking on observance of the various market  rules from the standpoint of ensuring fairness in securities  dealing.    b) From the standpoint of sustaining a healthy managerial  posture by securities firms and others, fully checking on such  aspects of their business posture as the facts on their  encouraging investments.    c) From the standpoint of ensuring reliability in the  securities business, reviewing and getting a grasp of the  circumstances of the internal management setup so as to fully  check on whether it is functioning effectively.    3. In the 1992 business year for inspections, the  surveillance commission and financial authorities undertook 84  inspections of securities firms and 11 inspections of financial  institutions with permits for handling securities business.    Of the inspections begun in this period, inspection findings  had been delivered by 30 June 1993 to inspected institutions and  inspections completed on 49 securities firms and seven financial  institutions with permits to conduct securities business.    4. To consolidate the results of inspecting securities  firms,  et al., according to the points of inspection emphasis: a) As to  their observance of trading rules, we found such problems as  inducements promising to provide special profits (so-called  "stock shuffling" [tobashi]), entrusting improper trading deals  in transferred company debentures and entrusting transaction  cleanup deals; b) as to their business posture, we found the  problems of placing excessive trust in clients and excessive  switched sales of investment trusts; and c) in their internal  managerial setups we found such things as corruption and client  disputes, leaking reports of corruption cases, and taking and  transferring orders with persons other than clients.    As for findings of major regulatory infractions as a result  of inspections, as stated below we sent advisories to the  minister of finance, contacted administrative authorities about  problems found in the inspections, and had instructions for  improvements sent from the said authorities to the parties  inspected.  <H5>  Examination of Transactions </H5>   1. As for examining transactions, based on authority granted  by the minister of finance under securities trading laws to  collect reports and data, we do daily market observations by  collecting reports and data from securities firms and financial  institutions with permits to conduct securities business.    2. In the period for this report, a total of 170  examinations  were conducted. Breaking these down by content, 154 examined  price structure, 12 examined insider trading, and four examined  other areas.    3. As to characteristics of the cases that were subjects of  examinations, due to the fact that, compared to earlier periods,  the activities of so-called "speculators" in buying up stocks in  volume have subsided amid the general stagnation of the  securities market, large and long-term cases were few and small  cases became more numerous.    As for the work of transaction examinations, although we  found that in many cases there was no problem, the examination  activity itself is functioning as a direct and indirect  deterrent to the kinds of transactions that become problems.  <H5>  Investigating Infractions </H5>   1. When it was necessary for the surveillance commission  staff to investigate infractions injurious to fairness in  dealing, they can do discretionary investigations by conducting  interrogations, inspections, custodial detainment, etc., as  well as mandatory investigations by spot inspections, searches,  and seizures under warrants issued by a judge.    The surveillance commission receives reports of  investigation  findings from its staff and, when it gets proof of an  infraction, issues an indictment.    The authority to investigate infractions is a newly created  power attendant to the surveillance commission's creation. By  bringing to light the truth about pernicious acts injurious to  fairness in dealing and by seeking criminal prosecution from  indictments, we hope it will play a major role in securing  fairness and health in the market.    2. In the period of this report, because of suspicions of  market manipulation of Tokyo Stock Exchange First Section listed  stock, in December 1992 the homes and offices of those suspected  of infractions were raided, searched,items seized in an enforced  investigation, and the needed investigation was conducted.    3. As a result of such investigation, on 21 May 1993, given  the fact of market manipulations by the two persons suspected  of the infractions, they were indicted by the Tokyo District  Public Prosecutor's Office for violating the securities trading  law.    (Note: With the surveillance commission's indictment, an  arraignment was effected 16 August by the Tokyo District  Prosecutor's Office against the two suspected of an infraction.)  <H5>  Advisories </H5>   1. When it has conducted inspections or investigations of  infractions and found it necessary, the surveillance commission  can advise the minister of finance, based on its findings, on  administrative punishment or other measures that should be taken  to ensure fairness in securities trading, etc.    2. In the period of this report, it provided the minister of  finance with the two following advisories on the outcome of its  inspections. Receiving these, the minister of finance effected  specific punishments.    a) With securities firm A, a violation having been found of  the regulations (inviting investments by promising to provide  special profits and entrusting improper dealing) by officers and  staff of the securities firm, an advisory was issued to seek  administrative punishment and other appropriate measures.    Based on this advisory, the minister of finance applied such  punishment as suspending the business of the involved section of  the securities firm. Also, receiving notification from the  Ministry of Finance, the Japan Association of Securities Dealers  levied the punishment of canceling its canvasser's registration.    b) With securities firm B, an infraction of relevant  regulations by an employee (concluding a contract for entrusting  a transaction cleanup deal) having been found, we issued an  advisory requesting suitable measures.    Based on the advisory and having received notification from  the minister of finance, the Japan Association of Securities  Dealers carried out the punishment of suspending the work of the  canvasser.  <H5>  Inspections of Financial Institutions by Minister of Finance </H5>   1. For basic items relating to the inspections it conducts  of  financial institutions, the minister of finance must heed the  views of the surveillance commission and must report to the  surveillance commission each quarter on the status of  inspections under way.    Furthermore, for inspections of financial institutions  conducted by the minister of finance, the surveillance  commission can make recommendations; but during the 1992  inspection year, it found no situations for which  recommendations were deemed necessary.    2. As to the inspections the minister of finance conducts,  the surveillance commission stated its opinion in August 1992  that, "based on current financial conditions, in inspecting  financial institutions, we should seek to understand precisely  the details of their assets, grasp the status of each financial  institution's rethinking of its internal office management,  etc., and by checking on whether that is functioning  effectively, should seek to conduct effective inspections in  carrying out our inspections.    3. According to a report from the minister of finance, in  the  1992 inspection year it initiated 249 inspections of financial  institutions, 54 inspections of foreign exchange institutions,  and 191 inspections of securities firms. Of these, as of 30 June  1993, it had completed the inspections of and sent instructions  to 158 inspected financial institutions, 32 inspected foreign  exchange institutions, and 134 inspected securities firms.  <H5>  Other Matters </H5>   Besides what has been stated above, in this report we  describe in detail the activities of such voluntary control  institutions as the Securities Dealers Association and  securities exchanges. Also, concerning the activities of the  surveillance commission, it touches upon 1) the fact that,  within the period of this report, the surveillance commission  did not find conditions on which it should make recommendations  on policies the Minister of Finance should adopt; 2) information  received from all sources during the period of this report came  to 497 items; and 3) to build links with authorities regulating  securities in other countries, we are applying for membership in  the International Organization of Securities Control Officers  (abbreviated IOSCO).    (Note: At the committee meeting of IOSCO representatives in  Mexico City on 25 October, the surveillance commission was  formally admitted.)    As indicated, we believe the surveillance commission has so  far faithfully carried out its expected role. Henceforth, in  doing inspections and other work we will be watching  transactions on the securities markets in accordance with laws  and regulations and with an impartial stance, while following a  course of resolutely dealing with infractions.    As for the surveillance commission, we will be pleased if  through such activities we can ensure fairness and transparency  of the market and contribute to the healthful manifestation of  its functioning.</p>

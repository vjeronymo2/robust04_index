			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOW AWAY  </P> <P> I was appalled at Harry Shearer's total lack of responsibility, both for his  own actions and as a journalist ("And Away They Tow," Man Bites Town, July 22).  </P> <P> Though this country has more freedom than any other in the world, our founding  fathers set rules, called laws, to make it work.  </P> <P> We, as citizens, must obey and respect the laws, whether we like them or not,  and if not, vote to change them. Clearly, Shearer has no respect for our laws,  or he just simply cannot read.  </P> <P> What would prompt someone to park directly under a sign that read: "Tow-Away,"  other than a complete act of defiance, not to mention total stupidity. And then  to take it a step further by blaming the police for doing their job.  Unfortunately, we will always have those citizens like Shearer, who feel they  are, for whatever reason, above the law.  </P> <P> Consider how you handle an emergency. Who do you go to for help? The police.  They are there to protect and serve. Many people do not like cops until they  need one. And last, but not least, if the Los Angeles Times Magazine is going  to endorse Shearer's "work," then please be more responsible. A lot of people,  including children, read the magazine every week: The immature visual depiction  of an unshaven, dirty pig in a police uniform is enough for even a 2-year-old  to comprehend.  </P> <P> RHONDA R.

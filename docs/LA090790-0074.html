			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> IBM in Venture to Create New Software: International Business Machines said it  formed a partnership with Metaphor Computer Systems of Mountain View to create  new software that will allow individual programs to work with multiple computer  operating systems and networks. Software publishers now must write different  versions of the same program for each different operating system. The pact  could strain IBM's relationship with Microsoft Corp., which has created most of  the operating system software used on IBM personal computers.  </P></p>

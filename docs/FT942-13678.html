			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo interest Takeover speculation continued to surround Lasmo with analysts pointing to Atlantic Richfield as a likely bidder. The speculation prompted heavy turnover with the ordinary shares trading 15m, the new 'nil paid' seeing volume of 13m and active volume in traded options. The shares closed 2 up at 147p. Mr Simon Flowers, oil analyst with NatWest, argued that the re-rating had been driven by the recent rights issue but the rights issue had 'forced the market to have a major review of Lasmo as an investment'. Both Elf and British Gas have been targeted as potential predators but both are believed to be preoccupied with their own concerns.</p>

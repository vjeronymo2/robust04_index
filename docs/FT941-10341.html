			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Little progress in market access discussions Mr Hosokawa and President Clinton meet will tomorrow announce the results of talks on four priority market sectors where the US would like to see improved foreign access. These are: Cars and car parts. The US claims that Japan's markets for cars and car parts are 'relatively closed' to foreign products. Japan imports only 3 per cent of its cars and 2 per cent of its car parts. Other OECD countries import between 22 and 78 per cent of their cars and 16 to 60 per cent of parts. In addition to improving access to these markets, the US wants qualitative and quantitative indicators to monitor progress. Japanese officials say to measure such progress they would accept the monitoring of past data, such as the number of Japanese dealers selling foreign cars or the number of US car makers selling right-hand drive cars in Japan. However, they are adamantly opposed to setting market share targets or parts procurement plans. The main reason US car makers have not been successful in Japan is that they do not make cars suited to the Japanese market. While 80 per cent of cars sold in Japan are under 2,000cc, no US car maker sells cars in Japan in that range. Moreover, the industry is in private hands, leaving little room for government action. Insurance. Japan has the world's second largest insurance market but foreigners have been able to take only 2 per cent of the market. This compares with foreign market share of 10 per cent to 34 per cent in other G7 countries. The US blames this on barriers such as a non-transparent regulatory regime and procurement practices based on cross-shareholding equity arrangements. The Japanese side says insurance should not be a trade matter in the first place. Telecommunications equipment procurement. The US claims that while Japan is the second-largest telecommunications market in the world, 5 per cent comprised imports in 1991 compared with an average 25 per cent in other G7 countries. The US, for example, imported 28 per cent of its telecommunications needs. Foreign companies are disadvantaged by the lack of access to procurement information, sole sourcing practices and overly-detailed tender specifications. The US would also like to see NTT, the privatised telecommunications company, included among organisations that would be subject to the government's public procurement guidelines. Japanese officials say that NTT is a private company and cannot be told what to buy. But there are signs of progress in this sector which is an area where the government can act to improve matters without unduly meddling in private business affairs. For example, the government recently announced an action programme to simplify procedures in government procurement, to use open tendering to the greatest extent possible and lower the threshold of government contracts requiring public notice from SDR1m (Pounds 920,000) to SDR800,000. Medical equipment procurement. Agreement in this area was announced yesterday by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown, though no details were available.  Concerns centred on poor US penetration of the Japanese market. In 1992, US companies sold equipment worth Y394bn (Pounds 2.4bn) to Japan, 28 per cent of a market worth Y1,428bn. US companies account for 47 per cent of the European market. Although there are no tariffs against American medical equipment, US manufacturers claimed they were disadvantaged by complex Japanese regulations and non-transparent bidding procedures. If Japan imported medical equipment at the same rate as other developed countries, the US could sell another Dollars 3bn a year.</p>

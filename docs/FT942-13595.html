			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Windsor after the fire - William Packer finds Alexander Creswell following in the tradition of Turner, Sandby and Piper with his evocative watercolours In the age of the photograph, the uses of the work of art as a thing of topographical or architectural record may often be overlooked, but the argument remains. In matters of particular emphasis and annotation, and of personal experience and response, the drawing or painting may take on a selective authority which the supposedly all-seeing camera can seldom match. There was Turner, watching from the river as the old Houses of Parliament went up in flames: there was Paul Sandby, noting down the informal daily life of the Windsor Castle of the later 18th century: there too, under darker neo-romantic skies, was John Piper, seeing the Castle in wartime through more dramatic eyes - 'you don't seem to have had much luck with the weather, Mr Piper', remarked the King. The great fire at Windsor Castle, late in 1992, touched a national, indeed an universal nerve, as the image went round the world of one of the great monuments and symbols of nationhood about to be, so it seemed, destroyed. No doubt, in its aftermath, every single square inch of the damage has been dutifully photographed, but how good it is to learn that an artist, Alexander Creswell, was also called in to make more subjective, perhaps, but no less pertinent a record. The damaged part of the Castle, he tells us, 'had been wrapped in plastic sheeting . . . isolated from the world . . . enshrouded. The sun filtered through from above . . . The plastic sheeting rustled . . . pigeons flapped around somewhere above . . . tourists gazed in . . . a band struck up in the Quadrangle, the tunes echoing round the empty walls, distorted and remote . . . The damage inside the Castle had created a fantasy, a ghost of a palatial interior.' Ruins are familiar enough to all of us, but it is the freshness of ruin and devastation that is so shocking: 'it was cold and sepulchral in the Castle, the rubble giving off a stench of black rot.' We see what he means. It is, of course, the documentary and circumstantial content of these dozen or so watercolours, commissioned for the Royal Collection, that will give them their immediate reclame, and it has to be said that at this first level they are immediately effective and satisfying. The mood is appropriately doom-laden and tragical, the perspectives looming and dramatic, the significant detail  - the skeletal rafters, the isolated malachite vase, a corner of gothic tracery, an empty frame - well-chosen and well-observed. But they are better than that, something more than of merely superficial interest and indulgence. A good story, after all, can bear the bad telling: told well, we are hardly aware of the telling at all. And Creswell does the business very well indeed, working with a freedom yet sureness of touch, and a simple, confident authority in the setting up of his composition, that together mark him out as a true painter, not just a reasonably efficient note-taker and recorder. For it is never the image alone, and what it represents, that makes the work of interest as art, but always the way it is done - the command of the medium, the direct, physical engagement with surface and material, the sense of adventure and discovery and an element of risk. Creswell's sketchbooks even more than the full-dress paintings give us this picture of the true artist, unselfconsciously absorbed in the subject. There is in all this, however, something of a paradox and a word of warning. Creswell is clearly a skilful painter, master of his chosen medium and his favoured architectural subject-matter. That said, it may well be that so strong and extraordinary was the experience afforded him by the devastation of Windsor Castle, that there was nothing for it but for him to lose himself and all his skill in the magnificent awfulness before him - which is precisely why his Windsor work is so successful. Is there is to the accompanying group of paintings, of great houses from Rome to St Petersburg, something rather less of the intuitive excitement, rather more of the mechanical and, dare I say, complacent? A few lines from Basil Bunting's Briggflatts come to mind: 'It is time to consider how Domenico Scarlatti/ condensed so much music into so few bars/ with never a crabbed turn or congested cadence/ never a boast or a see-here . . .' But the show is worth catching, the only pity that it has been on for so short a time. Alexander Creswell: watercolours - Windsor Castle after the Fire; Spink, 5 King Street, St James's, SW1, until April 28.</p>

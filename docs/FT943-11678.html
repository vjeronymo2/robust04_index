			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Berlusconi's troubles rebound on Bank of Italy The Berlusconi government has failed to resolve the delicate issue of nominating a new director-general for the Bank of Italy, letting the matter slip until September. The bank's higher council, responsible for making the formal nomination, had been expected to agree yesterday on a replacement for Mr Lamberto Dini, who became treasury minister after last spring's general election. But Mr Antonio Fazio, the bank's governor, failed to signal that the council would be called in extraordinary session; only such a meeting can determine who will hold the number two job at the bank. The postponement is a further sign of the difficulties faced by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister. It was only this week, after two months' wrangling among the right-wing coalition partners, that the compromise choice of Mr Michele Tedeschi was agreed to head Iri, the main state holding company. Attempts to find an acceptable successor to Mr Dini have come up against competing interests in the Bank of Italy and the government. Although the 13-man higher council chooses the replacement, their choice must be confirmed by the head of state in conjunction with the prime minister and treasury minister. In the wake of the council's previous abortive meeting at the start of the month, the government issued a strongly worded statement asserting its right to make nominations to senior posts at the bank. This right was not to be confused with the bank's autonomy, the statement insisted. However, the Bank of Italy continues to press for someone from within the institution, preserving both tradition and a sense of autonomy. The logical successor, in hierarchical terms, would be Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the senior of the two deputy director-generals. But the government regards him as too close to Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who resigned as bank governor to become prime minister in 1993 and who promoted Mr Fazio above Mr Dini. The government wants to introduce new blood to the bank. Its favoured candidate has been Mr Rainer Masera, a former head of its research department, liberal economist and currently in charge of Imi, the state-controlled financial group. A compromise which would give the vacant job to Mr Vincenzo Desario, the junior deputy governor who is close to Mr Fazio, has yet to find support. But the weaker the government becomes, the more Mr Fazio is likely to get his way. The debate over the choice of a replacement reflects not on the quality of the respective candidates but rather on whom each person is seen to represent. Whatever the outcome, relations between the government and the bank risk being damaged. Good links between the two have become all the more important as the economy begins to recover from recession and as the government crisis produces speculative pressure on the lira that could force up interest rates.</p>

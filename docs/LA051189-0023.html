			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRONG TARGET IN THORP VS. BEAM?  </P> <P> The question is not whether pregnant women should drink, but whether anyone  should drink. Where is the person who has not suffered, to some degree, the  damaging consequences of alcohol?  </P> <P> I am astounded by the wimpy tone taken by the director of the Alcohol and Drug  Abuse Institute at the University of Washington. Speaking of the lawsuit  against the James B. Beam Distillery, he says, "But to cheer for either side is  a mistake because everyone is a loser."  </P> <P> I mean, let's smarten up here. We must cheer for the side against legal drug  pushers such as the Beam Distillery, who not only should be held accountable,  but should be put out of business.  </P> <P> M. POWER GIACOLETTI, Lake Forest  </P></p>

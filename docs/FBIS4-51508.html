			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the inauguration of the cabinet of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata, YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted an emergency  opinion poll on 28 and 29 April on the support rate for the Hata  cabinet. The telephone poll conducted surveyed 1,500 eligible  voters across the nation. According to the survey results, 56.8  percent of the respondents supported the Hata cabinet while 25  percent did not support it. This indicated that the Hata  cabinet is enjoying high public support despite the view at the  Diet that "the administration is treading on thin ice."  However, about 60 percent of those surveyed denounced the  ruling coalition's formation of the new parliamentary group  without the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] as  "coercive," and said the SDPJ's secession from the coalition  "was not favorable for the cabinet." In this way, the survey  also highlighted public criticism of the new cabinet.    The top four scores recorded in past YOMIURI SHIMBUN polls  on  cabinet supporting rates soon after cabinet inauguration were:  71.9 percent for the Hosokawa cabinet; 60.5 percent for the  Tanaka cabinet (1972); 55.7 percent for the Miyazawa cabinet  (1991); and 51.5 percent for the Takeshita cabinet (1987).  Because those polls were conducted through interviews, it is  difficult to compare them exactly with the latest telephone  survey. However, it can be said that the support rate for the  Hata cabinet, from the viewpoint of survey figures, is the third  highest of the above-mentioned cabinets.    As for their reasons for supporting the Hata cabinet, 45  percent of the pollees said that the cabinet "can be expected to  do something new." While 24 percent of the pollees said they  "can trust the prime minister," 16 percent said "neither the  Liberal Democratic Party nor the SDPJ has joined" the Hata  cabinet. Moreover, only 7 percent of the respondents said they  support the cabinet because "it is stable." On the other hand,  32 percent of the respondents did not support the Hata cabinet  because "it is unstable." In stating their reasons for  disapproving of the cabinet, 22 percent said the cabinet "cannot  be expected to do anything" while 17 percent said they "cannot  trust the prime minister."    Asked about the term of the Hata cabinet, 35 percent of the  respondents said they want the cabinet to last "as long as  possible," 20 percent "two or three years," and 20 percent  "about one year." About 15 percent said they want the cabinet  to "resign as soon as possible."    There was a list of four emergency tasks facing the Hata  cabinet such as: "review of the tax system"; "economic  pump-priming measures"; "the issue of DPRK's (North Korea's)  suspected nuclear weapons development"; and "Japan-U.S.  relations." Asked to pick the top priority issue from the list,  64 percent picked "economic measures," 25 percent chose "review  of the tax system," 4 percent mentioned "the issue of North  Korea's nuclear weapons development," and 3 percent picked  "Japan-U.S. relations." Thus, the overwhelming number of  respondents wanted the cabinet to tackle domestic issues.    Regarding the way Shinseito and other parties formed the new  parliamentary group, which led to the SDPJ's secession from the  administration, 57 percent of the pollees were strongly  critical, saying "it was coercive." While 27 percent of the  pollees thought "it was necessary to form the new group," 6  percent felt "it was only natural."</p>

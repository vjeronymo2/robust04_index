For a full three years since the Gulf war, American media,  spearheaded by the CNN, have never had a better chance to  promote in such an aggressive manner the power of American  weaponry and such accompanying arrogance that can hardly be  attributed to a civilized country.    According to American media, the planes of Admiral Burda,  who  is in charge of the operation in Bosnia, revved up their engines  already on Friday evening because some shells exploded in  Sarajevo. It was later established, however, that there were  about fifty of them and that most of them were Moslem.    The American public was immediately informed from NATO's  southern command in Naples that a special group in charge of  picking potential Serb targets had specified several hundred of  them, from individual artillery pieces to warehouses of fuel and  munitions.    In the war of nerves which was launched by the U.S.  Administration and taken up with clockwork precision by the  American media, the information was released immediately that  the turning on of the engines of Admiral Burda was,  unfortunately, a false alarm. The action was nevertheless  welcome, the media emphasized, because it had enabled all  services and commands to be put into operation as in an actual  situation.    Admiral Burda has 146 planes at his disposal. In the  escalation of military combinations and war cries, he  immediately asked for an additional eight "super" planes,  cheered on by CNN and company, which would be able to strike by  day or by night, in rain or fog, from high or low altitudes.    Eight F-15s were immediately flown from bases in Great  Britain to airports in Italy.    CNN hurried to show until now unusual "secret" CIA shots  showing, as the reporter explained, the helpless appearance of  Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo, filmed with optical  instruments of U.S. planes. Everything has been filmed,  pinpointed, nothing can be hidden, in the daytime or at night,  and now all that is expected is the signal to begin.    One of the "commanders" of the CNN is already in the  Adriatic  on the aircraft carrier The Saratoga. Everything is in  readiness here, engines are roaring, missiles have been attached  under the wings of the planes, only Butrus Butrus-Ghali seems to  be hesitating still, and the Russians are ignored anyway.</p>

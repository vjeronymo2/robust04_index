[Juppe] Good evening.    [Fauvet-Mycia] [passage omitted] We start with Bosnia and  the  first question from Sylvie Pierre-Brossolette of L'EXPRESS.    [Pierre-Brossolette] Following the failure of the Geneva  talks, you are proposing a complete review of the whole Bosnian  issue. Is this a diplomatic way of saying that nothing more can  be done, or do you really hope to get anything out of your  current international contacts?    [Juppe] Whatever the temptation, we cannot say that nothing  more can be done. If I proposed a review of the issue, it is  because the time has come to ask some fundamental questions. We  have taken many initiatives since last April. France is behind  the adoption of the UN resolution on sanctions; we can see its  impact today. France also launched the idea of the security  zones, which was adopted but not implemented. We, that is  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and myself are behind the  plan which brought about the European Union initiative. All  this has failed, and we must have the courage to say so.    In Geneva in the last 48 hours, the various parties went  back  on the agreement in principle which they gave in November or  December. As far as the NATO summit initiative launched on 10  and 11 January is concerned, it included two concrete  operations: one to reopen the airport in Tuzla, the other to  organize the relief of the Canadian contingent in Srebrenica.  These operations are still bogged down in endless talks. This  cannot go on like that.    Should we leave? This is the question some are asking today,  particularly in the foreign countries which are providing  troops. What would be the consequences of a pullout? Have they  been clearly assessed? [They are] the humanitarian catastrophe  which would undoubtedly ensue, and the risk of a general  conflagration in the region. Those who believe that a pull-out  is unavoidable and who create the conditions for a pullout  should weigh their responsibility in such a contingency. If a  pull-out of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is ruled out, how  can we get out of the diplomatic deadlock in which we are  trapped today? Perhaps all the great powers, and not only the  12 countries of the European Union, should get more deeply  involved in telling the three warring factions: That's enough  now.    [Questioner] Is that what you are now asking your partners  to do?    [Juppe] This is what I am assessing; this is what I said  yesterday. With all our partners, I am now considering, if you  allow me to say so, how we could bounce back. As you know, the  American secretary of state will be in Paris over the weekend; I  will meet him on Monday, I believe. I have contacts with my  German and British colleagues too. In short, we must look for a  way out of the deadlock in which the warring parties have  trapped themselves. Things must be clearly said. At the start  of the conflict, it was rightly said that the Serbs were the  aggressors. They were the aggressors. The Croats too have a  great deal to feel guilty about. However, today, all observers  monitoring developments on the ground, and that includes the  UNPROFOR staff which drafted telling reports, agree that the  Bosnian army, the army of the Bosnian Muslims, has more  equipment and more men and now considers that it can achieve its  goals through war and not through negotiations. This must be  said in order to apportion responsibilities to the various  parties and to move forward.    [Questioner] At a time when others are on the verge of  giving  up, do you believe that France will be able to remain the only  one to say that something must be done?    [Juppe] We cannot grow tired and as far as I am concerned,  whatever the difficulties, I shall not grow tired. You are  right to point out that when one considers what is happening on  the international stage, France is probably the country that has  done the most. First, thanks to its soldiers on the ground;  they are playing a wonderful role. Then, through the financing,  with its partners within the European Union, of the largest  share of the humanitarian aid. And finally, through the  multiplicity of its diplomatic initiatives, which I recalled  earlier.    [Questioner] Are you already considering that you might have  to explain that soldiers in the area might have to pull out next  spring or next winter?    [Juppe] Earlier in this program I tried to outline the  consequences of such a pullout, so before rushing into this easy  solution which might be welcomed by some of our partners, we  must think carefully and, I repeat, weigh all the consequences  and look for other solutions. The other solution, which I  believe is the only one which would prevent a disaster today, is  a diplomatic initiative by all those who can influence the three  warring factions. You can see today that some of these factions  feel encouraged by the absence of our great international  partners, encouraged to continue fighting. It must be put to  them clearly that there is no solution in this direction.    [Questioner] How do you explain the fact that General Cot  has been recalled by the United Nations? Valery Giscard  d'Estaing told the [National Assembly] Foreign Affairs Select  Committee yesterday that General de Gaulle would have never  accepted such a decision. How do you react to these remarks?    [Juppe] I am a Gaullist, but I do not believe I am entitled  to speak on behalf of General de Gaulle.    [Questioner] What about the recall of Gen. Cot? Do you  understand this?    [Juppe] Listen, we were told that this was taking place in  the framework of a rotation within the UN system. Having said  that, I will remind you of something obvious, something simple  which is not a criticism of anyone, namely, the supreme  authority commanding Gen. Cot in the framework of UNPROFOR is  the UN secretary general.    [Questioner] Don't you believe that, at times, there are  double standards and that the UN is sometimes harder on some  French or European generals than it is on American generals, in  Somalia for instance?    [Juppe] Perhaps.    [Questioner] Therefore we cannot understand the reactions  and  the arguments provoked by this recall.    [Juppe] I did not condemn any reaction, I simply refuse to  take part in any argument. Having said that, I will naturally  mention this to the UN secretary general when we next meet.  There is probably a problem. I believe this is the fourth  general to have been thus expended, if I may use this word, by  the UN in the former Yugoslavia. This means that this system  must contain a certain number of -- how can I put it? -- a  certain number of dysfunctions.    [Questioner] Do you intend to visit the area and are these  visits to the area useful?    [Juppe] You know I am not very keen on media diplomacy, and  in some of these visits, promotion through the media is often at  the forefront. I might go there if it is useful, if it enables  me to understand better, to have a constructive and positive  meeting with the authorities in Sarajevo.    [Questioner] Is this planned; have you got a date?    [Juppe] I am considering the issue, but I have not decided  on  a date yet.    [Fauvet-Mycia] Mr. Juppe, we have three short questions  concerning foreign affairs. First, Algeria: Are you optimistic  following the recent goodwill gestures made by the Algerian  Government in favor of the Islamists? Do you expect more  gestures?    [Juppe] I am not optimistic as far as Algeria is concerned  and I note that the situation is still deteriorating; there is,  in particular, growing violence. I hear some people asking:  What is France doing? I would like to point out that we do not  hold the solution to all problems. First of all the Algerians  themselves have to solve this conflict, which is looking more  and more like a civil war.    What we did first was to take the necessary security  measures  to prevent too many threats against our nationals.  Unfortunately, these measures are not fully effective. We also  encouraged the Algerian authorities to make some moves, since  conservatism, the status quo, brings failure. They made some  moves in the economic sphere. Unfortunately, the political  climate is such that this economic reform, which will probably  be included in the agreement which the Algerian Government  reaches with the IMF, will certainly be extremely difficult to  implement. The various ways for a meaningful dialogue must be  explored.    [Fauvet-Mycia] Let us go further east, to Saudi Arabia. You  have just been there with Edouard Balladur. It was an obvious  failure, you did not sign any contracts. What happened?  Everyone is puzzled. Why go there if you do not bring back  anything? What was the mistake? Was it because the Quai  d'Orsay was not involved in the negotiations?    [Juppe] We do not have such ambition. I have visited Saudi  Arabia before, several ministers have visited it. It is  absolutely necessary to have a close relationship with this  country, which plays an important political and economic role.  The prime minister rightly visited this country and, in  particular, you will see that three large contracts will  materialize in the coming days.    [Fauvet-Mycia] Concerning which areas?    [Juppe] You will know when they are announced. I am always  very prudent where contracts are concerned. You must have two  partners agreeing before you can announce anything.    [Fauvet-Mycia] With regard to Franco-Chinese relations,  Michel Rocard spoke of disgrace for France. I assume you will  tell me that this is somehow disproportionate, but were all the  necessary steps taken? Was the Quai d'Orsay left on the  sidelines in this instance, too?    [Juppe] Listen, one cannot just say anything -- I am  naturally referring to Mr. Rocard. One of my very first goals  when I became foreign minister was to re-establish normal  relations with China. Every step came from our side. I have the  list of the meetings which I chaired myself, or which the prime  minister chaired at my request, in order to achieve this result.  This is a diplomatic success which I am claiming as one of the  achievements of French diplomacy and, once more, Mr. Rocard --  who has no clear idea whatsoever on foreign policy -- has lost  the opportunity to remain silent.    He may be obsessed with arms sales to Taiwan, that is his  problem, but to choose between Taiwan and a country numbering  1.3 billion people, a country which is one of the world's  leading powers, a country achieving an annual growth rate of  13.5 percent, to choose as he does is either shortsighted or  evidence of a political negativism -- which by the way is Mr.  Rocard's trademark. You will note that he has become Mr. Nyet --  he says no to everything; this is a kind of stubborness in the  opposition which, it seems, is a sign of the future candidacy in  the presidentioal elections. This has nothing to do with  diplomacy.    I repeat that I am deeply satisfied with what has been  achieved, and the Quai d'Orsay played its full role in this, as  might have been expected.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- A secretary to President  Kim Yong-sam for political affairs, Yun Won-chung, left for  London and Washington Monday to study the electoral systems of  the two advanced democracies in support of Kim's election reform  program.    Yun, an official at the office of the senior presidential  secretary for political affairs, will tour the two countries for  two weeks collecting data and meeting with officials about their  electoral systems, especially their election management systems,  before returning home around May 29.    The amendments to Korea's election laws recently passed by  the National Assembly have provided the legal grounds for clean  and inexpensive polls, a Chongwadae [presidential offices]  official said. The question now is how to implement the new laws  to achieve clean and cheap elections, he added. "Secretary Yun  will visit the United Kingdom and the United States to research  their election management systems and collect data which may  help implement the new laws," he said.</p>

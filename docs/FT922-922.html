			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: BSN to sell two Italian mineral water brands BSN, the French foods group which sided with Nestle of Switzerland in the battle for Perrier, is selling two Italian mineral water brands formerly owned jointly with the Agnelli family's IFIL holding company. Although worth only around L25bn (Dollars 21m), the deal represents a further upheaval in the European mineral water business in the wake of the Perrier takeover. Following that transaction, the European Commission expressed concern about the shares of the French mineral water market held by Nestle and BSN. The sale of BSN's Sangemini and Fabia brands is not believed to be linked with the Perrier deal. Rather, BSN has now decided to concentrate on Ferrarelle and Boario, its two biggest-selling marques in Italy. Ferrarelle and Boario account for around 80 per cent of the L500bn turnover of BSN's Italian mineral water activities, against L100bn for the two marques being sold. Sangemini and Favia are being acquired by a joint venture between Terme Demaniali di Acqui, a quoted holding company, and Mr Massimo Violati, whose family controlled Sangemini until 1987.</p>

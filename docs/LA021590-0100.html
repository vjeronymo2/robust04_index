			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS WATER SAVINGS ORDINANCE  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a water conservation  ordinance that would reduce water consumption during a drought and change water  rates to reward low-volume users and penalize high-volume users.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, the monthly bill for the typical residential customer's  2,000 cubic feet of water would go up to $45.80, an increase of 72 cents.  </P> <P> But customers who, for example, use 1,000 cubic feet would see their bills  reduced by $2.10 to $24.50, Public Service Director W.E. Cameron said.  </P> <P> In times of drought, the council would be empowered to activate a five-step  plan that would call for customers to reduce their water use by up to 25%. Any  excess use would be penalized by a surcharge of twice the basic water rate.  </P> <P> The council excluded treated water from the ordinance after Forest Lawn  Memorial Park officials requested an exemption last week. Glendale is building  a pipeline from its sewage treatment plant to the cemetery, which will purchase  treated water.  </P></p>

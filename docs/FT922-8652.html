			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Exchange tightens ruleson directors' share deals TIGHTER RULES on share dealings by directors of listed companies, and on dealings by their families and associates, were issued yesterday by the London Stock Exchange after the share-rigging scandal surrounding the late Robert Maxwell. Had they been in force before, the rules would have prevented Maxwell and Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, from agreeing an options deal which has subsequently been the subject of intense scrutiny by various regulatory bodies. The deal gave Goldman the right to sell 15.6m shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) to Maxwell at a pre-agreed price. The exchange did not name Maxwell or MCC when issuing the rules. However, the changes are believed to have been provoked entirely by revelations about dealings in MCC shares and options on MCC shares between the summer of 1990 and Maxwell's death last autumn. The rules, to take effect on June 1, will force directors to disclose share dealings by people, companies or other entities to which they are connected. Previously only dealings by directors and their immediate families needed to be disclosed. The definition of 'connected' parties includes trusts in which directors or their families have an interest. It also extends to associated companies - those in which directors have at least a 20 per cent stake. The Stock Exchange has taken the definition of 'connected' from section 346 of the 1985 Companies Act. This embraces, for instance, dealings by a director's illegitimate children, though not by any children who are over 18. In addition, dealings in options on a company's shares are to be brought within the disclosure requirements for the first time. The new rules are linked to the exchange's model code of dealings by directors, which forbids directors to deal in the period before a results announcement. Such a rule could have prevented Maxwell from selling a controversial 'put' option over MCC shares to Goldman Sachs in August 1990, during the 'closed' period ahead of a results announcement. The option, giving Goldman the right to sell MCC shares to Maxwell at a predetermined price in effect put a floor under the MCC share price during the autumn of 1990. The exchange's new rules will not have the force of law, but breaches will give the market authorities the power to suspend trading in a company's shares or delist it altogether.

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NETS' BRUNDY FIRST ROOKIE TO FAIL RANDOM DRUG TEST  </P> <P> Stanley Brundy, a rookie forward with the New Jersey Nets, was suspended for  the rest of the season Friday night after failing a drug test.  </P> <P> Brundy, who played at Crenshaw High and DePaul, is the first rookie to be  suspended since the NBA began random drug testing of first-year players during  training camp in 1988.  </P> <P> In a statement announcing the suspension, the NBA said that if Brundy follows  the league's treatment procedure, he could be eligible to play next season.  </P> <P> "We are very surprised and disappointed," said Harry Weltman, the Nets' senior  vice president and general manager. "We will do our best to support him and, of  course, we support the league's anti-drug policy and will abide by it."  </P> <P> Weltman said he knew nothing about the test other than that Brundy tested  positive.  </P> <P> The Nets, who were idle Friday night, play the Cleveland Cavaliers Saturday in  Richfield, Ohio.  </P> <P> Net Coach Bill Fitch said Brundy traveled to Ohio with the team but has  returned to New Jersey. He had no comment.  </P> <P> "This is a big shock to me," Net forward Roy Hinson said. "I didn't expect  anything like this to happen. He was on the plane with us and I saw him in the  lobby after we came in."  </P> <P> Brundy has played in 16 of the Nets' 34 games, averaging 2.3 points and 1.6  rebounds. He scored a season-high 12 points on six-for-six shooting against the  New York Knicks in New Jersey's fourth game of the season.  </P> <P> Three random regular-season tests of rookies were approved in November as an  amendment to the NBA's anti-drug agreement. In 1988, one test during training  camp was authorized for rookies.  </P> <P> The NBA said drug counselors will determine whether Brundy has complied with  after-care requirements. If so, he could play again in 1990-91.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAY AREA CREEPS TO WORK AT A BUMPER-TO-BUMPER PACE;  </P> <P> GALES, WILD WAVES, RAIN -- MISERY  </P> <P> Their misery compounded by soaking rain and bone-chilling winds, hundreds of  thousands of Bay Area commuters struggled to work aboard the remaining links of  the earthquake-ravaged transportation system today. Conditions across the area  were crowded and chaotic, but mass gridlock was avoided.  </P> <P> "We've got gale winds, heavy rains and heavy traffic -- your basic nightmare  conditions," said California Highway Patrol Officer John Lash. "Somebody up  there doesn't like us."  </P> <P> Bruce Selby, a spokesman for the Golden Gate Bridge District, said officials  there were "absolutely amazed that things are going so smoothly."  </P> <P> "People are turning to mass transit, he said. "Our buses and ferries are  running at double and triple the normal level."  </P> <P> But "smoothly" was still only relative. Neophyte riders of the Bay Area Rapid  Transit District subway were drenched while waiting for cars that carried them,  sardine-like, from the East Bay to San Francisco. An armada of ferryboats  braved squalls and rough seas to deliver their seasick passengers to San  Francisco piers. To the south near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake, Santa Cruz  County travelers made their way to work on Highway 17 thanks to a fleet of CHP  escorts.  </P> <P> In Washington, meanwhile, the White House announced that President Bush will  seek $2.5 billion in new federal aid for earthquake victims -- a figure well  below that sought by congressional Democrats who were working on a relief  package. Estimates of the actual cost of damages continued to mount, exceeding  $6.6 billion at last count.  </P> <P> The San Francisco coroner added two more victims to the list of confirmed dead,  bringing that tally to 61. Another 52 people were officially missing and  believed trapped in the yet-uncleared wreckage of the Nimitz Freeway in  Oakland. Officials in Santa Cruz also launched a search for a man believed to  have been trapped in a landslide on Sunday.  </P> <P> Bay Area workers, returning en masse to work for the first time since Tuesday's  6.9 temblor, were forced onto BART trains, ferries and roundabout freeways  because of the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay  Bridge. Authorities were also forced to close I-280 and San Francisco's  Embarcadero Freeway because of threatening cracks.  </P> <P> By 10:30 a.m., BART had carried 99,732 passengers, compared to an average of  69,638 on a normal weekday. Two passengers fainted after getting off trains at  the Embarcadero Station after crossing the bay.  </P> <P> "They were hyperventilating, I guess from being nervous in the tube," said  Debby Tudor, a Westinghouse Elevator technician dispatched to tend to the  station's escalators.  </P> <P> But traffic from the northern suburbs over the Golden Gate Bridge was fast and  smooth. And the morning commute on Highway 101 from the southern suburbs began  light -- but then the freeway flooded.  </P> <P> "Mother Nature is having a field day with us," commuter Joyce Bustinduy said.  </P> <P> At sea, it was even rougher. Hundreds of commuters -- many afraid of traveling  in the under-bay BART tube -- sought to make their way to work aboard ferries,  but found the boats crowded and the seas wild.  </P></p>

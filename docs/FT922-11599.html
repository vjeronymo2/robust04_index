			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Varied performance reflects investors' uncertainty about the economy ALTHOUGH US stock markets posted mixed results in the first quarter of this year, the big story was the billions of dollars in newly issued stock that flooded them. The rush of stock issues - both initial public offerings (IPOs) by companies making their debut or returning to the markets, and sales of new shares by already listed companies - boosted trading volume to high levels. On the New York Stock Exchange, daily volume averaged 216.5m shares, while on the more active Nasdaq over-the-counter market it averaged 221m shares. A record Dollars 30bn was raised via common stock issues and IPOs, compared with Dollars 9.5bn in the first quarter of 1991, as US companies rushed to take advantage of relatively firm stock prices and strong demand from individual and institutional investors for equities. The pace of new stock issues is unlikely to be maintained, primarily because the hesitant performance of stock prices in the latter part of the quarter has made the case for issuing new equity less persuasive. The best gains of the first quarter were recorded by secondary stocks, with the Nasdaq composite index rising 6.28 per cent to 602.07 as investors remained keen on biotechnology, computer technology and healthcare stocks in particular. Second best was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which advanced 2.1 per cent to 3235.47. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which is most representative of the US economy, however, showed a net loss for the three months of 3.2 per cent, ending the period at 403.69. This varied performance reflects investors' uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and corporate earnings. The Dow managed a modest gain, because cyclicals such as Bethlehem Steel, Caterpillar, General Electric and International Paper were popular early on as investors sought stocks that would benefit most from economic recovery. The quarter opened strongly, with the momentum from the December 20 interest rate cut carrying share prices to a series of new highs in the first six weeks. Although investors were buying stocks partly in expectation of a turnaround in the economy, the unattractive yields offered by alternative investments lured money into equities. The steady climb in stocks peaked in early March. From then on, prices oscillated as investors waited for corporate earnings and economic performance to catch up with share prices. Monetary policy remained on hold throughout the quarter, with the Federal Reserve seemingly content that enough had been done to ensure a steady, inflation-free recovery. Politics reared its ugly head in the form of the presidential primary season, however, and signs of early weakness in the Bush re-election campaign cast a cloud over sentiment. The prognosis for the second quarter is more of the same. Until corporate earnings display a marked improvement and economic data point to a sustainable recovery, analysts expect share prices to stay stuck in a holding pattern. In Canada, concern about the sluggish economy, the realisation that the pace of the recovery will lag several months behind the turnaround in the US, and a recent increase in interest rates, kept a lid on price rises. During the quarter the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index fell 10 points to 3,412.10. The most troubled sector was financials, with bank stocks hit by the problems of debt-burdened property giant Olympia &amp; York. The Mexican stock market, meanwhile, thrived once again, aided by a strong performance from bank stocks rising sharply in the wake of privatisations. The Bolsa index rose almost 30 per cent in local currency terms to 1,875.73. If Bush should lose - Page 13</p>

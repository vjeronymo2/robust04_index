During the first quarter of 1994, Panamanian exports rose by  4 percent in comparison with the same period of 1993. So far  this year, Panamanian exports have totaled $74.7 million, while  in 1993, exports for the same period amounted to $71.9 million.  (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 13 Apr 94 p 11A)    The Panamanian Foreign Trade Institute has reported that  Panama's annual export income from fishing operations last year  exceeded $85 million, which represents more than 18.2 percent  from the previous year's exports.

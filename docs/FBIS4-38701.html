			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "Paris Displays Gallantry, Russia </F> Does Not Resist"]    [Text] Paris -- The European Union [EU] has begun the  creation of a mechanism designed to consolidate the continent's  security. The new mechanism is aimed first and foremost at  resolving the problems of nationalism, interethnic conflicts,  and religious intolerance.    It is on a French initiative that work has begun on the  Stability Pact, directed toward the nine states of Central and  East Europe, including the three Baltic countries, which have  declared their intention to join the EU's ranks. A meeting of  delegations from 57 European countries was held in Paris as part  of this. The forum examined the problems of stability from the  standpoint of democracy and human rights, not in a military  context.    "We are ready to accept the new members into our ranks,"  Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European Affairs, noted,  "but we do not want to open the doors to new conflicts."    The focal points of possible conflict are connected with the  position of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltics and  the Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia. The EU  expects these countries to go through a "preparatory class"  prior to joining, where they will learn the rules of good  conduct.    Paris favors the earliest possible signing of an agreement  on  partnership and cooperation between the EU and Moscow (it seems  that this will happen as early as June) and is energetically  supporting Russia's admission to all the European institutions.    After some hesitation, Moscow supported the French  initiative. It believes that the Stability Pact should not exist  as a separate entity but should form an organic part of the CSCE  fabric. In Moscow's view, another major aspect of this pact is  the fact that the document is based on the principle of the  inviolability of borders. Furthermore, to all appearances it  will promote the protection of the rights of the Russians in the  Baltics.    The Paris conference has begun work on the pact which will  end with its signature in about a year. After the adoption of  the basic document by consensus at the present meeting, regional  talks will be held. The first talks will be on the rights of  minorities in the Baltics.    Andrey Kozyrev proposed the creation of a European  University  in one of the Baltic states, where instruction would be given in  the local language and in Russian.</p>

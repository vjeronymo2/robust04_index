			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Rea Brothers shares fall on bonds warning Shares in Rea Brothers, the private banking group, yesterday fell 13p to 62p after the company issued a profits warning, indicating substantial interim losses against the value of its Pounds 7m fixed interest securities portfolio. The company said that its core businesses had recorded profits 'in excess of Pounds 1m'. But given the sharp decline in the price of medium-term bonds, this would be reduced by up to Pounds 700,000 of unrealised losses from its bond portfolio. Kleinwort Benson, the house broker, has reduced its forecast for the year from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.5m, and interim profits of less than Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 802,000) are expected. Nevertheless, Rea maintains a strong balance sheet, with shareholders funds of Pounds 23m, and its banking, corporate finance and fund management businesses continue to show earnings growth.</p>

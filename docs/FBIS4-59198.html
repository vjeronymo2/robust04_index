			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan and the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) begin talks today on detailing the economic  agreement they signed on Jan. 7. The talks are expected to be  characterised by "requests for clarifications" before the two  sides draw the mechanisms for the implementation of the accord,  particularly that the PLO signed an economic agreement with  Israel in April after months of negotiations in Paris.    Officials said the talks would go deep into the practical  implementation of the Jan. 7 Jordan-PLO accord and that the  Kingdom's delegates would be seeking clarifications on the  implications for Jordan of the Paris accord.    Ahmad Quray', head of the economic department of the PLO,  and  five other Palestinian economists are expected to be in the PLO  delegation to the talks.    Describing the Jan 7 agreement as a "broad framework  agreement," PLO officials told the JORDAN TIMES in Jerusalem  that the two sides should now negotiate a detailed Jordanian-PLO  economic accord based on the previous broad framework. They  said amendments may be needed in the accord in light of the new  powers Palestinians have gained in the Paris economic talks with  Israelis.    "There are answers and details that we would like to have  from the Palestinian negotiators," said an official, adding that  only then "can we, in Jordan, play a positive role to serve the  Palestinian people on a scientific and acceptable basis that  also protects Jordanian and Palestinian interests."    This and other senior officials said Jordan needs to clarify  details of the PLO-Israel agreement and other economic  arrangements that the PLO had struck before the Kingdom draws up  a detailed accord with the PLO.    The quest for these clarifications carries in its folds many  of the fears that Jordanian officials have been trying to keep  hidden pending the arrival of Mr. Quray' in Jordan.    These fears began when the PLO signed the Oslo agreement  with  Israel without prior consultation with Jordan and have been  repeatedly underlined since that time as the PLO shied away from  committing itself to anything with Jordan before concluding its  negotiations with Israel.    Repeatedly since then, Jordanian officials have been asking  the PLO to coordinate its steps with the Kingdom to avoid  hurting the interests of Jordan but at the same time had tried  to extend support to the Palestinian negotiators so as not to  undermine their negotiations with Israel.    At one time, His Majesty King Husayn issued an ultimatum to  the PLO calling on it to coordinate an economic agreement with  Jordan by a set date or all coordination would be called off.    In response, the Palestinians showed up on the set deadline  date and reached the Jan. 7 agreement with Jordan, setting out a  general framework for economic cooperation that at the time was  seen as "a letter of intent" rather than a binding agreement.    When the details of the PLO-Israel economic agreement were  first announced, Jordan officially welcomed the agreement as  having achieved "symbols of sovereignty for the Palestinians."    Minister of Finance Sami Qummuh at the time told the JORDAN  TIMES that the PLO should be credited for making gains that  underline its independence and he rejected charges that the  PLO-Israel agreement contradicted the agreement reached with  Jordan.    However, other officials had expressed reservations about  the  agreement and questioned its ramifications on Jordan.    Mr. Quray', aware of the Jordanian fears, sought to dispel  them by making statements at the time denying that the agreement  annulled the Jordan-PLO economic agreement.    "It looks like the Palestinians kept us at bay with an  unbinding economic agreement until they went and strengthened  their hand with the Israel-PLO Paris agreement," economist Fahd  al-Fanik said.    "They feel that they have a stronger bargaining position  with  this Paris agreement," he said, adding that Jordan "now has the  choice of taking it or leaving it."    Another economist, who asked he not be named, said that the  PLO move to force Jordan's hand with the Paris agreement and  asking Jordan to agree to a "compatible" agreement with it "is  an attempt to force us into Benelux-type arrangements."    Benelux, a 1960 agreement creating economic integration  between Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg, is an idea that  was floated as an option for a similar arrangement between  Jordan, Palestinian territories and Israel.    "The Palestinian negotiator is trying to make the Jordanian  decisionmaker consider the idea of economic integration similar  to Benelux in terms of making the Jordan-PLO agreement  compatible with the Israel-PLO agreement," the economist said.    "It is very clear that PLO-Israel agreement should not be  used as a pressure card against Jordan," he said.    The Lower House of Parliament's Finance Committee,  apparently  in response to the fears created by the Paris agreement in  economic circles in Jordan, has requested copies of both the  Israel-PLO economic agreement and the Jordan-PLO agreement as  well as the Oslo and Cairo agreements.    'Ali Abu-al-Raghib, head of the Finance Committee, told the  JORDAN TIMES Monday that this request came to "hold the proper  discussions with the government and concerned officials and draw  a policy that will reflect constructively on the Jordanian and  the Palestinian people."    "There is fear that the Jordan-PLO agreement has become a  subsidiary agreement to the PLO-Israel agreement," Mr. Abu  al-Raghib said "when this appears to be the case, it can only  draw suspicion and depression in economic circles," he added.    Mr. Abu-al-Raghib agreed with Jordanian officials that  "proper elaboration of what happened in Paris is needed."  Otherwise, he added, "Jordan's mixed economy can only suffer  and this will reflect negatively on the people both Palestinian  and Jordanian."    "As representatives of the people we cannot sit back and  watch," he said, making an appeal that the interest of the  people be dealt with "the highest and utmost responsibility and  patriotism."    "Otherwise it will reflect negatively on both sides," he  said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Andronaki under the rubric "Island of </F> Crimea": "Leisure in the Crimea has Become Suspiciously Active"]    [Text] On Saturday [4 June] V. Nedrigaylo, Ukrainian first  deputy minister of internal affairs, unexpectedly made an  appearance on Crimean television to explain that the Crimean MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] has finally been disbanded,  transformed into a Main Directorate of Internal Affairs, and  placed under the jurisdiction of the department in Kiev. But  within an hour Vyacheslav Lebedev, the Crimean president's press  secretary, and and Valeriy Kuznetsov, the autonomous formation's  minister of internal affairs, appeared on television and stated  that nothing of the kind had happened and that Mr. Nedrigaylo's  speech was bogus and a piece of disinformation.    Meanwhile, Ukrainian television described how in Lvov the  leaders of the Ukrainian People's Self-Defense are busily  turning some of their thugs into "active leisure groups," which  will be sent to the Crimea. Since the Don cossacks have gone to  the peninsula as "tourists," they say, we have found our own way  of assembling forces to protect national interests.    Since not one of the Supreme Council's three decrees on the  suspension of the Crimean Supreme Council's decisions has been  fulfilled, on Wednesday the Ukrainian parliament intends to  discuss more effective measures to pressure the autonomous  formation's power structures.    Kiev cannot tear itself away from the idea of a unitary  state  that it proclaimed three years ago and cannot fully come to  terms with the experience provided by relations between Russia  and Tatarstan.    Of course, Ukraine is far removed from the popular image of  a  land of jaunty gopaks and fruit dumplings. But since achieving  statehood it has come to grief over what was not the greatest of  all stumbling blocks and cannot restore equilibrium, confirming  yet again the shortsightedness of the present politicians and  the weakness of the idea of nationalism as a state doctrine.  This also explains the Ukrainian parliament's indecisive  hesitation over one thing, namely, the dangerous choice of which  direction to take; either to push Kravchuk into introducing  direct presidential rule in the Crimea, or to declare a state of  emergency there and disband the local Supreme Council, or to  abolish the autonomous formation completely. Any of these  decisions will be a call to action for both the Lvov "active  leisure groups" and the Don cossacks. God knows what will  happen then.    Incidentally, there has been a considerable increase  recently  in the number of people at prayer in the Republic's Orthodox  churches....</p>

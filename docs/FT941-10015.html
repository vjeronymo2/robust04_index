			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: Marvellous Mukhamedov - Clement Crisp finds this dancer in excellent form at Sadler's Wells Cheers - and several more than three - for Irek Mukhamedov in his short season at Sadler's Wells: for his dancing (which is stunning), for his colleagues (well chosen, gifted, and on best form), and for his enterprise (which in these hard times might have seemed foolhardy). Like many Russian dancers, he knows that the public wants to see stars, not just in a formal opera house repertory, but showing off their gifts in more relaxed fashion, and simply showing off. Thus his first sorties in 1992/3 with a concert group, here and in Europe, reliant upon the drawing power of his name, of course, but encouraging new works and giving fresh opportunities to his colleagues in the Royal Ballet. Now he has brought a programme to Sadler's Wells for four nights, and its opening performance on Wednesday was excellently judged, and cheered to the echo. A second purpose to the evening was also evident: Mukhamedov's need for new roles, valid settings for gifts which are unrivalled today. MacMillan gave him two tremendous ballets, and Mukhamedov has claimed almost everything else he has danced here as his own, by right of genius. So he has inspired a new Othello from Kim Brandstrup, and this forms the first and most significant part of the programme. Brandstrup has used his favoured collaborators: Ian Dearden for music (synthesised, atmospheric); Craig Givens for design (a grand setting of massive pillars; long dresses for the women that swirl and move exquisitely; simple period costume for the men); Tina MacHugh for lighting (intensely responsive to the action). Brandstrup's choreography for the early scenes is like a commentary on the narrative. It is characteristically clear, restrained, and slightly too uniform in tone. We know what is happening, but the charting of events is more illustrative than illuminating. It is when jealousy takes hold, when Brandstrup and Mukhamedov show us Othello's torment, that the dance claims its rightful identity as a language and not as accompaniment to some existing action. Once exposition is done - Brandstrup might edit with advantage - the tragedy takes its headlong course on dance terms. Brandstrup's Arc Dance company provide a touching Desdemona (Leesa Phillips) and an insinuating Iago (Daniel Belton), but the work is Mukhamedov's and his Moor is a tremendous study of anguish. For the earliest moments there is an innocence to his reading which is very sympathetic; as the mood darkens, so does Mukhamedov's playing, and he brings off the killing of Desdemona and Othello's remorse with a tense, heart-tearing power. The portrait is harrowing, true. Its setting is handsome. The rest of the evening might be considered as Beecham-esque lollipops, but these were of the best quality, and rather less familiar than is usual. Mukhamedov and Miyako Yoshida nipped through the Balanchine Tarantella in happy fashion, and then Leesa Phillips and Paul Liburd performed Darshan Singh Bhuller's sinuous erotic raga Interlock, first seen with London Contemporary Dance, with bodies entwined, bodies seeming one body. Some entwining also came in two Argentine Tangos, by Juan Carlos Copes, danced with a nice and mocking wit by Maria Mukhamedova (whom we remember as a character soloist with the Bolshoi) and her husband. Very welcome, too, a new duet by Michael Corder for Lesley Collier and Paul Chalmer. Piano music by Poulenc; Corder's musical sensibility and stylish way with steps; Lesley Collier at her most elegant, and Chalmer a ideal partner - these made for a dance lyric whose discretion did not disguise its emotional force. Collier's dancing is now all virtues: watching her we see grace of means, purity of manner, the academic language beautifully nuanced. She is our most rewarding ballerina. Maria Mukhamedova also appeared in a pretty solo from the Russian repertory: Kasyan Goleizovsky's Russian dance. A Tchaikovsky melody, Mukhamedova in long dress and kokoshnik head-dress, with the beguiling skill, that only Bolshoi dancers possess, to show the charm of the piece. And as the statutory closing fireworks, Mukhamedov and Yoshida in Diana and Actaeon. It is the pas de deux with which Mukhamedov first came to fame. He brings to it now a grandeur of scale - the Wells stage is far, far too small for him - and a bravura which are the stuff of legend. He also brings to it distinguished schooling: the tricks are never cheap, the technique is superbly sure. Yoshida darts and spins with uncanny ease: together the couple make roaring good sense of it. The audience, very properly, roars for more. The Mukhamedov season continues at Sadler's Wells until February 12. Sponsorship by Daniel Katz and the Friends of Sadler's Wells.</p>

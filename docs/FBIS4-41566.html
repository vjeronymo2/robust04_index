			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- Lithuania's national  currency the litas became quite strong during the year that  passed since its introduction, and such stability must be  preserved, say the present and previous leaders of the  Lithuanian central bank.    The litas was introduced June 25, 1993 when the central bank  was headed by Romualdas Visokavicius. He told reporters Friday  that the introduction of Lithuanian national currency was  praised by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  In Visokavicius' view, the Currency Board, which was set up  after the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar, will not survive  long.    Meanwhile, the bank's current head, Kazys Ratkevicius,  maintains that the Currency Board, whose task is to preserve a  stabile litas- dollar rate, is very useful to the country's  monetary policy. But both Ratkevicius and Visokavicius noted  that tying the litas to Western hard currency is not enough for  the economy to start recovering. Lithuania's industry and gross  domestic product must be aimed at Western standards, as well,  Visokavicius said.    In Ratkevicius' view, an important factor helping to  preserve  a stabile litas are the central bank's receipts in hard  currency. The chief banker said the bank purchased around 60  million U.S. dollars over the past three months.    Ratkevicius also informed reporters that 500 and 1,000 lit  bills have already been printed, but there is no need to release  them into circulation yet.</p>

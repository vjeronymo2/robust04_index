			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAZERS FACE COMETS IN RETURN TO FORUM  </P> <P> Having ended a three-game trip Wednesday by losing to the Kansas City Comets,  the Lazers hope to get back on track tonight at 8 at the Forum against those  same Comets.  </P> <P> Kansas City, which swept the Lazers out of the opening round of last season's  playoffs, has won three of five against the Lazers this season, and Wednesday's  6-3 victory moved the Comets a half-game ahead of the Lazers in the Major  Indoor Soccer League standings.  </P> <P> About the only bright spot for the Lazers, who have lost five of their last six  games, has been the play of Hector Marinaro, the league's top goal-scorer with  42.  </P> <P> The Lazers (18-21) have nine games remaining, including two against the Comets  (17-19).  </P></p>

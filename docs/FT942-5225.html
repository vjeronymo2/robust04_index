			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: US-South Africa link A new airline, USAfrica Airways, last week inaugurated a link between North America and southern Africa, writes Bernard Simon. The airline will initially offer twice-weekly flights between Washington DC's Dulles Airport and Johannesburg, with a refuelling stop in the Cape Verde Islands. It aims to expand later to other US cities, as well as countries such as Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. The only other direct air service between North America and South Africa at present is operated by South African Airways, with flights from New York and Miami. Many travellers still fly via Europe.</p>

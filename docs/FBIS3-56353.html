			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 14, BNS -- Estonian, Latvian and  Lithuanian delegations to the Council of Europe [CE] decided in  Vilnius Friday [14 January] that Russia must not be admitted to  the organization until its troops are withdrawn from the  territory of Latvia and Estonia.    The three delegations also discussed other conditions of  Russia's membership in the CE, the head of the Lithuanian  delegation, Algirdas Gricius, said at a press conference Friday.  Russia has already fulfilled part of the demands -- it has a new  Constitution and a new parliament, he said.    But, Lithuania and Estonia, as members of the council, and  Latvia, which enjoys special guest membership, will insist that  Russia solve national and ethnic problems on its territory. The  Baltics also want Russia to assess the Soviet aggression upon  the three states in 1940. Russia must also promise not to  interfere with the internal affairs of other countries and "must  become a normal state," said Tunne Kelam, member of the Estonian  delegation.    In Vilnius, the three delegations coordinated their  positions  for the upcoming session of the CE General Assembly. The session  will start in Strasbourg Jan. 24 and will reportedly focus on  possibilities of expanding Europe politically. The three Baltic  states agreed to support the idea of including the Caucasian  region in the political map of Europe.    Lithuanians and Estonians decided to circulate a joint  statement on the recent NATO summit in Brussels and a joint  resolution of the Baltic Assembly on Russian army presence in  Estonia and Latvia.    Roland Blezurs, secretary of the Latvian delegation, said  this week's incident with the Russian military in his country  revealed the kind of pressure that may be caused by the presence  of foreign troops.    The three delegations also discussed the economic and  political situation in the Baltic states.</p>

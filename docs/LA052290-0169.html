			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PANEL PASSES LIABILITY BILL  </P> <P> The Senate Commerce Committee approved today a uniform national system to deal  with consumers injured by products, limiting punitive damages to cases of  "flagrant indifference" by the manufacturer.  </P> <P> In addition to a uniform system, the bill, approved 13 to 7 and sent to the  Senate for action, provides incentives for quick settlement of product  liability cases.  </P> <P> The bill was sponsored by two Democrats and two Republicans.  </P> <P> "American companies face 50 different state laws, plus liability costs that are  20 to 50 times higher than their foreign competitors," co-sponsor Jack Danforth  (R-Mo.) said. "And liability cases drag on for years, leaving too much of the  money to attorneys instead of to victims."  </P> <P> "It is time to put fairness and efficiency on the front burner," he said.  </P></p>

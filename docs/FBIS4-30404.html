			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] will hold an extraordinary session of the Central  Executive Committee in the morning of 24 June to make a final  coordination of intra-party opinion on whether the SDPJ should  return to the ruling coalition or not. The SDPJ believes that if  it decides to return to the ruling coalition as a result of a  top-level meeting between SDPJ Chairman Murayama and Prime  Minister Hata, the Hata cabinet would resign en masse. The  ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ have failed to reach an  agreement on how to reform the current tax system. The SDPJ aims  for an early agreement with the ruling coalition parties on  reforming the current tax system after holding the intra-party  debate again. Some SDPJ members are still showing strong  resistance to raising the consumption tax and it remains unclear  if the intra-party coordination of opinion on the issue will go  smoothly. If a situation is created wherein talks between the  SDPJ and the ruling coalition parties run into rough sailing,  centrists and leftists in the SDPJ, who are cautious about the  SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition, will certainly react  against the SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition. The SDPJ  leadership is likely to be hard-pressed to run the party.    How many members of the SDPJ will vote for or abstain from  the vote on a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet has  become a focal point as the talks between the ruling coalition  parties and the SDPJ have entered a final stage. Members of  "Taiyo" [Sun], a policy study group formed by leftists in the  SDPJ, have suggested that they would vote for the no-confidence  motion or abstain from the vote in a backlash to the SDPJ's move  to return to the ruling coalition.    Former SDPJ Secretary General Tsuruo Yamakuchi and Koken  Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet Affairs Committee, who are  known to be cautious about the SDPJ's return to the ruling  coalition, met with Chairman Murayama at the Diet in the  afternoon of 23 June to ask the latter not to make an easy  compromise with the ruling coalition parties. Mindful of the  moves within Sakigake [Harbinger] and the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party to back Murayama as the prime minister, they  told Murayama, "if you are backed as a candidate for prime  minister, you should run for the post."    SDPJ legislators Tadatoshi Akiba, Hideko Ito, and Seiichi  Kaneta have issued an emergency statement opposing the SDPJ's  unprincipled return to the ruling coalition" and handed Chairman  Murayama the statement. Ten SDPJ legislators including Yamakuchi  have signed the statement. There is a view within the SDPJ that  the emerging intra- party caution about the SDPJ's return to the  ruling coalition would heighten depending on the outcome of  talks between the ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ, and the  heightened caution would affect the adoption of the  no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet in the Diet    Meanwhile, rightists in the SDPJ are saying that since the  prime minister has expressed his willingness to make his cabinet  resign en masse on the premise that the SDPJ returns to the  ruling coalition, "there is no just cause to vote for the  no-confidence motion."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Alvarado from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast; passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate  [for the Arnulfist Party, PA], would be willing to decline her  candidacy in favor of a great alliance of all civilist parties  of the country. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber thus reiterated what  she proposed weeks ago in David when she called for a great  alliance against the Democratic Revolutionary Party.    [Moscoso de Gruber] "I don't think Panamanians want to  return to the past. We must therefore call for this great  alliance of all parties. Let's sit down and discuss what is  best for Panama, not what is best for personal or economic  interests."    Apparently the difficulty lies in the absence of identifying  a person to unify all these forces.    [Moscoso de Gruber] "Let's all sit down and look for this  person, just as we did in 1989.    [Alvarado] "Even if it is not you?    [Moscoso de Gruber] "Even if it is not me."    Moscoso de Gruber said it is time to leave behind the  arguments and political ambitions that have so harmed democracy.  If we must hold a new convention, we are willing to hold it,  added the leader.    [Moscoso de Gruber] "There are seven candidates for the  presidency of the Republic, and we think there should be only  two."    Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber made these statements during a  meeting of the parties that form the so-called Democratic  Alliance, alliance representatives commented later.    [Alfredo Arias of the PA; identified by caption] "I think  that when we talk about a great national alliance, it has to be  based on the alliance's majority party.    [Alvarado] "What do you think of a possible unification of  criteria?    [Roberto Aleman of the Liberal Party; identified by caption]  "The truth is that I do not know. Right now I think it would be  very difficult, but it could happen.    [Alvarado] "Would you support it?    [Aleman] "I don't know. I would have to propose it to the  party's national executive committee.    [Joaquin Franco of the Authentic Liberal Party; identified  by  caption] "I see no such possibility at this time. Mrs. Gruber  represents the Democratic Alliance. She made some statements  this morning, which you have already heard. We are still  awaiting responses to those statements."</p>

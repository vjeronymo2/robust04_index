			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rodica Palade with various political analysts, </F> under the rubric "Roundtable": "Reform, Counterreform, or the  Syndrome of Procrastination"; first five paragraphs are Palade's  introduction]    [Text] The Center for Political Studies and Comparative  Analysis (CSPAC) is a nongovernmental research institute which  deals with the analysis of social, economic, and political  problems of transition in postcommunist societies. In 1993 the  center launched a series of debates on these topics and held one  of the summer courses offered by the University of the Black  Sea, a course entitled "Crisis Management During the Transition  Process."    Recently the center compiled and presented to public opinion  the basic list of the significant problems for Romanian society  which have remained unresolved during the period of 1990-93.  Called residual problems, they constitute the object of a  research program initiated by CSPAC and carried out by a  multidisciplinary team made up of Dorel Sandor, Varujan  Vosganian, Ulm Spineanu, Ilie Serbanescu, Lucian Mihai, Victor  Ciorbea, Gabriel Ivan, Andrei Musetescu, Costea Munteanu,  Mariana Celac, Denisa Ionete, and Horia Murgu.    The study's objective consisted in the systematic analysis  of  the SYNDROME OF PROCRASTINATION. This term means above all the  ignoring of real needs, delays, half-measures, and failures  through which COUNTER-REFORM acts as a parasite on the national  effort to transform our society. The accumulation of these  problems constitutes a dominant characteristic of the transition  period in Romania.    Last week at GDS [Group for Social Dialogue] headquarters, a  discussion took place with representatives of the CSPAC. We have  selected several excerpts from that discussion. Among the  participants we will mention: Magda Carneci, Mariana Celac,  Andrei Cornea, Gabriel Andreescu, Mircea Diaconu, Ioan Popa,  Victor Babiuc, and representatives of CSPAC--Dorel Sandor,  Varujan Vosganian, Ilie Serbanescu, Ulm Spineanu, and Costea  Munteanu.    We have also included in these pages part of the list of  residual problems which CSPAC inventoried. We should mention  that the entire text appeared in this year's 5 October issue of  ROMANIA LIBERA and in this year's 8 October issue of TINERETUL  LIBER. [See box at end of article.]  <H6>  * * * </H6> <H3>  An Analysis Which Describes the Current Stage of the Reform  Process </H3>   [Dorel Sandor] Our project starts from the common-sense  observation that everyone wants reform in Romania, but, at the  same time, anyone can see that obstructions have accumulated  over the last four years; these obstructions are a result of  problems which have been either ignored for a long time, or  which, over the process of being resolved, have acquired a  handicap in relation to the demands of reality.    Recently, we compiled this list of problems, a list which  remains open-ended. We started from the following hypotheses:    1) The problems are ones of public interest;    2) They are tied to the process of transition imposing  conditions on the advance of Romanian society toward a  democratic society;    3) They are found in the sphere of action of state  institutions (the governing party and the political coalition  which supports it, and the legislative and executive branches  with the group of "technocrats of transition") which have  prerogatives and competencies, and therefore resources, and  which should take on the task of achieving institutionalized  reform.    The performance of the government is a problem for political  analysis everywhere, but for Romania, unfortunately, it is  easily marked by subjective, personalized, and somewhat  caricatured approaches. One of the objectives of this project is  to remove this analysis of government performance from under the  sphere of influence of petty passions, from under the incidence  of approaches characterized by petty ambition, and from under  the perspective of a deadline arising out of the circumstances  of the moment.    After four years, the quantitative dimension of these  problems (the list contains 103 points, but it remains  open-ended) has already reached a critical threshold, which  necessitates a special approach. Many of these problems together  form structures of procrastination, structures of bundles of  residual problems which already tend to dominate the complex  process of transition. Procrastination, the accumulation of or  the blocking of the resolution of problems of this kind, has  appeared during the past year, after the September 1992  elections, to be an obvious characteristic of the government.    Therefore, our analysis assumes these three characteristics:  the quantitative dimension, the structural dimension, and  the characteristic of the transitional processes at the level of  the macroeconomic and macropolitical decisionmaking process.    Another reason/motive which we considered made this analysis  necessary is the fact that, in our estimation, the coming year,  1994, will be a year when we reach a crossroads: The residual  problems can engender a crisis of procrastination capable of  provoking instability and social convulsions (I believe that the  latter alternative has no more than a 15-percent chance of  coming about, but that percentage is already a troublesome one).  Or, on the contrary, these problems can become a kind of  normality of Romanian reality; they can impose a  long-term--10-15 years--pace on the course of transition in  Romania by becoming a political practice which could legitimize  institutions and a political style of this type. Because of  this, Romanian society will become marginalized in the overall  regional competition of transition.    We do not wish to call for the government's resignation; our  objective is to track down what the resources are which Romania  is wasting by maintaining these problems in a residual state.  And then we need to find out who is paying the price of these  examples of procrastination, and whether the current mechanisms  of the state structure and of the opposition's alternative  structures are in a position to tackle the problems in a  pragmatic and positive way, and what the alternative solutions  would actually be.    I would like to say a little bit about the list of problems  itself, which, I repeat, remains open-ended: It contains several  layers, several fields of facts. A first layer refers to the  (relative) tearing away from the system of real socialism with a  centralized economy, a tearing away which came about in our  country through convulsive events. Even the confusion, the fact  that very important areas connected to December 1989 are still  enigmatic, shows the way in which Romania entered into the  process of transition. A second layer of problems refers to the  way in which what is called postrevolutionary institutional  construction took place: the state institutions, the machinery  of decisionmaking, the machinery which creates the institutional  balances in Romania.    After that, we are interested in several fields connected  with local government and urban planning, and then the situation  of the communities and of the human factor in the various  aspects of the process of transition--from tensions between  ethnic groups to tensions between religious groups, and up to  the reactions of the citizens to the new challenges of  transition. An important area refers to social protection, not  just as a protection vis-a-vis economic problems proper, but  even more as the balance between change and the costs of change  experienced by the populace. It seemed to us that the problems  which are appearing in the fields of health and education, in  the cultural milieu, and in the field of training are  symptomatic.    We are also very much interested in the structural rift in  the framework of the Romanian economy, where privatization and  decentralization represent two major and mutually very  intertwined processes. It is in the area of economic reform that  the most important rifts have been engendered, but also that the  most significant obstacles have appeared. Also, in closing, we  proposed to link together several of the topics of international  interest with a direct impact domestically, topics connected  with foreign aid; with relations with international economic  institutions (the IMF, and so forth); and relations with  Bessarabia, with Russia, and with Eastern Europe--all of these  things with a view to an opening toward the international  economic environment.  <H5>  A (Desired?) Tool in the Hands of the Political Element </H5>   [Ilie Serbanescu] The finalization of this synthesis holds a  completely special importance, because it brings to our  attention, in a concentrated form, everything that has been  started--as far as reform is concerned--and not finished. Out of  these 103 points, 80 percent represent, in fact, things which  have not even been started. If we take an inventory of these  problems, we see that, out of everything that should have been  done, some things never were in the plans of anyone with the  power to make decisions; they are at most in the mind of those  people with common sense.    The team that drew up this synthesis did nothing more than  give an expression to common sense. In fact, it is not an  analysis, it is a finding, an instrument which is available to  the political element. I do not know if it also suits the  political element. But if the political element (particularly  the parliament and the executive) would happen to set to work,  that element would have something to do.    [Andrei Cornea] I would like to know if these points of  procrastination can be reduced to a sufficiently small number of  fundamental points from which the others would follow,  especially since I believe that the procrastination is  self-reproducing. Therefore, the first question would be to what  extent these problems can be condensed and how a certain system  can be devised which would say something about our society.    In the second place, it would be interesting to know what  the  explanation for the procrastination would be. Are we witnessing  a lack of political will--that is to say, an incapacity to  remove the points of procrastination--or are we in fact  witnessing a political will pulling in the opposite  direction--that is, a will to procrastinate? This question  should be posed, even if it is not always a matter of either/or  but can sometimes be both.    Finally, there would also be the matter of the consequences:  To what extent can interventions from certain points be  productive and create once again snowballing effects in other  fields?    [Dorel Sandor] Costea Munteanu will answer your first  question. Regarding the causes of the procrastination, we have  established 15 levels of analysis. Among these I would call to  mind the institutional obstacles, the critical points, and the  stage which each problem is in, the interest groups favored by  the procrastination, the costs, the resources wasted due to the  procrastination, and a whole series of errors or failures which  have obstructed or favored a certain hijacking of the process of  change. We can also make it obvious exactly what is the  mechanism or the institution which is being aimed at or is the  most active in obstructing some matters, elements of management,  of resources.    As for the consequences, I think that the following is one  of  the chief reasons why we did the analysis: to see whether the  costs of reform in Romania have not somehow exceeded the  benefits of reform, and whether these costs could not--as in  other Eastern European countries--reorient the overall national  interest toward transition, to influence it, or to lead it in a  totally unexpected direction.    [Ulm Spineanu] In putting this study together, we did not  propose to analyze any particular program of governance. We  started from the effects and in that way saw that some problems  had not been tackled at all. On the other hand, these problems  tend at a certain point--through circumstances which are very  hard to appraise in the way they work together in the social  spectrum--to have both institutional influence and influence in  the legislative process, given the reform process itself as  lived from day to day.    As they are posed there, these problems represent clear  points which can create elements of a great range in the fields  with which they can be correlated. The option of boiling these  problems down in some way to a few essential ones--which would  mean that we would, however, lose precisely the image and  definition of each consequence of the various problems--would  mean that we would make the mistake which everyone who has put  forward ideas of governance has made: They have proposed  programs as such, programs which do not factor in these  consequences, which, as we can see, are now becoming factors  stifling people's enthusiasm for reform.    On the other hand, if up to around six months ago people  were  working with half-measures, now we are in a system of  quarter-measures. We can observe completely undefined measures  everywhere, including in political discourse, not to mention in  economic or social discourse. Everything that is being done  appears as if it were seen through a smoke screen: Behind the  smoke screen are those who are proffering the measures, while in  front of it are those who are at the receiving end of those  measures, but who cannot understand them or explain them. And  through this smoke screen the germs of social instabilities are  already starting to appear. It is even within the realm of  possibility that we will get to the point where certain claims  are forcefully imposed, if we take account of the government  desire to preserve itself.  <H5>  Transition in Romania Up To Now--a Failed Process </H5>   [Costea Munteanu] In the economic area, we have identified a  total of 39 residual problems--put another way, of unresolved  aspects in the process of transition. In the final analysis,  they can be considered as forms of manifestation of two  fundamental structural distortions of the Romanian economy:  the first is the imbalance between consumption and  resources (the synthetic form of expressing the latter is  the fact that imports for the daily consumption by the economy  and by the population surpass the resources which can be  procured through exports), and the second distortion is  the vicious circle between domestic inflation and foreign  depreciation.    These two fundamental structural distortions are, in origin,  of different kinds: the imbalance between consumption and  resources is an inherited structural distortion; the deficiency  of the post-Decembrist policy of reform is that it has not even  attacked this problem. On the other hand, the vicious circle  between domestic inflation and foreign depreciation is a product  exclusively of policy after December, a policy of half-measures  which is called pathological gradualism.    As we know, there are two ways of approaching reform: shock  therapy, in which the authorities take the measures completely  and implement them all at once in order to carry out reform, or  gradualism--in other words, they divide the implementation of  the particular measure into successive phases. Pathological  gradualism is the one which loses the needed sequence along the  way and ends up where it started from. In the case of the  applying of normal gradualism, adverse reactions appear in the  environment in which it is operating, until complementary  measures are applied.    When these adverse reactions appear, instead of considering  them a signal that the transformations should be speeded up, our  own governmental teams have done the very opposite: They have  accentuated administrative intervention. Practically, in the  final analysis, this has in fact meant that there is an  orientation which is counter to reform, because the result has  been something other than the one they had counted on. The field  of price liberalization, and especially of the mechanisms of  formation, is illustrative in this regard.    I am trying to answer Mr. Cornea regarding the causes of  these instances of procrastination--whether they are in the  sphere of the lack of political will, or whether they spring  from incompetence. My feeling (from the experience which I had  when I spent a short period of time in the government) is that  we are dealing with a combination of the two. For example, in  the area of prices one can consider that there were also  premeditated elements which had the effect of ensuring that not  even up to the present time, after the four successive phases of  liberalization, has the mechanism of formation been completely  liberalized. In this case we are dealing with premeditation but  also with incompetence. And when I refer to incompetence, I  refer also to the lack of courage to apply a measure which  introduces effects of shock into the economic and social system.    If the people in our government have sinned in any way, it  is  through fear that they have sinned; and if they can be  characterized in any way, again it is by their fear. The  reformist type of person must, in my opinion, be the decisive  type. But here the dilemma appears between maintaining your  position high official and not making allowances for this  personal career objective, regardless of what happens with your  position.    Due to this pathological gradualism, the transition in  Romania up to now is a failed process; it has involved high  social and economic costs, while the results do not justify  these costs.  <H3>  From the Government's Standpoint, the Reform Process Is a  Success </H3>   [Valeria Pascariu] We see a list of problems which we  consider failures of the present government. But what categories  of interests does the government express? Because the essence of  a government always lies in the protection of a category of  interests. It seems to me that this category of interests  protected by the present government is the category of interests  of part of the state industry--that is, the industry which  formerly represented the ideological obsession of the communist  regimes: the petrochemical industry, the iron and steel  industry, and so forth. Faced with the choice between  unemployment and inflation, the populace has chosen the  alternative of inflation and has rejected that of unemployment;  through this choice, it has given its stamp of approval to this  variant.    If we look at things from the viewpoint of the government  (which deliberately planned not to carry out reform and planned  to protect the interests of this industry), we see that the  government is, in fact, a success. All the other things are  concessions or secondary problems; privatization is clearly a  secondary objective. When the government reaches the point where  it may run into a crisis in ensuring foreign financial resources  for this industry, due to its failure to sign the stand-by  accord with the IMF, then it will begin to make concessions on  the plane of reform.    [Dorel Sandor] There are five reasons why we chose a problem  here: The first reason is so that some of these problems might  be tackled in a program of governance or in a political position  of a programmatic nature (we did not refer solely to the  Vacaroiu government, but to all of the governments which have  entered into the process of transition during the past three  years).    The second reason is represented by certain political  relations with alternative political structures (because however  much it might be based on a program, governance is carried on in  a political context of balance).    The third reason consists of the social reactions, the  expectations of the populace, and the characteristic feature at  the level of current interests on the local level, on the macro  level, and on the intermediate level.    A fourth reason is represented by structural challenges,  such  as inflation, prices, unemployment, resources, and the relations  between consumption and production.    The fifth reason is represented by the exigencies of the  foreign factor, on which depend foreign financing, regional  equilibrium, national security in relation to spheres of  influence, and so forth. The fact that these problems are seen  as secondary by the present government is of less importance to  us; they are important to the public interest, for Romania now  and in the years to come.    [Varujan Vosganian] To return to Mr. A. Cornea's first  question: There really is a nucleus, but we cannot bring it into  the debate to the public at large, because that nucleus cannot  be perceived merely by means of the common sense that Ilie  Serbanescu was talking about. So, there is also a deeper level  of theoretical approach which does not appear in our analysis.  Here, however, we can see the first intermediate level--that is  to say, the centers of obstruction, the centers of disruption,  which owe their existence to procrastination.    We are trying to create an economic theory of transition, to  discover concepts, to apply the concepts, and to create some  general laws of transition. We have found pathological  gradualism, we have found the allocation of resources to the  necessities of transition, we have found the vicious circles of  transition, and so forth.    [Dorel Sandor] Certainly, if we will acquire knowledge about  these deep matters, it is not absolutely necessary that  political options be modified as such. But here I would connect  two planes: the evolution of political will during transition  and the evolution of deep, systematic knowledge about  transition. These are two planes which do not meet for the time  being, and this is also the difficulty which I see as obvious in  sending a particular message. I believe that one of the  linchpins of political demagogy is truly the lack of political  knowledge; nevertheless, I think that the chief moral support of  the lack of political will is not necessarily the lack of  knowledge, but rather a certain set of very active and very  explicit interests.  <H3>  The Government's Political Will Is To Maintain a Certain  Kind of Electorate </H3>   [Varujan Vosganian] State industry did not appear for state  industry, but rather for the electoral support of those who work  in state industry. What the present government wants (as did the  previous governments) is to maintain a certain kind of  electorate, the one tied to state industry, to state  agriculture, and a part of the pensioners who are imbued with  all sorts of nationalism, with "the young people of today," and  so forth. This is an electorate which does not hold property,  which cannot oppose the state and the arbitrariness of the  state--in other words, a permeable electorate. It is precisely  in this that the political will and the subversive and  intentionally deceptive character of the government's actions  consist.    [Valeria Pascariu] In what we theoretical economists are  doing, let us not forget that reality is one step ahead of us;  therefore, we should not fall into the sin of arrogance and  imagine that the managing directors of private enterprises, or  even of state enterprises, are people who, if we do not write  down for them how to do marketing, do not know how to do it.    [Ioan Popa] The problem is that, in the reform strategy,  many  times people have made their choice of priorities because of the  immediate circumstances, under the pressure of events; for this  reason, certain instances of a lack of correlation have appeared  in the creation and the putting into operation of the  institutions and the mechanisms of the market economy. And I  will give you an example from the field of finance and banking:  A reform was carried out--I would say a radical one--as regards  the banking system, without there being undertaken at the same  time measures in the field of the capital market. This happened  not because such measures would not have been provided for in  the reform programs, but rather simply because they were delayed  endlessly under the pressure of other measures.    If the law of privatization would have been respected, we  would have had a stock exchange by now, and we would have been  present in Business Central Europe with quotes from  the Bucharest Stock Exchange; but we have no such thing. And  that is not even on your list.    The securities exchange is the central institution of the  capital market, just as the National Bank, the Bank, are the  central institutions of the credit market, of the banking  market. If people are not concerned with developing the capital  market, then, inevitably, the entire financial and banking  system will rely on the banks. The banks are thus put in a  monopoly position. At least two reasons show how urgent it is to  create a securities exchange: first off, the one that refers to  the well-known problem of privatization, which is intimately  tied to the existence of a capital market. And then, a  securities market has here also the extraordinary ability to  lend credibility to the reform measures.  <H5>  What Laws the Government Is Sending Parliament </H5>   [Victor Babiuc] I would like us to return to the causes of  procrastination. It is certain that the idea of reform was not  well received in all of the circles of power in Romania, neither  in 1990, nor in 1991, nor in 1992, nor in 1993. But the obstacle  was not localized in one place; one met with the obstacle in  various places, because both in Romania and in other countries,  there are several centers of power. And given that, up to  September 1991, laws of a reformist nature (I will not comment  on whether they were irreproachable or not) were sent over from  the government to the Parliament, from September 1991 on these  laws have been fewer and fewer in number. On the other hand,  even up to September 1991, laws forwarded by the government were  not entered into the parliamentary agenda, and this was not  because of the government.    I will illustrate this with my personal situation: During  the  spring of 1991, I prepared all of the laws at the Ministry of  Justice for the reform of Justice, and for the judges, and for  the prosecutors, and for the notaries, and for jurisconsults,  and for the carrying out of sentences and for other things; only  the lawyers opposed my dealing with them. But out of all these  laws, how many got onto the parliamentary agenda? One single  law. And when? The moment the meeting of the ministers of  justice of Europe and North America was being announced. Mr. Dan  Martian realized, on my insistence, that it just would not do  for me to go without any kind of bill having been put on the  parliamentary agenda. And this bill concerning the  reorganization of Justice passed through the Chamber of Deputies.    If we look at what has happened from then on, things are  partially different: In the first place, the present government  has sent Parliament the old laws, but those have also sometimes  been changed for the worse. If we look at the period from  November of last year through today, we see that very few  important laws have made it onto the agenda. The state budget  has gotten onto the agenda--it would not have been possible for  it not to--and so did the laws about the reorganization of  Justice, which had a certain deadline and which enjoyed a  certain importance. The rest have been trivial matters.  <H5>  Decentralization Without Denationalization and Vice Versa </H5>   [Varujan Vosganian] Mrs. Pascariu brought up the problem of  large industry, in favor of which there is an extraordinarily  powerful lobby, whether at the governmental level, or at the  level of parliamentary committees, or at the level of the  politicians. Two things which come from socialism are being  exploited, things which Romanian citizens are used to: the  repeated nature and preservation of income, on the one hand, and  the preservation of jobs, on the other hand. There are two  distinct processes: One is decentralization, and the other is  denationalization. We have done something very strange in  Romania: We have carried out decentralization without  denationalization, and we have carried out denationalization  without decentralization. One time we carried out  decentralization unaccompanied by privatization, and we carried  out a privatization unaccompanied by decentralization.    [Calin Anastasiu] As Ilie Serbanescu was also saying, your  list is at the common-sense level. It is probably somewhat above  the level of common sense--it is a simple diagnosis, a census of  problems. The question for you, for the group which has worked  in this area, is: What do you have in mind as a follow-up to  this? There should be a second step, an analytical step, which  seems to me to be essential.    [Dorel Sandor] Our design is the following: In the first  place, we have avoided mixing up the diagnosis with the  solutions, because I have observed, after three years of  activity in the structures of the executive branch, that there  are many times when pseudo-solutions or modest solutions have  inhibited a thorough analysis of the problems. So we wanted to  establish a pertinent diagnosis which would be as objective as  possible; we will probably wrap up this stage by the end of the  year. At the same time, we believe that the problem of solutions  is not merely of a technocratic nature. We want to throw into  the political market several programs of political proposals  which are now being redone, are being rearranged, in the  structure of Authority as well as elsewhere.    As regards solutions, I believe that we could put together a  collection of alternative solutions from three sources--first of  all, at the local level. There is also an experience of  tradition in East Europe with which we are already familiar to a  great extent and which we could orient toward these problems;  there is this permanently failed transfer of international  experience--or diminished [as published]; and there is finally  the great problem of the domestic political will to take on  certain solutions.    One lesson of the technocrats of the past four years is that  you can give very good advice to people who make decisions of a  political nature, but it is not taken into consideration even  the slightest bit. However, I do not believe and I will not fall  into the trap of thinking that we must rush to hand out  solutions in the sense of botching things up, because the great  danger after a long period of waiting is for you to rush in to  provide other unworkable solutions.  <H5>  Why We Have Not Held a Dialogue Until Now </H5>   [Mircea Diaconu] I am glad to hear that over there, high up,  someone is really doing some thinking. However, I want to ask:  When you were in the government and we were out shouting in the  streets, why did you not tell us, too, that you were thinking so  well?    I did some little experiments at my own expense: I went to  the first bank that I came across and I asked for 200,000, not  more, and this was when another government was in power, not  this one. As I was saying, I asked for 200,000 and that was  enough for me; I could not pay the first installment, because my  first installment was greater than the amount of the whole loan.  And then, to keep using the example of this same loan, I and my  brother had put down as collateral everything we had in the  house, everything we had accumulated over a lifetime. Shaken, I  gave up, and I ceased any attempt to privatize myself or to do  something myself.    We talk about the attempt to privatize yourself and, it is  true, no one stops you. You are allowed to do this. You can do  it in a field, at the entrance to the subway, wherever you  want-- just so long as it is not in the great industrial  strongholds. You cannot talk about privatization while thinking  about some poor little kiosks. I am not thinking at all of  selling off the "23 August" complex. It can stay there as a  stronghold, for the kids to visit later on, as they would a  Doftana. But the individual, the one who can start a business at  a very small level, needs to be given an incentive, while the  peasant has to have a scrap of paper which will make him feel  that he is a landowner. And this is precisely what has not been  done. And it is not only this government that has failed to do  it; no one at all has done it.    And now I will come back with my question: Dorel Sandor, you  were there in the government, you were important, you were  powerful. What did you do there?    [Dorel Sandor] I would like to give three answers which will  not agree with you very much. The first answer is that, in  truth, I did work for two and a half years in the Victory  Palace, as did, moreover, several other people here, and I want  to say that our job there was to do these kinds of analyses of  government. They were not disseminated because there is nowhere  in the world where such analyses are made public.    However, the second reason that we did not carry on a  dialogue such as we are now is the fact that we came into this  building for the first time on 29-30 September 1991, invited by  the GDS. Up until then, we were on your blacklist. Even though  we remained friends all along, institutionally speaking we had  no reason to be here until the Roman government fell. And at  this point I want to touch on a certain sore spot of  post-Decembrist Romania: The lack of professional solidarity  among intellectuals after December is one of Romania's great  tragedies; it is the fault neither of those of us who worked in  the government, nor of those who did not work in the government,  or who got there only recently.    The third answer is that, in truth, one of the great errors  of the reform process in Romania is that it was done from the  top down. Only now at the ground level have there appeared the  true states of ferment of spontaneous reform, in which I believe  very strongly.    [Andrei Cornea] I want to return to the subject of the  position of the government towards the truth. I believe that the  Authorities simply do not want to know the truth. It may well be  that these technocrats never had political freedom of choice, as  people say, but it is assumed that they know some things very  well, that they understand them and can make a quasi-correct  expert appraisal. Up until now, people have also said--and this  is very well known--that many technocrats, experts, have made  plans, have designed things, have made expert appraisals, but  they have been disregarded, or they have been given very little  weight. This is already a symptom which could be included in  your list. It shows that the Authorities need a facade of  expertise in certain fields, but that they do not intend to heed  that expertise, and that finally this process ends with the  gradual expulsion of these undesirables.  <H3>  The Experience of a Team Made Up of People Who Have Been in  the Government and People Who Have Been in the Opposition </H3>   [Dorel Sandor] I would like to say one thing in order to  prevent any confusion at this moment. We do not want to produce  a bundle of stresses so that we will be called in after that to  the Victory Palace and set to work, especially since many of us  have been through that experience and have cured ourselves.  Perhaps this makes the group "A future for Romania." And I want  to draw a clear distinction between a political and ideological  approach which tempts the Authorities with certain options, and  a cool, systematic approach, from the perspective of the public  interest.    What is very much missing in Romania now is not whether or  not the Authorities want to carry out reform; Romanian society  needs to tackle its problems in a relevant way, as if it were  something normal. And Romanians are not to blame for not knowing  still what is meant by the market economy. However, we, as  experts, should very seriously pose ourselves this problem: that  we should be able to offer Romanian society the common-sense  facts in order for it to understand the real problems. We have  made this list so that Romanian society will realize that these  are its problems; this is our main objective, without any  particular political orientation.    [Gabriel Andreescu] I would like to tell Mr. Sandor why our  dialogue came later. In 1990, the newspaper AZI, which was under  the leadership of the Front, was publishing attacks directed at  the GDS and its members, in a kind of language that made it  difficult to imagine any dialogue.    Now I would like to ask: In your analysis, what is the part  with the description of phenomena, and what is the part setting  out standards? A second point: From the concrete experience  which you have had during the time of this analysis, please  assess the margin between what is desired and what is happening  by virtue of an internal dynamic.    [Dorel Sandor] I tried earlier to explain the five  benchmarks  which we take into consideration. What you say about their  dynamic is interesting; in one of the preliminary propositions  of this structure of scoring which we introduce into the  database are earlier critical moments, a kind of case history of  each problem. For example, this problem of the leu/dollar  exchange rate, of the liberalization of the exchange rate, is a  typical case in which we tried several times, we paid the price,  we created the mechanism, up to a point. But after that we  compromised that mechanism and we went, if not from zero, then  perhaps even from before zero, through the damage we created.    Also, I agree, and it is a matter which concerns us, too: to  what extent a problem is procrastinated on into a network of  interests, of influences, of machinery of decision-making, and  to what extent we are not talking about merely the quality of an  individual, of his personal tendencies, but rather we are  talking about a domestic political environment which has taken  on shape and substance over four years in Romania. We have to  take that environment into account, just as we should also take  into account the determining influences of the industrial  environment over the political environment, the commercial  environment, and the environment which is tied to information  and to culture.    However, I want you to observe that in this team, there are  some people who have worked for four years in the structures of  the executive branch, and there are others who have worked and  continue to work in the structures of the opposition--true, all  of them as technocrats. Thus, this team contains within it  people who have experienced the problems from both directions,  and this is, in my opinion, a precious thing.    [Mariana Celac] I would like to stick to the inertial part  of  the processes we are dealing with and the part exposed to the  decisionmaking process, or political will, which is somewhat  blurred in this first offering of the study. At least at the  semantic level, the feeling is that all forms in which  procrastination is manifested are exposed to a corrective  decisionmaking which could eliminate this procrastination. I  believe that here we are confronting an illusion in which both  the Authorities and the journalism which writes "Authorities"  with a capital "P" participate in equal measure. In truth, the  force of decisionmaking and of the will on which it is based  works very efficiently when you are close to moments of  disturbance with an extremely wide range, when you are close to  catastrophes.    I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we are  approaching a moment when the inertia of long-term and very  long-term processes is becoming extremely important. I believe  that whoever will be confronted in the future with the exercise  of decisionmaking will have to deal with a phenomenon which is  more and more dramatic--that is, that you may shoot at one  target, but you may hit a completely different one. At that  point you have to shoot in another direction, but you need to  know where to aim.    The secret "arrogance" of this enterprise is that of  decanting acts of solidarity, of differentiating between that  which is long-term inertia, of perceiving what is becoming  regional in our economic reality, and of defining, finally, what  could be the area of decisionmaking, with all of those ricochets  which a clearheaded Authority will need to handle so that, when  it takes aim, it will hit the intended target.    [Traian Andronic (vice president, National Union Bloc)] I  would like to refer to the moral aspect which you dispatched  into an area having to do with corruption, with cover-ups, and  so forth. I think that you should have taken this moral aspect  somewhat more into account. You have two points there: One  refers to the reform of Justice, and the other to labor  legislation. To be concrete, one of the points refers to the  existence of ambiguities in the resolution of labor conflicts  through the law. Thus, this group of laws with a social  character suffers from the very start from certain ambiguities  which, practically speaking, make it impossible for the unions,  for instance, to exercise the right to contest, to negotiate,  and to strike.    How do morals function in this whole story, morals which  have  but one purpose--to ensure an ethical comfort which would lead  to hope? Such an approach would relieve you, too, of the burden  of a presumed inkling of populism in the statement which you  made to the effect that reform has to start from the ground up  (thus, with a moral earthquake) and not from above, the way it  has happened.  <H5>  [Box, 10] </H5>       -  Hushing up of the political responsibilities in  the events of June 1990;

   -  The compromising of the machinery for negotiating  collective labor contracts through maintaining  components of the economic and financial legislation specific to  the previous system;    -  Delay in establishing the foundations for labor  relations and industrial relations due to the ambiguities  in defining the category of employers under the conditions of  transition; procrastination in the establishment of tripartidism  (the state, the management of enterprises, and the unions) as a  transitory structure;    -  The demagogic approach to social protection and the  delay in establishing an efficient system of social  security;    -  Procrastination on the establishment of a system of social  protections and provisions which would assure the medical  and social assistance of disadvantaged persons (the  elderly, the handicapped, and abandoned children);

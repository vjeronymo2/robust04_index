			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Thai group seeks to raise Dollars 80m in IPO Advance Agro, the pulp and paper subsidiary of the Soon Hua Seng group of Thailand, is seeking to raise more than Dollars 80m through an initial public offering next month to help finance a Dollars 650m pulp and paper mill on Thailand's eastern seaboard. Executives from Advance Agro and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the international lead manager for the offering, are currently on an international roadshow to publicise the IPO. SHS, a leading agro-industrial group which trades rice, tapioca and other products, is offering one-tenth of the enlarged capital of Advance Agro, or 36m shares, to the public at an estimated Bt55 to Bt60 a share, depending on the outcome of the book-building process. About 30 per cent of the new shares will be allocated to foreign investors. A further 19m shares have been sold to the project's main financial backers  -Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers' Bank, Krung Thai Bank, and the Commonwealth Development Corporation - at Bt40 a share. The new pulp and paper mill is expected to begin production in early 1996 and is designed to meet the growing demand for paper in Thailand and the region. Advance Agro intends to focus on the domestic market but could export up to one-fifth of its output to China, Singapore and Hong Kong. Mr Yothin Dumnernchanvanit, managing director, said: 'Demand for paper in Thailand and throughout the Asia Pacific region is increasing by more than 10 per cent a year. 'Per capita consumption of paper in Thailand is only about 30kg per year, compared to more than 200kg per year in Singapore, Japan and the US, indicating huge future growth potential for the market.' The new plant will generate its own electricity and produce up to 175,000 tonnes a year of bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp. It will supply its own paper mill, with a capacity of 217,200 tonnes of coated and uncoated printing and writing paper, and that of its existing wholly-owned subsidiary Hi-Tech Paper, which operates a 41,000-tonnes a year paper mill.</p>

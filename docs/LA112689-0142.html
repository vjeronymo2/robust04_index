			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENTHUSIASM HIGH FOR GORBACHEV'S VISIT TO ITALY;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: HE WILL SIGN 15 BILATERAL AGREEMENTS. ROME OFFICIALS ALSO SEEK  EXPANDED TRADE AND INVESTMENT.  </P> <P> One of Italy's favorite politicians, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,  ventures into this blase Roman Catholic bastion of honest-to-God capitalism  this week with results as foreseeable as the traffic tangles they will  engender: popular adulation, political embrace and economic blandishment in  support of perestroika.  </P> <P> The Romans, who have seen it all, Caesar to Charlemagne, are as wild about  "Gorby" as the rest of a country that has made clunky Red Army wristwatches a  symbol of both fashion and feeling. Even back when the United States was still  warily watching nascent glasnost, an Italian poll showed that among Italians,  Gorbachev was more popular than then-President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> Italy was one of the earliest West European champions of Gorbachev's reforms,  and his Wednesday-Friday visit here en route to a weekend summit at sea with  President Bush will be a Roman circus of three rings.  </P> <P> History may best remember his coming Friday encounter at the Vatican with Pope  John Paul II, but as important for Italy is Gorbachev's impact on Europe. More,  the Soviet leader casts a giant shadow on the soul-searching within the largest  Communist Party in the West.  </P> <P> The Italian government will receive Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, in the  conviction that accelerating change in the Soviet Union and East Europe demands  an immediate, positive and comprehensive Western response.  </P> <P> "Italy decided early on to take Gorbachev at his word -- and to test him. This  view is now accepted within NATO and echoed by the upcoming summit," said Marco  Carnovale, a security specialist at the Institute for International Affairs in  Rome.  </P> <P> In the tumult of change in East Europe, there is no longer much debate among  Italy and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Community allies  over the "let's help" attitude.  </P> <P> "There's no more discussion in the West between cautious people and  risk-takers," Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said in an interview.  "Change is not only so rapid but, in my view, so irreversible, that now the  only thing is to define the strategy to cope with it.  </P> <P> "The problem is how to manage it from an economic and political view."  </P> <P> In a reaching-out policy begun in 1987 when the current Christian Democratic  Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti was serving as foreign minister, Italy has  argued that the surest means of making change in the East a lasting reality is  to support it vigorously. "The best way to influence the process is to open  ourselves to it," De Michelis said.  </P> <P> In a round of meetings with Italian government officials, Gorbachev will sign  15 bilateral accords ranging from cultural exchanges to the conversion of arms  industries, Italian spokesmen say. Italian government and private corporations  are not only seeking to expand trade with the Soviet Union and East Europe but  also to markedly increase their own investments there.  </P> <P> New joint agreements are pending that would produce more Italian-Soviet cars,  tires, traffic signals, computer software, power stations, gas turbines and  pipelines and shoes in the Soviet Union. One agro-industrial project will  transform 400,000 acres in the Soviet Union into a modern truck farm and  canning center.  </P> <P> Of about 680 joint ventures under way in the Soviet Union, almost 10% are with  Italian firms. For a time, Italy proposed that West Europe sponsor a 1990s  Marshall Plan to help the East catch up, but that idea has been overtaken by  events.  </P> <P> "Until yesterday, the problem was one of economic help to smooth the political  process," said De Michelis, "but now the political process is faster than the  economic one. So the problem of the economic sector is not aid but cooperation;  the creation of involvements -- not only of a one-way transfer of resources."  </P> <P> However challenging, the Italian goal of peacefully tying West and East seems  more achievable than untying the knots in the West's largest Communist Party.  </P> <P> Gorbachev will encounter Italian Communists at a noisy crossroads. The irony is  that Italian communism got to perestroika, or restructuring, long before  Gorbachev, but now finds itself a step too short. The party is riven by debate  over how much more to liberalize.  </P> <P> For 40 years, Communists have formed Italy's second-largest political party --  and the eternal opposition -- in a country where governments are fashioned by  coalitions that never include Communists except at the local level.  </P> <P> Italian Communists began drifting away from the Soviet party in the 1960s and  broke entirely with it in 1980 over the invasion of Afghanistan. By now, the  Italian party is virtually social democratic; its Marxists are a small,  hard-core, change-resisting minority whose roots lie in their struggle against  wartime fascism.  </P> <P> Although modernization enabled the Communists to avoid the disintegration of  their counterparts in France and Spain, the party struggles today with the same  identity crisis as the rest of world communism.  </P> <P> Implicitly acknowledging that there is no chance they will ever share national  power as Communists, the party's leaders are trying to weld a new union of the  Italian left. Along the way, they plan to overcome furious internal opposition  and change the party's name, dropping the word Communist and such symbols as  the hammer and sickle.  </P> <P> "In many ways, the Italian Communists anticipated Gorbachev, but now realize  they can't become just progressive capitalists. To survive, they must stress  ideas that are significantly left and credibly alternative," said Gianfranco  Pasquino, a professor of political science who sits in the Italian Senate as an  independent leftist.  </P> <P> Gorbachev knows the Italian Communist Party, by reputation, and at firsthand.  In 1984, he was a middling member of a Soviet delegation that came for the  funeral of Italian party leader Enrico Berlinguer.  </P> <P> Middling no more, Gorbachev must walk on eggs in his meetings with Italian  Communists this week. In projecting themselves as an honest party with strong  managerial capacities and a commitment to both protecting civil rights and  enforcing civic duties, the Communists need a strong statement from Gorbachev  acknowledging their positive, peaceful role, Pasquino says.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev can prove either an asset or a liability to Italian Communists,"  Pasquino said. "On the one hand he is 'the Liquidator,' a visible sign that  communism can't work. On the other, he's an attractive, progressive leader  who's not changing the name of his Communist Party."  </P></p>

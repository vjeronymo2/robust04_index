			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Reliance Industries posts strong midway advance Reliance Industries, India's largest company, yesterday posted a 146 per cent increase in interim net profits to Rs5.1bn (Dollars 162m), due to strong demand, improved productivity and worldwide increases in chemicals prices. Sales in the six months to end-September rose 33 per cent to Rs32.9bn, pushing up operating profits by 41 per cent to Rs7.4bn. Earnings per share soared 91 per cent to Rs31.45. Reliance is among the first of the large companies to report results for the half-year. Analysts expect many groups to post rises due to a recovery in Indian industry following more than two years of stagnation, partly induced by reductions in public spending due to reforms introduced by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister. Mr Anil Ambani, managing director, said: 'We benefited from growing consumption of all our products in India, from productivity increases and from a cyclical turnround in the chemicals industry.' Reliance, which produces textiles, plastics, and petroleum-based chemicals, has grown in 30 years to overtake old-established companies such as Tata Iron and Steel, the country's largest private steelmaker, as India's biggest company. It is expanding capacity and diversifying into financial services, power and telecommunications.</p>

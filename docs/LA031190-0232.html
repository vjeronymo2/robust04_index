			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STILL WALKING SILLY, AFTER 20 YEARS  </P> <P> "It's a mockery, blasphemous. Personally, I was offended."  </P> <P> -Father Arnold Gonzalez, San Gabriel Mission, after a screening of "Monty  Python's Life of Brian," 1979  </P> <P> "You'll have to stop that now. It's getting altogether too silly."  </P> <P> -Graham Chapman, in the midst of any number of Monty Python's Flying Circus  episodes, 1969-1974  </P> <P> Well, yes, it was a mockery and, certainly, it was quite silly. Gee, there  wasn't even any cheese in the cheese shop, was there? What could be sillier  than that? And, not only was it silly, but half the time they were making fun  of "chat shows" and "Match of the Day" and all sorts of quirky little English  things that we couldn't begin to understand.  </P> <P> So, why is it that 20 years after the debut of "Monty Python's Flying Circus,"  the world still can't seem to get enough of twit competitions and the Ministry  of Silly Walks? How is it that this pack of bratty English schoolboys (plus one  renegade American) managed to become the first comedy troupe in history to  attain rock star levels of fame and adulation? Has any other television program  ever aired on both PBS and MTV? Who actually wrote "The Lumberjack Song"? And,  by the way, can a sweater vest really keep you warm?  </P> <P> Of course, we're not going to answer any of those questions here. Your only  hope is to tune into Showtime this weekend when the pay cable channel premieres  two one-hour specials celebrating the Pythons' 20th anniversary.  </P> <P> "Life of Python," featuring interviews with John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric  Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, debuts Friday at 10 p.m. "Twenty Years of  Monty Python (Parrot Sketch Not Included)S debuts Saturday at 10 p.m. and  features clips of memorable Python moments, including excerpts from some  "Flying Circus" episodes filmed in Germany and never shown in America.  </P> <P> The Saturday night special will also include the final appearance of Graham  Chapman, who died of cancer last October.  </P> <P> Chapman's death on Oct. 4 came just one day short of the 20th anniversary of  the Python's debut show. Fellow Python Jones, remarking on the irony of it, was  quoted as saying, "I thought it was in terribly bad taste for him to die when  he did."  </P> <P> It certainly was. Although Chapman's individual star never rose quite so high  as those of Cleese, Palin or Idle, he was in many ways the soul of the troupe.  His characters on stage tended to be straight men and authority  figures-constables and professors. But offstage, Chapman was, by far, the most  outrageous Python.  </P> <P> Until he stopped drinking in the late 1970s, Chapman's alcoholic binges and  barroom exploits put him in a league with the Who's Keith Moon, who also  happened to be one of his best friends. He also described himself as  Raggressively gay," a stance that delighted some and offended others.  </P> <P> In his 1980 life story, "A Liar's Autobiography," Chapman wrote that after he'd  appeared on a BBC interview program, a woman had written in to say that someone  from Monty Python had appeared on television and admitted to being a  homosexual.  </P> <P> "Her handwriting became visibly angrier as she went on to say that persons like  that should not be allowed to live," Chapman wrote. "Eric Idle wrote back to  the lady saying that we (the Pythons) had found out which one it was and killed  him. Curiously enough, we did the next series of shows without John Cleese. I  wonder what she thought..."  </P> <P> Chapman, like all the Pythons, had an academic background. He studied medicine  at Cambridge, which is where he met Cleese, who was preparing for a career in  law. Idle was also a Cambridge student (majoring in English). Jones and Palin  attended Oxford (where Palin earned a history degree). Gilliam, the lone  American, grew up in the San Fernando Valley and has a political science degree  from Occidental College. None of this is particularly important, although it  might help explain why they were always writing jokes about the Crimean War and  Emmanuel Kant.  </P> <P> This is the kind of thing that can be expected on Showtime this weekend.  They'll show lots of clips, like of people exploding and Jones dressed like a  fishwife and Gilliam's drawings of giant feet crushing strange things. Maybe  someone will dress like the Pope, except that he'll be wearing stockings and a  garter belt.  </P> <P> But that would be blasphemous, wouldn't it? A mockery. And silly. Very, very  silly.  </P></p>

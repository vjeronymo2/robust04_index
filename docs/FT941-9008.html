			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Nigeria economy fears grow Private-sector bankers in Nigeria have warned that increased government intervention in the economy in the wake of last month's budget will boost inflation, undermine growth and damage relations with western creditors. The measures introduced by the military regime of Gen Abacha, include fixing the exchange rate and setting interest rates. They have worsened relations with official creditors and stalled talks on debt relief as Nigeria continues to default on its external debt of over Dollars 28bn. Arrears exceed Dollars 5bn. The government's domestic debt is more than N100bn (Dollars 4.5bn) yet the budget does not specify any money for servicing it. The head of Nigeria's leading discount house told finance ministry officials: 'By decreeing a 21 per cent cap on interest rates (nearly 80 per cent) below inflation, the government has attacked the root of a growing savings culture. The central bank is today due to sell Dollars 100m to of foreign exchange at N22 to the dollar, whereas importers have been willing to pay between N45 and N50 since last September.</p>

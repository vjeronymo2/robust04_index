			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVE FOR CALABASAS CITYHOOD GETS BOOST  </P> <P> The chief administrator of the government agency that oversees creation of new  cities recommended Monday that Calabasas be allowed to incorporate, giving a  major boost to those who back cityhood for the affluent community at the west  end of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The report to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) reverses  recommendations made two years ago, when a Calabasas cityhood movement failed  after LAFCO's staff concluded that such a city could not support itself.  </P> <P> Although Monday's recommendation by LAFCO Executive Officer Ruth Benell does  not guarantee approval by the commission of the drive to create an independent  Calabasas, it is expected to have a strong influence on the commission's  decision. A hearing is set for July 11 to consider the proposal.  </P> <P> If it is approved by the commission and by the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors, the proposal could be put before voters as early as November.  </P></p>

He added: Otherwise, sooner or  later they will have to go just as they have come.    Demirel hosted a dinner in honor of Azerbaijani President  Geydar Aliyev at the Cankaya Mansion. Addressing the dinner,  Demirel said that they have a close friendship with Aliyev that  goes back many years, adding that Aliyev is not a prominent  statesmen of Azerbaijan alone but of all the Turkic world.  Noting that there is no need to explain the closeness of  Turkish-Azerbaijani relations, Demirel said:    [Begin Demirel recording] [passage omitted] Today's talks  were held in all sincerity and honesty reflecting the relations  between two friendly states. [end recording]    Demirel said that Turkey and Azerbaijan are a single nation  and two states, adding that there exist no problems between  them. Pointing out that at today's talks an agreement was  reached to make the most of the existing potential, Demirel said  that the agreement to be signed tomorrow will document their  mutual political will and provide the security sought by Turkish  businessmen for investments. Pointing out that regional problems  were also discussed in depth, Demirel said that the fact that 20  percent of Azerbaijani territory is occupied by Armenians poses  a threat to regional peace, stability and security. Demirel  continued:    [Begin Demirel recording] From the very beginning of the  conflict we called on the Armenians to respect Azerbaijan's  territorial integrity. We pointed out that such a stand is in  the interests of all the regional countries and primarily  Armenia. The Armenians, however, have continued to seek the  solution through brute force. We hope that the Armenians will  immediately and unconditionally withdraw from all the  Azerbaijani territory they have occupied in line with the UN  resolution. Otherwise, sooner or later they will have to go  just as they have come. [end recording]    Demirel said that one can observe that the Azerbaijani  people  have acquired a new consciousness regarding the concept of  nation and expressed his satisfaction over the issue. He noted  that at the talks they have also decided to consolidate  bilateral relations through cooperation at international  organizations in which both Turkey and Azerbaijan are members.  Demirel said that Turkey will continue to extend the necessary  support and assistance to Azerbaijan's efforts to unite with the  international community.    Aliyev said that after gaining its independence, Azerbaijan  has begun to attach great importance to developing its ties of  friendship and brotherhood with Turkey. He added that the ties  between Azerbaijan and Turkey, which date back to history, have  never been severed despite the difficult periods. Stressing  that the peoples of the two countries have immediately formed a  close rapport despite the fact that they have remained apart for  70 years, Aliyev added that it is their duty to further advance  the bilateral relations.    Pointing out that the Azerbaijani Army has attained  significant victories in defending the country's integrity  through great sacrifices, Aliyev said: We still maintain that  the path of peace is in the forefront of our war plan. We will,  however, continue our just struggle to attain our goal.  Thanking Turkey for all aid the it has extended in all fields,  Aliyev concluded by expressing the hope that it will continue.    After the dinner, Aliyev received Democratic Left Party  leader Bulent Ecevit and conferred with him for some time.</p>

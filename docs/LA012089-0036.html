			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM HIGH HIGHS TO LOW LOWS, NANCY REAGAN HANDLED HER JOB WITH GRIT AND GRACE  </P> <P> Eight years ago, as Ronald Reagan was being inaugurated President of the United  States, the woman beside him caught the eyes of a dear friend in the crowd. At  that second, she remembers, "both of us were thinking the same thing: Nothing  would ever be the same again."  </P> <P> She was right. Nancy Davis Reagan wasn't sworn in. She never held a public  office. She wasn't paid a public salary. Nothing in the Constitution gave her  power or place in the government. But from 1981 to 1989 she played the most  public of private roles imaginable. She was the President's wife and the  country's First Lady.  </P> <P> Now Nancy is going home with the guy who brought her.  </P> <P> What are the images that she will leave behind, the photographs in our national  scrapbook? The devoted wife staring in fixed adoration as her husband spoke.  The fashion plate in Adolfo dresses and borrowed jewels, a Second-Hand Rose.  The activist against drugs who drove home a three-word message to American  parents and kids: Just say no. The fiercely loyal worrier and star-gazer who  made her husband's enemies her own.  </P> <P> Ronald Reagan will be judged as President. Nancy will be judged, as women often  are, by a much more elaborate set of criteria: wife, mother, presidential  adviser, activist, woman.  </P> <P> From the very beginning this First Lady had little of the Teflon coating that  protected her husband's surfaces from the painful scratches of public  criticism. She was labeled frivolous one year and intrusive another. She was  called a clothes horse in the first term and a dragon in the end. She was  criticized for caring about china and for caring about Russia. For being X-ray  thin and for being power-hungry.  </P> <P> In an era when all the images of women were in flux, the opinions about this  woman were more than ambivalent. Those who admired her independent efforts  against drugs often parodied her protective defense of her husband. Those who  lauded her as a wife often lambasted her as an inner-circle adviser.  </P> <P> It is understandable if she looked out of that White House window and said,  "Some days I have the feeling that if it's raining it must be my fault."  </P> <P> Every First Lady has felt the heat of the White House lights. Dolley Madison  was criticized for her snuff, Mary Lincoln for extravagance. Mrs. Roosevelt was  called a busybody, Mrs. Truman reclusive. "Our expectations are unrealistic,"  says Sheila Tate, who was Nancy Reagan's press secretary for four years. "There  is a sense that everything the First Lady does is subject to discussion. Most  First Ladies go through a baptism by fire. I don't care how well prepared they  think they are."  </P> <P> Not even private problems stay on hold in the White House, nor do they stay  private. A simple chronology of the life events in this First Family reads like  an entry on a stress chart.  </P> <P> In her time in non-office, Nancy Reagan had a husband shot and diagnosed with  colon cancer. She lost her father and her mother and a breast to cancer. As a  stepmother, she was for a time estranged from her stepson. As a mother, she has  been alienated from a daughter whose novel was a thinly veiled attack. Through  it all she was expected to perform perfectly as hostess and wife and drug  czarina.  </P> <P> We can leave it to the historians to divine her influence on the governing of  America in these years. All she says is this: "It's silly to suggest that my  opinion should not carry some weight with a man I've been married to for 35  years."  </P> <P> We can let the sociologists determine if she had a lasting influence on the use  of drugs in America. The one thing that the First Lady has is the ability to  focus attention. Now we will see how short our attention span is.  </P> <P> But we don't need experts to assess what credit is due to the woman who married  her job and carried it out under the hot, white lights that bathe Pennsylvania  Avenue. She, too, has completed a term -- what Martha Washington once called  "the lost years" -- in a role of enormous influence and little freedom.  </P> <P> There is no official transition team for First Ladies -- just boxes and moving  vans passing in the driveway. The spotlight has already shifted from the  Reagans to the Bushes, from the size and style of one woman's family and dress  to that of another.  </P> <P> Still, Nancy Reagan's advice should be included in any non-job description  passed from one resident to the next. "Once you're in the White House," she has  said, "don't think it's going to be a glamorous fairy-tale life. It's very hard  work, with high highs and low lows. Since you're under a microscope, everything  is magnified. So just keep your perspective and your patience."  </P> <P> The woman who is leaving on the President's arm did that. And she did it with  grit and a goodly measure of grace.  </P></p>

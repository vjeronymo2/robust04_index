			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: A triumphant 'Trojans' - Opera in concert The first thing to be said about the Barbican concert-performances of Berlioz's opera Les Troyens at the weekend (in its unequal halves, the fall of Troy and Aeneas's fateful stopover at Carthage en route to Trojanising Italy), with Sir Colin Davis conducting the London Symphony &amp; Chorus and 18 finely chosen soloists, is that they were magnificent. The second is that this memorable experience is on offer twice more: a few lucky readers will stop reading to ring the Barbican box office (071-638 8891) now. For next Sunday the diptych is probably sold out, but there might be seats for this Wednesday/Thursday. It is a little over 24 years since Davis demonstrated conclusively, at Covent Garden, that the neglected Troyens was one of the few great 'epic' operas. Subsequently his recording of the work swept most of the western musical world and ensured that it never goes long now without performances in one capital or another. It seems to demand the resources of a big metropolitan company, though Scottish Opera made a recent and remarkable case for staging it with thrifty austerity. We have been missing it in London. By concert standards, the current Davis performances are sumptuous. Six harps for La Prise de Troie - chiefly to render even more radiant their strummed accompaniment for the Trojan women on the brink of mass self-annihilation; multiple offstage brass, top-calibre, to realise Berlioz's sound-visions in depth and to crowd into the hall to blow the final peroration into an overwhelming blaze. With the LSO in superb form (its flutes, trombones and timpanist distinguished themselves), its chorus forcefully eloquent beyond almost anything that a 'naturalistic' stage chorus could achieve, and Davis conducting out of a lifetime of paid-up addiction to Berlioz, we expected no less. What was unexpected and quite wonderful was Davis's revelatory account of La Prise de Troie. Hitherto its two acts have been regarded as a stark, tight-lipped prologue to the grand romantic action at Carthage. This time there was dangerous electricity in the Trojan air from the outset; and soon, with the great 'Dieux protecteurs' choral scena, we found ourselves confronting a musical vista of extraordinary, tragic depth, a linchpin about which all the rest revolved. Conned by the Greeks' mock-retreat and their bequeathal of the Wooden Horse, the Trojan people sing a paean of thanks to their delivering gods. Yet we know, and Berlioz knows - and perhaps they guess - that they are already lost, that the horse will be the engine of their doom. Their words are triumphal; but their music, veering from bright major-key glare to darker intimations, conveys noble defiance in the face of inexorable disaster. Davis spelled it out to profound effect: in a timeless perspective of grief, but with a brazen panoply of barbaric splendour. For an hour and a half, this illusory archaic world seized our imaginations and wrenched them hard. Sir Colin has persuaded us long since that Les Troyens a Carthage, where Aeneas loves Queen Dido and cruelly leaves her, is a heart-stirring masterpiece. That might have left his new principal singers just to fill their slots as dutifully as possible; in fact they all did much more. In Aeneas's recklessly high-flying music, Vladimir Bogachov went from strength to strength. There were long passages of strenuously bright, clarion tone in La Prise, such as only a young tenor heedless of his future could risk (exactly what the role demands - there is no safe substitute). Toward the end of Carthage, Bogachov nevertheless tapped new reserves of power, raising a brave, well-studied performance (plainly after the peerless but huskier Jon Vickers) to a level of searing directness. Much the same happened with his Dido, Markella Hatziano, Cardiff's 1983 'Singer of the World'. Cultivated warmth and invincible dignity from the start, despite some slippery pitch; later, she expanded into grand, scathing focus when Dido finds herself forsaken and ruined. In La Prise, Jane Henschel's ripe Cassandra had done no less, growing into the stature of ignored, clairvoyant prophetess even while let down by her patchy French. (Though nobody listens, what she has to say is of the utmost importance.) As Dido's sister Anna, Maria Popescu boasted not only a svelte, penetrating contralto, by turns bubbly-urbane and stricken, but the advantage of being born in Montreal; more than anyone, she brought all her words to spontaneous life. Among the minor principals there are no weak links. Young Ian Bostridge (who made a strange, memorable impression as Young Sailor and Shepherd in the recent Welser-Most/LPO Tristan) again brings something artfully raw and touching to Hylas's haunted lullaby, and Gregory Cross makes nearly as much of the poet Iopas. Fiona James, Alan Ewing and Brian Bannatyne-Scott, not to mention the seasoned Gwynne Howell, Robert Lloyd and Carlos Alvarez, supply vital sketches of lesser roles. Everything is held together in Davis's far-sighted, purposeful grip; these days, Berlioz has no champion like him. Later performances; December 8/9 and both halves together on the 12th, sponsored by the Peter Stuyvesant Foundation and the Sema Group.</p>

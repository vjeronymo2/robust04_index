			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mosbacher Criticizes Japan: U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher slammed  Japan for closing its markets to American goods and services but praised South  Korea for opening its markets wider. Mosbacher told South Korean business  leaders that Washington applauded Seoul's spirit of cooperation in response to  trade pressure, imposed in particular through the 1988 U.S. Trade Act. But he  was critical of Japan's efforts and promised to voice his criticism when he  visits Tokyo today after his visit to Seoul. "We opened our markets. And we  worked to create a trading system that would allow for everyone to prosper. Now  it's Japan's turn to show the same kind of commitment to the world trading  system," Mosbacher said.  </P></p>

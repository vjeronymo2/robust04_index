Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, etc., including those pertaining to the licensing of contractors and the so-called ``Kick-Back'' Statute (48 Stat. 948) and regulations issued pursuant thereto.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

Bid Bond: Each proposal must be accompanied by a bid bond in the form attached or a certified check on a bank that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the maximum bid price. Each Bidder shall agree, provided its proposal is one of the three low proposals, that by filing its proposal together with such bid bond or check in consideration of the Owner's receiving and considering such proposal, said proposal shall be firm and binding upon each such Bidder and such bid bond or check shall be held by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (or Builder's Risk Policy) is furnished by the successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of proposals, whichever period shall be the shorter. If such proposal is not one of the three low proposals, the bid bond or check will be returned in each instance within a period of ten (10) days to the respective Bidder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Contractor's Bond or Builder's Risk Policy: The successful Bidder will be required to execute two additional counterparts of the Proposal and to furnish:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) For contracts in amounts in excess of $100,000, a Contractor's Bond in the form attached to the Proposal with sureties listed by the United States Treasury Department as Acceptable Sureties, in a penal sum not less than the contract price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For contracts in amounts of $100,000 or less, either a Contractor's Bond or a Builder's Risk Policy, whichever the Owner has specified below: (Check One)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  Contractor's Bond <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  Builder's Risk Policy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Failure to Furnish Contractor's Bond or Builder's Risk Policy: Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to furnish a Contractor's Bond (or Builder's Risk Policy) satisfactory to the Owner within fifteen (15) days after written notification of the acceptance of the Proposal by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such event, the Owner shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check has been delivered with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check the difference between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amounts for which the Owner may in good faith contract with another party to construct the Project.

Minor Irregularities: The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in the Proposal, if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal prior to its acceptance by the Owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12.

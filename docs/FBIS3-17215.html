As  a justification for the re-establishment of that coercing body,  the decree says: The Committee was set up in order to stabilize  the crime situation; the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry  of Security will be subordinated to it.    Former Security Minister Shevtsov [name as heard] was  appointed head of the new body. The interior minister of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Moldovan Republic, as well as his  deputy, were relieved of their offices and are now standing at  the disposal of the republic's president.    The decree became effective immediately after it was signed,  that is, last night, and it orders the new body to elaborate, by  1 May, a plan to fight organized crime.    A commentary broadcast by Radio Moldova assesses that such  reshuffles made by Igor Smirnov are merely further attempts to  save the discredited authority of the Dniester leaders and as a  method to eliminate the persons they find disagreeable and to  mislead public opinion making it believe that decisive measures  are being taken to fight crime. In reality the latest  reorganization is the implementation of the directions given to  them by the Russian opposition forces, which use the Dniester  Region for trying their hand at the reestablishment of the  Stalinist and Brezhnevist regimes, an attempt made to liquidate  the opposition, and a concerted effort to deal a blow at their  opponent, General [Aleksandr] Lebed [commander of the 14th  Russian Army stationed in the Dniester Region], concludes the  commentary broadcast by Radio Moldova.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Macro 4 shows advance to Pounds 5.4m Macro 4, a computing services company which specialises in software for IBM mainframe and midrange computers, maintained its 26 year record of growth with a 9.4 per cent advance in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.4m. The rise was achieved despite difficult trading conditions and lower interest rates. Turnover for the six months to December 31 was up 7.9 per cent at Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 11.2m). The results were slightly below market expectations, however, and the shares fell 38p to close at 675p, pushed by analysts' fears that second half trading would not show an improvement and dividend growth might not be maintained. But Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said there had been misunderstandings, as the company traditionally performed better in the second half. 'Despite continued difficult trading conditions, the board expects the second year profit to exceed the first half, assuming stable trading conditions,' he said. Operating profits were up 15 per cent at Pounds 4.85m, but this improvement was offset by a 23 per cent decline in interest earnings from Pounds 715,000 to Pounds 549,000. Macro 4 is a cash-rich company which traditionally expects a substantial contribution to profits from its cash balances, which stood at Pounds 19.3m at the year end. Earnings per share were up 8.1 per cent at 16p (14.8p) and the interim dividend goes up 28 per cent to 8.02p (6.27p). Macro 4 is unusual among UK software houses in the international nature of its business. Only 18 per cent of its revenues derive from the UK, while 33 per cent come from the US. Furthermore, it rents, rather than sells, licences for its products, so guaranteeing recurrent income. COMMENT Macro 4 has proved a quietly effective performer over the years. It has high gross profit margins and is strongly cash generating. It has shown it can hold its own against US systems software houses like Legent Corporation and Computer Associates. The big question is whether it can continue to grow profitably when the market for mainframe computers is stagnating. Mr Kelly believes large customers will increasingly use their mainframes as servers in client server systems. The move to systems software on IBM's midrange AS/400 computers will further help to counter any downturn in the big systems marketplace. Analysts are marking in about Pounds 11.5m pre-tax for the full year, leaving the shares slightly underpriced.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, "one of the most </F> prominent Islamic trend leaders in Gaza" by Sophia 'Amarah in  Gaza; date not given; from "The Event" program -- recorded]    [Text] ['Amarah] Dr. al-Zahhar, what formula does Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] set for dealing with the  Palestinian National Authority [PNA]?    [Al-Zahhar] Certain yardsticks and principles govern Hamas'  dealing with the PNA. The first point is that we welcome the  return of every Palestinian who has lived in the diaspora. This  does not mean we approve of the autonomy or that we agree to  participate in it. The second point is that we are against  internecine fighting and against shedding Palestinian blood at  the hands of Palestinians, no matter the causes or motives. The  third point is that we do not participate in the PNA. However,  as sons of this homeland, we will participate in all elections  that will serve the people, whether municipal, rural council,  chambers of commerce, or trade union and student elections. The  fourth point is that we support the freedom of action of any  person who works to serve this homeland. We believe every  Palestinian, after the protracted period of occupation, has the  right to have his own means of dealing with the public through  the establishment of party and media institutions. Every person  has the right to demonstrate and to express his opinion.    ['Amarah] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, some problems emerged  between  Hamas and the Palestinian police at the beginning. Are there  still any problems? What is Hamas' real position on the issue  of security in the autonomy areas?    [Al-Zahhar] We regret to say that the stand of the police  was  unjustified. While the police force had not yet completed its  organization, the agents did their best to fabricate sedition to  kill Fatah and Hamas leaders and to set the occupied territories  on fire. They made confessions to this effect. While the  Palestinian force had not completed its organization, it was  necessary to end this sedition and put out this fire. The  Palestinian police made several statements that were  unacceptable to the ordinary Palestinian, and to Hamas. Matters  remained as they are. We hope that in the not too distant  future, these differences will be settled and that a balanced  formula can be forged for dealings between the PNA and all the  forces which have a presence in the occupied territories,  particularly the opposition forces.    ['Amarah] Where does the movement stand on the residual  Israeli military presence in the Gaza strip?    [Al-Zahhar] As far as we are concerned, it is not a residual  presence. Occupation is present. What happened was a  redeployment of occupation forces. Israel left some sections of  Gaza for other sections of Gaza. If anything, Israel has  stepped up its presence. It is in control of crossings and the  main roads that link the Gaza strip and its villages. It is in  control of livelihoods and everything. So, for us it is  rationed occupation and it is unacceptable. Palestinians are  entitled to defend themselves against occupation, from which  they have suffered a great deal.    ['Amarah] Will Hamas [word indistinct] continue the armed  struggle against occupation in the occupied territory of the  West Bank?    [Al-Zahhar] That is what Hamas said in its latest leaflet,  emphasizing its continuing jihad line. The leaflet that was  issued on 15 June emphasized Hamas' and other Palestinian  factions' right to defend themselves against the Israeli  presence in the occupied land, whether that takes the form of  soldiers or settlers.    ['Amarah] Preparation has begun for [words indistinct]  Palestinian elections. Are you prepared to run in these  elections alongside the Palestinian Authority?    [Al-Zahhar] The Islamic side, Hamas in particular, will not  contest the self-rule elections. As for elections that are  unconnected with the self-rule authority, as I have said, these  will be contested, as has been our practice during occupation.    ['Amarah] Israel recently levelled accusations that Hamas  has been receiving aid [word indistinct] from Saudi Arabia and  Iran, [word indistinct] the chances for a peace settlement.    [Al-Zahhar] There is nothing wrong with Hamas or the other  factions receiving assistance from brother Arabs or Muslims.  However, Hamas has not received a single piaster from the Saudi  government. An ordinary Muslim, whether in Saudi Arabia or  anywhere else, contributes zakat [alms tax], which comes to 2.5  percent [of a Muslim's income] annually, and this is given to  known categories in Islam -- the poor, those who handle the  zakat and for those engaged in the zakat raising effort and the  effort to get slaves freed and for needy strangers. As you  know, the Palestinian people are going through exceptional  circumstances -- poverty, [word indistinct], displacement, and  deportation, and consequently, they qualify for zakat. A Saudi,  Gulf, or Egyptian Muslim or any other Muslim, even in Europe and  America, collects zakat so the money can be spent on  Palestinians who fill the conditions of zakat. But, thus far,  Hamas has not received a single piaster from the Saudi  government.    ['Amarah] One last question. The Palestinian opposition  wants to form a broad national front to abort the settlement  between Israel and the PLO. Has Hamas and the other Palestinian  factions worked out an agreement? Are you truly prepared to  enter into effective participation in such a front?    [Al-Zahhar] [Words indistinct] the 10 factions outside  [words indistinct]. I personally support the call to form a  broad national Islamic front to tackle the inadequacies of  self-rule, especially those with a negative impact on the  national cause and Islamic sanctities and on the (?homeland) in  general, provided that the formula is well-defined and not  (?inconsistent) with our national cause or our religious creed  and (?helps) the Palestinian street for the sake of the  interests of the Palestinian people [words indistinct] and  government in line with the rules I already pointed out.</p>

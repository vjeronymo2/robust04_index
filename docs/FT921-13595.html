			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / No winners in the chip race: Recession and huge excess capacity are hitting Japanese semiconductor manufacturers Japanese electronics companies are fast concluding that leading the technology race does not mean winning the commercial race. Having rushed to produce ever more sophisticated semiconductors, the tiny devices at the heart of modern electronics equipment, they have suddenly discovered that the market's appetite for their advanced products is not as healthy as they had anticipated. Leading companies such as NEC, Toshiba, Hitachi and Fujitsu had presumed that they would now be reaping the financial benefits of their lead in making the memory circuits, or chips, used to store and retrieve information. Instead, they are cutting production targets, reviewing capital investment programmes, and asking themselves if the high price of participating in the memory market is worth the now meagre returns. In part the troubles of the chip makers reflect the global economic downturn, in particular the weakness of the US economy. The industry is also plagued with massive excess production capacity, which has prompted a sharp fall in semiconductor prices. More fundamentally, chip makers' investment in technology appears to have run ahead of what their customers want to buy. This is something of a novel experience for the Japanese semiconductor manufacturers. They had long regarded the chip market as special, driven by a so-called 'silicon cycle' with a life apart from the real economy. Each new and more powerful generation of memory chip seemed to create its own market as it was embraced by the makers of consumer electronics goods and computer companies to improve the quality and capacity of their products. For the makers themselves, producing ever more powerful memory chips has long been a potent symbol of technological prowess, even though their basic function, information storage, is relatively simple. For the past two decades, companies have vied to squeeze ever larger amounts of memory on the same small chips, with each new generation rising by a multiple of 4. Before the current 4-megabit, or 4Mbit, generation, mass produced from 1989, came the still popular 1Mbit; the next generation is the 16Mbit, which is expected to begin mass production shortly. But the market is no longer expanding as expected. In the case of the current generation of semiconductors, potential customers, made wary by recession, are proving slow to begin the process of redesigning their products to incorporate the new technology. The result is that prices of the 4Mbit chips have fallen by almost 50 per cent over the past year and are still falling. An executive at Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics company, lamented that 'nobody will make a profit on this generation' of chips, while a senior executive at Matsushita Electric Industrial said the company is considering whether to commit the estimated Y120bn (Pounds 524m) a year needed to stay in the memory chip race. The question is all the more pressing because most Japanese electronics groups have been confronted by falling profits in other product lines, including video-cassette recorders, computers, and televisions. Consumer electronics sales have been been particularly sluggish on the domestic market over the past year, with the result that companies reported lower profits in the first half of the current financial year ending in March: Toshiba was down 62.6 per cent, Hitachi 27.3 per cent, and Mitsubishi Electric 24.5 per cent. Memory chips remain potentially lucrative. The world market is worth about Dollars 14bn, of which Random-Access Memory chips such as the 4Mbit comprise about two-thirds of the value. There are other types of chips, many of them more sophisticated than memory chips - with some, for example, working as the brain of a computer - but the memory market is the largest and, Japanese makers had hoped, the most profitable. That was certainly the case with the 1Mbit generation, in which Toshiba led the pack and reaped large profits. For the 4Mbit, the competition has been much tougher, with eight Japanese companies, three US makers, and one South Korean company, Samsung, in the field, and two other South Korean companies preparing to begin production. This challenge to Japanese makers, which last year captured about 93 per cent of 4Mbit sales, has forced them to cut chip output targets in the financial year ending in March by 30 per cent and more. Toshiba has delayed the opening of a new production line by six months. And a month ago, Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer maker, announced it was cutting investment in semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the year to March 1993 by 40 per cent to Y90bn, and postponing construction of new plants until the following year at the earliest. The pain is also severe at Hitachi, where memory chips comprise about 40 per cent of chip production. The cuts in Japanese production targets are an attempt to bolster the price of the 4Mbit chip. But that strategy has been undermined by the continuing weakness in demand and the aggressiveness of Samsung, which is quoting prices to customers at up to 10 per cent below the level agreed on by Japanese makers. Partly as a result, Japanese companies are nervous about the prospect for profits on the next generation of 16Mbit chips. They are even more anxious about the risk involved in developing the new technology necessary to manufacture the even more sophisticated 64Mbit chips. Mr Hajime Sasaki, senior vice-president at NEC, said the types of products that might use a 64Mbit - for example, video telecommunications systems - are still under development, and he is unsure who will be buying when the chips arrive on the market in the mid-1990s. This uncertainty has prompted Japanese companies, once proud that they dominated the market, to try to share the 64Mbit development burden with foreign partners. Mr Kazuo Kimbara, Hitachi's senior managing director, sometimes called 'Mr Chips' for his leading role in developing the Japanese industry, said that 'the need for international co-operation is being felt more strongly than ever'. Hitachi and Texas Instruments of the US recently announced an agreement to research jointly the technology needed to make the 64Mbit chip, which requires the use of finer circuits than present technology can manage. There are also agreements between IBM and Siemens, and NEC and AT&amp;T Microelectronics, and Toshiba has been considering a partnership with an unnamed European company. AT&amp;T estimates that the cost of developing the new process will be about Dollars 500m, and that is before a production facility is built. These agreements have another beneficial side effect: they help to solve the problem of trade friction that has long plagued Japanese semiconductor makers. In their quest to build market share in the early 1980s, Japanese companies flooded the US with chips, with exports rising from Dollars 285.66m in 1982 to Dollars 987.1m in 1984. When challenged by the US government they admitted that some of the devices had been dumped - that is, sold at less than cost. The result was a five-year, bilateral semiconductor pact signed in 1986 and renewed last July, when Japanese makers again vowed that they would not dump chips and Tokyo agreed that foreign chips should have at least a 20 per cent share of the overall Japanese market by the end of the next year. What these longer-term agreements have not done is help the 4Mbit market, which has little chance of revival until the US economy recovers and demand increases from US computer makers. In the meantime, Japanese companies will be under extreme pressure, and the stronger, NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi, are hoping that the weaker, such as NMB Semiconductor and Oki Electric Industry, will drop out of the memory market. 'There are just too many companies making the chips,' a Fujitsu executive said. Even the large electronics companies determined to remain in the market are having to adjust their vision of the future. A good reason for continuing to push ahead is that the technology involved, particularly the process of miniaturisation, is likely to have applications beyond the memory chip itself. That in itself, however, will not guarantee profitability. In the past, the Japanese manufacturers were fond of describing chips as the 'industrial rice' of the modern age; like rice, memory chips have indeed become just another commodity.</p>

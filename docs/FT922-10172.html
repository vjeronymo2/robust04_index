			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pan-Nordic insurance group still just a dream / A look at at how a tangled Scandinavian saga might be unravelled Plans for the creation of a pan-Nordic insurance group are back to square one after Denmark's Hafnia Holding decided on Thursday to reject a bid from Skandia of Sweden to take over the group. The Nordic insurance saga started last year when Norway's Uni Storebrand and Hafnia tried to gain control of Sweden's leading insurer, Skandia, and announced plans for an alliance, which, somewhat prematurely, they named Nordic Co-operation. The plan fell through and, in April, Skandia turned the tables on Hafnia, making a bid to take it over. At the time Hafnia was in deep financial trouble as a result of its over-adventurous bid for Skandia. Hafnia's rejection of the Skandia bid places Uni Storebrand and Mr Jan Erik Langangen, its chief executive, in a difficult situation, with speculation rife in Oslo that he will be forced to resign. The next moves in the complex Nordic insurance saga could take many directions. Among the possible developments are that Baltica, Hafnia's main domestic rival, which was discussing an agreement with Skandia when the Uni Storebrand-Hafnia raid was launched, could resume talks with Skandia. 'If they ring, we can always discuss things, but we have no plans to make an approach ourselves,' said Mr Esben Hostager, Baltica's public relations manager. As France's Compagnie Financiere de Suez has a 23 per cent holding in Baltica, and Baltica has holdings in Colonia-Victoire, the Franco-German insurance arm of Suez, any deal between Baltica and Skandia would lead to a Scandinavian-French alliance. Another possibility is that Hafnia and Baltica could reopen merger talks. This would be one way of solving the problems caused by Hafnia's 33.5 per cent stake in Baltica. 'Any agreement would have to benefit our shareholders, and nothing has emerged so far which seems advantageous to our shareholders,' said Mr Hostager. Alternatively, an outsider, such as France's UAP, which has a small holding in Hafnia, may have its eye on Hafnia's Baltica stake with a view to establishing French ascendancy over Baltica. However, Hafnia's institutional shareholder group has said it will seek a friendly placement of the Baltica shares, so this move looks unlikely. Meanwhile, Uni Storebrand has a serious problem. On April 9, Skandia made an offer to take over Hafnia on the condition that Skandia sold its international reinsurance business to Uni Storebrand, with payment being made with the Skandia shares held by Storebrand and Hafnia. The refusal of Hafnia's shareholders to accept the Skandia bid means the Storebrand part of the deal is also in danger. However, the view in Oslo yesterday was that Storebrand would try to carry out the deal with Skandia, although it would require renegotiation of the April 9 agreement and the acceptance of any new arrangements by Hafnia. Storebrand said yesterday there was a shareholder's agreement between Hafnia and Storebrand that neither can sell its holdings in Skandia without the agreement of the other. This agreement stands, Storebrand said. The collapse of the deal with Hafnia leaves Skandia back where it was before the Danish firm and Storebrand began their play to gain control. The Danish-Norwegian approach was foiled because it did not have the consent of Skandia's board. As no shareholder in Skandia can exercise more than 30 votes, the Danes and Swedes where unable to force through their plan. This 30-vote rule, in effect, places Skandia in the control of its employees. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, said on Thursday he regretted the decision by Hafnia's shareholders. He said Skandia, for its part, would concentrate on its insurance business. The rejection of the Skandia bid came only after pressure on Hafnia's board of directors, who originally favoured the offer, by dissatisfied Danish shareholders. Institutional investors, led by the LD Fund, considered that Skandia was getting Hafnia too cheaply. The rebels have promised to raise at least DKr1.5bn (Dollars 234m) in new capital for Hafnia, which would give Hafnia breathing space to dispose of its 13.5 per cent holding in Skandia and its Baltica holding at an acceptable price.

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Russians testing water bomber The Russians have been pouring cold water on Salisbury Plain with a demonstration of a giant water bomber aircraft designed to combat the growing scourge of forest fires, Paul Betts writes. The demonstration of the Ilyushin IL-76, capable of carrying more than 40 tonnes of payload, was staged for the US Forest Service. The service is interested in strengthening its fire fighting resources after the devastating Californian fires last year. The IL-76 is normally used for military transport and civil cargo. Variants of the aircraft have also been built as aerial tankers for refuelling military aircraft and as flying radar stations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 21 (CNS)--There has been a drop  in the number of Beijing students of college-level and above  going abroad to study at their own expense with 2,800 of them  being approved last year down by 1,063 last year from the number  in 1992 and by 2,031 from the number in 1991, according to the  municipal Higher Education Bureau.    One of the reasons for this fall is the deepeening of reform  and the widening of opening to the outside world which has lead  to a number of students seeing their ability to earn money in  the Mainland and chances to fully exploit their talents there.  In past years, some people felt that there was no role for them  in the Mainland and that intellectuals were not adequately  rewarded. Going abroad, therefore, was seen as a way out of  this situation. Now, many people originally planning to go  abroad question why they need to do so since there are now ways  to employ their talents at home.    Another reason for the drop is the increasing rise of  expenses involved in going abroad to study and the difficulties  faced by foreign countries in taking so many Chinese students.  Some of the foreign countries which in the past had taken in  many Chinese students have now adopted restrictive measures in  light of depressed economies and social problems.    Despite the fall in the number of students going abroad at  their own expense, students with post-graduate qualifications  constituted 27 percent of such students. In 1993, however, the  ratio increased to 36 percent and in the first half of last  year, among the students going abroad from Beijing University,  Qinghua University and the Beijing Medical Sciences University,  those with post-graduate qualifications made up over 40 percent.</p>

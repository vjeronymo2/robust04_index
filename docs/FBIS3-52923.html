Talking to newsmen at the airport, Silajdzic  criticized the international community for failing to play an  effective role in ending the Serb and Croat aggression against  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He urged the international community to  either act effectively to defend the Bosnian Muslims or allow  them to defend themselves. He also called for an end to the  arms embargo against Bosnia, which he described as illegal. He  said the arms embargo against his country has caused the  massacre of 200,000 Muslims. Silajdzic said renewed shelling  and bombing by the Serb and Croat forces of Sarajevo and other  cities has seriously hurt the process of restoring peace in  Bosnia. He said Bosnia-Herzegovina is trying to restore peace,  but the siege of Sarajevo is hampering this process.    Silajdzic praised Pakistan's role in the Bosnian crisis and  its continued support for the Muslim people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    During his stay in Pakistan, Silajdzic will call on  President  Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and meet with Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto.</p>

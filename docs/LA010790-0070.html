			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THREAT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT  </P> <P> Arco Solar Corp., the largest manufacturer of solar electricity in the world,  has just been purchased by Siemens Corp., a West German company.  </P> <P> Arco Solar maintains a branch in Camarillo which employs 400 people.  </P> <P> This is just one more on a growing list of businesses being acquired by  companies outside the United States.  </P> <P> British, West German and Canadian companies have all recognized the advantage  of owning property in the United States, and they are investing heavily here.  According to a recent TV report, approximately 50% of all high-rise buildings  in Los Angeles are now owned by Japanese interests.  </P> <P> Considering the staggering cost and scarcity of land in Japan, one can hardly  blame the Japanese for seizing the opportunity to invest in valuable land at  bargain prices; but when will Americans wake up to the fact that we are being  bought out building by building and inch by inch?  </P> <P> One public official who spoke out against the recent Camarillo sale was  Congressman Elton Gallegly. Where were all the others?  </P> <P> Have we, in this country, become so apathetic that we will sit by, without  protest, while our country is gobbled up by outside interests?  </P> <P> MARY E. BAALAS  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

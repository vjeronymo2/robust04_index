			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS;  </P> <P> BLOOD GRASS AVAILABLE  </P> <P> A grass that was rare is becoming more available, now that one of the largest  wholesale growers, Hines Nurseries, produces it.  </P> <P> Japanese blood grass, Imperata cylindrica 'Rubra,' looks like broken shards of  stained glass when back lit in the garden. Each blade is green, turning to  translucent red, and it is most dramatic planted in front of the sun. It  spreads very slowly in Southern California to make small, 18-inch tall clumps  and goes completely deciduous in winter. It takes ordinary watering. Robert  Smaus  </P></p>

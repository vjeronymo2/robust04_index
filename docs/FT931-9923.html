			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / IMF demands consistency: Brazil told to present economic programme MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has told Brazil it must present an economic programme before full-scale negotiations can begin on a new accord. The decision disappointed Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, who has been in Washington this week for his first round of meetings with multilateral financial institutions and members of the US administration. The main aim of trip was to discuss with the IMF the targets for a new accord in place of a Dollars 2.1bn stand-by, signed in January last year, which collapsed after the initial payment because of Brazil's failure to meet conditions. Mr Rubens Pontes, the minister's chief of staff, said yesterday that the meetings had gone well: 'We didn't expect a red carpet, given Brazil's poor record of meeting IMF targets. But, in the circumstances, the reception was almost warm and the fund is definitely disposed to collaborate.' Mr Camdessus accepted Mr Haddad's request to use the last accord as a basis for the new one, rather than negotiate from scratch. However, he insisted that, so as to have numbers to work with, Brazil must put a consistent economic programme in place before new targets could be set. Mr Pontes said that the absence of a programme so far was a reflection of the new government's 'more realistic stance. We are trying to clean the house and resolve a series of structural problems before formulating a programme.' Brazil is anxious for a new accord in order to move towards concluding the restructuring of Dollars 44bn in foreign debt, for which it must put up Dollars 3.2bn in collateral, at least half of which it hopes to obtain from multilateral institutions.</p>

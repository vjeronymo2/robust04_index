			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (7): Tension rises as poll nears - Politics HUNGARIAN politics and politicians tend to exaggeration, a characteristic mirrored in the ornate, gilded parliament on the banks of the Danube and the dramatic statues of moustachioed heroes which dot Budapest's magnificent squares and avenues. With elections due by May next year the atmosphere is electric as the former communists prepare for a comeback a la Polonnaise, the nationalist right plays on old phobias about Jews and foreigners and the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) seeks desperately to consolidate its failing grip on the centre by strengthening its hold on the mass media, especially the state TV. Behind all the nervous tension lies an economy which is stubbornly refusing to deliver sustainable economic growth after a four-year, 20 per cent decline in GDP which masks substantial, but not sufficient, structural reform. Even the ruling coalition's success in attracting more than Dollars 5.5bn in foreign equity investment, and a steady flow of new foreign debt issues, has turned into a double-edged weapon. The nationalist right, led by Mr Istvan Csurka, thunders against the sale of Hungary's family silver and the overweening influence of foreigners and 'cosmopolitans'. It is sometimes hard to remember amid the cacophony of discordant sounds that Hungary managed the most seamless transition from a reform-communist regime to a multi-party system in 1989 or that Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, has headed the most stable and long-lived government in post-communist Europe. But government is a thankless task in this part of the world and Mr Antall has seen his support dwindle, his party split and his coalition partners lapse into internal squabbling over the past 12 months. Questions also remain over the physical health of the prime minister who has just returned from Germany after receiving treatment for non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a debilitating illness which has sapped his strength for years. In his absence the reins of power were held by his heir apparent, Mr Peter Boross, the increasingly powerful minister of the interior. A rising economic tide would have lifted the fortunes of the ruling parties. But the economy, failed to oblige. Instead, Mr Antall has had to face down a rightwing nationalist challenge led by Mr Csurka, a populist writer who articulates the fears of many Hungarians that their distinctive language and culture are threatened by closer integration into European structures. After mounting a personal attack on Mr Antall's leadership, Mr Csurka broke away from the MDF in June and took a handful of MPs with him into his new Hungarian Justice and Life Party. It remains to be seen whether this new party gains the 5 per cent of votes needed to secure entry into the next parliament. It probably will. To fend off right-wing attacks Mr Antall has been obliged to shift the MDF towards the right and give moral support to gestures such as the repatriation and re-burial of Admiral Miklos Horthy. A national hero to some, and a crypto fascist to others, Admiral Horthy took Hungary into the war as an ally of Nazi Germany and re-occupied part of the territories that Hungary was forced to cede at the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. The real electoral challenge to the centrist coalition which has governed since June 1990 comes, however, from another direction. Buoyed up by the victory of communist-era parties in the recent Polish elections, the Hungarian Socialist Party, heir to the reformist traditions of the former communist party, is confidently preparing for a comeback. The party won only 33 seats in the 1990 elections compared with the 165 gained by the MDF. But the latest opinion polls show 25per cent support, compared to only 8 per cent for the MDF. The party, led by Mr Gyula Horn, the veteran reform communist and former foreign minister, is unashamedly bidding for the votes of the unemployed and those who feel that the shift towards a market democracy has deprived them of security and status. Many who once berated the communists for their corrupt abuse of power now profess to see the socialists as the party of clean hands and hold up the last communist government headed by Mr Miklos Nemeth as a model of political correctness and principled economic reform. Mr Horn and Mr Csurka are competing for the anti-government vote, including the votes of those who believe that four years of painful changes have merely created a new wealthy class of recycled party bosses and nomenklatura managers, who used their connections to convert former state property into their own. The main weakness of the socialist position is that few, if any, of the other political parties would be prepared to join them in a coalition, as the Peasants Party joined the socialists in Poland. The socialists may well emerge as the largest single party but are most unlikely to win enough votes to govern alone. Surprises are possible. The elections are likely to demonstrate considerable electoral volatility. All three ruling parties and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), the main opposition party in the current parliament, are expected to lose votes, leaving the socialists and the Fed-eration of Young Democrats (FIDESZ) as the main gainers. Fidesz, led by the char-ismatic young Viktor Orban, has consistently topped the opinion polls for three years, but has equally consistently failed to capitalise on this favourable sentiment at by-elections. Its main asset, an absence of links with the old regime guaranteed by the youth of its protagonists, has been sullied in recent months by its involvement in a shady real estate deal. This involved the sale of its state-provided property at a substantial profit and partial re-investment of the proceeds in a luxury car hire company. Mr Orban, intelligent and articulate, looks to many like a Hungarian version of Spain's Felipe Gonzalez who brought Spain into the modern world by leapfrogging the generation warped by the Franco dictatorship as Hungary has been warped by communism. He has just emerged from a bruising internal conflict over the soul and direction of the party with victory over his would-be rival, Mr Gabor Fodor. The latter, defeated in his bid for the presidency of the party's national committee, argued unsuccessfully that Fidesz was too linked to Hungary's rising entrepreneurs and risked gaining a reputation for arrogance and insensitivity towards the hopes and fears of the majority of voters who remain mired in low paying jobs in the poorly performing state companies. At present Fidesz is in loose alliance with the Free Democrats. But Mr Orban and his close collaborators are clearly aiming for power, displaying a naked ambition which worries some erstwhile supporters. Mr Orban is perceived as shifting his party, which could well emerge as the kingmaker, into position for a possible post-election power-sharing agreement with the MDF - or whichever non-socialist party emerges as the most likely core of a future government.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Party             Hungarian   Seats   Latest       Leader          Type                     acronym  won in   opinion                             June 90   poll  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hungarian Democratic  Forum                  MDF    165    8%    Jozsef Antall  Conservative  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Christian Democrat  and People's Party    KDNP     21    8%    Laszlo Surjan  Conservative  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Independent                                                   Populist,  Smallholders Party    FKGP     44    7%   Jozsef Torgyan         rural  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Alliance of  Free Democrats       SZDSZ     92   10%     Gabor Kuncze       Liberal  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Federation of Young  Democrats           FIDESZ     21   30%     Viktor Orban   Neo-liberal  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hungarian Socialist  Party                 MSZP     33   25%       Gyula Horn     Socialist  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hungarian Justice and  Life Party            MIEP                 Istvan Csurka   Nationalist  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Workers Party         MSZMP     3%          Gyula Thurmer     Communist  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT statistics  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

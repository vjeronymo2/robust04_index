			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zaneta Skerlev: "$4 Million for Macedonia"] </F>   [Text] Mr. George Soros, an eminent international  businessman and founder of the Open Society Foundation, after  talking to President of the Republic Kiro Gligorov and to  representatives of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian  National Unity] and PDP [Party of Democratic Prosperity]  political parties, held a news conference yesterday in which he  informed he was giving $4 million to Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] in support of its  efforts to cope with the embargo imposed by Greece.    He then emphasized that $2.5 million would be given as  credit  without interest for the provision of 20,000 metric tons of corn  for cattle, and the remaining $1.5 million were a gift for the  transport costs of the corn to Skopje. Mr. Soros announced that  in the first 15 days of April this year he would finance the air  bridge, that is he would cover half of the expenditures for air  transport of early vegetables from Macedonia to Europe, since  the air costs were twice as high as the land ones, too high to  accept.    The goal of this gesture of Soros was, as he himself pointed  out, to help the Macedonian Government in the difficulties it is  having since the Greek blockade, but first of all -- to turn the  attention of the European and the world public, which must not  let the country collapse or fall into the hands of extremists,  neglecting the lessons of Bosnia and thus creating here a new  hotbed of crisis with unpredictable consequences.    Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, who attended the  beginning of the news conference with Soros, emphasized that Mr.  Soros was ready to help Macedonia throughout the difficult  times. "Even now," Gligorov said, "he immediately responded to  my invitation and we had very fruitful discussions about the  embargo and about what could be done to help Macedonia."    "I came to Macedonia because I am very much concerned about  the fate of this country," Mr. Soros said, "because I think that  whatever will happen with Macedonia is of great interest for  Europe and the world."    "In this case," he said, "it is very easy to make a  distinction -- who is the aggressor and who is the victim. If  this government breaks down because of an economic collapse, and  if the extremists come, who, we know, are present on both sides,  there will be a conflict in which many neighboring countries  will undoubtedly be involved."    Mr. Soros also said that everything he pledges for in  Macedonia in this situation is in danger. Therefore, he conveys  an appeal to the European countries, to the United States, and  to the other international factors to undertake concrete actions  for assisting our country.    Answering journalists' questions, Soros said that the  meetings he held yesterday with representatives of VMRO-DPMNE  were carried out in a more moderate way than he had expected,  taking into account the previous criticisms he had been exposed  to by this party. Soros also said that he had not had any  contacts with the Greek Government in relation to the loan to  Macedonia, but he pointed out that he would give an interview to  Greek Television, in which he would expose his stances.  Concerning the question that NOVA MAKEDONIJA informed that he  had conveyed a letter to Clinton in which he stated that the  survival of Macedonia depended on how much rights the Government  would give to the minorities, he said that his opinion was that  the Macedonian Government was sincerely committed and dedicated  to solving the rights of the minorities, but more should be done  in that respect.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  "Inexperienced Diplomacy" </H5>   I hope President Gligorov will not be angry at me, but I  have  to say that he and his government were not successful enough in  persuading the world about the dangers Macedonia is faced with,  as well as about the dangers that will come if the situation is  not changed. Of course, Macedonia does not have great  experience in diplomacy and in foreign relations. However, I  say there is a lack of information about the situation in  Macedonia and the attention of the world's mass media has not  been sufficiently turned to this side.</p>

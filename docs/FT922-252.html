			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Kinnock predicted defeat in election MR NEIL KINNOCK yesterday said that four days before the general election he had realised that his party's internal strife during the early 1980s would lead to its defeat. Speaking two weeks before he stands down as Labour leader, Mr Kinnock said that on the Sunday before the election his personal instincts and polling data had signalled that Labour had not done enough to win back the trust of the electorate. Between 4 and 5 per cent of the electorate did not have sufficient trust in the party because of the 'months of turmoil' under the last Labour government in 1979 and the 'years of conflict' in the early 1980s. Speaking to Mr David Frost on TV-am, Mr Kinnock said that to win back that trust Labour would have to further reduce the power of the trades unions in decision-making. In spite of last week's decision by Labour's National Executive Committee to delay any change for at least a year, Mr Kinnock said he was convinced that the party would move to a one member, one vote system for the selection of parliamentary candidates.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT SURRENDERS IN FATAL SHOOTING OF OCEANSIDE GIRL;  </P> <P> CRIME: ANOTHER SUSPECT IN WHAT MIGHT BE THE CITY'S FIRST GANG-RELATED KILLING  IS RELEASED AS AKELI S. KELLY, 21, TURNS HIMSELF IN TO POLICE.  </P> <P> A suspect in the possible gang-related shooting death of a 14-year-old girl  surrendered to Oceanside police Wednesday and was expected to be booked for  murder, while another suspect was released from custody.  </P> <P> Police still haven't found a motive in the killing of Michele Tate but have  increased patrols in the gang-troubled area where she died Monday night from a  single bullet that also wounded a 17-year-old pregnant companion.  </P> <P> And amid neighborhood tension, the Oceanside Unified School District has  rescheduled Friday night's traditional football game between Oceanside and El  Camino high schools to Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> Security at the game, a 15-year intra-city rivalry, will be doubled to 25 to 30  guards.  </P> <P> A major development in the case came at 9:40 a.m. Wednesday when Akeli S.  Kelly, 21, of Oceanside, walked into the police station with an attorney and  surrendered.  </P> <P> "He's going to be booked into County Jail for murder," Senior Officer Bob  George said.  </P> <P> Kelly was interviewed, but George said "anything he says we can't talk about."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Talofa Finouga Jr., 19, who had been arrested Tuesday morning in  connection with the incident, was released from custody at 11:30 that night.  </P> <P> "There's insufficient evidence to charge him with any crime," Officer E.J.  Luarca said. We do not believe he's the shooter."  </P> <P> Initially, police believed both Kelly and Finouga might have occupied the car  that some witnesses said drove past Alberto's Mexican Food at Redondo Drive and  North River Road as Michele Tate and three friends emerged.  </P> <P> There have been conflicting accounts of the incident. "It's actually the first  fatal drive-by shooting in the city of Oceanside, if in fact it's a drive by,"  George said.  </P> <P> One shot reportedly was fired, hitting Michele in the back and wounding Stacey  Prince. Michele was declared dead at Tri-City Medical Center while Prince was  treated and released from Palomar Hospital.  </P> <P> "As of yet, we haven't determined a motive," said Luarca, who added police have  neither identified or recovered the murder weapon.  </P> <P> Authorities are investigating whether the incident was motivated by hostility  between rival gangs that are known to exist in the area where Michele died. It  is located in eastern Oceanside near Camp Pendleton's back gate.  </P> <P> A police report last year said there was increasing violence between groups  called Samoan Bloods and the Deep Valley Posse, a black gang.  </P> <P> The victims of Monday night's shooting are black while both Finouga and Kelly  are Samoan, but police have declined to say whether they believe any of the  people involved are gang members.  </P> <P> Mecaela Tate, the mother of Michele, who was a freshman at El Camino High  School, denied earlier this week that her daughter belonged to a gang. Tate  said the girl was slain by mistake.  </P> <P> According to police, the city was quiet in the aftermath of the shooting and  additional patrol units were dispatched to the area where the shooting  occurred.  </P></p>

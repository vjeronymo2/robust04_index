			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Belgian franc loses more ground against D-Mark THE Belgian franc yesterday dropped to its lowest level against the D-Mark for at least three years amid renewed speculation about a possible cut in interest rates. In spite of support from the Belgian central bank, which denied rumours of a change in interest rate policy, the Belgian currency slipped at one point to the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism. The French franc was also pushed down sharply. Belgian analysts said there seemed to be no single reason why the Belgian franc should have come under such pressure yesterday. However, tension has been mounting in recent weeks, as the government prepares to publish guidelines for its negotiations with employers and unions over a 'social pact'. The guidelines have been prepared by a committee headed by Mr Alfons Verplaese, the central bank governor, and are expected to lay the foundation for cuts in labour costs, improvements in competitiveness, and the reduction of Belgium's large budget deficit. Certain Belgian economists have suggested that easing interest rates might be one way of making Belgian companies more competitive. Dealers said yesterday that pressure on the franc had come from within Belgium but there were also rumours that it might have been generated by Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, the US investment group which made also Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) at the time of sterling's exit from the ERM last year. The Belgian franc ended the day at BFr21.89 against the D-Mark, up slightly from a low of BFr21.95 but weaker than its previous close of BFr21.78. The fall reflected the view that the 'core' members of the ERM, saddled with high unemployment and hit by recession, may have to ease interest rates shortly, in spite of pledges to shadow the D-Mark. The French franc closed at FFr3.5290 against the D-Mark, down from FFr3.5120. A spate of strikes, lower overnight interest rates and comments from Mr Edmond Alhpandery, the minister for the economy, that a weaker franc had been a key factor for stimulating growth, gave hope that the key intervention rate might fall from its present 6.8 per cent.</p>

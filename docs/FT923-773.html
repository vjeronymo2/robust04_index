			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Gardening: Artful additions to autumn - How to prolong the life of a fading season AUTUMN began officially this week although that will not surprise gardeners who have been living with it for almost a month. Asters have opened early; at least one day in each weekend has given a fine imitation of mid-November; and, everywhere, there are trees with berries or bunches of over-ripe fruit. Blackberries have peaked already in the hedgerows: gardeners are left with postscripts which are only as good as they have planned to make them. Years ago, I took a decision to be artful in autumn. Sooner or later, the weather clears. Days are perfect, and I certainly do not wish to spend them among a sweep of dead flowers, pussy-cat colouring and the first signs of yellow on ageing leaves. Instead, I want new life, colours which are not rusty, not too many chrysanthemums, and a rest from orange daisies. Gardeners tend to give up. We all enthuse about early flowers, plant winter gardens and romanticise Lenten roses - but nobody plants beds for October or thinks about schemes for the season's last six weeks. This year, I have had some sudden successes which have turned received wisdom upside down although their spelling is awkward and they belong at the end of alphabetical catalogues. Down in the Z section, I remember an early flop which involved zephyranthes. This late-flowering beauty is known as the West Wind flower but it went west from my keeping after only one season. Ever since, I have avoided late plants too late in the list, assuming that they are tiresome. In fact, some of them are much easier than people admit. Most catalogues still list a bright red flowering carpet of a plant as zauschneria, although botanists have re-named it. Its popular name is supposed to be Californian Bonfire, but nobody uses it and not many people grow it. It is supposed to flower only in hot summers, late in the season. but this belief is quite untrue: my plants have been magnificent since August and nobody could call 1992 a bonfire of a season. Zauschnerias make low carpets of green leaves which are covered with tubular flowers in a brilliant shade of scarlet which clashes with almost nothing. They certainly prefer a dry, limey soil, the sort of garden which is better at growing pinks than hostas. They are slug-proof, an important virtue in a late-flowering plant, and remain fresh and clean in any sunny position, however small the garden. The names are still chaotic, but the best variety for gardeners was discovered in Ireland - hardly the hottest of climates. Nurserymen tend to call it Glasnevin after the great botanic garden, although botanists have now named the entire plant epilobium Dublin. So far as I can establish, these plants are easy, hardy, and excellent value on well-drained soil. But watch out for a grey-leaved form which seems to flower less freely than the conventional green, which is now the main form in the trade. Whereas the Bonfire is supposed to like drought and a hot summer, Kafir lilies are supposed to prefer an impossible combination: damp soil and a sunny aspect. As a result, I have been very wary of them, but this year is showing up the approved wisdom. Once again, their name - schizostylis - is not to be dropped lightly but the plants are far prettier than their photographs in dictionaries suggest and they are one of my small triumphs in this obliging season. The best Kafir lilies tend to turn up in the West Country, growing under houses in areas of lush green grass and high rainfall. Not for me, I decided years ago (like Cornwall, which is out of reach of intellectual libraries). As usual, the publication of The Plant Finder changed everything. On late summer evenings, the entries can be ransacked and whole families identified. Sixteen types of schizostylis are on sale in Britain, from whites through pinks to one named after a professor. Why not grow the lot? You cannot, the experts tell us, if you live in a dry, sunny garden. One kind nurseryman offered to prove the point by sending me a selection of potential victims, fit only for wet conditions. So far, I have proved him wrong. What a schizostylis likes is enough water in spring and enough water again in the weeks when it sets its buds. In between, the weather can be as hot as it wants: this year, my new plants are flowering wildly with no more attention than two watering cans and a wet April. If this performance is typical, they are the postscript we all need. The green leaves are like rushes and send up stems about 2 ft high, set with clear, open flowers of pink, white or scarlet rounded at the edges. My plants are set near paving stones where the ground is always rather more cool. The flowers have high quality in colours which do not clash and which raise the tone in autumn among clear blues and white autumn crocus. As for the varieties, the main distinction seems to lie in their season: November Cheer is late, whereas several of the paler pinks are early. One of the best collections is kept by Rowden Nurseries at Brentor near Tavistock, Devon, which will supply by post (I agree with the owner that each variety is as good as the other, although the whites are perhaps less interesting). From September onwards, this South African flower is something to anticipate and to try in a mood of hopeful experiment. There is no need to worry about long-term damage from frost and, as for the need for constant moisture, the experts seem to be slightly wrong. Half the fun of received wisdom is that it does not always need to be received - and that adventure can turn it upside down.</p>

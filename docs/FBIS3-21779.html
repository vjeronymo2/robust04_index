			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed SH: "National Council On Repression of </F> Organized Crime--Swiss Banker Will Be Able To Keep Suspicions To  Themselves"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Bern, 2 Mar (ATS) -- Swiss bankers will have the  right--but not the duty--to inform the authorities if they have  reason to believe that the money entrusted to them is the result  of a crime. The National Council made this decision Wednesday,  when it defined the new penal rule for combatting criminal  organizations. This penal rule, which was approved--without  opposition--by 158 votes, should enter into force on 1 July.    Henceforth, bankers, trustees, or other business lawyers  will  be able to report their suspicions to the penal authorities  without any risk of violating banking or commercial secrecy. In  this way, they will avoid the dilemma of acting contrary to  either the ban on money laundering, or the obligation of  confidentiality toward their clients.  <H5>  Hit Hard </H5>   Saint-Gall socialist Paul Rechsteiner proposed going further  by making it the duty of financiers to report their suspicions.  Switzerland acts as a center for international criminal  organizations. This is where we have to hit hard, he said.  Only the obligation to inform will make the law effective, Jean  Ziegler (Socialist Party, canton of Geneva) added. However, the  Greens and independents were the only ones who shared this point  of view.    The left wants to introduce the "principle of informing"  that  was so dear to the former communist regimes, retorted Suzette  Sandoz (Liberal Party, canton of Vaud). Generally speaking, the  majority of Swiss feel that the right to inform is enough,  especially since an obligation to do so can be introduced at a  later stage with regard to the laundering of dirty money.  Federal Councillor Arnold Koller stressed that, in any case, no  provisions were to imply sanctions to bankers who do not talk.  The Rechsteiner proposal was defeated by 101 votes to 58.  <H5>  Definition Contested </H5>   The left was also beaten on another point: the definition of  a criminal organization, whose members would be punishable by a  maximum of five years imprisonment. The following definition  was chosen: "an organization which keeps its structure and  staff secret and whose purpose is to commit acts of criminal  violence or to procure income by criminal means."    The socialists feel that this definition is too vague, since  it could be applied not only to the intended organized crime,  but also to small-time crime. It would take just three people  to plan to steal from a large store and you could talk about a  criminal organization, said Nils de Dardel (Socialist Party,  canton of Geneva). Hence, the proposal for a more detailed  definition, which includes the crime of corruption. However,  this was rejected by 121 votes to 36, while Mr. Koller made  assurances that no judge would take a small gang of hoodlums for  a criminal organization.  <H5>  Burden of Proof On The Accused </H5>   The broader possibility of confiscating the illicit property  of criminal organizations was not contested. This should make  it possible to fight organized crime more effectively, namely by  depriving it of its operating capital. It will no longer be  necessary to establish from which specific infraction the  confiscated securities come. It will be up to the accused to  prove that his property was acquired legally.</p>

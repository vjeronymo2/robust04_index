			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin believes that there  will not be a breakthrough in the deliberations on a peace  agreement with Jordan in the coming months, but there will be  progress on other issues. The Jordanians, Mr. Rabin said, have  raised three issues: water, border demarcation, and refugee  return. Israel has made it clear that there is nothing to  discuss on the refugee issue since that belongs to the  negotiations with the Palestinians, and even then only in  discussions on the permanent settlement. Mr. Rabin also said  there are signs that the gaps are closing in the deliberations  with the Palestinians, but that we have to be careful and not  make overly optimistic statements. He also said that even if an  agreement is reached in Foreign Minister Peres meeting with  'Arafat in Davos, there will still be a need to discuss economic  issues in Taba and Paris. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports  that the prime minister made the remarks when he left the  Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 24 January  quotes Mr. Rabin as saying that "the peace process with Syria  will be decided this year. In a recorded passage, Mr. Rabin  says: `I have no doubt that 1994 will decide which direction  developments take in the longer run -- especially with Syria and  perhaps with other elements in the Arab world: whether there  will be peace or deadlock and tension, with all the subsequent  ramifications, but not necessarily war in late 1994.'"    The report quotes Mr. Rabin as also saying "he does not want  to forecast what the direction will be, but the present  circumstances give peace a chance. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir  reports that on leaving the Knesset House Committee, Mr. Rabin  was also asked about Major General 'Uzi Dayan's remarks that a  rupture in the process with Syria could lead to war. Rabin said  the use of the word war was unfortunate, and he would have been  more careful in his remarks."]</p>

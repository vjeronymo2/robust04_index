Anyone who, like Kohl, accuses Rau of "being  a traitor to humaneness" shows that he has "lost touch with  reality, good behavior, and morals in treating others in a  democratic society," SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen said  in Bonn on Friday [18 February]. "Those who talk like that are  becoming a danger to democratic culture and the future of our  country."    The chancellor had attacked Rau in connection with the SPD's  former policy on Germany during an interview broadcast on ZDF,  Second German Television.</p>

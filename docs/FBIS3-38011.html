[no closing quotation mark as published] This is stated in a  Russian Federation Foreign Ministry statement disseminated at  the United Nations 22 February as a Security Council document,  ITAR-TASS reports.    "In recent days," the document points out, "Russia has  undertaken additional efforts to realize its initiative with  regard to unblocking Sarajevo and transferring this city to UN  control, which it advanced back at the 47th General Assembly  Session. We have sought and are seeking to implement this  initiative by acting openly within the framework of Security  Council resolutions."    It points out that "as a result of the steps taken by the  leadership of Russia and intensive diplomatic work, this firm  and consistent line, which rules out unilateral ultimatums, has  produced a result." "In response to our appeal the Bosnian  Serbs adopted a decision at their assembly in Pale to withdraw  their heavy arms from the Sarajevo reigon. We reckon that this  show of goodwill by one of the sides involved in the conflict at  a critical moment for a settlement will elicit equally specific  countersteps.... We also urge our partners in the Bosnian  settlement -- above all, the United States and the EU countries  -- in the spirit of their statements on the preferability of a  political solution to the problem, to exert the necessary  influence over the Bosnian Government to make it cooperate with  the United Nations in the matter of completely unblocking and  demilitarizing Sarajevo," the statement reads.    Russia has proposed that, following the unblocking of  Sarajevo, the UN Security Council urgently begin examining ways  to establish an administration in this city, as well as measures  to strengthen other safe areas on the territory of Bosnia and  Herzegovina.</p>

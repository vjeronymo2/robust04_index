			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Miners' group seeks partner THE miners' consortium which last year leased Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh from British Coal is to seek a partner or outside investor to provide finance to overcome funding problems. Monktonhall Mineworkers is owned by its 160 employees, who have invested Pounds 10,000 each in the company. It blamed the need for additional finance on a three-month delay in starting production. It wants to buy equipment to develop a second coalface. The colliery, closed by British Coal in 1987, resumed production at the end of last year. It has a contract to supply 87,000 tonnes of domestic coal to British Coal and is fulfilling a trial order for 12,000 tonnes of power station coal. Mr Jackie Aitchison, Monktonhall chairman, said the company was continuing to operate thanks to the support of its bank, Bank of Scotland, and 'the understanding of our suppliers'.</p>

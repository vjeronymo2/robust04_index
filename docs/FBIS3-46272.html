			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liang Chao: "Imports Fuel Record Rise in </F> '93 Tariff Earnings"]    [Text] A rise in imports and tighter customs inspections  caused tariff revenue to hit a record 25.9 billion yuan ($2.98  billion) last year, statistics said.    The income was a 20 percent rise over 1992, according to  statistics released yesterday by Chinese customs authorities.    Officials from the Customs General Administration (CGA) [as  published] attributed the sharp growth in tariff income to  booming trade, China's rapidly developing national economy and a  change in the composition of imports.    China's soaring domestic demand for imports was the major  factor behind the rise in import tariffs, they said, adding  that, excluding international aid and donations, China's imports  of general merchandise last year rose 25.2 percent over l992.    For example, steel imports rose to 30.34 million tons, up  327  percent over 1992; processed oil imports 17.48 million tons, up  128 percent; imports of automobiles or wheelbases by 310,000  units, up 47 percent; and imports of aircraft 129 units, up 79  percent.    There was also a marked increase in the imports of Hi-Fi and  TV sets from Japan and other developed countries as well as cars  from the CIS republics.    The officials also attributed the rise to CGA measures last  year to improve customs inspections on imported goods and its  crackdown on fake goods.    Last year, import duties rose 19.58 percent over 1992 to  reach 25.62 billion yuan ($2.94 billion), while export duties  grew by 32.11 percent to hit 260 million yuan ($29.9 million).    During the past year, customs officials also collected 18.82  billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in value-added taxes on imported  goods an increase of 13.2 percent over 1992.</p>

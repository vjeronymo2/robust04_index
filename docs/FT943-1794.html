			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: AWA Arjo Wiggins Appleton's French minority shareholders clearly rule the roost at the Franco-British paper company. The succession of Anglo-American resignations among board directors and line managers in recent years indicates how disagreeable the AWA nest has become. The question is whether, now they have have gained control, the financial weakness of St Louis and Worms &amp; Cie is holding back AWA's industrial progress. At first glance, yesterday's announcement that AWA would not make a full bid for Scott's SD Warren subsidiary supports that thesis. AWA has made no secret of its intention to add to the highly successful North American Appleton businesses. Much of Warren's operations are in the high margin fine paper that AWA professes to like. The price tag - unlikely to be more than Dollars 1.5bn - was within AWA's range. Debt could have been easily increased and the remaining cash raised through a rights issue. The concern is that such a strategy was blocked by the French who did not have the necessary cash but did not want to dilute their shareholding. However, the considerations behind the decision were probably more industrial than financial. Two of Warren's mills fit perfectly. But two others manufacture low-margin paper grades of little interest to AWA. Although the French shareholders' financial weakness does not appear to have held back AWA this time, it continues to be a cause for concern.</p>

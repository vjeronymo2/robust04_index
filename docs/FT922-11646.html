			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Wasa turns in operating loss WASA, the Swedish insurance group, said its non-life insurance and finance operations, which are due to be listed on the Stockholm bourse in 1993, made an operating loss last year, writes Sara Webb in Stockholm. The combination of heavy credit losses in the real estate sector and big claims related to storm damage abroad led to an operating loss of SKr395m (Dollars 66m) last year, compared with an operating profit of SKr57m in 1990. Premium income increased by 10 per cent to SKr4bn, the group said. Wasa's life insurance operations, which rank third in Sweden after Skandia and Trygg-Hansa SPP, more than doubled operating profit, to SKr2.25bn from SKr981m in 1990 despite a drop in premium income from SKr3.6bn to SKr3.4bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pier Ferdinando Casini and Clemente </F> Mastella, Italian Democratic Christian Center leaders, by Paola  Di Caro; place and date not given: "The Centrists Raise Their  Voices: We Want More Space in the Moderate Pole"]    [Text] Milan -- Now that the [Northern League Secretary]  Bossi-[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi entente appears to be in  the bag, the Christian Democratic Center's [CCD] spokesmen are  displaying a certain perplexity as to the future of the "Pole of  Freedom." They, partisans from the outset of an accord between  all the center and center-right parties, now fear being crushed  in the "mortal embrace" between Berlusconi and Bossi. And they  fear that the exclusion of Fini's National Alliance from the  electoral pact could prevent the victory of their lineup. Here  are the doubts of Pier Ferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella,  the CCD's leaders in the North and South respectively.    [Di Caro] Mr. Casini, what risks do you see in the  League-Berlusconi alliance?    [Casini] I view as positive the go-ahead which the League's  congress has given to the possibility of a liberal-democratic  grouping, but the difficulty is coming now, as one attempts to  put together varying political formulations. I want to find out  what space exists in this grouping for liberal Catholics. And I  want it to be clear that this is not a problem of names, of  candidates. In this field, obviously, it is numbers which  count. Nobody wants to deny the weight of the League in the  North. But the problem lies elsewhere: We are not ready to  accept political annexation. We were the first to enter the  game because we want to build a political project.    [Di Caro] What concerns you in particular?    [Casino] I would premise my comments by stating that Bossi  has a colorful language, and in what he says one has to  distinguish between folklore and political substance. But I am  having a hard time coming to terms with a tired antifascism,  within a constitutional set-up which is being served up over  again and which does not make sense today. Something has  shifted to the right, and today a prejudiced "no" to an  electoral grouping with the National Alliance is not acceptable.  And then, naturally, one will have to evaluate what changing an  electoral agreement into a political agreement to govern will  eventually involve. One can win only by resolving these  problems.    [Di Caro] Mr. Mastella, are you frightened by the  League-Berlusconi embrace?    [Mastella] Certainly, if the alliance fails to respect our  Catholic identity, or if a desire for hegemony emerges, then  there will be problems. Our negotiations with the other  representatives of the moderate pole remain open, and we are not  forced to be part of a pact at any cost. But I would recall a  single fact: According to the polls, the moderate pole has 35  percent, and we have 4 percent. It is not so easy to do without  the CCD.    [Di Caro] Whom do you fear more, Bossi or Berlusconi?    [Mastella] The danger certainly comes from the League. It is  true that we are strongly rooted in the south, but we are a  national party; that is why we wish to have a fair weight in the  alliance. If, however, anyone raises his voice and in  particular asks too much, also on the question of candidates,  there will be serious problems.    [Di Caro] Bossi has closed the door on the MSI [Italian  Social Movement].    [Mastella] It is important to end the era of an excluding  democracy, but also that of nostalgia, as it seems to me the  National Alliance is doing. I believe that, in the electoral  field, it is necessary to seek accords with this political force  wherever it is possible. In the political field, in any case,  one cannot deny that differences still exist between us and Fini.</p>

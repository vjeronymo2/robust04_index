Addressing a media conference in Johannesburg, former Congress  of SA [South African] Trade Unions Secretary General and ANC  election candidate Jay Naidoo said the Reconstruction and  Development Programme [RDP] would be the basis of a legislative  programme for a new government at all levels.    The programme puts forward various mechanisms for the  implementation of its proposals and retains nationalisation and  the creation of a reconstruction levy as two of those policy  options.    The RDP document was a concrete programme for addressing the  expectations of large sectors of the population who had suffered  as a result of inequality and imbalances in housing, education,  health and employment, he said.    The RDP would seek to harness the resources of all sectors  of  society to tackle socio-economic disadvantages although the  state would play a leading role. "A government that invests  heavily in infrastructure," he said, "will meet the needs of our  people and stimulate economic growth."    The RDP document focusses on five key areas: meeting basic  needs, developing human resources, building the economy,  democratising the state and society, and implementing the RDP.    The programme seeks to redistribute over the next five years  a substantial amount of land to landless people, build over one  million houses, provide clean water and sanitation to all,  electrify 2.5-million new homes and provide access to everybody  for affordable health care and telecommunications.    On the economy, the RDP proposes considerable trade and  industrial reform to achieve international competitiveness  s?ed employment creation. It points to t he imperative of  developing a large domestic?uring sector that makes greater use  of the country's raw materials and minerals.    Although the cost of the programme would be large, the ANC  said it could largely be met within the existing government  budget, as well as by accessing new and innovative forms of  financing. ANC economics head Trevor Manuel said the emphasis  would be to promote more efficient governmental spending through  better social expenditure delivery systems and state capital  investment.    He said the financial sector would have to be encouraged to  mobilise and direct more resources from housing to the promotion  of small and medium sized enterprises. The RDP considers  increasing the public sector in "strategic areas" through  nationalisation, purchasing of shareholding in companies,  setting up new public corporations or joint ventures with  private sector.    On the other hand, it also proposes reducing the public  sector to enhance efficiency, advance affirmative action and  create employment. "Such a mixed economy will foster a new and  constructive relationship between the people, the democratic  government, the trade union movement, the private sector and the  market," the RDP documents states.    The final draft of the RDP document will be discussed by a  special ANC conference next weekend before being adopted as its  election platform.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (8): A little essential luxury - Life's important non-necessities MOST PEOPLE, when asked to name a luxury, hesitate only briefly before gazing into the middle distance and allowing covetousness to carry them away. A private jet, they mutter dreamily. A house in St Paul de Vence. An entire set of Vuitton luggage. A yacht. A Rolex. A magic no-bills platinum Amex card. A Bulgari necklace. A Chanel handbag. A Rolls-Royce. A driver. servant. Certainly they are all luxuries. But they are great luxuries, the things daydreams are made of. Push someone on life's little luxuries and, for a moment, they are likely to be perplexed. A Bulgari ring? One piece of Vuitton luggage? No, life's little luxuries are the real thing. They are not daydreams. They are the vitally important non-necessities without which life would become, if not dreary and desperate, then drab and difficult. They are the expenses which Mr Micawber would not incur. They are such little things. But they make such a difference. Most of them are about convenience. They are the cost of car parking in central London. They are the washed, prepared vegetables from Marks &amp; Spencer which permit 15 more minutes in bed before the Sunday pot roast has to be slammed into the oven. They are the Fauchon individual souffles which go into a cold oven at 20 minutes to eating time. They are a private fax, an American fridge, an extra four hours of the cleaner's time the morning after a party, still eating dinner in restaurants, paying the bills on the second car so the children never take the first, the laundry service, car-valeting, constant hot water, a telephone in every room, tights by the boxful. The luxuries of convenience vary from person to person. Women will value a taxi to the door because it keeps their Emma Hope velvet shoes from too bruising a contact with the pavement and spares anxiety concerning strangers. Men, on the other hand, have no such apprehensions and often find the Tube quicker. However, while a woman might grudgingly wield an iron if her clean American percale cotton sheets depended on it, a man might be certain the end of his world was at hand should the laundry close. For all, though, convenience is a matter of time and comfort. It is an intensely rational motive. Other motives for insisting on life's little luxuries are less so. Take the luxuries which are about certain standards. They are little differences by which we define ourselves, which ensure that we stand out from the herd. They include: travelling first-class; picking up the bill; Chanel cosmetics; hardback books; buying not renting videos; a bottle of good wine with a take-out pizza; keeping up one's membership to a club one never uses; Laurent Perrier in the fridge, and tipping generously. These are also about expert knowledge and insider information. This kind of luxury is about paying a little more than necessary for something which other insiders will recognise has been bought as a consequence of expert knowledge. These luxuries take in Armani spectacle frames, Herbert Johnson's roll-up panama, a Brigg umbrella, bespoke shoes from Lobb's, a travelling writing case from W &amp; H Gidden, a Parker 51 fountain pen, fruit teas from Wittard of Chelsea, a Mason &amp; Pearson hair brush, Glycerine and Rosewater soap from Woods of Windsor, a subscription to World of Interiors, a blanket jacket from Ralph Lauren, fresh flowers and Eva Gunderson to arrange them, an Aga, an amber necklace from Cobra &amp; Bellamy, Lorna Wing to make your canapes and, failing that, Gentlemen's Relish. Others are little indulgences, kindnesses to ourselves which make us feel loved. This is known as the feel-good factor and is held to bolster confidence, effectiveness and a sanguine temperament. These are the luxuries without which, many women are convinced, life would be unendurable. Numbered among them are: lots of time in the bathroom and plenty of shiny jars on the bathroom shelves; an occasional day in Harrod's beauty salon; a weekly manicure; scent by Guerlain; a new Georgina von Etzdorf scarf twice a year; Emma Hope shoes; La Perla underwear; a Pringle cashmere dressing gown; regular lunches with a girlfriend at Le Caprice; therapeutic afternoons in Joseph; fine china and fresh croissants for breakfast; crystal glasses on the supper table and Vogue every month. Whichever category a little luxury falls into, it only qualifies if it is habit-forming, if the mundane but adequate alternative becomes quite unthinkable. My mother simply could not drink tea out of a mug. It had to be a china cup with, most emphatically, a saucer. A friend cannot sleep under sheets and a blanket. It must be a goose-down duvet. Another friend cannot, she swears, live without a view of trees as she draws back the morning curtains. I must leave home with my my car or I will have an anxiety attack along the lines of 'how will I ever get home again?' Silly, but necessary.</p>

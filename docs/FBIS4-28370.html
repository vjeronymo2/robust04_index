			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States is Dispatching 90 Military </F> Advisers and Military Specialists to Cambodia To Continue  Fueling the War in Cambodia; Is This a Repeat of the Indochina  War of the 1960's and 1970's?"]    [Text] There have been reports saying that the spokesman  of the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh has announced that the United  States is dispatching 90 military advisers and military  specialists to Cambodia.    People still remember the history in Vietnam when the U.S.  Government dispatched U.S. troops there in the 1960's -- the  Vietnam War started. The U.S. Government dispatched hundreds of  military advisers and specialists; more were successively sent  until there were millions of U.S. soldiers there. In the  Vietnam War, over 50,000 U.S. troops were killed; hundreds of  thousands more were wounded. Thousands are missing and their  fate remains a problem today.    Now the United States will start dispatching military  advisers and military specialists to Cambodia to assist the  two-headed government to continue fueling the war in the  country. People are interested in this and have asked the  following question: Is this a repeat of history? The Cambodian  people do not need gasoline to pour over the fire; the Cambodian  people need water to put out the fire. National reconciliation  is water for putting out the fire.    The Cambodian people categorically oppose whatever helps  fuel  the war; they will absolutely not allow this. They will fight  on until achieving national reconciliation and genuine peace.    The Cambodian people want to coexist peacefully and have  friendship with the American people. The two peoples do not  want war and do not want to kill one another. Therefore,  solving the Cambodian problem for peace and national  reconciliation will benefit the Cambodian and American people,  and also the people of the region. Furthermore, nobody in the  world wants to die in a war.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week - Penstemon Schoenholzeri THIS IS one of the best bright, red hybrid penstemons. It also appears in nursery catalogues as firebird and ruby - attempts to give it a more acceptable name for the English-speaking market - but Schoenholzeri is correct. It is an evergreen perennial which may be damaged by cold in winter indeed, it can even be killed - for which reason it is wise to root cuttings in August or September and over-winter them in a light but frost-proof place before planting outdoors in spring. It grows about 3 ft high and has slender spikes of tubular flowers which are produced successfully most of the summer, making it very useful both for borders and for use as a bedding plant. It thrives in all fertile soils and sunny places.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Allders and BAA deal will spread risk more equally ALLDERS International, the tax and duty free retailer which is part of the Allders Group, has signed a deal with BAA covering all its shops in BAA's UK airports. The contract runs until 1999 and replaces individual contracts for each store, some of which were due to run out this year. The new agreement also changes the way in which each side makes profits from retailing, sharing risks more equally between them. It will give Allders, which is hoping to float in the next few months, a more stable flow of profits from its BAA shops. BAA said that as well as long-term security it would enable the two sides to work together on new ideas while sharing the risk. About a quarter of Allders' turnover is being secured by the deal with BAA. Its BAA shops had sales of Pounds 161.1m in the year to March 1993, while Allders International's turnover was Pounds 296.5m in its financial year to September 1992. Allders other activity, department stores, had sales of Pounds 259.1m in that period. Usually airport shops are run under five-year contracts at the end of which they are put out to bidders. Allders 1992 profits were adversely affected by the loss of a large contract to run a shop at Sydney airport. Mr Harvey Lipsith, chief executive of Allders, said 'there is always a bit of nervousness about contracts. This deal allows us to target other geographical areas without covering our backs all the time.' He said the new system of payment 'should benefit both parties and make it much easier to predict profitability.' Until now Allders has been paying BAA a rent based on turnover with a guaranteed minimum. Now BAA will pay Allders a management fee, more than covering Allders International's costs. A profit target will be set, and profits above that will be split between the two. Mr Lipsith said this shifted the balance of risk away from Allders International, and gave it a greater incentive to drive the business for growth. BAA said it had struck a similar deal with Forte, the hotels and catering group, which had been operating since January with benefits to both sides' profits. BAA's strategy is to expand the space in its airports devoted to shops over the next three years. Tax and duty free shops are central to this plan, and Sir John Egan, chairman, said they provided 'an important source of revenue to BAA' as well as offering customers 'choice and value'. Allders International is the largest retailer in BAA's airports.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Israeli PM departs from his dogma on settlements IN A rare public admission that Jewish settlements in the occupied territories are a central issue in Middle East peace efforts, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, has said they would be a subject for negotiation. His informal remarks to reporters on Tuesday night were a departure from his earlier public dismissals of US and other protests about the settlements, which are undergoing significant expansion. Previously he had insisted the settlements issue was not connected to the peace process. The prime minister was speaking in English. In the past he has appeared to strike a conciliatory stance for a foreign audience, only to retreat when speaking to his supporters at home. The settlements issue is likely to be a key topic when Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister, meets Mr Shamir in Jerusalem tomorrow and when Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, returns for further talks next week. Mr Bessmertnykh arrived in Damascus yesterday on the first leg of his tour. He will meet Mr Baker in Cairo on Sunday. Mr Yossi Achimeir, a senior aide to Mr Shamir, said yesterday the prime minister had not altered his staunch commitment to settlements. Mr Shamir called the settlements 'part of the essence of the conflict' that would be a subject for negotiations. 'It is a question of territory - to whom this land belongs - and this is the object of negotiations and we have to negotiate.' Mr Achimeir said the remarks were consistent with Mr Shamir's long-held position that all issues could be brought to the negotiating table at the second stage of the two-step process Israel has proposed for the territories. This envisages negotiations on a final settlement only after an interim period of limited Palestinian autonomy. Peter Riddell adds from Washington: President Bush said yesterday he was 'moderately optimistic' that Mr Baker would make progress on his fourth peace mission to the region since the end of the Gulf war.</p>

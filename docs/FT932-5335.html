			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Taxpayers may bear cost of scrapping nuclear plants BRITISH TAXPAYERS may have to bear a large part of the burden of scrapping civil nuclear facilities, the National Audit Office, the public-expenditure watchdog, says in a report published today. The reason, it says, is that 'considerable uncertainty' surrounds the nuclear industry's ability to pay. Scottish Nuclear will become technically insolvent some time after March 1995 if the government does not intervene, partly because of future decommissioning costs, the NAO said. Nuclear facilities have a limited lifetime and safely dismantling them will be one of the nuclear industry's biggest financial burdens. The report, which is the most comprehensive government study of decommissioning costs to date, estimated it would cost Pounds 18bn to decommission all of the industry's facilities, but said that is 'affected by a wide range of uncertainties'. While it is difficult to estimate total costs, the report said they would be spread over more than 100 years. Some disposal plans have not yet been approved by the regulators, and the UK has not yet decided which method to use for long-term disposal of radioactive waste. However it pointed out its estimates do not discount the amount of money to be spent in the future. It calculated the undiscounted decommissioning costs for Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear and British Nuclear Fuels, which make up most of the civil nuclear sector, to be Pounds 14.5bn and the discounted value at Pounds 5.9bn. The Atomic Energy Authority also has undiscounted costs of Pounds 3.5bn. Nuclear Electric told the NAO that it expected 'to be able to meet all decommissioning liabilities as they fall due'. However the office warned that if operating costs rose - particularly for disposing of waste from regular operations - the generators could be unable to meet long-term decommissioning liabilities. It added that 'the present electricity supply market provides no mechanism through which any increases in costs can be passed on directly to consumers'. Nuclear Electric said yesterday: 'We believe we can cover liabilities without any extension of the nuclear levy' - paid by electricity consumers and worth more than Pounds 1.2bn a year, the levy ends in 1998. Scottish Nuclear said yesterday that its financial results would show that it was not technically insolvent. The Cost of Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities. Commons Paper 692, HMSO, Pounds 7.40.</p>

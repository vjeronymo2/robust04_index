			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in an attempt to ease nationalist  tension in the Baltic republics, met with the leaders of those republics --  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- and supported their drive for greater  autonomy, Estonian party chief Vaino Valjas said. Valjas told Estonian  television that Gorbachev expressed concern that his perestroika program was  threatened by conservatives, however, and that it was necessary for reformers  in both Moscow and the Baltics to be united. Next week, the Soviet Central  Committee is scheduled to meet, and the Baltics' effort is expected to be a  major issue.  </P></p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Chess in Britain is suffering from a decline in business sponsorship WHILE Nigel Short (above left) will be on the brink of becoming Britain's first chess millionaire today, the game in Britain is suffering from a big decline in business sponsorship, Leonard Barden writes. Short needs only one draw from his remaining two games against Jan Timman (right), the Dutch master, to win the right to challenge world champion Gary Kasparov and share a possible Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) prize fund. Yet City institutions such as Grieveson Grant, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, and Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, have stopped sponsoring chess since their mergers into bigger groups. There is still City sponsorship - from Lloyds Bank, Leigh Interests, and Duncan Lawrie, the private bank - and from the East Sussex town of Hastings which holds an annual tournament. But declining sponsorship has left grandmasters and other leading players struggling for a living. Mr Peter Wells, head of the British Chess Academy which represents young professionals, says: 'There are too many players chasing too little money, and in European opens we now have to contend with a huge influx of ex-Soviets.'

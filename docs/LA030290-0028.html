			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> MARMONTE LEAGUE  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P> <P> COACH: Jack Willard, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 12-13; tied for 4th in league at 5-7.  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Willard was the coach of the girls' softball team until he  accepted the baseball coaching position this season. He takes over a young team  that has only three returning starters. Matt Tackett (.358) is a returning  all-league first baseman who was also 3-3 with a 3.61 earned-run average. "He  is outstanding offensively and defensively," Willard said. Mike Muncy, a junior  shortstop, is another returning starter and catcher Mitch King was a part-time  starter in the outfield last year. The rest of the players are primarily from  last year's junior varsity. Senior Eric Raba, a 6-2 right-hander, is  inexperienced but will be Camarillo's top pitcher. "He's our mainstay," Willard  said. Juniors compose the remainder of the pitching staff: Tajah Merrill, Fred  Tepesano, Danny Haas, and Mike Waid. "They're pretty young, but they're going  to get an opportunity to pitch," Willard said. Camarillo has some speed in  outfielders Tim Cornish, Mark Lindbloom and David Nathaniel, as well as in King  and Muncy. "We run pretty well," Willard said. Junior Corey Tucker will play  second base and junior Robert Sanchez is at third.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Camarillo may overcome its youth with talent. "I think we'll be able  to play pretty well," Willard said. Camarillo has pitching depth, but the key  will be defense. "If we play defense like I think we're capable of playing, it  might smooth over some of our rough spots," Willard said. "Our offense is going  to be OK and our pitching is going to be in the strike zone. Now it's just a  matter of how we field the ball and throw people out."  </P> <P> Channel Islands  </P> <P> COACH: Don Cardinal, 24th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 6-17; 7th in league at 2-10  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Channel Islands used to be a power in the 1970s but has not  won a league title since 1979. There are 12 juniors on the team. Junior center  fielder Jacob Cruz (.377), a starter since his freshman year, could be the  finest outfielder in Ventura County. A pair of right-handers, sophomore Angel  Aragon and senior Manuel Padilla (1-1), lead a thin pitching staff. Cardinal  says Aragon's fastball approaches 80 m.p.h. Senior George Alvarado will move  from second base to shortstop, a position John Johnson mastered before  graduating to Ventura College. Cardinal also expects a strong contribution from  junior outfielder John Bogges.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Cardinal says the Raiders will be better, but he isn't sure how much.  "It's still early, but we're optimistic," he said. "Our pitching will be fair  to good, and I think we'll be hitting the ball better as the season goes  along." Cardinal says he needs anywhere from 22 to 25 wins to reach 400 in his  career.  </P> <P> Newbury Park  </P> <P> COACH: Gary Fabricius, 4th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 19-5; 2nd in league at 9-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Only four players return from last year's team, which lost in  the second round of the 4-A Division playoffs. "We were senior-dominated last  year, but we have some pretty good players coming back," Fabricius said. Those  include left fielder Brian Smith, designated-hitter/outfielder Ron Spaeth,  Chris Marsden and Shane Gallimore. Marsden, who bats left-handed, and  Gallimore, who bats right, will fill the left side of the infield. Junior Jason  Cash provides depth in the infield and Tighe Harrell will play first base and  pitch. Junior Mark Wilson will platoon at first base. Seniors Jason Kernan,  Andy Moffat, Derek Bovard, and Matt LaBelle compose the pitching staff, which  has its work cut out in replacing the graduated Jeremy Dewey (8-3, 2.52 ERA)  and Tim Beal (5-0, 2.29). Jon Jerotz and Jason Sands are fighting for the  catching job. Jai Johnston and Jason Smith add speed and depth in the outfield  and may work into starting positions.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Newbury Park is young and inexperienced and is a member of an  unforgiving league. "With that combination, you really don't know how good you  will perform," Fabricius said. "We look good in scrimmages, but we'll know a  lot more after this weekend." That's because Newbury Park will play five games  in the the 32-team Loara tournament. "That tournament is usually a good measure  of whether you can battle in the Marmonte League," Fabricius said.  </P> <P> Royal  </P> <P> COACH: Dan Maye, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 12-17; 6th in league at 4-8  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Royal's top offensive threat, Jason Jones (.446, nine home  runs, 27 RBIs) graduated. But Royal retained its best pitcher, left-hander Bill  Egan (4-6, 2.32). "Egan is our mainstay, but the rest are unproven," Maye said.  Tim DelMonte and James Tosh are contenders for the No. 2 slot. Gilbert Renteria  (4-1, 3.27) will move to the bullpen. Senior Sean Mitchell has moved from  shortstop to second base. Royal will have outstanding speed in sophomore left  fielder David Landacker and right fielder Tony Liming, who stole 22 bases last  year on the sophomore-freshmen team. Senior Richard Naranjo (.302) returns at  third base, senior Steve Kinnaman will start at shortstop. Three juniors named  Steve are contending for the starting catcher position: Steve Talafuse, Steve  Bernstein, and Steve Prentice. Center fielder Robert Campos has good speed and  a strong arm.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Maye, 27, says his goal is to change the attitude at Royal. "We're  going to concentrate on playing aggressive baseball rather than think about  winning," he said. "If we go out and play solid baseball, the winning will take  care of itself." Expect to see more hit-and-runs than home runs. "If we sit  back and wait for the two-run home run, we'll be in trouble," Maye said.  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P> <P> COACH: Mike Scyphers, 12th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 23-4; 1st place in league at 10-2  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: It appeared as though this would be the first year Simi  Valley didn't have a name like Scott Radinsky, Scott Sharts, or Tim Laker in  the lineup. Then Brian Vasey transferred from Carlsbad High, the San Diego City  2-A champion last year. Simi Valley also has Kenny Hood, a 6-4 senior  left-hander (3-1, 1.56 ERA) who is one of the league's finest pitchers. Hood  also hit .380 last year as a second-team All-Ventura County first baseman. Jeff  Sommer, a three-year starter, is an all-league power-hitting outfielder who  also might pitch. "He has a tremendous arm," Scyphers said. "If he comes around  as a pitcher, it will be a big boost." Brandon Banaga is a returning starter  who was honorable mention all-league last season. Tyler Nelson, a junior, was  promoted from the junior varsity midway through last season and will play  third. Joe Gordon, a senior, has moved from first to second base. He hit two  home runs in a doubleheader scrimmage against Rio Mesa. James Manzi, a 6-3  junior, will play the outfield and pitch. Junior Derek Rushton was the  projected starting shortstop before Vasey transferred, but Scyphers will move  Rushton to outfield. Kris Kirksey transferred from Camarillo.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Simi Valley will be a tough out. "Offensively, we'll be as good as  we've ever been," Scyphers said. "Our two through seven hitters are capable of  hitting the ball out of the yard." Yet Scyphers is still searching for a  leadoff hitter and he isn't comfortable with his pitching staff. "Kenny Hood is  as good as any pitcher in the league," he said. "After that, we have unproven  talent." Simi Valley will play in the 32-team El Segundo tournament, beginning  today, and the Las Vegas Chapparal tournament from April 12-14.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P> <P> COACH: Jim Hansen, 16th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 16-10; 3rd in league at 7-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Lancers are loaded with talented juniors, many of whom  played on a Conejo Valley Senior League team last summer that won the Southern  California championship. And, after years of thin pitching depth, Thousand Oaks  finally has a quality staff. John Bushart (6-3, 1.83), is pitching for Cal  State Northridge this season, but Thousand Oaks will be long on arms with  senior left-hander Scott Barkman (2-0), and juniors Tony Siegel, Chris Loll,  Adam West, Mike Lee, Nick Brown and Jeff Naster. Thousand Oaks has strong  hitting from a group of five senior returning starters: Barkman (.365), left  fielder Lance Martin (.364), shortstop Mike McNellis (.300), third baseman Bill  Hall (.500) and center fielder Brent Christensen (.280). Junior Brian Sturges  (.385) is recovering from an arm injury and could miss much of the season.  Catching will be Hall and junior David Skeels. Junior infielders Jason  Goldstein and Ryan Kritscher are pushing for starting positions, and juniors  Brian Capella and Bryan Corey are talented and versatile.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The Lancers could be the team to watch this season in the Marmonte  League. "We're confident that we have one of our better teams," Hansen said.  Thousand Oaks is strong up the middle and has good pitching, but Sturges'  injury could hurt the Lancers at catcher. Hansen feels most teams in the league  will be able to contend with a Simi Valley team that has won the past four  league titles. "They don't appear to have two superstars who can blow you out  of your shoes like they have had in the past," Hansen said. Thousand Oaks has  lost in the first round of the 5-A playoffs four consecutive years.  </P> <P> Westlake  </P> <P> COACH: Rich Herrera, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 11-13; tied for 4th in league at 5-7  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Eight of 10 returning players are starters. Westlake has a  1-2 punch of left-hander Mike Eby (6-5, 1.61 ERA) and right-hander Scott Lerner  (1-4, 2.04), both of whom mix their pitches well. "Eby has developed some pop  in his fastball and Lerner has a bigger upper body," Herrera said. James Clark  and Donnie Hill also will pitch. Catcher Mike Lieberthal (.408), who has made  an oral commitment to play at Arizona State, may be the league's best  all-around player. Tim Falsken (.278), a junior, moved from second to shortstop  and Rick Walters, a backup to Lieberthal, is at second. Keith Hess will start  at third base. Juniors Dave Monheim and Derek Stien provide pitching depth.  Outfielders Rob Neal, Keenan McAluney, Matt McHenry and Shawn Howard give  Westlake plenty of speed. James Jones, whom Herrera said would start at  shortstop if Falsken weren't so talented, will provide depth.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Westlake committed more errors than a bad circus act last year.  Herrera estimated that 10 to 12 of Westlake's losses were by two unearned runs  or less. Westlake had 40 errors in 24 games. In a 13-10 loss to Newbury Park,  all 13 Panther runs were unearned. Therefore Herrera has concentrated on  fielding fundamentals. "If we don't get them out, we can't hit," he said. If  Herrera corrects the Warriors' defensive woes, Westlake will be a contender.  </P></p>

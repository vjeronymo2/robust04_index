			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (26): Obstructing the president's vision - Stephen Fidler assesses the political system The Byzantine workings of Bolivia's tight-knit political system remain a mystery even to long-standing students. Some observers reckon it also remains a mystery to its president, who spent most of his formative years outside the country. Far from enjoying the cut and thrust of political life, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada appears to view politics as a rather tiresome necessity. Like Bolivia's coca problem, politics stands in the way of his grand vision. Educated at the University of Chicago and a philosophy student who speaks better English than Spanish, he certainly is not from Bolivia's traditional political mould - which is a positive rather than negative attribute as far as most of the public is concerned. While the popularity of his government has waned in recent months - in large measure because of the way it handled demonstrations by coca growers - it remains by Bolivian standards at reasonable levels. Many Bolivians figure the president, one of Bolivia's most successful entrepreneurs, is rich enough not to have to be corrupt. Mr Sanchez de Lozada describes himself as 'a very modern type of politician'. During the 1993 election campaign, he reshaped his campaign - with the help of US political consultants Sawyer, Miller - after close scrutiny of opinion polls. It was out of these opinion polls that the idea of 'capitalising' rather than privatising state industries developed. He has followed public opinion closely since he took office. 'We have used a great deal of modern methods - polling, focus groups and in-depth interviews. We've become very effective in not only knowing the questions to ask but knowing how to interpret the answers,' he says. But even some supporters think that the president is too much of a slave to public opinion, and that following the opinion polls has added to indecisiveness and slowed the government reform programme. They argue that to get things done he will have to court public unpopularity  - particularly in the middle of his term and since he is forbidden by the constitution for standing for a second consecutive term. As an example, they cite the fact that public support for coca-growers marching on La Paz to protest against government policy aimed at repressing illegal coca cultivation led him to an about-turn in which he met the leaders of the coca farmers' unions, whom he openly condemns. Yet Goni - as he is widely known - continues to stand head and shoulders in public esteem above the rest of his political rivals, according to Mr Carlos Mesa, a political analyst and television journalist. Indeed, most of the parties competing against the coalition led by the president's MNR party are almost all in turmoil. The MIR, the party which provided the previous president, Mr Jaime Paz Zamora, is viewed by political analysts as highly vulnerable. This follows allegations - brought to the attention of the government by the US Embassy and now being examined by Congress - that the former president and senior members of his party had links with drugs traffickers. The party of former dictator Gen Hugo Banzer - the ADN - has also been weakened by an intensifying debate over the succession to the party's ageing figurehead and founder. Meanwhile the UCS, the party headed by brewery magnate Max Fernandez, has been riven by a dispute with the government. Mr Fernandez pulled out from the governing coalition protesting at the lack of government jobs allotted to his party. However, many of his party members peeled off and continue to support the government, which thereby preserved its majority in both houses of Congress. Other significant opposition figures include Mr Carlos Palenque, a television talk-show host and populist who heads Condepa. Arguing for a new economic programme which he calls 'endogenous development', he so far has been unable to extend his support beyond the poor people of the highland regions. According to one observer, therefore, 'Goni's biggest problem is with his own party.' As a modernising president sitting atop an unreconstructed political system, he has had to cut deals - that means promising jobs - with key figures within the MNR. Although it is early to judge, many political analysts believe, nonetheless, that the most likely next president will come from the ranks of the MNR. Among the names most frequently mentioned are - in the ranks of traditional politicians - Mr Guillermo Bedregal, now a leading legislator in the lower house, and a senator, Juan Carlos Duran. The candidature of Mr Bedregal, who agreed to go as ambassador to the UK before deciding that he should stay on in Bolivia, is weakened by his links to the violent 16-day dictatorship of Alberto Natusch Busch in 1979, when he was minister of external relations. More technocrats than politicians are Mr Fernando Romero, the entrepreneur and a former cabinet minister ousted by the president, and Mr Jose Guillermo Justiniano, the present minister of sustainable development and the environment. All this assumes some measure of success for Mr Sanchez de Lozada's programme, in particular capitalisation, which is being relied upon to boost growth. 'If capitalisation doesn't work, everything he does here is dead,' says one political analyst. Failure of the programme, according to one diplomat, does raise the danger of a populist government succeeding the administration. If that happens, he argues that the intervention of the military cannot be ruled out. In the military - as well as in politics, particularly in the eastern city of Santa Cruz - the influence of secret societies or 'lodges' is hard for outsiders to divine. Yet the intervention in the near future of the military in politics is viewed as unlikely by most Bolivian observers. Indeed, the military is on the face of it today less of a factor in Bolivian politics than it has ever been. The involvement of the dictatorship of Gen Luis Garcia Meza during 1980-81 with drug trafficking and the viciousness of the regime caused long-term damage to the public standing of the army. Mr Mesa, the political analyst, says morale in the armed forces is low, its effectiveness has been reduced by budget stringency and it has yet properly to define a modern role for itself. The international and regional environment is also significantly less friendly to military governments than it was a decade ago. Furthermore, there is no sign of the emergence of a new military leadership willing or able to take a political role, he says.</p>

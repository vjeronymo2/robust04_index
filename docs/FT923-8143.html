			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Nestle hits snag over Perrier deal THE DEAL struck last month between Nestle and the European Commission permitting the Swiss food group to acquire Perrier has been shaken by the discovery that the French mineral water company does not own at least one of the eight springs that Nestle has agreed to sell as part of the agreement. And the real owner of the Thonon spring, the city of Thonon-les-Bains on the south shore of the Lake of Geneva, says it will not automatically approve the transfer of the concession that it had ceded to Perrier. Mr Paul Neuraz, the mayor of Thonon, wrote a letter to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, on July 30 explaining the city's position, but he has not yet received a reply. The situation is potentially troublesome. The commission's ruling on the Perrier acquisition obliged Nestle to sell the eight minor brands with a view to creating a third force in the French mineral water business. It stipulated further that the purchaser had to be approved by the commission. Now the purchaser will also have to be approved, at least in respect of the Thonon spring, by the city of Thonon-les-Bains. An EC official conceded yesterday that there was a problem. Nestle said it was unaware of the town's ownership until a few days ago. 'From the time we made our bid for Perrier in January until the commission approved it on July 22, we were not allowed to look inside Perrier,' a spokesman said. He added that it was possible, but not yet clear, that another of the eight springs to be sold, Vichy, was also held under a concession. 'I think we can find a solution that will satisfy Brussels and the legal requirements of Thonon,' the Nestle official said. Thonon authorities worry that they will be the losers. Their interest is that their spring be exploited to the maximum. The Perrier concession is due to expire in 1994, and the town has just negotiated a boost in annual output, now about 35m litres, to 300m litres, as a condition of renewal. It faces the prospect that the eventual purchaser of the other minor Perrier brands might not be as enthusiastic as Perrier about boosting output from the spring.</p>

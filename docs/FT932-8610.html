			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canny conversion to a new faith / Assessing Silvio Berlusconi's change of heart on listings THE surprise conversion of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's media magnate, to the cause of popular share ownership is almost akin to one of the scantily-clad soubrettes on his TV game shows taking holy orders. Few entrepreneurs have so publicly flaunted their distaste for the stock market and their determination to retain sole stewardship of their companies. Even after winning control in 1991 of the Mondadori publishing group, Mr Berlusconi did nothing to raise his stock market profile. Mondadori and Standa - Italy's second-biggest retailing group, purchased by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest holding company in 1988 - are the only listed parts of his empire. In both cases, the listings existed prior to acquisition by Fininvest. So what explains last week's sudden change of heart, with the decision to list Silvio Berlusconi Editore, a publishing and commercial printing operation, as part of a complex share swap into Mondadori? The main motive is financial. After its rapid rise in the 1980s and early 1990s, when sales soared with the Standa and Mondadori acquisitions, Fininvest is now in what one group director calls a 'consolidation phase'. Although it has emerged relatively unscathed from the recession so far, Fininvest is feeling the strains of growth. Net group borrowings grew to L3,050bn (Dollars 2.07bn) at the end of 1992, the latest year for which figures are available. Interest charges amounted to L500bn in 1992. While the group may not be under direct pressure from its bankers to divest, opportunities for further growth via debt-financed acquisitions are starting to look severely restricted. In essence, the flotation of SBE is linked to an offer to swap SBE shares with those of Mondadori. It will be the preliminary to the placing of a substantial stake in SBE. Mondadori is Italy's biggest publisher, with a prestigious book list and a stable of leading magazines, including Panorama, Italy's best-selling weekly news magazine. Sales last year rose by 13.9 per cent to L1,600bn, while net profits recovered strongly to L57.1bn from L10.1bn in 1991. Meanwhile, SBE made net profits of L29.7bn on sales of L320bn in 1992. The company, which has substantial commercial printing activities, is best known as the publisher of TV Sorrisi e Canzoni, Italy's biggest-selling magazine. Shareholders in Mondadori will be able to exchange one ordinary share for one share in SBE. The ratio for holders of non-voting savings stock will be four Mondadori shares for three in SBE. Fininvest already owns almost 70 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares and about 80 per cent of the savings stock, which will be swapped into SBE equity. A further 20 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares were sold to SBE directly last month. Outside shareholders in Mondadori have little option but go along with the deal, which values Mondadori ordinary shares at L15,000, against a closing price of L10,825 before last Thursday's stock market suspension. The savings shares are being valued at L11,250 against a pre-suspension close of L6,905. After the swap, SBE will have about 9 per cent of its shares on the stock market. SBE is then likely to place up to 49 per cent of its total capital in order to raise up to L600bn in fresh funds, based on the offer price for Mondadori shareholders. The transaction may only be the first sign of a new-found affection for the stock market on Mr Berlusconi's part. Some analysts predict he will eventually list minority stakes in two other parts of his media, retailing and financial services empire, which made net profits of about L60bn on group sales of L11,000bn in 1992. The first may be RTI, Mr Berlusconi's three highly-successful Italian television channels, packaged together with Fininvest's Videotime film and transmission interests. The second could be Mediolanum, the small insurance group purchased by Fininvest in 1984. Special reasons could explain the RTI transactions. Trading conditions at RTI, one of the pillars of Mr Berlusconi's financial success, have grown increasingly tough following criticism of its advertising activities. The principal attacks have focused on RTI's pioneering use of on-screen sponsorship of products on its popular quiz and game shows. The practice has been attacked by competitors and Italy's supervisory authority, which wants to limit the duration of such spots. The attacks on RTI include a campaign by magazine and newspaper publishers claiming that Fininvest's channels are gaining an unfair slice of the market by undercutting rates. Together, they have put the normally ebullient Mr Berlusconi on the defensive. Taking RTI public via a big flotation could multiply its lobbying power by creating an army of new shareholders. Mr Berlusconi's seeming conversion to the cause of the stock market may not come from the heart, but he is canny enough for his head to tell him it is the right step in the circumstances.</p>

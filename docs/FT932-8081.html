			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Leeds reaps Pounds 2.9m and buys into Continent LEEDS Group, the West Yorkshire-based textile dyer and printer described by Mr Robert Wade, its chairman as 'tortoise, not a hare', lifted pre-tax profit 16 per cent from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 2.92m in the six months to March 31. This steady progress was 'no more or less than is expected of us.' Turnover grew 4.5 per cent to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 20.8m). However Mr Wade pointed out that, although this gave the impression of a climb in margins, they had in fact remained either constant or had slipped a little, though volume production had risen more than the turnover advance indicated. He said that the financial value of sales had been adversely affected by two factors. First, the fire at the Walsden factory, which accounts for a little less than 20 per cent of the group's output, had hit production - a 'conservative' Pounds 385,000 exceptional credit was taken above the line to account for any business interruption insurance. Second, there was a 31 per cent fall in wool prices during the last year, though Mr Wade added that they had risen in the past few weeks. Since the period-end, Leeds made its first non-UK acquisition in the Netherlands. For an initial Pounds 2.49m and a maximum further payment of Pounds 1.03m, it has bought TIM Beheer and Itex Brummen, which specialise in transfer printing of textiles and merchanting dyed and printed fabrics, as a 'springboard' for the rest of Europe. The non-apparel business continued to grow, though it still represented less than 25 per cent of the group. Mr Wade said Leeds liked to do 'difficult things where the margins are high'  -the camouflage, printed furniture fabrics and curtains operations performed well, he said. The difference between Leeds and other textiles groups, he said, was that it did not spin, weave or make clothing; it was simply concerned with colour and design, converting a commodity to what the market wanted very quickly. On the non-textile side, Mr Wade said that Leeds Leasing had started to write an increased level of business after two years of restricted activity. Earnings per share rose to 10.8p (9.5p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.75p (2.33p).</p>

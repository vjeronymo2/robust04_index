			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANON BUSINESS MACHINES TO EXPAND TIJUANA PLANT  </P> <P> Canon Business Machines, a Costa Mesa-based U.S. subsidiary of the Japanese  electronics giant, said this week that it plans to significantly expand the  Tijuana manufacturing plant it opened last summer.  </P> <P> Since June, Canon has been manufacturing printed circuit boards and ribbon  cassettes for electronic typewriters at a 60,000-square-foot facility in a  business park in the Fundadores district in southern Tijuana. The plant employs  about 90 people, Canon's director of administration David Shiffman said.  </P> <P> Canon now says it will add 120,000 square feet of plant space by the middle of  next year and bring its total payroll in Tijuana to more than 220 by the end of  1990.  </P> <P> The expansion will be carried out partly on 3.3 acres Canon recently acquired  and partly on land it acquired when it made its initial entry into the Tijuana  maquiladora scene. Shiffman said Canon's experience in Mexico so far has gone  "very well."  </P> <P> Shiffman said the expansion could lead to Canon assembling completed  typewriters in Tijuana instead of just components. Canon now makes only one  model of electronic typewriter for the U.S. market, but may add several models  in coming years, he said.  </P> <P> Sean Doyle, a broker with Coldwell Banker International of San Diego, which  represented both buyer and seller in the Canon land transaction, said interest  in maquiladoras on the part of U.S., Japanese and other foreign manufacturers  has picked up in recent weeks after a slight downturn earlier this year. Doyle  attributed the decline to political uncertainty in Mexico.  </P> <P> "The success Canon has had in the first phase is evident in the current  expansion plans," he said. "It's also a good sign for additional Japanese and  other offshore investment" in Tijuana.  </P> <P> Doyle said other foreign manufacturers operating plants near Canon's in the  Fundadores area include Scripto-Tokai, a Japanese manufacturer of disposable  cigarette lighters; Altus, a U.S. battery manufacturer, and Cast Alloys, a U.S.  golf-club maker.  </P> <P> Shiffman said the expansion of Canon's Tijuana facility will not negatively  affect jobs at Canon's Costa Mesa plant. In fact, payroll at the Orange County  plant has nearly doubled to 390 workers over the past year, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roundup by reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900): "Trade </F> of Property Rights Is Growing in China"]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (XINHUA) -- A new market for  trading property rights is on the increase in China. According  to data provided by relevant departments, the number of markets  for trading property rights has increased to 25 across the  country so far, and regional trading centers for property rights  have taken shape in Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong, Chengdu,  Shenzhen, and Zhejiang. Thirty banking institutions and large  enterprise conglomerates-- including the China Economic  Development Trust and Investment Corporation; Hangzhou Waitan  Construction Co., Ltd.; China Everbright International Trust and  Investment Corporation; and Shenzhen Baoan (Group)  Corporation--recently decided to jointly establish the China  International Property Rights Trade Center in Beijing, a market  for the trade of property rights nationwide.    The trade of property rights refers to the transfer of  property rights between owners, whether it be in kind, in whole  or in part. The best advantages to be gained from trading  property rights are: Assets in stock can be turned to good  account and guide the redisposition of resources, allowing  assets whose supply exceeds demand or which are lying idle and  produce no economic returns to now flow to departments which  badly need them; highly competitive enterprises which produce  good economic returns can merge with uncompetitive enterprises  which produce poor economic returns; and all enterprises which  produce good economic returns can make the best use of their  assets and convert them into cash at all times, thereby  improving the economic returns of assets in society and ensuring  and increasing their value. However, under the restrictions of  a planned economy over a long period of time, relationships of  property rights are vaguely defined among enterprises in China;  large amounts of funds are lying idle because, unlike production  and management factors, property rights cannot circulate and  cannot be redisposed. As a result, the production structure of  the country and the scale and structure of enterprises are  extremely irrational; large amounts of state-owned assets are  lost; and enterprises produce low economic returns. According  to statistics by relevant departments, presently about one third  of state-owned assets throughout the country are lying idle,  produce low economic returns, or are being wasted at a high rate.    To promote the rational flow and restructuring of  enterprises' property rights in order to bring about the best  combination of resources and operating scale, we should put  assets in stock back into the productive cycle, improve the  operating structure of assets, eradicate the gap in securing  construction funds, and ensure appreciation while guarding  against depreciation of state-owned assets. Markets handling  property rights transactions began emerging in China in the  early 1980's. After a few years of development, the trading of  property rights has brought remarkable benefits to our national  economy, and is gradually becoming an important formula for  optimizing the disposal of state- owned assets under the  socialist market economic conditions. Statistics show that a  total of 6,900 or so Chinese enterprises were merged with other  enterprises throughout the 1980's, resulting in the transfer of  stock property worth over 8 billion yuan, a reduction of 4,095  loss-making enterprises, and a 522 million yuan reduction in the  amount of losses. The trading of property rights developed  further in the 1990's, bringing the accumulative total number of  annexed enterprises in the country to over 10,000. During the  past year, property rights trading markets in 16 cities --  including Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen --  witnessed the annexation or sale of a total of over 2,900  enterprises, the transfer of assets in stock worth over 6  billion yuan, and the relocation of more than 400,000 workers  and staff members. Since 1987, more than 1,000 loss-making  enterprises in Sichuan have been put back into business through  the trading of property rights after relocating more than 90,000  workers and staff members, transferring over 3 billion yuan  worth of assets in stock, and putting 2.3 billion yuan worth of  stagnant assets back into productive use. Shanghai carried out  property rights transfers on 151 industrial enterprises in 1990,  injecting 113,200 workers and staff members into key industries  for priority development, and gradually improving the operating  efficiency of fixed assets worth 2.8 billion yuan. In the first  half of 1993, 30 or so Beijing industrial enterprises without  any hope of getting out of the red were given new life after  being merged with other enterprises.    Following the emergence and gradual expansion of the trade  in  property rights, the establishment and perfection of a series of  relevant laws and regulations also began. So far, laws and  regulations--such as the "Bankruptcy Law," the "Company Law,"  the "Provisional Procedures for Enterprise Mergers," the  "Provisional Procedures for Selling Off Small State-Owned  Enterprises' Property Rights," the "Procedures for Administering  the Evaluation of State- Owned Property," and the "Regulations  for Transforming the Operating Mechanism of Industrial  Enterprises Owned by the Entire People"--have been promulgated  and implemented in the country, while other relevant laws and  regulations--such as the "Securities Law," the "Banking Law,"  and the "Provisions for Unemployment Insurance for Workers and  Staff Members in State-Owned Enterprises"--are currently being  drafted.    Economic circles believe that although the present trade in  property rights is still shaded with administrative intervention  and lacking standardization and fairness, it has played a  positive role in remolding and optimizing the combination of the  elements of production and in developing the productive forces.</p>

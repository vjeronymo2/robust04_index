			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / People: Rover Life in the motor trade can be terribly incestuous. No sooner has Rover chairman George Simpson taken the helm of Lucas Industries, than Bernard Carey, Lucas's director of corporate communications, announces that he is off to be Rover's top spin-doctor. Carey, 39, who started life as an economist with British Gas, moves to Rover next month to take over from John Pullen, 61, who is retiring. He gets a seat on the Rover board. Pullen, who has been at Rover for eight years, was brought over from British Shipbuilders by Sir Graham Day, a former chief executive of the state-owned shipbuilding business who was asked by the Government to sort out BL, Rover's predecessor. Carey was headhunted for the job but admits that he had a bit of a head start. Not only is Lucas one of Rover's major suppliers but it is based only three miles away from Rover's Solihull headquarters.</p>

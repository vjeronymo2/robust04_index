			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): When to take the money - Commuting your pension / Ought one to exchange part of a taxed pension for a tax-free lump sum? Most people do - and the Max factor provides a new incentive TO COMMUTE or not to commute? The question faces most people at retirement. It applies if they have contributed to a company pension scheme; or if, whether employed or self-employed, they are taking the benefits from an old retirement annuity contract or a new-style personal pension. Every person about to receive benefits from a private pension arrangement, whether his own or his employer's, has the attractive option of taking part of the benefits as a tax-free cash sum. More than 95 per cent take the cash, usually without a second thought. But are they making the right decision? There are four basic reasons why taking the cash can be a good choice: 1. In general, you are converting taxable income into tax-free cash - a conversion that must be favourable, particularly to higher-rate taxpayers. 2. Even if you need income at retirement, you can usually take the cash sum and buy an annuity that will provide a higher overall net income than taking the full pension benefits. 3. With the advent of independent taxation, although an individual cannot split his pension with his wife, he can transfer the cash sum to her to invest, usually saving tax in the process. 4. A pension is one family asset that cannot be passed on to the next generation. It dies with the husband and wife. But the cash sum can be taken, invested and added to the family estate, to be passed on in due course. There is also a further, less practical, attraction: commutation represents the only occasion in many people's lives when they can accumulate, at a stroke, a substantial capital sum, part of which can be spent on holidays or other extravagances that were just dreams while they were working. For many the reality of cash in the bank simply provides a feeling of security. The Maxwell saga has added a further dimension to taking the cash sum, for at least that part of the pension is secured, irrespective of what might subsequently happen to the scheme. It is to be hoped that the proposed reforms in pension legislation will secure the pension scheme assets against a rapacious employer. Even so, one should not take the cash sum automatically, but consider first the options available and then what one would do with the money. The commutation rules laid down by the Inland Revenue are different for personal pensions and company pensions. Personal pensions With personal pensions, old and new, the individual can effectively take the tax-free cash from the accumulated value of the pension contract, up to the Inland Revenue limits, and then buy an annuity with the remaining value. With new-style personal pensions, he can take up to 25 per cent of the accumulated value as tax-free cash. But with the old-style retirement annuity contracts, the cash limit is more complex - the amount of cash taken must not exceed three times the annual pension secured by the remaining value. Since annuity rates increase with age, the later the individual takes the benefits under the contract, the greater the proportion of the accumulated value that can be taken as tax-free cash. Also, since annuity rates are lower for women than for men at the same age, the cash limits are lower for women than for men. The decision whether to take the cash is straightforward for those who have contributed to personal pensions. The answer is almost certainly 'yes', even if they require maximum income. There are two types of annuity: an annuity purchased with the proceeds of a pension arrangement, known as a pension annuity; and an ordinary life annuity, known as a purchased life annuity, bought with other assets. Both types offer the same range of annuities - level, increasing, index-linked and so on. Pension annuity rates are slightly higher than ordinary annuity rates, but this is more than offset by the more favourable tax treatment of the annuity payments on an ordinary annuity. So, even if one needs the maximum income, it usually pays to take the cash sum and buy an ordinary annuity similar to the pension annuity bought with the remaining value. The Inland Revenue does not treat the investment of the tax-free cash sum as being from the proceeds of a pension contract. Company pensions Under company pension schemes, the mechanics of commutation are different. At retirement, an employee has the option of converting part of his or her pension into a tax-free cash sum. The Inland Revenue sets limits on the amount of tax-free cash that the employee can take, and three different limits are currently in operation. But for employees retiring with at least 20 years' service in the scheme, the maximum cash sum is one-and-a-half times the employee's earnings at or near retirement. The limits, including the earnings 'cap', imposed in recent years will affect employees who retire well into the future. The amount of pension given up to secure the required cash sum, known as the commutation factor, is determined by the scheme's actuary, taking into account mortality, investment returns and future pension increases. There is an overall Revenue limit on the commutation factor that can be used. A growing number of schemes now use unisex commutation factors. It is not easy to decide, on financial grounds alone, whether or not to commute. The employee should receive a benefit statement prior to retirement, showing full pension entitlement and the alternative maximum cash sum and reduced pension. So he can see how much pension is given up for the cash sum, though he may not know whether it is worth commuting. However, in most schemes the spouse's pension is not reduced by commuting. So an employee only has to judge the merits of the pension foregone during his or her own lifetime. A rough judgment can be made by checking what annuity on the employee's own life could be secured by the cash sum, and ascertaining whether this would replace the pension given up. However, this is not an easy exercise. The employee must compare like with like, and consider the cost of an annuity that would provide increases in payment similar to the expected increases in the underlying pension. Generally, taking the cash sum gives the employee flexibility and control over that part of his pension. But those approaching retirement ought to decide in advance what they intend to do with the cash - save it or spend it, or both. Above all, they need to think not only of the immediate future after retirement, but the likely situation when they reach their mid-70s - the so-called 'Fourth Age' - and may need every penny they possess to pay for care services. They may wish to invest the capital to produce income in their later years. Employees in public-sector pension schemes have a different decision to make. They receive, as part of the benefit structure, an automatic tax-free cash sum (maximum one-and-a half times final salary) and a reduced pension (maximum half final salary). This is broadly equivalent to the maximum pension of two-thirds of final salary provided by private-sector schemes. The decision for these employees is whether to use the cash sum to boost their pension - remembering that their pension receives annual increases linked to the rise in the retail price index and that index-linked annuities are expensive.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ALTERNATIVES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- For a man aged 65, with Pounds 100,000 available from his retirement annuity contracts  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      Net monthly income                                                            at 25% tax  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A: Invests the Pounds 100,000 in a level pension annuity, gross monthly income Pounds 1,120:                           Pounds 840  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- B: Takes the maximum cash of Pounds 30,536, and invests it in an ordinary purchased life annuity. Gross annual income (paid monthly) Pounds 3,964. This is divided into:  1, Capital content (tax-free)        Pounds 1,740  2, Interest content (subject to tax)        2,224     Tax at 25% on interest content            (556)     Net annual income                        3,408                  284 The remaining value of the contracts is used to buy a level pension annuity of Pounds 778 a month gross; net, at 25 per cent tax:                                                                583 Total monthly income:                                       Pounds  867  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thus, by taking the cash sum and investing it in an ordinary annuity, the individual has increased his monthly income by more than 3 per cent compared with investing all the value in a pension  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Equitable Life  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

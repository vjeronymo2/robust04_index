			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul District  Prosecution Wednesday summoned Yi Hak-pong, former chief  investigator of the defunct joint investigation division of the  Martial Law Command, as part of its probe into the Dec. 12,  1979, "coup d'etat-like incident."    The prosecutors probed into how and why Yi apprehended on  Dec. 12 Gen. Chong Sung-hwa, former Army Chief of Staff and  martial law commander, on suspicion of abetting a rebellion  despite an earlier announcement by the joint investigation  division that Gen. Chong had no link with the assassination of  former President Pak Chong-hui on Oct. 26, 1979. Yi was then  serving as director of the division's investigation bureau.    Proceeding to the prosecution, Yi told reporters he took  Chong to the investigation office at that time "to question him  in connection with the Oct. 26 incident," adding that he had  brought with him documents proving the suspicions about Chong.    Yi replied "groundless" when asked to comment on Gen.  Chong's  assertion that he had undergone water torture by investigators  of the Defense Security Command's Sobingo Branch in Seoul.    The prosecution, meanwhile, will summon former Defense  Minister Choe Se-chang on Friday for similar reasons.</p>

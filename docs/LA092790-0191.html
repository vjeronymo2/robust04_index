			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONTARIO AIRPORT CHIEF MAKES NOISE ABOUT STOPOVERS;  </P> <P> REGULATIONS: SAYS REFUELING PRACTICE IS ANOTHER CASE OF ORANGE COUNTY UNLOADING  ITS PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE. JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT MANAGER SAYS SHE'S HEARD NO  COMPLAINTS.  </P> <P> Ontario International Airport Manager Michael Digirolamo said Wednesday a  decision by several airlines to stop for refueling there in order to take off  more quietly from John Wayne Airport is another example of how Orange County  transfers its problems elsewhere.  </P> <P> "We're getting dumped on by Orange County again," he said. "We're kind of upset  about it."  </P> <P> The unscheduled stops came to light this week when Seattle-based Alaska  Airlines officials admitted that they were landing Seattle and Portland-bound  flights there for refueling after taking off from John Wayne. The purpose was  to comply with Orange County's noise restrictions -- the heavier the plane, the  more engine thrust is needed at liftoff.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Digirolamo said that other airlines occasionally refuel at  Ontario too, including Trans World Airlines, whose officials could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Most airlines, however, bump passengers or reduce seat sales to shed takeoff  weight at John Wayne.  </P> <P> Digirolamo said Ontario shouldn't have to adopt noise limits because of extra  air traffic generated by Orange County.  </P> <P> "It also affects our ability to use our capacity for passenger service here,"  he said. "During the refueling stops these airlines are not picking up any of  our passengers. They just stop and go."  </P> <P> Because Orange County bars cargo jets from using John Wayne, Ontario is already  being used to satisfy much of Orange County's air freight needs, Digirolamo  said.  </P> <P> It's one thing to do this for north Orange County passengers and freight, which  is close by, he added. But some of Ontario's air traffic is coming from  southern Orange County too, only because Orange County is pushing its air  traffic problems on surrounding counties.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, officials in San Bernardino and Riverside counties  complained that Orange County was trying to dump its airport and jail  overcrowding problems on its neighbors because of proposals to locate new  Orange County facilities in their areas.  </P> <P> But Orange County officials have argued that urban problems are regional and  deserve regional solutions.  </P> <P> John Wayne Airport Manager Jan Mittermeier, on her second day in that post,  said Wednesday that she would not respond to Digirolamo's comments because he  had not complained directly to her or other Orange County officials.  </P> <P> "He'll have to talk to us if he has a problem," Mittermeier said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, county and Federal Aviation Administration officials said it was not  within their jurisdictions to restrict airlines from making unscheduled stops  on their routes.  </P> <P> "We don't handle that," said FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke. "There are no  regulations I know of that affect this."  </P> <P> That is little solace to passengers such as Kathleen Bernauer of Newport Beach,  who said Wednesday that on a recent TWA flight to St. Louis, the crew did not  announce the stopover in Ontario until the plane had left the gate.  </P> <P> "I asked them if they were going to hold our connecting flights for us,"  Bernauer said, "and the reply was, 'No, we don't do that.' "  </P> <P> Bernauer said she later applied by telephone for extra frequent flier miles  because of the stopover in Ontario. "They flat out denied that TWA does this  (refueling stops)," she explained. "They didn't believe me. That really ticks  you off and it makes me very determined to fly other airlines."  </P> <P> Another passenger who contacted The Times said that on a Sept. 4 flight to St.  Louis, TWA's pilot announced that, because of head winds, they might have to  stop for fuel somewhere, provoking sarcastic banter among passengers about over  which city or state the plane would run out of fuel.  </P> <P> Alaska Airlines officials said they began notifying pre-booked passengers in  advance about the Ontario stopover a few days ago. The stopover is expected to  be eliminated when a new time period for measuring airport noise begins Oct. 1.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Guarded praise for Clarke's balancing act - City reaction Reaction to the Budget in the City was dominated by praise for the chancellor's skill in raising revenue without imposing damaging new taxes and relief at his decision to leave the taxation of pension funds unchanged. But there was scepticism as to whether his proposed cuts in public spending could be achieved. Most City commentators thought that the Budget had done nothing to harm confidence, and opened the way for further interest rate cuts in the first half of next year. Even the insurance sector gave it a broad welcome, despite its disappointment at the 3 per cent tax on general premiums. The new investment incentives - such as the Enterprise Investment Scheme - were seen as marginal initiatives to boost private investment. Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, a former Treasury adviser to Mr Norman Lamont and now chief executive of Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, said: 'The markets are clearly relieved that there has been no change in the taxation of pension funds, which would have hit funds badly when surpluses are falling.' He said reaction to the tax changes was 'generally favourable, except for those sectors - particularly insurance - most directly affected.' However, he voiced scepticism about whether the public spending cutbacks could be achieved, 'particularly in the 'out years' of the three-year horizon sketched out'. Mr Andrew Jones, national tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young, gave the Budget a cautious welcome but said the chancellor was risking everything on economic recovery. 'He has only avoided massive tax increases by assuming that he can deliver more rigorous control of public expenditure than ever before. By pinning all his hopes on reduced spending, he has placed a huge strain on the government's project management skills.' Mr David Rough, investments director at Legal &amp; General, said Mr Clarke had made a 'very competent impression' in the City, and had raised 'serious prospects' of another half point off base rates within three months. 'There were no shocks, and he has done nothing to harm confidence.' However, he was 'disappointed' at the 3 per cent tax on general insurance premiums and predicted a move to personal self-insurance as a result. City stories, Pages 22, 24</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nam Yu-chol: "Even If Nuclear Issues Were </F> Resolved, North-South Economic Cooperation Is Far Away"]    [Text] Expectations and concern over the North-South  economic cooperation are mounting again now that a hint of a  solution of North Korea's nuclear issue can be seen. This is  because it is expected that in the case that North Korea's  nuclear issues were completely resolved, the actual improvement  of North-South relations would bring a brisk North-South  economic cooperation. The government has even revealed on  several occasions that if the nuclear issues were resolved, it  would press ahead with economic cooperation with North Korea. A  government official said that "entrepreneurs have already  telephoned the government authorities to ask about the  procedures for visiting North Korea."    The general expectation that the solution of the nuclear  issues will lay a foundation for North-South dialogue and, then,  this would bring a brisk North-South economic cooperation is  confirmed in the stock markets. As foreign news reports that  progress is being made in the U.S.-North Korean negotiations  over the nuclear issues are coming out everyday, stock markets  have been vibrant with the dealings of stocks related with  business with northern countries from the beginning of the new  year.    However, the view of business circles and experts is  overwhelmingly cautious over the era "after the nuclear issues  are resolved." They believe that even if nuclear issues were  resolved, to think that North-South economic cooperation would  be brisk is yet premature. Many experts believe that a  full-fledged North-South economic cooperation, which requires  the considerable improvement in political relations, will take a  lot of time.    By analyzing data, the Korean Trade Promotion Corporation  [Kotra] has recently estimated that even if North Korea were to  open up, it is very likely that its opening policy may incline  toward the U.S. or Japanese sides rather than the ROK side. The  KOTRA held that because economic cooperation with the ROK has  been stagnant for the past two years, North Korea has worked out  a policy of turning the direction of economic cooperation to the  United States and Japan. There is a view that the abrupt  dismissal of Kim Tal-hyon, former vice premier and chairman of  the State Planning Committee, last December was a strategy to  exclude the ROK enterprises from bringing foreign investments in  the future. Kim Tal-hyon, who held actual power out of those  favoring opening, was a channel for most ROK enterprises to  promote North-South economic cooperation. A conglomerate's  official, who is in charge of business with North Korea, said  that "there will be great difficulties in trade with North Korea  as a result of Kim's dismissal."    Experts point out that, in addition to the fact that North  Korea's investment legislation, systems, and other investment  conditions are not tangible and are incomplete, there are still  many stumbling blocks to full-fledgedly investing in North Korea  in light of pure economics. An official from business circles  said: "Many believe that to think that if North Korea's nuclear  issues were resolved North-South economic cooperation would  proceed smoothly, is a very simplistic idea. North Korea does  not want the ROK enterprises to independently enter the Najin  and Sonbong free trade districts." This bespeaks that the  solution of the nuclear issue means North Korea's return to the  time when it had not withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty.  <H3>  Holding Investment-Explanation Meetings in the United  States, Europe, and Hong Kong </H3>   However, there is a view that because the issue of  establishing diplomatic relations with the United States and  Japan is being discussed in connection with the solution of  nuclear issues, the solution of North Korea's nuclear issues  will bring about a change at a new level. In particular,  because North Korea admitted its failure in its economic fields  and is making positive efforts to attract foreign investment,  the expectation that there is a new turn in North-South economic  cooperation in the near future is mounting. That is, even though  this may take time, if the ROK assumes a farsighted attitude,  North Korea will be eventually forced to come out and improve  relations through economic cooperation. Kim To-hyang,  researcher of the Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute,  said that "North Korea may try to exclude the ROK enterprises  and to trade with foreign enterprises for the time being to  maintain its system. However, it is difficult for North Korea  to exclude the ROK enterprises on a mid- and long-term basis."  It is believed that it is actually difficult for North Korea to  trade with foreign enterprises alone because North Korea has no  special attractions for foreign enterprises to invest there.    It is difficult to predict the position North Korea will  assume in the economic exchange with the ROK. North Korea  enacted for the first time in 1984 the joint venture  legislation, which stipulates the regulations on joint venture  with foreign enterprises. Since then, North Korea has steadily  attempted to attract foreign capital. North Korea has made more  contacts with foreign enterprises than the ROK experts thought.  North Korea held investment-explanation meetings in the United  States and Europe early last year. Kim Chong-u, vice chairman  of the External Economic Committee, personally held an  investment-explanation meeting in Hong Kong last September.  According to informed sources, it is said that he will visit  China and East Asia to promote foreign investments.    (Tony Misel), representative of a British consulting  company,  who personally held an investment-explanation meeting in Hong  Kong last September, revealed that approximately 30 enterprises,  which were then banned from investing in North Korea, attended  the meeting. He said his clients are interested in investing in  North Korea and added that the enterprises are global  multinational ones, ranking among the world's top 500  enterprises selected every year by the U.S. economic magazine  FORTUNE.    Of course, even though they are interested in investing in  North Korea they will not all invest in North Korea at once. An  official in Hong Kong, who attended the Hong Kong  investment-explanation meeting, said that "Out of the  enterprises attending the investment-explanation meeting,  practically no enterprises will actually invest in North Korea."  For example, Nestle, a Swiss multinational foodstuffs company,  has reviewed for a few years the possibility of investing in  North Korea, but it has not invested anything there. The  official in Hong Kong said that the greatest concern of most  foreign enterprises on investing in North Korea is the concern  the management of the multinational enterprises have in looking  at the next 20-30 years.    An official of Germany's East Asian Association (OAV),  established to promote exchanges between German enterprises and  24 Asian-Pacific countries, including North Korea, revealed  that: "Some German conglomerates and small- and medium-sized  enterprises have concluded contracts with North Korea recently.  However, the amount of money is not large. The contracts were  to provide machine parts mainly exported by the former East  Germany." The official, who refused to be identified, said  during a telephone interview that "The main reason trade between  Germany and North Korea does not increase is that North Korea  lacks hard currency." North Korea is currently indebted with a  considerable number of German enterprises. Frequently, many  enterprises from European countries, including Sweden which has  promoted relatively brisk economic exchanges with North Korea,  keep dealing with North Korea because of the loans that North  Korea has not paid back.  <H3>  There have been approximately 160 investments, at the most,  that North Korea has attracted between 1984 and 1992 </H3>   Samsung Economic Research Institute estimated that since  North Korea enacted the joint venture law in September 1984,  North Korea has attracted approximately 160 foreign investments,  at the most, by the end of May 1992. It is said that most of  the 160 foreign investments were the result of investments made  by pro-General Association of the Korean Residents in Japan  enterprises and by U.S.-resident Korean compatriots. The  research institute views that, comparing North Korea's  investment conditions with those of China and Vietnam, North  Korea's competitiveness is not strong. Kal Yong-sung, senior  researcher of the Samsung Economic Research Institute, analyzed  that "North Korea's efforts to attract investment may draw  attention in view of its taxation system but other conditions  are worse." He affirmed that "it is almost impossible for North  Korea to succeed in attracting investments through its current  methods." He held that even though foreign investments of all  kinds seem to be possible in view of the legislation, North  Korea's strategy for attracting investments greatly favors a  joint venture-type processing-for-wages-trade work [hapchak  hyongtaeui imgagong saop], which prevents foreign investors from  having actual management and ownership rights. Japanese experts  point out that the worsening of North Korea's energy shortages  is another barrier. North Korea's efforts to attract Western  refinery companies in Najin and Sonbong free trade districts  will be impossible without a steady supply of electricity.    The tangible economic line of Hong Sok-hyong,  newly-appointed chairman of North Korea's State Planning  Committee equivalent to the minister of the ROK Economic and  Planning Board, has yet to be revealed. Experts believe that  North Korea's line to positively promote foreign investment in  Najin and Sonbong free trade districts will not be changed.  North Korea has positively promoted the construction of Najin  and Sonbong free trade districts as a part of the Tumen  development work led by the UN Development Program (UNDP),  because North Korea views that this is the best way to realize  its two targets, maintaining its system and earning foreign  currency. In particular, since it is the United States that has  actually promoted the UNDP behind the scenes, it is much clearer  that North Korea has more significantly promoted this work in a  bid to realize its greatest target of improving relations with  the United States.    North Korea has conducted economic projects six times since  the fifties. However, there has not been a time when North  Korea officially admitted its failure of attaining its target.  Nevertheless, on last 8 December, North Korea admitted, for the  first time since the Republic was founded, it had failed to  attain the target of the Third Seven-Year Plan (87-93). North  Korea itself made a report that the production increase rate on  a yearly average remained at 5.6 percent, much lower than its  target of 7.9 percent. However, the ROK experts view that North  Korea has actually not attained 40 percent of its target. North  Korea's economy is officially in a difficult situation.</p>

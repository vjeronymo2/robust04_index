			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhirinovskiy, Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia  [LDPR] leader, intends to take a trip to Iraq in October on  invitation from the Arab Social Revival Party, Interfax was  informed by the press secretary of the LDPR in the State Duma  Grigoriy Serebryanikov.    He noted that along with Zhirinovskiy, several other members  of the lower house of parliament also intend to make the trip.    According to Serebryanikov, Zhirinovskiy sent U.S President  Clinton a letter which informed that a plane with Russian  parliamentarians would land in Baghdad, at the Iraqi capital's  airport. Serebryanikov explained that this was done so that a  desire to "shoot down the airplane" does not creep up on the  Americans.</p>

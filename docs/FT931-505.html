			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Forum chief unruffled by critics' sniping SIR Allen Sheppard, the outspoken chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, is unconcerned at sniping over the two private-sector organisations he chairs to promote the interests of London. One, London First, aims to harness business leadership and management skills in strategic thinking about the capital's future. The other, London Forum, yesterday revealed plans to promote London as a business and tourist centre. But some opposition politicians are concerned that the government sees the bodies as a substitute for an elected authority for London. There has also been criticism from bodies such as the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, which feel that such newcomers are muscling in on their work. 'It shows that we're getting somewhere,' says Sir Allen. 'I would have expected downright hostility. If it's just scepticism we face, we're making progress.' He adds: 'What we have to convince people of is that we can bring extra support from the business community for what is already going on.' Sir Allen is unruffled by accusations that he is not accountable. He points out that the reputation of GrandMet is linked to his performance as chairman of the two bodies. 'If we get things wrong, it will be very bad news for GrandMet. 'Consumer capitalism means that our customers now look through our brands at what the company stands for. I am answerable to them through the Pounds 1m they vote for our products every hour of the day.' He also believes that business executives can help in the switch from what he calls 'they-ism' to 'we-ism'. Sir Allen says: 'We used to spend much of the time saying that 'they' ought to tackle certain issues. We never found out who 'they' were. During the 1980s, 'we' began to emerge - companies, consumers, pressure groups etc. Business is part of that and can make an input into solving problems.' The two organisations hope to contribute to the debate over London's infrastructure, which is widely agreed to be central to the capital's international competitiveness. One of the first challenges to the clout of the bodies will be CrossRail, the proposed east-to-west rail link. The government has asked for the scheme to be re-examined to see if private finance can be introduced. 'We can't take sides over the merits of one bit of infrastructure over another,' says Sir Allen. 'But we must make sure that the government knows the business community sees CrossRail as a priority. And we can get together some of the best brains in the City to see how the financing can be made to work.' Mr Stephen O'Brien, chief executive of both organisations, is happy to be judged by results. He says: 'If after five years things have happened which otherwise would not have happened, I would regard that as a success.'</p>

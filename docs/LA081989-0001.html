			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONCERT YAHOOS  </P> <P> Reviewer Chris Willman was right on the mark in describing the disruptive  "beer-guzzling yahoo" element in the audience at Jackson Browne's Aug. 12  Amphitheater concert ("Browne Proves There's Plenty on His Mind," Aug. 14).  </P> <P> But Willman was far too kind. Do these loud, obnoxious clods (who should be  confined to arena shows) really believe that anyone wants to hear them jabber  during songs and whistle and scream every time the performer takes a breath  between songs?  </P> <P> It had been more than 10 years since my wife and I had seen Browne. At one  time, he could talk between songs and quiet piano solos could be performed  without some jerk shrieking.  </P> <P> But that was way back, when audiences were still listening.  </P> <P> PERRY MIYAKE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Banks fail to woo Midland investors INSTITUTIONAL investors in Midland Bank yesterday gave a chilly response to a briefing for shareholders designed to build support for the bank's acquisition by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Shareholders said they were disturbed by the absence of specific figures on cost savings from the merger, and the lack of detail on the Pounds 190m charge intended to cover rationalisation costs. In the joint briefing, Midland chairman Mr Brian Pearse, Mr John Gray, deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings, Hongkong Bank's parent, and Mr Bernard Asher, a director on both banks' boards, sought to persuade shareholders of the advantages of the proposed Pounds 3.1bn takeover. They emphasised the benefits for shareholders of owning a company likely to gain from growing Asian trade with the west and the synergies to be created by the takeover. Mr Pearse also told shareholders, without mentioning Lloyds Bank by name, that monopolies officials would be likely to veto a takeover between two UK banks and that such a takeover would be likely to produce fewer cost savings than imagined. However, institutions said that in addition to disappointment over the price they are being offered for their shares, they were chary of the multinational bank to be created by the takeover. They believe HSBC's desire to acquire Midland reflects its fears about political stability of its home market after 1997. In the City, opinion was divided over whether fund managers would accept HSBC's terms announced this week and over whether Lloyds Bank or another bidder would make a rival bid. 'I think it is basically a done deal,' said Mr Mike Fesemeyer at Nomura Research Institute. There was thin trading in Midland shares in London, and the shares closed at 364p, down 1p on the day. The Kuwait Investment Office again failed to find buyers for 60m Midland shares placed on the market yesterday, though it is believed to have received interest from buyers for about a third of the shares. HSBC's shares rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.25 yesterday, increasing the value of its all-paper bid by 7.7p to 385.7p per Midland share. Hong Kong banking sector, Page 30</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORE CITY JOB SEEKERS TO FACE DRUG SCREENING  </P> <P> In an expansion of San Diego's drug-testing program, applicants for more than  half of the 9,000-plus city government jobs -- particularly those involving  operating hazardous equipment or driving city vehicles -- will be screened for  illegal drug use.  </P> <P> Under action taken Thursday by the city's Civil Service Commission, the city's  drug-screening program, which now covers about 3,000 employees in 30 job  classifications, will be expanded to 165 job categories occupied by more than  4,500 workers, according to Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory.  </P> <P> The program, which already applies to employees such as police officers,  firefighters, trash collectors and lifeguards, will be expanded to cover dozens  of other jobs ranging from groundskeepers, roofers and divers to airport  workers, building inspectors and parking enforcement officers.  </P> <P> Employees affected by the change are those who work in jobs that require them  to drive while on city business, operate hazardous equipment, provide support  work for public safety activities, handle controlled substances or work near  traffic.  </P> <P> The expanded drug-screening is designed to minimize dangers to the public and  other city workers posed by employees performing hazardous jobs while under the  influence of illegal drugs, city administrators said.  </P> <P> "Our principal objective is to get a drug-free workplace," McGrory said. "One  of the best ways to accomplish that is to screen out anyone with a drug problem  before he becomes part of the work force."  </P> <P> Applicants whose tests reveal any illegal drugs in their blood or urine will be  automatically rejected, McGrory explained.  </P> <P> Although the Civil Service Commission has considered also applying the new  rules to current city workers, existing employees will not be subject to the  widened testing program pending negotiations between city administrators and  labor unions over the next month.  </P></p>

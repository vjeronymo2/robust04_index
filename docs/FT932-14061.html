			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / NZ body seeks new powers New Zealand's new takeover panel has recommended that it be given sweeping powers to protect shareholders, especially minority interests, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. In a recommendation to parliament it urges that legislation be passed which includes requiring anyone who acquires 20 per cent of the voting rights of a company to make an offer for the rest of the shares at the same price. At present, companies or individuals are able to buy shares in a target company at different prices until they gain control of a majority of the shares.</p>

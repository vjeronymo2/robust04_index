			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Despite the opinions of most political groups, the  legislative opposition, the Prosecutor General's Office, the  Lima Bar Association, and the chief justice of the Supreme Court  himself, the president has promulgated and published in EL  PERUANO the controversial Law on Venue Dispute [Ley Sobre  Contienda de Competencia], which in this case transfers the La  Cantuta case to military courts.    Congressmen in the majority, whom the opposition have  accused  of violating the independence of the Judicial Branch, broke  their silence through authorized spokesman Carlos Torres y  Torres Lara, who justified the law and explained that in the end  the criminal court may or may not abide by its contents.    Opposition legislators reiterated their willingness to  struggle in Congress and the Judicial Branch to repeal the  aforementioned law.    Amid a great deal of controversy and severe criticism, the  executive promulgated and published in the official newspaper  the law eliminating the vote that settles venue disputes, thus  establishing that the La Cantuta case will be settled in a  military court.    Progovernment Legislator Carlos Torres y Torres said he is  confident of a fair sentence by the military court and added  that the provision is aimed at protecting the magistrates of the  Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court, the body that will now  decide whether this provision will be implemented.    [Begin recording] [Carlos Torres y Torres] The law has been  published, therefore it must be implemented. It is now up to  the Supreme Court of Justice, which must take note of the case  and take the action it deems appropriate.    [Unidentified reporter] Can the Criminal Chamber discard  this  provision?    [Torres y Torres] Well, state branches are independent,  consequently, the judicial branch may take whatever action it  deems appropriate. [end recording]    The first protests were not long in coming.    [Begin Popular Christian Party, PPC, Congressman Antero  Florez recording] The legislative wing of the PPC has just  presented a draft bill repealing the promulgation of the law,  which unduly transfers the La Cantuta case to military courts.  Second, the PPC-sponsored bill declares that the article of the  Judicial Branch Basic Law requiring four votes to pass a  resolution instead of three remains in effect. [end recording]    Opposition members met privately this afternoon and agreed  to  present tomorrow morning an amparo writ against Law 26-291,  arguing that it is intended to protect the perpetrators of the  La Cantuta crime.    [Begin unidentified opposition representative recording] It  is a law with a specific purpose: to violate the independence  of the Judicial Branch. It is a law intended to dodge  previously established procedures to protect the real  perpetrators of crimes. [end recording]</p>

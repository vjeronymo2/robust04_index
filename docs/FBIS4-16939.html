			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatol Plugaru, former minister of national </F> security of the Republic of Moldova, by Iulian Chifu, place and  date not given: "The Solution for the Conflict in Dniester  Region Is To Establish a NATO Base on the Other Bank of the  Dniester River"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Political Race Follows Its Course </H5>   [Chifu] Mr. Plugaru, your activity has been closely  connected with the period of the war in the Dniester region.  How come that the Republic of Moldova became divided into two  parts?    [Plugaru] The site where God places us becomes an advantage  only when we know how to make use of it, the way in, which, for  example, Stefan cel Mare [ruler of Moldova in the 15th century]  did. If we do not do it, others will make use of it in their  own interests, the way Russia did in the past and continues to  do today. When it became clear that the "union" with Russia  will not live long, some wise Russians found the way to calm  down the "display of sovereignty." Thus, the malady called the  Moldovan Dniester Republic appeared on the banks of the Dniester  River and it finds solid support in the 14th Russian Army.  There was much dispute on the issue of this strip of land, just  like in all the other places where the Russians are not pleased  with the locals. The Russians consider all the locals to be bad  sorts. The Russians believe that their rights are violated,  they are oppressed, they are not bosses everywhere, and on top  of it, they are asked to speak the language of the locals. The  Russians are not used to all this. If the world is not good,  the world has to be changed, because all those Moldovans,  Georgians, Latvians, and others are demanding too much. While in  Russia -- the country that has assumed the responsibility to  protect all of them from good or from evil, throughout this  "immense homeland," and the country that has suffered from birth  of an insatiable hunger for foreign lands -- the great political  race is in full swing and each participant in the race wants to  acquire more and more land for Russia. We have to accept the  thought that Russia can be led only by those who become the  winners in this race, which might also be called chauvinism.  Because all those who do not practice chauvinism have no place  in the Olympus of the Russian leadership. Everything that is  happening in the world today speaks of Russia's increasingly  aggressive and unstoppable intention to preserve what it  conquered in the past and to gain new spheres of influence.  Thus, it is clear that the Dniester region as well as other  areas where Russia has its own interest will still suffer if no  cure is found soon to this malady.    [Chifu] What is the role of the 14th Army in Dniester? Who  are the enemies from whom this Army has to defend the Russian  Federation in Tiraspol?    [Plugaru] No mater how strange it seems, and although the  big politics are not made in Chisinau, all the cure that we need  can be found here at home. First of all I am referring to our  location, since we are at the crossroads of the world. We must  understand that this place is suitable for all kind of  exercises, military occupation, coups, counter-coups, and for  the utilization of all kinds of weapons aimed in all directions;  certainly, all this in the name and interest of Russia. We can  also notice that the 14th Army faces a beautiful and prosperous  country that is called Turkey, with which Russia has been  "friends" for centuries on end.    I am not familiar with Russia's military doctrine and its  secret plans, thus I do not know whom it has in mind for the  role of the next most-probable adversary. However, I know very  well that, still, in the time of the Soviet Union, nobody in the  Command of the South-West Armies, located in Chisinau, was  concealing for whom the missiles in our forests, the planes in  Marculesti and Bolgrad, the airborne troops in Chisinau, the  means of communication, and all the other facilities of the 14th  Army were meant. Greece is not too far away either, not to  speak of Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, or Italy. I do not believe  that these countries feel too much at ease knowing that General  Lebed [head of the 14th Army] is in Dniester -- who initially  promised to hang all the Moldovan leaders -- or knowing that  there is a loony in Russia's State Duma who wants to wash his  boots not only in the Mediterranean, but also in the Indian  Ocean [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy]. Or, maybe they put their hope in  the one who recently chided Nixon, because he thought they were  sitting and having a drink [Yeltsin]. Poor of him, he could  hardly stand. And just think that he has access to the button  that can destroy the world.    One can hear rumors that he will be demoted soon. Let them  do it, it is their problem. But what if the loony comes to  power? Needless to say that these people were not appointed and  did not seize power, but were elected by and are dear to tens of  millions of Russians. As far as Lebed is concerned, I believe  that due to his outstanding qualities, he will advance in  position and will be soon one of the leaders of Russia's Armed  Forces. And if what he does is called saving Russia, we have to  expect other promotions as well.    The State of Neutrality Is Convenient If You Have Means With  Which To Defend Yourself [subhead]    [Chifu] Nevertheless, what solution do you see to these  problems? How do you think that the current leadership in  Moldova and the West should act?    [Plugaru] I believe that one of the solutions would be to  establish a modern military base on the other bank of the  Dniester River. Whose base should that be? Whoever you wish,  because in our situation it is the same for us. Certainly, the  country with which we have the best understanding should have  priority, but at the same time, that country should have  everything necessary to make the presence of the Russian troops  in this part of Moldova unnecessary. I believe that the most  suitable country would be Turkey. It has the means and the  reason, and it is also familiar with these places... However,  it is essential for us to open our doors and tell the whole  world what our problem is. A part of the world will get scared,  others will decide against getting involved, and others, who  have the means with which to face Russia, you can be sure will  come and will even thank us. Probably, the country or the  groups of countries that will accept the proposal, will  establish a base in two-three months and will bring over  everything that they need. It is Russia that should worry about  the rest.    [Chifu] Recently, the Republic of Moldova signed the  Partnership for Peace. How does this act match all that you  have suggested and the neutrality for which people voted on 6  March at the same time when the opinion poll "What People  Advise" was held?    [Plugaru] We will have to be patient with the already  proclaimed neutrality, because we have no other choice.  Neutrality is fine, but only when you have means with which to  defend yourself, or you have guarantees that somebody is ready  to defend you. It is not sufficient, and even dangerous, to  limit ourselves to measures such as Partnership for Peace. All  these things for which you have to pay nothing, will result in  nothing. Such things are good, but they mean only a first step,  nothing else, and only as long as Russia does not do anything  foolish. Those who invented the idea of the Partnership for  Peace meant well, but you see, Russia did not like it, it does  not like to be isolated, so it came at once to sit at the big  table. We should not have illusions that this would ensure the  preservation of peace in the region. Were we not members of the  United Nations when Russia, a member of the same organization,  attacked us in summer 1992 in Dniester? Europe and the new  world have signed, and will still continue to sign, alliances,  blocs, pacts, and all kinds of treaties but, ever since the  world began, the powerful ones were the ones who started wars.  People like us were witnesses, victims, or were simply ignored.  Certainly you can feel like the United States and Japan, or can  even look like them, but this will not make you stronger. Power  has always been and will continue to be decisive. And the  powerful ones know each other. Thus, we should not rail against  relations with Russia. Although nobody can rely on today's  Russia -- it does not know itself what is happening to it --  however, willingly or unwillingly, we have to accept friendship  with it because we have no other choice. But to completely lose  our self-esteem, the way Russia wants, is not possible either.  If we preserve out self-esteem and we want the world to respect  us, we should know how to convey to Russia the message to forget  its intentions. That is what I meant when I talked about a  small military base to oppose the Tiraspol base.    [Chifu] How will Russia react to such an initiative?    [Plugaru] Officially, it has no say in it because it is our  own business with whom we associate and what we do at home, and  Russia's borders are far away from us. Certainly, it would try  to stop us by putting pressure on those who make decisions on  such matters. Nevertheless, in the end it will accept it  because there are countries in this world with which Russia is  compelled to speak with respect and with much deference. Apart  from that, it might be possible that the separatist tendencies  that have engulfed Russia will inevitably lead to its  dismantlement and, one day, when it has no time to think about  the Dniester region, it will have to give up this region. What  we are suggesting will help Russia to reach this conclusion  sooner. At the same time, we do not really have a choice, there  are not that many variations from which we can choose or that  many ways in which to cut the Gordian Knot.  <H5>  Mature Countries Are No Longer Fighting, They Are </H5> Distributing Weapons to Others    [Chifu] The Republic of Moldova is currently holding  negotiations for the withdrawal of the 14th Army from its  territory. What will be the fate of that army?    [Plugaru] All these negotiation for the withdrawal of the  14th Army, unconditionally or on certain conditions, have been  both this year and the year before, just talks held in vain.  These negotiations have to be held because there is nothing  better to do and Russia has to be told every day that it is  occupying a part of our land and that it has to gather in all  those weapons that it distributed to bandits. Nevertheless,  ultimately the negotiations will not lead to the withdrawal of  the 14th Army. It cannot happen because it is at variance with  Russia's strategic interests. It does not matter that today the  nature of wars has changed somehow, namely rich countries are no  longer fighting but rather distributing weapons to others,  leaving them to shoot each other and then, it can purchase what  is left for peanuts. Mature countries are conquering new  territories, new assets, however not through military operations  but economic ones. In our case, the importance of military  operations is still topical because Russia has not reached the  stage of economic operations. It is just training at the  expense of the former Soviet republics.    Thus, Russia will not leave so easily and so soon. You can  rest assured that if today Russia's reason for staying is that  it has to preserve peace in this area and defend Russians from  who knows whom, tomorrow, when it becomes clear for everybody  that this is just an excuse not to leave this area, it will  invent another excuse. And how could Russia possible leave?  While it stays in the Dniester region, it does what it wants in  the Republic of Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine. Even in Ukraine,  a country that allowed the separatists to emerge and flourish.  The affirmation that, all this time while we were occupied,  including the time of the conflict, Ukraine has been neutral or  even helped us, is pure demagogy. As a matter of fact, Ukraine  refused to open the joint border crossing points that would have  been more useful for both sides and that would have isolated the  criminals in Tiraspol from the whole world. Certainly, the  separatists and the 14th Army would not have dared fire at these  joint points because they would have started a war with Ukraine.  But, to our great regret, Ukraine certainly remained "neutral"  only in words, because everything that emerged from Dniester on  land, water, or air, crossed Ukraine.    [Chifu] Nevertheless, how does Ukraine view the presence  of the 14th Army, under conditions of dissent with Russia on the  issue of Black Sea fleet and especially the Crimea region?    [Plugaru] Ukraine feels the real pain in its Western side.  It feels that it will hear the noise of shooting from those  weapons that were crossing the "neutral" Ukraine. Only God  knows how much military technology has been collected in  Dniester region. From this place the Russians do what they want  with Romania. Because I have to tell you truthfully, the 14th  Army has modern systems of electronic radio espionage devices.  They are working hard on systems to intercept telephone  connections from a distance, and there are other devices for  stealing information in general, because this part in territory  of the Republic of Moldova is a wonderful intermediary base for  the activity of Russian secret services. From what other part  could Russia's security services come closer to Moldova or  Romania? Its agents feel in their element in this part of the  world. There are practically no serious restrictions that might  hamper their free circulation on the  Russia-Tiraspol-Chisinau-Bucharest route. It does not matter  anymore what depth into Romania Lebed's technology reached.  <H5>  Romania Should Never Forget Where the Policy Promoted by </H5> King Carol II Led    [Chifu] What is Romania's role in this region?    [Plugaru] I believe that, first of all, we should ask the  question: Is Russia indeed the country that wants a stronger  and independent Greater Romania? If the answer is yes, then  long live Russia and the 14th Army. But what if the answer is  no? How can we face it? What is our army today and what can it  do? What is the Romanian Army compared to Russia's and when did  Russia produce the weapons that Romania's armed forces are using  today? I do not believe that the recent replacement of General  Spiroiu [former Romanian defense Minister] is connected with the  answer to this question, just as it has no connection with the  other changes that took place in Bucharest. New commotion and  turmoil in the structures that must ensure state security never  led to anything good. However, if too much garbage has been  collected, it is good to dispose of it, otherwise it will  dispose of you. However, Romania must never forget where the  policy promoted by King Carol II led. If one wishes for the  country to be united at home, one should take into account what  is happening around it. It is not possible that one has no  trustworthy allies.    [Chifu] You said that "they cannot make us unite." Are you  in favor of unification?    [Plugaru] Mr. Chifu, one cannot just foolishly shout  "unification" without knowing the answer to a few questions in  advance: What is Russia's attitude and possible reaction? What  will the Hungarians and Bulgarians do? What will Ukraine say,  although it is in a state of discord with Russia? Who would  benefit from a united Romania? Which of the superpowers will  support us? And who will want to stop us? It is important to  know things, not only to wish for them and also to be able to  act, not only today but tomorrow too, and even in the most  unfavorable circumstances. If you do not exactly know what you  are doing and you are just feeling your way, then it does not  matter whether you are a lunatic or insane person, or somebody  just got hold of you and you are working for him. No one can  invent a greater disfavor than this for Romania, for the  Republic of Moldova, and for Romanians in general. It is not bad  to wish for something and dream about it. What I said does not  refer to honest people, who do have great aspirations and who  act according to their feelings, because they believe that is  the normal thing to do. I am talking about those who make  politics without looking around. I am talking about those who  are duty-bound to know and to weigh things -- as any person,  party, or state should do -- before calling on masses of people  and before moving borders and relations with other people, with  or without involving the Army. This is the concern of all of us  who in one way or another have made a contribution to the  deterioration of relations with Russia. And I am one of them.    Just look at all the fuss made by Russia about the so-called  rights and interests of Russians who live beyond Russia's  borders. Have you noticed how, for several month on end, Russian  propaganda has been striving to prove to the whole world that  ethnic Russians, their fellow citizens, are oppressed and their  rights and freedoms are being violated; in short, that they need  help!    Since we are in the situation of the small and harassed one,  or rather in the situation of the little one who has been beaten  up by an older person, it would be advisable if we did not rush  in with an answer, because in any event we are going to grow up,  while he will be just growing older.</p>

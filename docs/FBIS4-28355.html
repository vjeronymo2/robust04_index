			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference on 30 May, Defense Agency [DA]  Administrative Vice-Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama revealed that  the agency will consider developing and owning reconnaissance  satellites to strengthen Japan's information-gathering  capability in the field of defense.    Administrative Vice-Minister Hatekayama stated: "For Japan,  which strictly adheres to defense only, it is important to  improve our information-gathering capability. I do not know  whether that means reconnaissance satellites or not. But we are  interested in strengthening and expanding our  information-gathering capability and must study various  possibilities."    Regarding utilization and development of reconnaissance  satellites, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata showed a positive stance  at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on 26 May,  saying that "the most important thing to the national security  is to possess accurate information."    The DA is examining the possibility of acquiring on a  commercial basis from American companies photographs from  high-performance satellites developed for military  reconnaissance use. For the future, the DA is also studying the  possibility of owning reconnaissance satellites or  meteorological satellites equipped with reconnaissance  capability for joint military and civilian use.    Moreover, positive opinions, which support the idea of  owning  reconnaissance satellites from a viewpoint of boosting  information- gathering capability, were expressed at a meeting  of the "Panel for Studying Defense Issues," a private advisory  organ to Prime Minister Hata. The panel is chaired by Hirotaro  Higuchi, chairman of Asahi Breweries, Ltd.    However, it seems that the idea of owning reconnaissance  satellites will trigger a debate. There exists a Diet  resolution for limiting the use of space to peaceful ends.  Reconnaissance satellites are also expected to require a great  deal of money.</p>

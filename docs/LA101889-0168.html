			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PACIFIC BELL NETWORK ESCAPES QUAKE HARM; LINES OVERLOADED  </P> <P> Pacific Bell officials said today their telephone network survived Tuesday's  devastating Northern California earthquake without significant damage, but the  system was being overloaded by a huge increase in calls into and out of the San  Francisco area.  </P> <P> Because of the surge in long-distance calls to the region, many calls were  being blocked. Recorded messages told callers to try again later.  </P> <P> The local network around San Francisco was unscathed, but because of the big  increase in calls, callers were having difficulty connecting with the network,  said Mary Hallisey, a Washington spokeswoman for Pacific Bell's parent, the  Pacific Telesis Group.  </P> <P> "The local network is in fine shape," Hallisey said. "There is no damage to the  central offices or the network itself. It is operating. There is a gridlock  problem based on the fact that so many people are trying to call in all at  once. . . . When you pick up the phone out there you don't get a dial tone  right away. . . . The system is not out, it's just a very slow dial tone."  </P> <P> "You've got customers trying to get hold of friends, loved ones, work," said  Sue Galloway, district manager for Pacific Bell's network in Southern  California.  </P> <P> "It's extremely heavy, and my anticipation is it will get heavier as the day  goes on."  </P> <P> "We're asking people not to call in for a 24-hour period," said Lissa Zanville,  a Pacific Bell spokeswoman.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which handles about 70% of the nation's  long-distance calls, appealed to people not to try telephoning the earthquake  area.  </P></p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Hong Kong groups lift their eyes across the border - Developers are making the most of pro-China fervour by building land banks AFTER years of playing down China connections to a nervous investing public, Hong Kong listed companies are suddenly announcing a mass of property developments across the border to cash in on current pro-China fervour. With the evolution of Shenzhen from sleepy Chinese town to chaotic metropolis in the past 12 years, the city's property market has already begun to resemble neighbouring Hong Kong's. Last year, it was even more profitable, with Shenzhen residential property prices estimated to have risen by 80 per cent. The potential for further development throughout the rest of Guangdong Province - which is where Shenzhen is situated - has not gone unnoticed, and this year countless listed companies have announced agreements on plots of land. These are mostly companies with little expertise in property development, and it sounds like a recipe for disaster. Even in the speculative environment of Hong Kong, property developers are saying the market has become 'too hot'. There is almost no limit to the supply of new land over the border. More than 100m sq ft of land has been snapped up by Hong Kong parties already. That is substantially greater than the colony's total land mass. But with an increasingly affluent population of 60m in the province of Guangdong, there is undoubted potential. It is just a question of timing. The leading Hong Kong parfar are Sun Hung Kai Properties, New World Development, Henderson Land, Sino Land and Tian An. Of these, only Tian An can truly claim to be a China specialist, with all its earnings coming from Chinese property. Its patchy earnings record in its five years as a China property stock exemplifies the risks inherent in the business. But its 1991 price-earnings ratio of more than 100 indicates the level of expectations. The other sizeable developers appear happy to limit their exposure, and China land banks remain insignificant in the context of their overall asset values. Sino Land has a China land bank of 2.5m sq ft and is planning to increase this to 10m sq ft by the end of the year, but its financial exposure will remain minimal. Mr Robert Ng, managing director of Sino, said the potential for China was enormous, but he admitted that in many areas the ratio of cost to purchasing power was far less favourable than Hong Kong. 'You may get small hiccups here and there, but in the long run it will be very positive,' he said. New World Development has been more ambitious. It is estimated the company's China land bank will exceed 50m sq ft by the end of 1992. Analysts do not expect any meaningful contribution from China before 1995. The leading property developers all have sufficient Hong Kong land banks to carry them through to 1997. Given the limited supply of land in the colony, it is a logical step for them to build up cheap entitlements in China for the long term; they can then wait for the market to mature. For the smaller companies with narrower earnings schedules, the urgency for completion is greater and they are forced to brave the fledgling market. These manufacturing companies are often investing as much as their entire market capitalisation in China property, so the stakes are high. And there is significant competition. At present, Hong Kong is the source of most demand. New properties on the Hong Kong side of the border cannot be bought for less than Dollars HK2,000 (USDollars 258) per sq ft. In Shenzhen, even after the recent price explosion, prices are half that. Analysts estimate that at least 60 per cent of units available for sale in Guangdong Province last year were sold to overseas Chinese buying holiday homes and flats. Special licences are necessary for overseas buyers, but these are easily circumvented. It is impossible to tell what will happen when this pent-up demand is satisfied since at present the mainland Chinese have very limited access to mortgage financing. Developers have to face up to a chaotic system for obtaining planning permission. Henderson Land claims that only 40 per cent of the projects it has negotiated are likely to be completed and successful projects progress very slowly. 'Developers say that for every official stamp there is a bribe of as much as HKDollars 200,000. And you need around 20 stamps,' said an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities. Most Hong Kong companies link with a joint venture partner which provides the land and pushes through the paperwork, while the foreigner pays for the construction. Often the China partner fails to obtain good title for the land. Contacts are crucial, which is why manufacturing companies are in the forefront of the property boom. The industrialists have already built up connections in setting up their factories in the Pearl River delta. The shortage of regulations in China has one large advantage: a Hong Kong developer can pre-sell units before it starts work, thereby raising the bulk of the funds required to complete the project. But this obviously depends on the continuing strength of the market. 'The key is timing, location and linking up with the right partner,' said a developer. The crunch will be felt three years from now, when the proposed developments finally become reality. 'I think it is going to take a lot more projects for the bubble to finally burst,' said Mr Peter Churchouse, vice-president at Salomon Brothers. There are few statistics to show how great the supply will be, but it seems only a matter of time before that point is reached.</p>

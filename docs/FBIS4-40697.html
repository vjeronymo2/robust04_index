			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 0710 GMT on 18 June, on the "How Shall We Live"  program, broadcasts live a 45-minute question-and-answer session  with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk answering viewers'  questions from a studio in Kiev linked up with a studio in  Moscow.    Asked why he wants to stay in power, Kravchuk replies:  "There are many reasons. The first and most important is the  fact that over the last two and a half years, Ukraine has made  very important and very serious steps toward forming its own  statehood and reorientating the economy toward the market and  reforms. Over these years, Ukraine has become a state in full  measure and has been recognized by the world community.    "Obviously, I am not trying to take credit for all these  achievements; I realize these have been achieved by the people  and all the power structures. In spite of all the criticisms,  they have made very important steps in this direction.  Therefore, I would like to see that everything that has been  planned and implemented, all the foundations that have been  laid, should develop and be consolidated. This is one of the  most important reasons."    In reply to criticism that during recent years, life in the  Republic has deteriorated, Kravchuk said: "Yes, the material  life has not improved for the majority of the people, and for a  considerable part it has even deteriorated. I can explain this.  Such a major transition from one system to another, such major  changes in society, the change in economic and politic systems  certainly involves major consequences, and people can feel this  for themselves; this is inevitable. Neither Ukraine nor other  states are an exception here."    Asked whether he, as the president, has created the  necessary  conditions for implementing the reforms, Kravchuk says: "The  conditions were created. It is another matter that it was not  easy to find educated and professional people in the situation  that evolved -- I mean, we started the reforms with the  personnel potential of the past. Attempts to introduce new  people into the government -- there were such attempts in the  Fokin and Kuchma governments, but to my great regret and  sadness, the people who joined the government with good  intentions to step up the reforms failed to implement them."    Kravchuk is asked whether he regards himself as a  nationalist. He replies: "I am very often asked this question  here in Ukraine. Some call me a nationalist, while others call  me a betrayer of national interests; in other words, there is  one point of view on the left and another on the right." He  continues: "My reply will be brief: I have defended and will  defend the interests of the people of Ukraine, the national  interests, because there can be no other interests than state  interests, integrity, and the independence of Ukraine and its  statehood. This is my sacred duty."    To the accusations that the disruption of economic ties has  done a great deal of damage to common people, Kravchuk agrees  that politicians are to blame for this. He says: "I will be  honest with you. I am ready to sign a document on free trade  with Russia tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and I have  proposed this repeatedly. But let us be consistent. There  should be no exceptions to free trade. In other words, Ukraine  should not make exceptions and Russia should not make  exceptions, if we are talking about free trade where goods move  freely. But Russia says it would not be beneficial to subject  its oil, gas, and nonferrous metals to the sphere of the free  movement of goods -- on the whole, more than 60 different goods  that earn Russia's revenue. In such a case, Ukrainian  manufacturers would have to buy oil and gas for twice as much as  do Russian manufacturers. How can they compete with Russian  manufacturers? They cannot. Therefore, I agree with you: The  political leadership is to blame for this, but both political  leaderships, not only Ukraine's; one should not reduce this to  saying that we are the ones pursuing some special policy."    Asked about national ideology, Kravchuk says: "We are not  dividing people according to their nationality either in the  economic, political, legal, or any other aspect." He adds: "We  are building a civil society and all our ideology is based on  this. We know and firmly believe that to build a state in a  multinational country on the basis of nationality would be  dangerous for the development of this state. This would be  grounds for possible contradictions today and tomorrow."    Touching upon Crimea and federalism, Kravchuk says:  "Evidently, it is not easy at present to find a clear-cut and  correct solution." He adds: "I am advocating and will advocate  the most decisive economic sovereignty of the regions; in other  words, the widest and fullest rights and freedoms as regards the  budget, the formation of the budget from below, and the  utilization of resources and protection of people's interests  taking into account the peculiarities of a particular region."    To the accusation that Ukraine has isolated itself from  Russia, Kravchuk replies: "I cannot agree that we have isolated  ourselves. Only recently, apart from signing the treaty on  friendship and cooperation with Russia, we have signed more than  70 different political, economic, and other documents." He  adds: "It was not Ukraine who started erecting borders, but  Russia -- one can check the documents. It is not Ukraine who  stands firmly at a customs post today and says that customs  duties are necessary."</p>

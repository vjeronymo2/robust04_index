			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A senior political source said  that if al-Dirani's interrogation corroborated the information  Israel already possessed according to which Ron Arad had been  turned over to the Revolutionary Guards, Iran would no longer be  able to deny any connection to this affair.    Approximately one month ago, in the framework of a  conference  in Bucharest, I asked Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati why Iran continued to hold navigator Ron Arad prisoner?    [Begin recording] Segal, in English: Why is your  country, Iran, still holding the Israeli POW Ron Arad?    Velayati, in English: I do not know how much this  is related to the present discussion that we have, but I  categorically deny that there is any prisoner from Israel in  Iran. [passage omitted]</p>

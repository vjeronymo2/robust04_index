			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELSMERE DUMP PLAN CRITICIZED FOR MINIMUM TRASH QUOTA;  </P> <P> WASTE MANAGEMENT: THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT WOULD PENALIZE L.A. IF IT DID NOT  PRODUCE ENOUGH GARBAGE. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH STATE  LAW.  </P> <P> A proposed agreement between the city and county of Los Angeles to jointly  develop a regional garbage dump in Elsmere Canyon would impose fines on the  city if it failed to deliver large volumes of trash.  </P> <P> Environmentalists say the fine provision in the proposed pact could discourage  recycling and make it harder for the city to comply with a state law requiring  sharp reductions in the volume of trash dumped in landfills.  </P> <P> The proposed pact, already endorsed by county supervisors, would penalize the  city if less than 6,000 tons per day of trash generated within city limits are  dumped in the landfill planned near the junction of the Antelope Valley and  Golden State freeways east of the city of Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> Initially the city would be fined $1 for each ton less than that minimum,  although the fine could be raised by as much as 6% per year. The fine would be  paid to a joint powers authority to be set up to run the dump.  </P> <P> Critics say the minimum-dumping provision is inconsistent with a new state law  requiring cities and counties to reduce trash dumped in landfills by 25% by the  start of 1995 and by 50% by the year 2000, or face stiff penalties of up to  $10,000 per day.  </P> <P> "That is an appalling provision," said Rod Miller, legislative director of  Californians Against Waste, a pro-recycling group based in Sacramento. "It  creates an incentive for producing garbage . . . as opposed to creating an  incentive for reducing garbage," he said.  </P> <P> The Elsmere proposal reduces the "pressure to put forward the recycling and the  waste reduction that's so desperately needed now," said Fritzi Bernstein of  Sherman Oaks, a member of the Sierra Club and the Los Angeles County Solid  Waste Management Committee.  </P> <P> But city officials who negotiated with the county defended the proposal, which  the City Council is scheduled to consider Friday.  </P> <P> Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said "there is no question in the world" the city will  generate at least 6,000 tons a day for Elsmere -- and still meet state  requirements to cut trash dumping at least 25% in the next 5 years.  </P> <P> Ronald Deaton, the City Council's assistant chief legislative analyst, said he  did not believe the Elsmere deal would undermine a proposed mandatory curbside  recycling program being considered by the council.  </P> <P> "Recycling is a high priority within the city and this decision does not affect  that priority," said Deaton. "The situation is that there are not that many  landfills. . . . Even if you assume substantial recycling, there still is a  need to get rid of what's left over," he said.  </P> <P> The city Bureau of Sanitation currently hauls 6,000 tons per day of household  trash -- taking 4,000 tons to the city-owned Lopez Canyon landfill above  Lakeview Terrace and dividing the remaining waste between the private Sunshine  Canyon and Bradley West landfills in the San Fernando Valley, BKK's West Covina  dump and the county's Calabasas landfill.  </P> <P> However, refuse hauled by the city represents but a third of the 18,000 tons  per day generated within the city limits. Waste trucked by private haulers from  businesses in the city would also count toward the Elsmere quota of 6,000 tons  per day.  </P> <P> The 6,000 tons per day works out to just over 1.5 million tons per year. At $1  per ton, the maximum conceivable penalty would be $1.5 million per year.  </P> <P> Gage said the penalty clause would save taxpayers money because it would lower  the interest rate on revenue bonds to be sold to finance development of the  190-million-ton landfill. He said the guarantee of a minimum amount of dumping  would lower the risk to bondholders and thus the interest rate.  </P> <P> But opponents of the dump were startled by the mere mention of minimum dumping  levels. Jill Klajic, a Santa Clarita resident and a member of the anti-dump  Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee, called it "really bizarre" to set a  floor rather than a ceiling on dumping.  </P> <P> The state's new solid-waste reduction law, authored by Assemblyman Byron D.  Sher (D-Palo Alto), requires that at least 25% of all trash now going to  landfills be diverted by recycling or waste reduction programs by 1995, and  mandates a 50% reduction by the year 2000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 18,000 tons per day produced by households and businesses in Los Angeles  would thus have to be cut to 9,000 tons per day in 10 years.  </P> <P> In order for the city to satisfy the 6,000-ton minimum at Elsmere while holding  its total landfill dumping to 9,000 tons, it would have to reduce its reliance  on other landfills.  </P> <P> City officials in 1985 inaugurated a voluntary curbside recycling program in  parts of the Westside, pronounced it a smashing success, and said it could soon  be expanded citywide.  </P> <P> Four and a half years later, the program has grown to 95,000 households, but  that's less than 15% of the 720,000 households served by the city's Bureau of  Sanitation.  </P> <P> Under the program, participants separate glass, metal cans, newspapers and  plastic bottles from regular trash for pickup by special city trucks.  </P> <P> A plan being considered by the City Council would expand the program citywide  during the next three years and make participation mandatory. Eventually, yard  waste and mixed paper would be included among the recyclable items -- with a  goal of diverting about 40% of the trash now going to landfills.  </P> <P> The city's investment in the program could be as much as $150 million over the  next three to five years, Deaton said.  </P> <P> City and county officials have hailed the Elsmere dump as a key to averting a  crisis stemming from dwindling landfill space.  </P> <P> The proposed city-county agreement, tentatively approved by county supervisors  last week, would create a joint powers authority to finance and operate the  dump, most of which is on Angeles National Forest land about one mile north of  the Los Angeles city limit and 1 1/2 miles east of Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> The authority would sell $195 million in revenue bonds to acquire and develop  the site, and pay off the bonds with tipping fees of roughly $20 for each ton  of trash dumped.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Steve Padilla contributed to this story  </P></p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Capitalist formula for growth Sir, The government having successfully suppressed (but not cured) inflation over a period of some years, now faces the harder challenge of achieving growth without stimulating renewed inflation. If the chancellor were to have the unusual courage to pursue a capitalist solution, the challenge might be met. My formula would include: sharply lowered interest rates, the main benefit of which would be felt by hard-pressed companies currently working only for their banks; greatly increased and simplified incentives to persuade the earning population to divert their expenditure from consumer goods into wealth creating investments; and a measure to allow wages paid by private people to be tax deductible - which would be widely interpreted as according benefit to the rich, but which would go a long way towards providing a solution to the unemployment problem. Finally, these measures should be matched by harsh cuts in public sector employment. D B Robb, managing director, Marlborough Fine English Tiles, Marlborough, Wiltshire</p>

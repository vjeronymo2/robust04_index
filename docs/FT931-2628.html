			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Interest cut boosts Vinten VINTEN Group, the camera mountings and systems, surveillance and electro-optics company, reported 1992 pre-tax profits 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 10.2m, against Pounds 9.18m, on turnover up 22 per cent from Pounds 63.3m to Pounds 77.3m. The rise was helped by a fall in interest charges from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.08m. Strong cash flow during the year enabled the company to cut gearing to 27 per cent while financing acquisitions and capital spending. Earnings per share came out at 21.7p (20.5p). A final dividend of 5.1p is proposed, for an increased total of 7p (6.6p).</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Lex Column: France The French were dragged deeper into recession by linking arms with their sinking German neighbours. The worry now is they may not receive an equal upwards tug as the German economy begins to rise. With the French inflation rate falling to 1.5 per cent and the yield on 10-year OAT bonds rising to almost 7 per cent, the economy will again be badly squeezed. The Bundesbank's 12 basis-point cut in the money market repurchase rate provides some leeway for the French to cut short term rates today. But a small cut may not be sufficient to reinforce the nascent recovery. These fears are reflected in the currency market where the franc is again trading close to its old ERM floor. With the speculators having already fled the scene, the selling is now coming from serious investors. The independent Bank of France is exhibiting considerable sang-froid but will not want the franc to fall too far. That could leave the government screaming for further monetary easing. The government's habit of buying industrial peace with state subsidies is jeopardising its budget deficit. It cannot count on privatisation receipts if the stock market remains so volatile. The risks escalate if German recovery causes interest rates there to stop falling. That could leave the French dangling with high real interest rates. The rise in long bond yields may already be dampening investment and could rattle the housing market. With property and banking markets still fragile, the outlook could turn ugly.</p>

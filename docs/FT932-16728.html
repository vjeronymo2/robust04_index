			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Macbeth with no scruples MACBETH has often been said to be the most bourgeois of Shakespeare's tragedies. Unlike Hamlet, the central figure was not born to be king. The Scottish court is not a patch on that of Denmark: there are no strolling players, no intellectuals, passing through. Unlike Othello, there is not even a touch of exoticism, unless you count the witches. The bard's view of life in Scotland is decidedly grim, like that of many people who have never been north of Stratford, and in the end it is England that has to come to the rescue by supplying 10,000 troops. On the other hand, Macbeth is a gripping tale with some wonderful poetry thrown in. The new production at the Royal National Theatre is an odd mix. Richard Eyre, the director, accepts the bourgeois nature of the play by reducing the famous banquet, attended by Banquo's ghost, to a dinner party for eight. It looks more like a scene from Harley Granville-Barker than Shakespeare. He also makes Lady Macbeth (Anastasia Hille) unusually young, but otherwise a woman without much distinction. It is no disrespect to Ms Hille's playing to say that this Lady Macbeth is out of her depth very early on. She plays the sleep-walking scene well enough, but the prime mover in Eyre's production is clearly meant to be the husband, not the wife egging him on. The husband is Alan Howard. The trouble with at least the first half of his performance is that he seems to be playing Claudius, not Macbeth. He never really has scruples. When he says 'Wake Duncan with they knocking] I would thou couldst]' the line comes across more as a joke that a stab of remorse. When he gives orders to the murderers, one is reminded inescapeably of Claudius instructing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to take Hamlet to England. In a more sophisticated court, he would have a Polonius to assist him. Howard develops as he goes on. He speaks the 'tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow' lines as movingly as I have ever heard them. It is the yesterdays that are the problem. There are other weaknesses. Robin Bailey's Duncan is a wholly conventional figure who does not even make a pass at Lady Macbeth. It is a curious act of national deference that English productions accept Duncan the king, however dim, as someone close to sainthood. He must have had some defects. The witches are not much to write home about either: pretty straightforward, nothing like the Schiller Theater production that came to the Mermaid. Yet there are also strengths. The Banquo murder in the dark is a suitably effective scuffle and the production moves swiftly into the ensuing dinner party. Eyre is good at table scenes. The breakfast with Lady Macduff and her three children with cereals, brown bread and boiled eggs looks like a scene from a more modern play, but is no less dramatic for that. Nicola Redmond as Lady Macduff is an impressive, outspoken Scottish matron who would make a good mother to Coriolanus. James Laurenson as Macduff puts some depth into the character when he tries to suppress his grief at the killing of his family. Until Macbeth gives way to fatalism, these are the best scenes in the production which is sponsored by the RNT's private contributors. Richard Eyre wrote in his book Utopia and Other Places that no Shakespeare play can be properly performed with less that 15 actors. His theory can be put to the test by going to the Battersea Arts Centre where there is another production of Macbeth with a cast of only five. The Red Shift Company has dispensed with the witches and the other superstitious bits altogether on the grounds that no-one believes in witches any more. The subtraction does not diminish the play, which is done a modern dress thriller, and I only realised how few actors there were at the end. It depends, I suppose, on how many times you have seen Macbeth and what you want, but I know this week which production I found the more interesting.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE HEATED BIG MAC ATTACKS, WEST COVINA OKS RESTAURANT  </P> <P> The City Council has overturned the Planning Commission and approved  construction of a controversial drive-through McDonald's restaurant.  </P> <P> After two marathon sessions of heated debate, the council early Thursday voted  4 to 1 to approve the restaurant at 3030 E. Garvey Ave., near the San  Bernardino Freeway.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Nancy Manners voted against it.  </P> <P> During the discussion, the president of a local homeowners association  threatened to "get even at election time" with City Council members who  overturned the commission decision. City Council elections are normally held in  the spring of even numbered years.  </P> <P> "We want a council that is sensitive to the needs of the people," said Corey  Warshaw, president of the East Hills Homeowners Assn., which opposed the  project.  </P> <P> Although the property is located in a commercial zone, the McDonald's Corp.  needed the city's permission to build a drive-through restaurant, said Pat  Haley, West Covina planning director. The Planning Commission twice voted  against the project.  </P> <P> During lengthy public sessions Monday and Wednesday, 32 people spoke against  the project. Twenty-nine people, some of them affiliated with McDonald's, spoke  in favor.  </P> <P> Opponents complained that the restaurant would increase noise, traffic  congestion and pollution and would decrease their property values.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned with the increase in crime, or robberies, a fast food restaurant  would bring," Yvonne Hillmann said.  </P> <P> But William J. Brutocao, an attorney for McDonald's, countered that the  drive-through would provide the city $25,000 a year in sales tax revenue. The  restaurant would also provide 100 jobs, according to other McDonald's  officials.  </P> <P> In June, the Planning Commission denied McDonald's proposal to build the  119-seat drive-through eatery. The commission said the project was not  compatible with the surrounding community.  </P> <P> But at an appeal hearing in July, the City Council referred the project back to  the commission for review and revision. On Aug. 15, the commission voted  against the revised project.  </P> <P> The revised project called for a wall to buffer traffic noise, restrictions on  hours of operation, removal of some roof lighting and an agreement to provide a  recycling program.  </P> <P> Even though the commission turned down the project, planning director Haley  recommended that the council approve it last week.  </P> <P> The council agreed, approving the revised project on the conditions that  McDonald's construct a 10-foot-high noise-buffer wall and conduct a traffic  study. If the study shows that a stoplight or sign is needed, McDonald's would  pay at least part of the cost.  </P> <P> This is not the first time that residents in the San Gabriel Valley have  attempted to halt construction of a McDonald's restaurant.  </P> <P> Altadena residents have delayed construction of a McDonald's restaurant at the  northwest intersection of Altadena Drive and Lake Avenue.  </P> <P> The opponents of that project asked the county Board of Supervisors to block  it, but because the restaurant plans comply with the site's commercial zoning  and local building plans, the supervisors could only ask for a more detailed  review under a 10 1/2-month urgency ordinance.  </P> <P> The ordinance requires McDonald's to obtain a conditional-use permit before  beginning construction. A public hearing must be held before such a permit is  granted.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: Diplomatic failure adds to Greek discomfort AS Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece drove back from Pale yesterday, he must have wondered what, if anything, had been gained from his attempt to mediate in the Bosnian crisis. Mr Mitsotakis had calculated that his appearance beside President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia at the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament could help swing the vote in favour of accepting the Vance-Owen peace plan. In the event, he was unable to repeat the achievement of last weekend's summit in Athens. Then, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators, had both stressed the Greek prime minister's contribution to persuading Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to accept the plan. Mr Mitsotakis's plea to the Bosnian Serbs not to 'commit collective suicide' by rejecting the plan fell on deaf ears. Once again, the relationship between Greece and Serbia looked embarrassingly intimate. If Mr Mitsotakis had hoped to divert attention from the government's domestic problems with a display of statesmanship, he must now expect redoubled criticism for failing to complete the deal. However, Greece is not likely to weaken its ties with Serbia, its traditional friend in the region, and, in the Greek perception, a deterrent to possible efforts by Turkey to extend its influence in the Balkans. This attitude has caused friction with Greece's western allies, not least because of the government's apparent unwillingness to crack down on Greek businessmen and shipowners suspected of breaking the United Nations embargo on trade with Serbia and Montenegro. Much of the fuel still reaching Serbia comes from Greece. It may be shipped by truck through Bulgaria by a local company set up in collaboration with a Greek exporter, or delivered by a Greek-owned tanker at a port in Montenegro. Mr Mitsotakis also asserts that other Balkan countries should not participate in a military intervention in Bosnia, a view not shared by Turkey, the only other Nato member in the region. Greece's refusal to send aircraft to help enforce the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia, while permitting Awacs surveillance aircraft involved in the operation to use a Greek air force base in western Greece, underlines the contradictions of its attempt to balance the obligations of Nato membership with support for Serbia. The government also put up a well-publicised show of resistance before permitting Turkish F16s to fly through Greek airspace on their way to join the contingent enforcing the no-fly zone. A similar difficulty over the role of a Greek destroyer, assigned to the international task force enforcing the UN embargo in the Adriatic, was resolved through an understanding that the Greek ship would not be ordered to enter Montenegrin territorial waters. However, Mr Mitsotakis has done much in recent months to shore up relations with Greece's other Balkan neighbours. The dispute over recognition of Macedonia, which made Greece so unpopular with its European Community partners last year, is well on the way to being resolved. Mr Vance is to act as a mediator at UN-sponsored talks on finding a compromise name acceptable to Greece and implementing confidence-building measures. Greece has also managed to put ties with Albania on a better footing, proposing co-operation in everything from military training to banking and agricultural reform, while the government is promoting military co-operation with Bulgaria and is loosening foreign exchange restrictions to support fast-growing Greek trade and investment there.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BELMONT FIELD CONTINUES TO SHRINK;  </P> <P> TRIPLE CROWN: DOTSERO, WINNER OF THE ILLINOIS DERBY, WON'T MAKE IT TO THE  STARTING GATE. MISTER FRISKY AND REAL CASH ALSO ARE OUT.  </P> <P> The Belmont Stakes is more than a week away, and the Triple Crown finale's  already threadbare ranks are beginning to unravel.  </P> <P> Illinois Derby winner Dotsero, a questionable commodity even under ideal  circumstances, is the latest defection.  </P> <P> He worked at Arlington Park on Wednesday and was to have been flown to Belmont  if the exercise was satisfactory. It was, but trainer Tim Muckler and the  colt's owners elected afterward to pass up the Belmont trip. Muckler said  running Dotsero in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont without a prep "might be a little  anxious."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the remarkably disappointing Mister Frisky, who has taken ill, will  not have the opportunity to tire badly in all three Triple Crown cities after  having won 16 consecutive races in Puerto Rico and California. The Puerto Rican  champion has been ill since arriving at Belmont Park after the Preakness,  assistant trainer Albert Barrera said Wednesday, and has not set a hoof on a  race track since May 19, when he was a distant third at Pimlico. Mister Frisky  will be returned to California as soon as he is well enough to travel.  </P> <P> The D. Wayne Lukas Stable has withdrawn Real Cash, unplaced in the Kentucky  Derby and third in the Jersey Derby, from consideration for the Belmont, but  confirmed that Land Rush, unplaced in both the Derby and Preakness, will keep  the date.  </P> <P> A decision on the Belmont status of Gotham and Wood Memorial winner Thirty Six  Red, who has not started since finishing ninth in the Kentucky Derby, will be  made by trainer Nick Zito and owner B. Giles Brophy after a scheduled workout  today.  </P> <P> "If he works the way we want him to," Zito said, "we'll proceed to the Belmont.  I think he's back to 100%. I have no doubt that if he's the way I think he is,  we'll be in good shape."  </P> <P> Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness runner-up Unbridled, who is assured of a  $1-million bonus simply by starting and finishing the Belmont, emerged without  incident from a six-furlong move in 1:14 1/5 over a wet track Tuesday at  Belmont.  </P> <P> The first two finishers in the Jersey Derby as well as the third finisher in  the Peter Pan Stakes are also on course for the Belmont. Yonder, the Jersey  Derby winner, has the Belmont penciled in for June 9, according to trainer  Angel Penna. Video Ranger, fourth in the Kentucky Derby before losing a narrow  decision to Yonder at Garden State, is at Belmont and will gallop up to the  race.  </P> <P> Country Day's trainer, John Parisella, confirmed his Belmont status. "I can't  wait," he said.  </P></p>

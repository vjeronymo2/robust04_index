			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L SCANDAL  </P> <P> How refreshing to learn of Lampel's means of gaining Cranston's attention when  no other conventional method prevailed. Surely the honorable senator, having  been backed into a corner by Lampel, could do better than to offer assistance  of a further bailout possibility by the federal government from a problem which  he and the other four senators appeared to have aided and abetted.  </P> <P> Damage control is a wonderful thing . . . when it works, but in this case, the  voters will be the ones who will eventually decide at the polls in 1992. Their  memories are, generally, not that short. If Cranston really wants to "aid"  those poor bondholders, he could do a lot more positive things than offer lip  service after the fact, and provide an aide's telephone number, after ignoring  Ms. Lampel for so long. Is this the timely way he "responds to the needs of his  constituents," the 23,000 bondholders, the way he did with Charlie Keating?  </P> <P> MARWIN H. GONSIOR  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

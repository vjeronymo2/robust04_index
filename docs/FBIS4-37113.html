			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amnon Barzilay] </F>   [Text] "Intelligence evaluation elements neutralized me in  order to distance me from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. One of  the methods they used was leaking a series of stories to the  media while creating the impression in the prime minister's  office that I was the source of those leaks."    These remarks were made last night by Dr. Jacques Neriya,  prime minister's political adviser, who filed his resignation  letter at the beginning of this week. Neriya further claimed  that he knows who the senior source is behind the leak that he  told the prime minister, in the presence of others, that Yasir  'Arafat is crazy.    Neriya further said that the source's identity, protected by  the censorship, said the following: "...unlike Neriya, who  thinks that 'Arafat is crazy. Neriya should have read 'Arafat's  psychological profile, written over a year ago, and should have  realized that he is not crazy."    Neriya added: "The prime minister was fair enough not make  any charges against me, but after I have been charged with so  many affairs, I felt that he was keeping his distance, that he  is reserved. They said that I am the current source of leaks  from the prime minister's office."    Neriya said yesterday that he had never made the remarks  attributed to him regarding the PLO head. On the contrary, he  was in charge of drafting the psychological opinion prepared in  the past about the PLO head. Dr. Neriya added that he decided  to resign after 20 months of work when he realized that his  skills as political adviser are not being properly used by the  prime minister's bureau.    The fact that his status as political adviser was ignored  has  caused damage to the public image of the government and the  prime minister over the past several weeks. Neriya claimed that  the storm regarding Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' letter to  Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst could have been  prevented had he been consulted on this.    Neriya revealed that Police Minister Moshe Shahal, who has  been acting as a liaison between the government and the Knesset  since Hayim Ramon resigned, has systematically avoided using his  services, for reasons unknown to Neriya.    "All the information regarding Peres' letter to Holst was  presented to me. Had Shahal shown any interest and asked me  about the letters to 'Arafat, I would have told him that 'Arafat  had received a letter regarding the location of the Palestinian  institutions in East Jerusalem. He could have then discussed  the issue with the prime minister."    [Barzilay] Why did you not bring it to Shahal's attention?    [Neriya] Since Shahal was appointed liaison between the  Knesset and the prime minister, he sent his aide to me once.  Should I be running after Shahal? This is not my job. Ramon  used to call me and come to my office whenever he needed  information. [end Neriya]    Neriya claimed that the restrictions imposed on him, in his  status as political adviser, grew gradually. "In the  negotiations with the PLO, I was supposed to be an assistant to  Major General Amnon Shahaq, the deputy chief of staff, as the  representative of the prime minister. In fact, I was left out  of the circle of consultations. I stayed on as a trouble  shooter."    The next stage of his reclassification was when classified  material stopped arriving at his desk, he said. "I felt like I  was an outsider at the prime minister's bureau. They stopped  passing information to me. How could I help forming political  opinions?"    [Barzilay] Why did they neutralize you?    [Neriya] National evaluation elements were angry over the  fact that the prime minister has a political, civilian arm that  could draft political evaluations independently of them. [end  Neriya]    In the coming days, Neriya will meet Hayim Ramon to work out  the definition of his position as the person in charge of the  Histadrut labor federation's international relations. Neriya  claimed that he has never spoken to Ramon about his political  plans or about getting him into the Knesset.    [Barzilay] Do you claim you were pushed aside in the bureau?    [Neriya] This is probably a matter of style.    [Barzilay] Were you the scapegoat of the system?    [Neriya] I was the lonely link. I have no organization. My  only source of support was Director General Shim'on Sheves, and  the prime minister's confidence in me.    [Barzilay] Do you believe the security branches are  isolating the prime minister?    [Neriya] The thing is that they are almost the only element  that controls information.    [Barzilay] Perhaps the prime minister is held captive by the  system?    [Neriya] You are using the wrong word. The prime minister  works vis-a-vis establishments -- the chief of staff, his  deputy, the Mosad, the Shin Bet. I was an irregularity in that  context.    [Barzilay] Would they not allow a civilian to work with the  prime minister?    [Neriya] Yes, and in a place like this, if you have no  information, you have no power. Preventing me from receiving  information was aimed at neutralizing my influence on the prime  minister.    [Barzilay] Did they harm the prime minister's ability to  receive evaluations from you?    [Neriya] They first and foremost wanted to harm my  functioning and allow the Army to have an exclusive status. How  long can you fight?    [Barzilay] How do you feel about the prime minister?    [Neriya] I love him, I appreciate him, I admire him. I  think he is a role model of integrity, openness, and dedication.  I learned a lot from him. I was faithful to him. I believed in  his path. I have no doubts about the things he did.    The problem is that I constantly had to fight for my square  foot under the sun, to remind everyone that I exist, that I am  here. I found I was an outsider. How long can you be an  outsider? [end Neriya]</p>

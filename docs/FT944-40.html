			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (6): Why they won't all charge you the same - Advisers' commission There is a danger that the new regime will take investors one step forward and two steps back in their quest for clear analysis of total charges. For, while the providers' charges will not differ for a given example, the commission can and will vary considerably, depending on how you buy your plan. Company representatives are remunerated partly by sales commission, but they may also receive a basic salary, a company car and office equipment, among other items. This means that the commission figure quoted on the key features document will only represent part of the total cost of advice. Commission-based independent advisers do not receive uniform rates. From next week, many providers will offer a choice in terms of the level of commission and the timing of payments. Advisers may discuss their commission terms with you, but you will not necessarily know what a different firm would charge. For the sake of clarity, the tables in this survey assume standard commission rates. If your adviser charges more or less than this rate, it will have a dramatic affect on the total charges and hence on the final fund. As a result, it may prove extremely difficult to compare like with like. The table below, supplied by independent advisers Blyth McKenna, illustrates the problem. The example assumes that you invest Pounds 200 per month for 20 years and that the growth rate is 9 per cent. The fund at maturity where no charges are deducted is Pounds 128,691. The difference between the nominal fund with no charges and the nil-commission figure represents the provider's own investment and administration charges. Naturally, the nil-commission terms look best, but do bear in mind that on this basis you still have to pay for the advice, either in the form of an explicit fee or by agreeing with your adviser the amount of commission he will take, which is deducted from your premiums. There are other factors that will produce anomalies in league tables used by advisers. For example, if you compare charges across the entire range of funds, then the money market, deposit and gilt funds, among others, naturally will show lower deductions than actively managed funds. The same applies to performance. In any five-year rolling period there will be star performers from the more exotic stables - emerging markets and the Far East, for example - but these funds are likely to prove very volatile, and exposure should be limited unless you can afford to take a gamble and are confident that you have got the timing right. The message here is that, if you want a managed fund, then be sure to ask your adviser to compare performance and charges, just within that category.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FLEXIBLE COMMISSION - HOW IT WORKS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Commission terms                                   Final fund (Pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Nominal fund nil charges                                       128,691 Nil commission terms                                           116,468 50 per cent level commission                                   111,911 50 per cent initial, full renewal                              110,570 Full level commission                                          107,354 Full indemnity                                                 107,052  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures are based on Scottish Amicable's FlexiPension, assuming premiums of Pounds 200 a month are paid for 20 years.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes:  Level: a predetermined percentage of each premium paid to the adviser throughout the term. Initial: most of the commission that would be paid over the term of the contract is paid during 'initial' period, about two years in the case of a long contract. Renewal: a commission paid once the initial period has ended. Indemnity: the commission is paid as a lump sum immediately. (Under indemnity terms, if the investor cancels the policy early, the adviser may be obliged to pay back part of the up-front commission to the provider. This is known as a clawback.)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Blyth McKenna  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Scots business optimism rises BUSINESS optimism increased in several parts of the Scottish economy in the first quarter of this year, although demand continued to decline in most sectors. The Scottish business survey, conducted by chambers of commerce and analysed by the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Glasgow, found an improvement in optimism in manufacturing, retailing and tourism. But business confidence was falling in construction and wholesaling. The quarterly survey showed manufacturers reporting a continuing fall in orders and sales, although the decline was slower than in the fourth quarter of last year. Orders and sales to all principal markets were in decline except for the Scottish market, where a small margin of companies reported an upturn. In construction, orders continued to fall at the same rate as in the fourth quarter of last year. But demand experienced by retailers appeared to be rising. The level of wage increases continued to fall in manufacturing, retail and finance, but increases were reported in construction and leisure. Demand for staff was generally weak, although the rate of decline in employment levels fell in the first quarter. Fewer companies were seeking to recruit and fewer were having difficulties recruiting.</p>

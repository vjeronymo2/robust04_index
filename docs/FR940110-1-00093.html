An applicant and the project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor shall state in the AHP application their commitment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding satisfaction of the long-term income-eligibility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordability and income-targeting requirements contained in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(1). An applicant may commit to maintain additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units as affordable for and occupied by low- or moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households, which commitment shall be for a minimum period of 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years or, at the election of the sponsor, the remaining useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of such units, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. The Bank's AHP implementation plan shall set forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that the Bank will follow to effectively implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this paragraph (a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A household occupying a rental housing unit subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-targeting requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required to satisfy the income-eligibility requirement of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph applicable to such income-targeted unit, as committed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the AHP application, upon initial occupancy. The household may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to occupy the income-targeted unit even if its income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases above the income-eligibility requirement for such unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The unit may continue to count toward meeting the income-targeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement committed to in the AHP application, provided the rent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged remains affordable to the household as defined in &sect;960.1;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, if the household's income rises above 140 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor must make the next available rental housing unit in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project affordable to and available for occupancy by a household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose income is at or below the income-targeting level committed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to in the AHP application for the original unit, and once the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available rental housing unit is so occupied, the rent charged on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the unit occupied by the household whose income has risen shall no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer be subject to the requirement that it be affordable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households at the income-targeting level committed to in the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing project may sell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or below the levels committed to in the AHP application; however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The purchaser must agree to continue the project's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rental units, or applicable portion thereof, as affordable for and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to the seller; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

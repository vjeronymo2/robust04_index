			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson A healthy scepticism about Hanson's low tax charge has in the end proved justified. While the reasons for the rise in the tax rate to 28 per cent are as opaque as the traditionally low charge, Hanson is at least becoming a more normal company. The outlook for Hanson's operations remains gloomy. There is little prospect of robust recovery in UK basic industries - as Ibstock's cut in brickmaking capacity confirmed yesterday. Meanwhile the fall in base rates will cut interest income through the year. In the US hopes of a large federal spending package which would benefit the aggregates business are also fading. The shares have been buoyed by the company's overseas earnings and cyclical recovery prospects. That process cannot go too far, however much investors are comforted by the 5.8 per cent yield.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan 14 (AFP)--Chinese President Jiang  Zemin welcomed Friday the resumption of normal relations between  France and China and praised the foresight of Mao Zedong and  former French president Charles de Gaulle in establishing ties  30 years ago, a diplomatic source said.    Jiang made the remarks during a half-hour meeting with the  new French ambassador, Francois Marcel Plaisant, who was  presenting his credentials.    Plaisant was given the rare privilege of being received  privately by the head of state. Normally a brief ceremony is  held at which several ambassadors present their credentials at  the same time.    Paris and Beijing issued a joint statement Wednesday  normalising their relations and in which France undertook not to  sell arms to Taiwan. Beijing claims sovereignty over the  nationalist island.    Relations between Paris and Beijing had been in the doldrums  for more than 14 months following France's decision to sell  Mirage 2000- 5 jets to Taipei.    Jiang, who is also general secretary of the communist party,  said that he admired French skills in the economic and  technology fields, the diplomatic source added.    He also evoked the upcoming visit of French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur to China, expected to take place next month,  and an official visit to France by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen.    Qian is currently on a tour of east Africa and is expected  to  visit Paris at the end of January.</p>

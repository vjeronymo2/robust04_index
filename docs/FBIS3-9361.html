The  style is like the man, it seems, not only insofar as his  handwriting is concerned, but also news conferences. Balzac is  easy to recognize in his novels and Nicolae Vacaroiu in his news  conferences. The way he appears in front of journalists betrays  the style he has adopted in his position of prime minister.  What could be noted, especially in his answers to the  questions, was the incoherence characteristic of Nicolae  Vacaroiu's activity as prime minister. To listen to a Nicolae  Vacaroiu speech is a hard task for an intelligent person who is  used to thinking on the basis of Aristotelian logic. Vacaroiu  has the talent to contradict himself without batting an eyelid.  Here is an example. The whole exercise on Monday, 14 March, was  designed to present himself as a genuine reformist. At one  point, however, he made an affirmation that clearly contradicted  this: "Thus, as long as I hold this position, the economy has to  function, come out of the crisis, and proceed to the  restructuring and privatization process..." Thus Romania's  prime minister views the period of his governance divided into  two stages: First, he takes the economy out of the crisis,  makes it function, and second, he restructures and privatizes  it. As is known, the two elements of the reform --  privatization and restructuring -- have been thought out by  economists of greater caliber than Nicolae Vacaroiu and not as a  purpose in itself, but as a means to take the economy out of the  crisis caused by the centralized communist system. And this for  a simple reason: Only privatization and restructuring --  typical elements of market relations -- may make the economy  function within maximum parameters! Communism collapsed  precisely because it failed at the economic level. The Romanian  prime minister, however, thinks that we may make the economy  function before privatization and restructuring. What is to be  understood from this? That Nicolae Vacaroiu continues to  believe in the efficiency of communist means at the economic  level. Thus he betrays his centralist thinking. Without wanting  to, he also betrays that he is a convinced antireformist. Thus  he declared in front of the entire press and, through it, in  front of the entire nation, that the means used by his  government so far have been those of communist centralism.  Understandably, this is harshly at variance with his emphasis  throughout the news conference of being a convinced reformist.  The incoherence typical of the Nicolae Vacaroiu government was  also obvious during the news conference in the prime minister's  talent to jump several times from one subject to another within  the same sentence. He begins, for example, by referring to the  machine-building industry only to find himself talking how to  cultivate field flowers at the end of the sentence. The same  news conference revealed another trait of the political style  practiced by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. This is what one  could call aggressive bragging. Normally, braggarts earn  sympathy. Nicolae Vacaroiu, however, is a braggart who gets on  your nerves. When he says that the decline in material  production has stopped, that the GNP and labor productivity per  employee have increased, and that exports have considerably  grown, Nicolae Vacaroiu simply does not brag. Actually, he  polemizes with all those who hold that things are not going  well. That is so with all Romanians. Had this been Stalin's  time, Nicolae Vacaroiu would have sent everyone who did not  utter praise of the way he governs to jail. Living in a  democracy, he has to be content to brag. The aggressiveness  behind his bragging betrays how he suffers that it is not  Stalin's time. At first sight, Nicolae Vacaroiu seems a modest  man minding his own business. If you study him closely, you will  find that he is a man who has an unusually positive opinion  about himself. The tone of both his introductory statement and  his answers during the news conference was characterized by an  irritating arrogance. On the basis of the fact that he is the  prime minister, Nicolae Vacaroiu has decided that he is  unquestionably superior to absolutely everything that moves in  this country, especially since he believes that everything that  moves stands on one side exchanging opinions, while he, Nicolae  Vacaroiu, is working hard to govern the country.</p>

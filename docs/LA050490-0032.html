			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Shannon to Dance in Moscow: Michael Shannon, the 20-year-old Angeleno who was  accepted in the fall as a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, will dance Albrecht  in the company's production of "Giselle" on June 1 in Bolshoi Theatre. His  Moscow debut in a leading role comes after a dozen tryout performances in tour  sites such as Tblisi and Tashkent, and perhaps will determine whether the  company will bring him -- among the youngest dancers to be given a leading role  -- to Shrine Auditorium in August.

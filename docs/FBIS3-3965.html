President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng met  representatives  of the award-winning scientists before the ceremony. The award  winners, including nine scientists from Hong Kong and foreign  countries, had between them completed 781 scientific and  technological projects for the country in 1993.    Congratulating the scientists, Jiang said that he hoped the  scientists will spread the seed of science and technology  throughout the country and make yet greater contributions to the  country's economic development and social progress.    He said Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking of making science  and technology the driving force behind production is the  guiding principle for developing the country's science and  technology and the national economy as a whole," the president  said.    Jiang asked the scientists to pay close attention to applied  research and development research while keeping a necessary  contingent in basic sciences.    He said, "the practice of reform and development needs a  correct theory and rich knowledge." He also urged officials at  all levels to gain more knowledge of modern science and  technology, and make new and realistic contribution to the  country's modernization.    The national science and technology awards include natural  sciences awards, invention awards, science and technology  progress awards and spark awards.    According to professor Zhu Lilan, vice-minister in charge of  the State Science and Technology Commission, the prize-winning  projects of 1993 have produced an estimated economic result of  21.3 billion yuan (2.45 billion U.S. dollars).    Projects associated with key industries in the nation's  economic development plan outnumbered the others in the winners'  list.    The winning projects are concerned with industries and  transport, agriculture, education, medicine and basic scientific  research.    One project was on research to make pandas give birth to  twins, conducted by the animal institute of the Chinese Academy  of Sciences and other research institutes in Chengdu, Sichuan  Province.    Another winner was research into Jurassic dinosaurs in  Sichuan mountain regions, conducted by the Chinese Academy of  Sciences and Chengdu Geology College.</p>

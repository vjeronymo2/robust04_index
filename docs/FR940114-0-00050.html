			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The National Manufactured Housing Advisory Council should be convened, as required by law, to consider the standards proposed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Despite the infeasibility of convening the Advisory Council within the timeframe originally proposed for the implementation of improved standards, the Department made an extraordinary effort to consult with the individual members of the Advisory Council. The responses of a number of the individual members of the Advisory Council have been considered and included in the docket file for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Later, because of the Department's extension of the comment period and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognition that a final rule could not be in place in time for the 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hurricane season, the Department immediately convened the Advisory Council so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it could discuss the proposal as a panel. The resulting recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Advisory Council, as a panel, also have been considered carefully in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining both the scope and the specific requirements of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional discussion of the proceedings of the Advisory Council can be found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elsewhere in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Several commenters questioned the impact of the rule on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families, in the context of Executive Order 12606, which requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of the impact of a regulation on family formation, maintenance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and general well-being.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : In the proposed rule, the Department indicated that the rule was not subject to review under the Executive Order. The commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questioned this position based on information that some potential consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be unable to purchase manufactured homes if the prices of those homes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were raised to cover the costs of the new standards. To the extent that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production cost increases resulting from this rule will be passed on to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers, one effect of the rule is expected to be the loss of marginal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers from the market. Some of these marginal consumers will have to find  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less expensive, rental housing; some will opt for comparably priced site-built  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing. However, the significance of this result is not a loss of housing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but a redistribution of the kinds of housing available. Although as a result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some families may lose an ownership option, the general well-being of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families, and society, is served better by ensuring adequate quality standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Department does not believe this final rule implicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family concerns within the spirit of the Executive Order, the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed the rule as required under the Order. Therefore, in the paragraph on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12606 under the ``Other Matters'' section of this preamble, the Department certifies that the requirements of the Order have been met in the issuance of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The proposed rule indicated that manufacturers should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipate the contents of the final rule and should prepare to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the more stringent standards soon after publication of the final rule. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule for implementation of the new standards fails to recognize the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for lead time to design, test, and seek approval of changes necessitated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standard changes. In addition, while personnel resources are concentrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the redesign requirement, production personnel may have to be laid off.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This problem is compounded by the possibility that another redesign will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary as a result of the new Federal energy standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : To a large extent, the Department already has been responsive to the concerns expressed in this comment by conceding that the rule will not become effective for 180 days. The Department is sensitive to the procedural requirements that a manufacturer faces when undertaking design changes. However, there is no doubt that by the time this rule becomes effective, all aspects of the industry should have had sufficient advance notice of the necessary product improvements to prepare for implementation of the new standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Innovative solutions and safer products generally depend on some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial incentive. The Department believes, based on the knowledge of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical staff, the reports they have reviewed, and some of the comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received, that those parties involved in the production, sales, and siting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured housing will be able to comply with these standards reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quickly, when continued sales depend on such compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cost Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The cost impact of the standard changes should be analyzed, as required by Executive Order 12291 and 42 U.S.C. 5403(f), and a regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact analysis should be prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : As stated in the ``Other Matters'' section of the preamble of the proposed rule (57 FR 19539), the Department agreed that it would prepare and submit a regulatory impact analysis before publication of the final rule, in accordance with established Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. Although many of the benefits, and some costs, of increased standards are difficult to quantify for purposes of such an economic analysis (e.g., loss of life, uninsured costs, insurance deductibles, and injuries), the Department has complied with the requirements of Executive Order 12866 (September 30, 1993) and OMB. As noted under ``Significant Regulatory Action'' in the ``Other Matters'' section of this preamble, a final regulatory analysis based on the provisions in this final rule is available to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, while economic concerns have always been an important component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Department's decisionmaking process and, in this case, resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of the rule, the Department stresses that its statutory mandate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reduce the number of personal injuries and deaths and the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance costs and property damage resulting from manufactured home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents, and to improve the quality and durability of manufactured homes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that the Department look beyond affordability issues. In promoting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homeownership opportunities for lower-income persons, the Department strongly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that such housing must also be safe. The concern with safety extends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the occupants of the housing, to all those who may be affected by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of such housing to meet minimum performance standards under reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreseeable conditions. For example, in a Federal Emergency Management Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FEMA) report on ``Building Performance: Hurricane Andrew in Florida'' (FIA&hyph;22, 2/93), cited by commenter 76, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It was observed that the breakup of corrugated metal siding and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roofed buildings such as manufactured homes and pre-engineered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metal frame buildings contributed significantly to the generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of airborne debris. This was evident from debris damage to nearby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downwind structures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> As stated by another commenter (205 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ): ``The prospect of reducing the loss of life and property and reducing the cost of disaster relief efforts from such losses as Hurricane Andrew would certainly be to the benefit of the entire housing industry and the individual and corporate citizen taxpayers of the United States.'' In addition, the upgrades required under this rule also would increase the ability of the homes to withstand damage during transportation and installation of the units, and the improved windows would be more energy efficient (see comment 150).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PALESTINE NEEDS A STATE, TOO'  </P> <P> The people of Israel were always willing to negotiate and talk with their  neighbors, but not with a PLO whose sole purpose and aim was to destroy and  exterminate Israel and its people.  </P> <P> For the past 40 years they have struggled and worked hard, under most difficult  circumstances and against severe odds (border attacks by their Arab neighbors).  </P> <P> The population of Israel consists mostly of refugees and survivors of the  Holocaust who were content to work in peace and make a homeland for themselves  and their families. They were tired of living in fear of Nazi atrocities. But  they were ready to defend themselves from enemy attacks and aggressors.  </P> <P> Most of the trouble started when their Arab neighbors, by sneak attacks,  started major wars against the small state of Israel. We all know the results.  Each time they drove the enemy back to where they thought would be a safe  distance to discourage and deter their aggressors from further attacks. They  even gave up valuable territory to make peace with Egypt.  </P> <P> I believe if they were guaranteed that there would be no more attacks they  would be glad to cooperate. My question to Mr. Klutznick -- who would guarantee  a lasting peace?  </P> <P> MURRAY KOPELLE  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

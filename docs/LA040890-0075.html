			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIVIA CORRECTIONS  </P> <P> As a teacher of geography and an airline buff, I was disappointed to find  several glaring errors in the "Can You Guess?" trivia quiz. They are: 1) The  airline of Spain is IBERIA not Iberian; 2) it's Qantas not Quantas; 3) LACSA  not LASCA (Lineas Aereas Costarricenses S.A.) and 4) Colombia not Columbia.  </P> <P> FRANK S.

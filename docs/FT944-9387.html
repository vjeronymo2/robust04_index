			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Fewer high rollers in New York: Rolls-Royce's Manhattan dealer is closing Manhattan residents who want a Rolls-Royce will soon have to head, at least for a time, for unfashionable Long Island - or to suburban New Jersey or Connecticut - to buy one. Carriage House Motors, which claims to have been the UK luxury carmaker's biggest dealer for most of the past decade, closes its doors on Manhattan's East 61st Street next month. Demand for one of the ultimate car status symbols is not what it was. Mr Michael Schudroff, owner of Carriage House and one of the world's biggest collectors of vintage Rolls-Royces, says: 'People are looking at them differently these days. The 1990s is not a time to be flamboyant.' So far this year, Mr Schudroff says he has sold 65 new Rolls-Royces and around 185 'pre-owned' ones. That is a far cry from the late 1980s, when he was selling around 550 a year, 200 of them new. The US recession also had something to do with the fall in sales in the early 1990s, along with a new luxury sales tax which adds 10 per cent to the price of each vehicle - though many other parts of the US car market have bounced back in the last two years. The rising cost of maintaining premises in Manhattan has finally persuaded Mr Schudroff to move to Greenwich, Connecticut. With smaller premises, he is preparing to sell a large part of his vintage collection: on December 10, Sotheby's in New York will auction around 50 vehicles, including cars once owned by Diana Rigg, David Niven and Bahrain's ruler. Mr Robert Warren, head of Rolls-Royce's North American business, concedes the loss of the Manhattan dealer will leave the company unrepresented in an important market. The company has already been approached by other Manhattan dealers hoping to be awarded the Rolls-Royce franchise, and he expects to name a new dealer shortly. Whoever gets the New York dealership would do well to heed a warning from Mr Schudroff: 'If you take a car for a test drive, you're lucky if you don't get whacked by a taxi.'</p>

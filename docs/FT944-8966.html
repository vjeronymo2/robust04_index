			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: To buy back or pay out - David Wighton examines the distribution of cash piles Boots' decision to spend more than Pounds 500m buying in its shares has fuelled a fierce, if arcane, debate about the best way for companies to reduce excess cash holdings. Boots is following a trail blazed by the regional electricity companies which have spent more than Pounds 750m buying back their shares over the last year. Last month East Midlands Electricity took a different tack by paying out Pounds 186.5m as a special dividend. Both methods have their pros and cons, most of which relate to tax. One advantage of the special dividend is that its tax treatment is certain. East Midlands obtained prior clearance from the Inland Revenue, which said the payment would be treated like an ordinary dividend - having a tax credit attached worth 25 per cent of the payment. Tax exempt shareholders, including pension funds, can reclaim the tax credit from the Inland Revenue. The company pays the same sum to the Revenue in advance corporation tax which it can then set against its mainstream corporation tax bill. In theory, if a company buys back its shares directly from investors most of the sum received is treated in the same way. But this only applies if the company buys the shares in the market or through a stockbroker acting purely as an agent. If it merely buys them from a market maker, as some of the electricity companies did, there is no tax benefit for the shareholders. There is another potential snag. The Revenue has given no commitment that shareholders accepting repayment will get their tax credit and it can refuse to pay if the investor sold for tax reasons. Tax experts believe it is likely that a few institutions who took advantage of electricity buy-backs may fall foul of this rule. Those who sold shares to the company only to buy them back in the market are particularly vulnerable. The Revenue could easily argue that the institution acted purely to get the tax credit. But buy-backs are more tax efficient, assuming institutions get their tax credits. In most recent examples the companies' brokers merely stood in the market buying shares until the money had been spent. Since the tax credit is only available to non-taxpayers, they buy most of the shares. The total amount claimable from the Revenue will therefore be almost 25 per cent of the purchase price. Yet a special dividend goes to all shareholders. Basic rate taxpayers get no credit, while top rate taxpayers face a bill of 20 per cent of the dividend. So the total net flow from the Revenue to shareholders is likely to be less. Supporters of special dividends counter that they are more equitable than buy-backs where only institutions are offered the chance to sell. But because of their different tax statuses shareholders do not receive equal value from dividends, while under a buy-back all shareholders receive the benefit of the changed capital structure. For example, because of the different tax treatment of interest and dividends, analysts calculate that by switching Pounds 500m of its capital from equity to debt Boots will boost its post-tax profits by more than Pounds 10m a year. Most observers agree that Reuters adopted the ideal solution last year. It distributed Pounds 350m to shareholders by offering all of them the opportunity to sell part of their holding. Not only did the company treat shareholders equally, it gave them the option of receiving cash or enhancing their investment. It also gave investors time to decide in contrast to what has been described as the 'unseemly scramble' over Boots' buy-back. Unfortunately the Revenue has since refused to give any other company clearance for such a scheme. If there is an interval between the announcement of the buy-back and the closing date, the market price could rise above the offer price. So shareholders who accept the company's offer, rather than sell in the market, are clearly doing so for tax reasons. A way around this is unlikely to be found before the Budget, which is expected to change the taxation of dividends.</p>

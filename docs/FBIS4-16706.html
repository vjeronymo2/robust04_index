			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen State Security Department has received  an order on the deployment of its formations. The order said  this was necessary as preparations for the state of emergency,  the Chechen State Security Department told INTERFAX.    The commanders of the formations were ordered to open fire  for effect without warning in case of an armed attack or  resistance.    Commenting on this order, Deputy Chief of the State Security  Department, Ayub Satuyev, said in an interview with INTERFAX  that more energetic actions were expected from Monday on the  part of the opposition forces in Chechnya. He announced that a  group of persons recruited for the destabilization of the  situation in the Republic had been arrested.    The security department formations will prevent unauthorized  rallies and hostile actions against aliens.    "The leadership has enough power and means to halt enemies  of  the people. We will undertake the toughest measures towards the  opposition," Satuyev stated. He suggested that Grozny would  never again allow any actions similar to the ones in April and  June 1993, when the rallies lasted for weeks.</p>

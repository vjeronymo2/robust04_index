			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LO-TEC'S OFFERING OF LIMON AND WATT PROVIDES A LITTLE TASTE OF HEAVEN  </P> <P> San Diego dance buffs awaited a visit from the renowned Limon Dance Company as  part of the "risky dancing" series sponsored by the San Diego Foundation for  the Performing Arts this year.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the risks proved insurmountable, and the debt-ridden foundation  dropped the Limon troupe (keepers of the flame for deceased modern dance  pioneer Jose Limon) from the lineup in a desperate attempt to salvage the  organization.  </P> <P> Happily for local aficionados, Three's Company's Lo-Tec Series picked up some  of the slack by featuring Limon's acclaimed principal dancer, Nina Watt, in its  first concert of the summer. Watt, a galvanizing performer who has danced the  master's work worldwide since joining his company in 1972, performed two Limon  dances.  </P> <P> She also included a smattering of Anna Sokolow, another early modern dance  visionary whose work has been overlooked in San Diego. Although "Escape" and  "The End?" -- both culled from Sokolow's modern dance masterpiece, "Rooms" --  might have come as a surprise to the zealots at the opening concert Saturday  night, it was a natural choice for Watt, whose modern dance background abounds  with names from the art form's rich past.  </P> <P> With little in the way of lighting support to heighten the dramatic elements in  her dancing, and a less-than-ideal sound track blurting out the scores, Watt  thrust herself into the three-piece program with a vengeance.  </P> <P> She opened the concert with Limon's "Chaconne," first performed at the  Humphrey-Weidman Studio in New York back in 1942. Decked out in a black velvet  evening dress, her fair hair knotted at the nape of her neck, Watt allowed the  scratchy strands of Bach's violin solo to propel her through its sweeping  circular phrases.  </P> <P> Watt is the only member of the current company who actually worked with Limon,  and it shows in her performance. With elegant port de bras and expressive  dramatic intensity, Watt embodied the very spirit of the Limon style, and  earned the wild applause that followed her appearance.  </P> <P> A quick costume change and she was back for a pair of excerpts from Sokolow's  "Rooms." Using fluttering steps that seemed to barely skim the surface of the  stage, Watt executed the wordless ballet as if shrouded in a dreamy fog. The  dance is fraught with emotions, and this highly dramatic dancer never failed to  deliver. Too bad she offered only a fleeting look at this obscure modern dance  classic.  </P> <P> For her finale, Watt paid homage to the earth mother of modern dance in Limon's  "Dances for Isadora." The five-movement piece (corresponding to the five  periods in Duncan's life) are usually danced by different dancers. But with a  makeshift dressing room in plain view of the audience, and a few appropriate  hairdo and makeup changes, Watt carried off the entire piece -- beginning with  Duncan's youthful vitality in "Primavera" and culminating with the brilliant  image of grief in "Scarf Dance" that symbolizes the dancer's tragic death.  </P> <P> A no-frills solo concert with uncomfortable seats, poor acoustics and minimal  technical support can never take the place of a full-blown Limon Dance Company  concert. But last weekend's Lo-Tec performance by Nina Watt was manna from  heaven for the small band of faithful on hand for the occasion.  </P></p>

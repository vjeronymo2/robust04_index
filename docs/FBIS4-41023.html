			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>   [Text] Lvov 21 June TASS -- According to the UNIAN  independent Ukrainian news agency, the Lugansk-based  machine-building works set going production of cartridges for  submachine guns and pistols, including those of calibre 7.62,  which are in great demand by foreign customers.    For example, a Cambodian entrepreneur has ordered 10 million  cartridges of this calibre; the Dutch have ordered even more --  50 million cartridges.    To retool the Lugansk-based plant as soon as possible, the  "Ukrinmash" foreign trade company, which has a licence for  selling this kind of production, proposed that 10-20 million  cartridges (the so-called untouchable reserve) be taken from the  depots of Ukrainian Defence Ministry and sold in the West. The  Ukrainian Government has already given a go-ahead for the move.</p>

The Kashmir leader rejected the talks between the Foreign  Secretaries of Pakistan and India which are starting in  Islamabad Sunday.    He was addressing a public rally on Friday soon after his  arrival here from Brussels via Karachi.    Amanullah was arrested in Belgium on Oct 18 while he was  undertaking an extensive tour of Europe at the invitation of the  Socialist Group of the European Parliament.    Although India tried its level best to get him extradited to  India, the pressure from Pakistan and several European quarters  frustrated the Indian move. He remained in a Belgium jail for  72 days.    He said the Kashmiris would not accept any agreement reached  between Pakistan and India without the participation of the  Kashmiris. "How can these two countries decide the fate of over  12 million Kashmiris?" he asked.    The two countries, Amanullah claimed, "are not serious in  holding the dialogue because such a dialogue, if at all it is  necessary to be held, should have taken place at the level of  the Prime Ministers." "The Foreign Secretaries are no better  than clerks," he said, adding, "What they decide would carry no  weight for the Kashmiris." [punctuations as published]    Reiterating the JKLF position on Kashmir, he called upon  India and Pakistan to vacate the Valley and hand it over to the  United Nations.    Elaborating further, he said the UN administration should  not  include any representation from the US. The mandate of the UN  administration should be to hold plebiscite in Kashmir after  five years, he added.    Describing his release by the Belgian authorities a victory  for the Kashmiris' struggle, he argued the Kashmiris have now  also won on the legal front. "The fact," he said, "that I have  been released by a neutral court indicates that the Kashmiris'  stand is just."    The JKLF chief said although he was given on opportunity to  use his right to bail by the Belgian authorities, he refused to  avail himself of the facility because he was a political  prisoner. He said his release was a victory for the oppressed  and the freedom fighters of Kashmir.    Earlier Amanullah Khan was warmly received by hundreds of  his  party workers at the airport when he arrived here from Karachi.  He was brought to the city in a big procession. The  processionists kept raising slogans in favour of independence  for Kashmir.</p>

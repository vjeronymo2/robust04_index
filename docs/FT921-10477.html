			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Technology: Olympic forecasts win gold One of the biggest worries about sporting events is that the weather may not co-operate. At the Winter Olympic Games, which begins on Saturday in Albertville, France, a new forecasting system should remove uncertainty about what is in store for competitors over the next two weeks. Meteo-France is launching a computerised forecasting model which will offer more accurate information than previously possible. The Super-Peridot system will reduce the distance between measuring points from 150 kms on the global statistical model Emeraude to 3.5 kms. Twenty-three Miria automatic weather stations have been set up around the region at altitudes ranging from 333 metres to 3,582 metres to register wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, precipitation and pressure. Calculations are made every four minutes and are taken from 30 levels to take account of the effect the relief has on wind and other factors. This compares with 15 or 20 levels for other systems. The information is gathered from the stations by the weather centre in Lyon-Bron and relayed to the control centre in Albertville either by the European satellite Meteosat or the Transpac packet-switched data network. They are then transmitted for processing by Meteo-France's Cray II supercomputer in Toulouse. When the French meteorological office started work on the system five years ago it faced a difficult task. 'The Savoie region is complicated geophysically, since every valley has a micro-climate,' explained Meteo-France engineer Georges Dhonneur. Moreover, the Games will be spread over nine sites, compared with only three in 1988. Greater precision offered by the system would be useful for agriculture, pollution control, power supply, civil aviation and yacht races among other applications. 'We say that every franc invested in weather forecasting gives a return of FFr165 by preventing losses,' Dhonneur said.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: National Express beats float forecast with Pounds 6.8m IN ITS FIRST results since flotation in December last year National Express, the coach service operator, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.82m for 1992 on turnover of Pounds 120.6m. When it came to the market profits of Pounds 6.5m were forecast. The profit compared with a proforma loss of Pounds 1.2m loss in 1991 after exceptional costs of Pounds 5.5m. Earnings per share for 1992 came out at 16.8p, compared to a flotation forecast of 16.1p. Turnover on continuing activities increased by 3 per cent to Pounds 117.1m (Pounds 113.8m). Mr Ray McEnhill, chief executive, said the improvement in profitability came despite very difficult economic conditions, which affected most parts of the business. The core NEL inter-city scheduled coach business was hardest hit by the recession which has adversely affected many of the company's traditional customers. Passenger journeys fell by 11 per cent from 11.8m to 10.5m. The passenger decline also reflected the company's policy of eliminating unprofitable parts of the route network and the 'increasingly aggressive competition from British Rail'. However NEL's operating profits were almost unchanged at Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.6m) helped by a 6 per cent fare price increase in April and a cost cutting programme which in turn led to a 10 per cent reduction in the workforce early this year. The company is in the middle of a Pounds 5m improvement programme including renovations of the Birmingham and Liverpool coach stations, introducing a computerised reservation system and installing coach-to-base communications systems. Eurolines (UK), the UK member of a pan-European grouping of coach operators, managed a strong performance with turnover up by 13 per cent to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 13.2m) and operating profits increasing to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1m). Airport Coach Services, acquired in October 1991, reported an operating profit of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 100,000 proforma loss) on turnover of Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 6.1m). COMMENT National Express is wisely investing in upgrading its coach station and reservation system infrastructure, both necessary if it is to squeeze more margin out of its low budget passengers. Investing in technology and replacing the antiquated paper system should produce early savings since NEL will no longer have to pay agents 50p per passenger reservation. However margins in the UK long-distance coach market are thin and passenger numbers are unlikely to rise much in 1993. Pre-tax profits this year could rise to about Pounds 7.4m. In the meantime the group has up to Pounds 10m of spare cash in its balance sheet, even after NEL's upgrading programme, and acquisition(s) in related areas look very likely this year.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> GROUP FIGHTS DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Azusa First, a group of residents opposed to the construction of 67 multifamily  units on land next to Azusa Greens Country Club, has begun a petition drive  that could force the City Council to repeal decisions allowing the project or  put the issue on the ballot.  </P> <P> At its Nov. 6 meeting, the council voted to change the zoning on the 8.4-acre  parcel from water conservation to multifamily residential. It also adopted a  resolution to amend the General Plan and approved the design and tentative  tract map proposed by D &amp; D development and developer Johnny Johnson.  </P> <P> The group is circulating two petitions, one against the zone change and one  against the General Plan amendment. If it is successful in gathering the  signatures of 1,413 registered voters by Dec. 6, the council could either  repeal the decisions or submit them to voters in the April election.  </P> <P> Christopher Sutton, the group's attorney, said the zone change goes against an  April, 1988, initiative in which residents voted to keep the golf course and  surrounding lots as recreational areas until 1992.  </P> <P> Last January, however, a court ruled that the 8.4-acre parcel was exempt from  the moratorium imposed by the initiative.  </P> <P> Sutton also said the density of the development is excessive and challenged the  environmental impact report.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin conducted an investigation tour here, soliciting opinions  from all walks of life on the reform and opening up, economic  development and social stability.    On April 26-May 6, Jiang, also general secretary of the  Communist Party Central Committee, visited local state-owned  enterprises, where he had discussions with a number of  enterprise managers on the establishment of a modern enterprise  system in China.    He stressed the important role that large state enterprises  play in establishing and developing a socialist market economic  system, pointing out that the basic way out for state-owned  enterprises lies in the further deepening of reforms.    Conditions are good in Shanghai for carrying out a modern  enterprise system on a trial basis, said Jiang.    He urged the municipal party committee and the local  government to continue to create a favorable environment and  conditions for the reform of enterprises by conducting active  explorations in readjusting the government's functions,  improving the management of state-owned assets, perfecting the  management inside enterprises, establishing a social security  system, perfecting the market system and relieving the  enterprises of excessive burdens.    The work should be well organized and done step by step, he  said.    He called on party committees at various levels to earnestly  study Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and better put it to practice.    In response to the demand of developing a socialist market  economy, Jiang said, great efforts must be placed on the  building of socialist ethics to improve the quality of the  people at large and advance the development of the society on  the whole.    He fully confirmed the achievements of local authorities in  carrying out the national economic guidelines and ensuring good  momentum in the economic development.    Jiang noted that the central authorities will persist firmly  in the policy of opening up and developing Shanghai's Pudong New  Area, the largest economic development zone in China.    The Pudong New Area not only concerns the development of  Shanghai but also is an important symbol of China's reform and  opening policy, Jiang said.    He asked local officials to insist on emancipating their  minds and seeking truth from facts, to maintain and push the  good momentum forward and do better work in the future.</p>

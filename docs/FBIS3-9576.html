			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak  on 24 March on page 1 carries a 400-word commentary by Alena  Gottweisova entitled "The Fifth Rider." The commentary takes  issue with leaflets being distributed in Slovakia by "youngsters  who identify with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]"  and who "demand from the recipients of the leaflets the promise  that they will vote for Vladimir Meciar." According to  Gottweisova, these leaflets portray "a smiling gentleman with a  dollar sign on his pocket making a telephone call to Prague,  Budapest, and Tel Aviv and reporting that `the putsch against  the Slovak nation and state has come off' and that they can thus  come to ransack Slovakia without having to fear resistance." To  "dispel doubts about the identity of this gentleman who is  carrying out orders from abroad," Gottweisova continues, "he  finally introduces himself as `your own Michal Kovac, alias the  president.'" In her commentary, Gottweisova deplores the  "wrath" of the leaflets' authors as well as their "racist  connotation." She describes as "absurd" both the view of  President Kovac as an enemy of Slovakia and the idea that  "Vladimir Meciar's dismissal had been organized in Prague,  Budapest, and Tel Aviv with the intention of destroying  Slovakia."</p>

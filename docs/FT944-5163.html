			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Canadian printer in UK move Quebecor Printing, North America's second-biggest commercial printer, is finally acquiring HunterPrint, the lossmaking UK printer, for about CDollars 3m (USDollars 2.2m). HunterPrint will be Quebecor Printing's first foothold in Britain and it plans further expansion soon, said Mr Pierre Karl Peladeau, president of Quebecor Group and in charge of the Canadian company's European expansion. Quebecor Printing in turn is a subsidiary of the Quebecor Publishing Group based in Montreal and controlled by the Peladeau family. Quebecor has been negotiating to buy HunterPrint for two years. Now it is offering 2p a share for the ordinary shares and a further amount for the preferred. It already has 54 per cent of the ordinary shares committed under its offer. HunterPrint, after a recent asset sale, has annual volume of about CDollars 80m. Quebecor is negotiating with trade creditors and will put new working capital into HunterPrint. Early this year, the auditors of debt-burdened HunterPrint expressed 'fundamental uncertainty' over its prospects as a going concern. In August in an attempt to cut debt, the Corby-based company sold its only active subsidiary, Hardy Printers, to a management buy-out team for Pounds 1.85m (USDollars 2.88m). At the time, the company said that even after the disposal, it would 'only have sufficient working capital for its current requirements through the continued support of its existing bankers'.</p>

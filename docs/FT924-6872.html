			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Inner cities suffer from the drive for cuts: Paul Cheeseright explains the distribution of cash for regeneration MR JOHN REDWOOD, the inner cities minister, has told Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation that funding for its first year of operation will be halved to Pounds 5m. The corporation is the latest of the government's urban regeneration agencies with statutory powers. When the fledgling corporation was conceived last February, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, promised it Pounds 10m a year for five years. With its resources cut, the corporation is being forced to adopt a gradual approach to the development of derelict areas in east Birmingham. It has been caught in the government's drive for economy and is trapped in a continuing shift of emphasis in funding methods. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said at a conference of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the British Urban Regeneration Association this week: 'City Challenge and the Urban Regeneration Agency, together with the urban development corporations, provide the main mechanisms for an effective and flexible approach to urban regeneration.' But details in the Autumn Statement covering urban spending figures show that, of these three 'main mechanisms', only the Urban Regeneration Agency will receive an increased budget in the mid 1990s. The agency will be responsible for handling expenditure on reclaiming derelict land and on assisting private-sector ventures in the inner cities with the administration of City Grant - a system of aid for private-sector ventures in the inner cities. It will be headed by Lord Walker, who as Mr Peter Walker was a Conservative cabinet minister for many years. Some City Grant is now handled by urban development corporations, each of which is responsible for regenerating a designated tract of land. The Autumn Statement figures show that 1992-93 represents the peak of government spending on development corporations. In the next financial year the government will cut spending on development corporations by 33 per cent. But the cuts are not evenly distributed. The development corporations of Bristol, Leeds, Teesside, Trafford Park in Manchester, and Tyne and Wear are understood to be maintaining their 1993-94 budgets at 1992-93 levels. The cuts outside Birmingham Heartlands are believed to have fallen on London Docklands and Merseyside, the first corporations to be established, and on central Manchester, Sheffield and the Black Country, where the financial position is complicated by provisions for roadbuilding. City Challenge spending, however, will increase in 1993-94 and then flatten out for the two following years. City Challenge is an innovation of Mr Heseltine which provides for the 57 local authorities with the most severe urban problems to bid competitively for government funds to assist the regeneration of a small, specific area. There have been two rounds: the first gave the prizes to 11 authorities, the second to 20. Each attracts Pounds 7.5m a year of government money for five years. Provisions for City Challenge from 1993-94 show that: The scheme will not be extended to cover any more areas than those already designated. The money will not cover the total which could be drawn by the authorised City Challenge schemes. 'The government is counting on under-spending, and maybe the failure of a couple of the schemes,' said Mr Victor Hausner of Victor Hausner Associates, which advises the environment department on urban policy. For the first time the environment department has separated City Challenge spending from Urban Programme spending. The Urban Programme, the source of regeneration funds for local authorities, is being steadily reduced. Spending in 1995-96 will be a third of that in 1992-93, City Challenge excluded. This means local authorities which have not succeeded in City Challenge bids have, at first sight, less central government help with urban problems. A clearer focus on that question depends on what happens to the government's new Capital Partnership programme. This allows local authorities, using their capital receipts on urban schemes in partnership with the private sector, to bid for more funding from the government. Such funding would be made available in the form of allowing the authority to borrow. Mr Howard said: 'Our best estimate is that this could generate additional spending power between Pounds 500m and Pounds 600m for capital projects in our 57 urban priority areas.' Capital Partnership may thus offset the fall in the environment department's established urban spending. Once allowances are made for the revenue coming in from the Commission for the New Towns - responsible for selling public assets in the English new towns - the amount will fall from Pounds 838m in 1993-94 to Pounds 552m in 1995-96. But, whatever happens to the figures, it is clear that the greater part of urban spending will be not a response to a particular problem but a response to a competitive bid, with the environment department as the client calling the tenders, the judge of the tenders and the paymaster. It is what the government calls 'targeting' - the need, as Mr Howard put it, 'to target resources to defined opportunities with opportunities that can be realised'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     URBAN SPENDING PLANS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Pounds m   Pounds m  Pounds m  Pounds m                                1992-3     1993-4    1994-5    1995-6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- City Challenge                   64         214       214       214 City Grant                       71          71        71        83 Derelict Land Grant (net)        95          95        95       122 Manchester Olympic bid            1          35        25         0 Urban Programme                 237         176        91        80 Urban Development Corporations and Docklands Light Railway                   491         330       293       284 Other                            28          36        32        24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           987         955       820       806 Less receipts from Commission for New Towns                       294         117       203       254  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Net Total                       692         838       617       552  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Environment  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

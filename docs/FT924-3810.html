			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Kinnock urges Smith to move on electoral reform MR NEIL KINNOCK, the former Labour leader, has expressed support for electoral reform. In a BBC interview to be shown today Mr Kinnock also differs from Mr John Smith, who succeeded him in July, over the pace of reform in the party. Mr Smith spoke in and interview with ITN last night. Mr Kinnock says he wants a change in the electoral system not purely to block the prospect of indefinite Tory rule, but 'because I think it's the only way to ensure that all parts of the country can be properly represented in a party or parties that can form a government'. During the general election campaign he refused to express a view on electoral reform before Labour's commission on constitutional matters reached a conclusion. The commission is due to report in the spring. Mr Kinnock's advice to Mr Smith to push on with changes seems drawn from his own experience. Mr Kinnock says: 'My instinct is that the longer you give yourself with an assembled body of policies the better it is . . . The general thrust must be there and people must be confident about it and the sooner you do it the better.' Mr Smith said, in contrast, that he constantly kept in mind the need 'to pace politics properly'. He added: 'I don't believe that you should rush forward and put everything in your shop window . . . you've got to do the patient and careful work, taking some original thoughts, working them through in practical ways.' He believed his overriding obligation to the Labour party was 'to make sure that we hit our period of maximum effectiveness at the relevant and important point in the political cycle'. Meanwhile, he continued, 'no doubt there will be plenty of parliamentary fireworks, but they are not the most important thing on my agenda.' He has been criticised by some Labour MPs for undue caution. Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich, said recently that the party appeared to be 'substituting a state of anaesthetised torpor for a previous mood of hyperactive aggression'. Ms Clare Short, MP for Birmingham Ladywood, spoke of 'masterful inactivity'.</p>

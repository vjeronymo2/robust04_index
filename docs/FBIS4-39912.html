			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow is warning that if the law on citizenship,  which Latvia's parliament adopted Thursday at its second  reading, comes into effect, "this may seriously complicate  relations between Russia and Latvia," and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin may have to postpone his visit to Riga, Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told Interfax Friday.    Churkin said he hoped that the law on citizenship will not  have an impact on the implementation of the agreements on troop  withdrawal, on the situation of retired Russian servicemen and  on the issue of the radar station in Skrunda signed by the two  countries' presidents in Moscow. He said these agreements were  too important to be affected even by such a serious document as  the law on citizenship.</p>

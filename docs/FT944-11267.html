			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: CBI warning revives fears of tightening - London The 3,100 mark on the FT-SE 100 Index scale is beginning to replace the Berlin Wall in the minds of UK investors. Some large and highly profitable deals are being done in equities, the sale of Elf-Aquitaine's stake in Enterprise Oil providing but one example. But across the broad range of the market, institutional interest remains light and stockbroking firms not on the right networks are finding it hard to make profits in a market which has made virtually no consistent progress since the end of July, and has now returned to its levels of 12 months ago. Strategists at the leading UK securities firms offer little comfort for a break-out in the Footsie range this week. 'Only a tightening of monetary policy (in the US) can have any sustained impact upon the dollar and US Treasuries,' comments NatWest Securities in reviewing the Federal Reserve's activities in currencies. Assuming that this will not happen until after Tuesday's US mid-term elections, the market will continue to worry ahead of the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting on November 15. On the domestic side, NatWest is equally forthright as well as in the mainstream of City belief in emphasising that the Bank of England's inflation report leaves unchanged its forecast that 'base rates will rise another 0.5 per cent early next year'; but it adds that 'it is a close call between then and this week'. The sudden appearance of danger this week is pinned on the Confederation of British Industries warning that industry needs to pass on its higher raw material costs to customers. A rate rise in December, so soon after the budget, is ruled out but NatWest thinks the Bank of England might just elect to raise rates now and ignore the uproar from a market just informed that the Bank feels happier about inflation. The stock market felt mildly affronted last week when the news agencies reported the Bank's inflation views immediately while its reminder on base rate trends led the following morning's newspapers. Sluggish market conditions are beginning to take toll of the the new issues among smaller capitalised stocks, those with flotation capitalisations of Pounds 250m or less. BZW warns that, with more than 55 per cent of its sample of this year's small-cap new issues now trading at or below their flotation price, the institutions are likely to set themselves significantly higher 'quality control' standards in the final quarter of the year. This could imply more attractive new issue possibilities ahead, especially if some of the deals recently pulled make a reappearance. The scale of under-performance by 1994 small-cap new issues can hardly be repeated.</p>

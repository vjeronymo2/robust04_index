			<p>CSO     [Text] The Engineering Research Association for  Super/Hyper-Sonic Transport Propulsion Systems (HYPR) and  overseas aircraft engine manufacturers including General  Electric (GE), USA will begin design work on the overall  structure of the next generation engine to be used for  hypersonic transport planes, which they have been developing  jointly. Since successful completion of the combustion test of  the core engine recently, the Japan-U.S.-European partners will  make a final decision on allocation of responsibilities for  development and design of the details, and begin the design  process. Future prospects for development are somewhat grim,  having been slowed down by budget cuts. But now that the overall  design finally has been approved, the project seems to be a step  closer to commercialization.    To date, various basic technology research, including that  related to turbojets and measurement control systems, has been  conducted. Successful combustion testing of the ``core engine,''  including the compressor, combustor, and high pressure turbine,  persuaded the researchers that their fundamental technology  research has met their goals, and prepared them to proceed to  the overall design phase. The design phase is estimated to last  two years, from FY94-95.    The HYPR includes three Japanese companies,  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy  Industries, Ltd., and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., plus  United Technology (UT), GE, from the United States, Rolls Royce  from the UK, and Snecma from France. Together they have been  developing an engine for hypersonic transport planes. Before the  overall design phase begins, the companies which are responsible  for different components must consult one another in order to  coordinate the interface between their respective components and  finalize allocation of their responsibilities at a general  meeting in May.    One example of this coordination problem is found in  development of the ``ramcombustor'' located at the rear of the  engine which must operate during flight at over Mach 3. KHI,  which is in charge of developing the combustor's ``flame  holder'' and UTC which is in charge of a portion of exterior  plate around the combustor, must agree upon the joint structure  and the number of holes for bolts.    Production of components based on the overall design plan is  scheduled to begin in FY96 at the earliest.    While overall design work is under way a number of  combustion  tests also will be conducted to verify its reliability. In  November, the first combustion tests of the overall turbojet  with a low pressure turbine installed in the core engine will be  conducted.</p>

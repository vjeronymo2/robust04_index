			<p>BFN     [Text] Pavlodar Oblast maslikhat deputies of the standing  commission for social policy matters adopted an appeal to the  Kazakh Supreme Council. It says the oblast inhabitants standard  of living is decreasing, food and goods prices are rising  unstably, and payments of wages and pension are not paid on  time, especially for workers in education, medicine, and  culture. It can be interpreted as a great violation of the  Kazakh law on labor and pension, of which Kazakhstan has signed  the human right declaration. Therefore, it demands the adoption  of a decree by the Supreme Council on payment of wages, pension,  and benefits. In case of delay in payment, the Supreme Council  should also adopt a law to pay additionally for inflation.</p>

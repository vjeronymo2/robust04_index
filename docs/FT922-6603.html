			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Bheki Mseleku - Jazz South African-born pianist Bheki Mseleku is an absorbing and absorbed musician who has attracted a good deal of praise on tour in the UK this year. Rightly so: although his playing skirts the fashionable 'world music' tag attached to so many other black South African expatriates, he nevertheless brings a new un-American dimension to swinging post-bop lines. Having started out with other South African luminaries - Hugh Masekela, Johnny Dyani and Chris MacGregor - it took the attention of New York's M-Basers and an adventurous new record label to bring Mseleku out in his own right. Marvin 'Smitty' Smith, the collective's drummer, spotted Mseleku upstairs at Ronnie Scott's and wound up collaborating on the 37-year-old's debut album, Celebration (World Circuit WC 028). It was Smith, along with fellow Americans Charnett Moffatt (upright bass) and Jean Toussaint (tenor), and English flautist Eddie Parker who joined him at the Elizabeth Hall on the South Bank. Showcasing a selection of Mseleku compositions from the album (which also features saxophonists Courtney Pine and Steve Williamson as well as American bassist Michael Bowie), the quintet swung through soulful pieces like 'Angola', Bheki scatting absent-mindedly, before reverting to the piano trio format and a lip-curling slap bass solo from Moffatt. A thoughtful and sensitive improviser whose volume balance sometimes suffers as a result of his self-contained musing, Mseleku also has the Horace Silver touch for pushing his sidemen along with carefully placed ringing blue notes. The South African's talent cannot miss with this line-up, of course. Moffatt and Smith make for a jumping rhythm section and Parker's (much under-used) virtuosity on two flutes add a delicate edge to Mseleku's rich writing. Ex-Jazz Messenger Toussaint, whose taut tenor parts in 'Monk's Move' had the leader bouncing off his stool, is another World Circuit artist with a new album, What goes around (WC 029), well worth investigating. If the holy trinity of jazz is the swinging and sensitive piano trio, Mseleku extends and strengthens the tradition. Add to the African-tinged soulfulness reeds and flute and you have a quintet for the Nineties.</p>

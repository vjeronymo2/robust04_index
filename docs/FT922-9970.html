			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Lagardere to spell out merger plan today MR Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman of the Hachette publishing empire and the Matra defence and electronics group, will today announce details of the merger of the two companies and a FFr2.8bn (Pounds 280m) recapitalisation and rationalisation programme for Hachette. The shares of both companies have been suspended since last Thursday pending the announcement prompted by problems at Hachette. Hachette is burdened by net debt of about FFr8bn after its US acquisitions in the late 1980s. It made FFr3.5bn losses last year on its ill-fated investment in La Cinq, the bankrupt French television station. The La Cinq losses took such a toll on Hachette's balance sheet that it has asked its banks, including Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, for FFr2.8bn in extra capital. The banks are believed to have agreed in principle. Hachette is expected to issue a combination of new shares and convertible bonds. As a result MMB, which indirectly owns 51 per cent of the equity, would lose its majority holding, but it is expected to retain control of the voting shares. MMB, the holding company through which Mr Lagardere's family controls Hachette and Matra, yesterday announced losses of FFr448.2m in 1991 against net profits of FFr368.2m in 1990. The board proposed to cut the dividend from FFr2.25 to FFr1.5 a share. Hachette last week disclosed a loss of FFr1.93bn for 1991 compared with profits of FFr492m the previous year.</p>

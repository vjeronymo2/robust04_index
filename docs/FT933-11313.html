			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Councils cannot 'opt in' to review PLANS to allow councils to 'opt in' to the review of local government in England have been vetoed by Mr John Major. The proposal from Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to allow councils to vote in favour of being included in the review, was among suggestions for overhauling the re-organisation of local government to the commission chaired by Sir John Banham. Today's edition of the Local Government Chronicle says the prime minister had rejected the idea of making the review voluntary at a meeting with Mr Gummer last week. An announcement on the revision of the review is not now expected until September. Mr Major's main reason, it says, was that putting the later tranches of the review on an optional basis would encourage Scottish and Welsh councils to try to avoid being reviewed. Legislation on Scottish and Welsh local government is due to come forward in the new parliamentary session which starts in November. If the English review had become voluntary, ministers would also have faced considerable political embarrassment in seeming to show such a lack of confidence in a policy intended to be a vote-winner. The Tory election manifesto pledged that a commission would examine 'area by area' the structure of local government in England. The aim was to deliver a council structure that would be popular with local communities and give back self-governance to cities such as Bristol and Leicester. So far, however, the commission has aroused controversy in each of the four areas for which it has announced its proposals. Even without the option of setting proportions of local councils in any one area which would have to vote in favour of the review to be included in it, there is still considerable scope for changing the form of the next four tranches of the commission's work by altering its policy guidance. Significant changes that seem likely are setting new ways of assessing cost effectiveness and measuring local community identity.</p>

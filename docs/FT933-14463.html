			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Takeovers sink to a 25-year low MERGER activity last year fell to its lowest level in the Takeover Panel's 25-year history. The panel's annual report, published yesterday, said that in the year to March 31 there were 88 takeover or merger proposals, down from 142 the previous year. The highest number in one year was 436 in 1971-72. The annual average is 225. The fall in the number of takeovers had enabled staff cuts to be made, said Mrs Frances Heaton, the panel's director-general. The panel regulates takeovers of publicly owned companies through the application of the Takeover Code. It is also consulted on cases which do not lead to published offers. The number of such cases rose from 116 in 1991-92 to 141 in 1992-93, suggesting that companies were more likely to back away from proposed deals. Several financial restructurings of troubled companies have been carried out, leading to the panel adjudicating on a larger number of 'whitewashes' - where shareholders taking more than 30 per cent of a company's equity and acting in concert are exempted from making a full bid for the company. These have arisen mainly where groups of banks have agreed to convert a company's debt into equity, and as a result have more than 30 per cent of the company's shares. Mrs Heaton said the panel had tried to treat these conversions 'as pragmatically as possible'. She also referred to the panel's statement last August on 'off the record' comments made during takeover bids by a company or its advisers. This came after TI Group's successful bid for Dowty Group in June. The Panel censured two Dowty advisers, one for giving a profit forecast to analysts which could not be substantiated under the Code. Mrs Heaton said: 'This subject remains of great concern to the panel.' She added that if speculation arose in the stock market or the press during a bid, the panel might require the appropriate company to make a statement either substantiating, or disassociating itself from, the speculation to prevent a false market developing.

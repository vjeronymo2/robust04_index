			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. Embassy official  has confirmed that the ASSOCIATED PRESS (AP) story on May 21  claiming that China is "exporting prison-made products to the  United States" was groundless, said an executive from the  Chinese Ministry of Justice here today.    In accordance with relevant articles of the Memorandum of  Understanding on the Prohibition of Import and Export of  Prison-Made Products, signed by the Chinese Government and the  U.S. Government, Chinese judicial departments arranged a visit  by two officials from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to the No. 4  prison in east China's Zhejiang Province and other units from  May 19 to 21. Prison officials answered questions from the U.S.  officials and provided them with relevant materials.    There was no evidence during their visit that shows China  had  violated the memorandum of understanding, the ministry official  said.    However, in his article AP reporter John Leicester claimed  that "U.S. officials had information that the camps were  exporting prison-made goods to the United States..."    In reponse to a Chinese Ministry of Justice official's  inquiries, Lorraine Toly, first secretary for press of the U.S.  Information Service of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said in a  letter yesterday that AP reporter John Leicester had made  "errors" in his article.    She said that "what I said was that if U.S. customs  officials  receive information that a Chinese prison might be exporting  prison- made goods to the United States, they then contact the  Chinese authorities to ask to inspect the prison.    "This explanation became in his article: `Toly said U.S.  officials had information that the camps were exporting  prison-made goods to the United States...'"    The U.S. official said: "I was annoyed by this article when  I  read it last week." She said: "I will call ASSOCIATED PRESS and  complain."    In the letter, she also said that she was "sorry for any  confusion this article might have caused."    The Justice Ministry official stressed that the Chinese  Government has been implementing the Sino-U.S. memorandum on the  prohibition of import and export of prison-made goods in a  serious, responsible and effective way.    He pointed out that the letter from the U.S. Embassy  official  showed that the May 21 AP report by John Leicester was a sheer  distortion of facts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Trench" newscast] </F>   [Text] At a seminar hosted by the Institute for Democracy  and the Development of Latin America, General Humberto Ortega  said the Army is a stabilizing factor in Nicaragua. He added  that those who favor a reduction in the military budget, as well  as those who favor the elimination of the Army, are seeking  chaos and war in the country.    During a seminar at the Olof Palme Convention Center to  review civilian-military relations, an event that is continuing  today, Gen. Ortega, in one of his usual abrupt remarks, said the  EPS [Sandinist People's Army] is a stabilizing factor in  Nicaragua. Without the EPS, he added, there would be chaos and  war in the country. He was criticizing those who favor a  reduction in the Army's budget.    In his statements, one can see Ortega's zeal to control  power  in a more complete and hegemonic way. Meanwhile, Dr. Lino  Hernandez of the Permanent Commission for the Defense of Human  Rights said what is happening in Haiti could happen here.    [Begin recording] [Hernandez] Ortega noted that those  seeking  to alter the current state of the Army or the way the it is  organized right now are attacking the country. In other words,  he is saying, there can be no changes here unless he or the  military leaders accept them. I expected a different position  from him at this seminar, because there are many international  personalities taking part in it. These people expect the  military to be remain subordinate to civilian authorities. In  turn, we expected Gen. Ortega to express a different position,  but he took the opportunity to be very blunt. He expressed the  Army's view, saying that the Army here cannot be altered. In  fact, he even threatened an economist clearly referring to him.  He said: There is an economist who is saying that the Army's  budget must be reduced. Well, this is a direct threat. Ortega  is telling him that he must be quiet.    Ortega's position shows there is a long way to go in this  country to attain what the Nicaraguan people want, which is a de  jure state -- a system that will include the subordination of  the military to civilian authorities.    [Reporter] It seems that he wants to remain in the Army  forever, giving up the possibility of becoming a presidential  candidate.    [Hernandez] When these politicians try to wrap themselves in  power -- and here, Ortega speaks like a true politician -- they  become very dangerous. We cannot stop thinking or predicting  that one day Gen. Ortega might decide to seize control, and who  is going to tell him no at a time when foreign intervention is  practically nonexistent?    Aristide was ousted in Haiti. The U.S. Government says it is  against it, and yet the situation continues. It has been more  than two years since the Haitian coup.    Unfortunately, we feel there is an attempt to control power  in an increasingly hegemonic and complete way, and we must be  alert to this. We must prevent men like Generals Ortega and  Somoza from trying to control all power in the country. [end  recording]</p>

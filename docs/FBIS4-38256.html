			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sophia 'Amarah from Gaza] </F>   [Text] A meeting was held at the Eretz checkpoint today  between Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian negotiating  team, and Major General Dani Rothschild, his new Israeli  counterpart.    Monte Carlo radio interviewed the member of the Palestinian  National Authority [PNA] immediately after the meeting.    [Begin recording] ['Amarah] Dr. Sha'th: What topics were  discussed during the meeting?    [Sha'th] We discussed all outstanding issues. Moreover, we  planned for future talks. I can say that today's meeting marked  a real beginning for the second phase. It was also in  preparation for the meeting between President 'Arafat on the one  hand, and Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres on the  other, due to be held in Paris on 7 July. It was an important  meeting for the overall peace process. We discussed the issue  of detainees and prisoners. I have informed Maj. Gen.  Rothschild that we have chosen Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, a freed  prisoner, to be the chairman of the Palestinian committee  assigned the task of holding negotiations on Palestinian  detainees and prisoners. All members of this committee will be  freed detainees and prisoners. Additionally, we agreed on a  good first step for the negotiating process. Nonetheless, I  cannot divulge details. This is because I will go to President  'Arafat first to seek his approval of this prelude before it is  announced.    ['Amarah] Has a date been set for the resumption of talks?    [Sha'th] This is also contingent upon the venue and time,  which have to be decided by President 'Arafat first.    ['Amarah] Israeli Minister of Environmental Protection Yosi  Sarid, who took part in the meeting, has said that he attended  the meeting to find out how the agreement will be implemented on  the ground, and also to find out about the problems facing the  agreement. He expressed his belief that there must be a rapid  transfer of powers to the PNA in the occupied West Bank, with  the exception of settlements, Jerusalem, and safe roads, as he  put it.

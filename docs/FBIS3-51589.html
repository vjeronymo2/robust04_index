			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister Admiral Radames Munoz Leon and  other members of the military High Command who met with their  Colombian counterparts returned home Wednesday night. Munoz met  with Colombian Acting Defense Minister General Ramon Gil  Bermudez and other ranking officers.    General Jose Tagliaferro D'Lima, Venezuelan Army commander,  and General Pedro Jose Romero Farias, Venezuelan National Guard  [NG] commander, accompanied the defense minister on the trip to  the Colombian city of Bucaramanga. Division General Jose de la  Cruz Pineda, chief of the Directorate of Military Intelligence  [DIM], and Brigadier General Fernan Eurroso Fuenmayor, chief of  Cofan [expansion unknown], were on hand to welcome the  Venezuelan mission. These two officers worked out the details  of the agreements on the exchange of intelligence information  between the two armed forces based on a draft prepared by DIM.    The two ministers reviewed the work conducted by officers of  the Colombian military and police forces and Venezuelan National  Armed Forces [FAN] officers. They pledged to create a standing  officers committee to review compliance and monitor the  agreements signed. The committee will immediately handle any  situation that may arise in the performance of military and  police functions in the two countries.    It was reported that the Colombian military and police  representatives created a very cordial climate, indicating that  "not even the statements by Colombian politicians and demagogues  would create problems in the close relations of cooperation  between them." During the course of the meeting, the NG  helicopter that had crashed in Colombia was returned. The  helicopter had been held in Colombia and not one Venezuelan  representative was allowed to witness or participate actively in  the investigation of the crash, as the laws mandate.    Thus, simultaneous work by the military forces of the two  countries will continue as it is now with each side working on  its territory, although stress was placed on continuous exchange  of military information to fight criminals who operate along  Venezuela's enormous border with Colombia.    There was no information, much less confirmation, from the  Colombian officers on the statement made to the media by the  Colombian Army commander. Oddly enough, the Colombian officers  and police chiefs did not present the list, ranks, or  intelligence reports that reportedly demonstrate that a group of  NG officers sold FAN weapons to Colombian guerrillas. They did  not present a list of serial numbers of the alleged FAN weapons  that the Colombian military had found or seized from Colombian  guerrillas, as had been reported.</p>

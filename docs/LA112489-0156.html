			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> PHOENIX'S COACH TO SWITCH QBS  </P> <P> Phoenix Cardinals interim head Coach Hank Kuhlmann has decided to change  quarterbacks and will give second-year pro Tom Tupa his second career NFL start  in Sunday's game here against Tampa Bay.  </P> <P> Kuhlmann, a fourth-year assistant who took over Monday for the fired Gene  Stallings, said he asked offensive coordinator Jim Shofner for a recommendation  Wednesday and Shofner suggested Tupa.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-4 Tupa, a third-round draft pick in 1988 out of Ohio State, made his  first career start here Oct. 15 against the Eagles and completed 14 of 41  passes for 266 yards. But he also threw six interceptions and was sacked six  times in a 17-5 loss.  </P> <P> In last week's 37-14 road loss to the Rams, Stallings benched Gary Hogeboom  early and Tupa completed 7 of 12 passes for 114 yards and one TD before rookie  Tim Rosenbach finished up in his NFL debut.  </P></p>

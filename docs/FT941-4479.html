			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Macedonian embargo plea Macedonia appealed to Greece to lift its embargo on the small former republic of Yugoslavia following the first round of United Nations-sponsored talks in Geneva, headed by Mr Cyrus Vance. In a draft accord given to Mr Carolos Papoulias and Mr Stevo Crvenkovski, the foreign ministers of Greece and Macedonia respectively, Mr Vance spelt out how and under what conditions Greece could lift its embargo in return for Macedonia making some concessions over its flag, and its constitution. Despite signs earlier this week of a breakthrough, it appears that Greece and Macedonia remain divided over the dispute. Judy Dempsey.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROKEN WRISTS, SICKNESS LED TO CONFESSION, HIJACK SUSPECT SAYS  </P> <P> Fawaz Younis, a Lebanese militiaman charged with hijacking in a case that tests  recent U.S. anti-terrorism legislation, told jurors Monday that the pain of two  broken wrists and seasickness led him to confess while without legal counsel to  FBI agents who snared him in international waters off Cyprus.  </P> <P> "I was placed in a very sensitive position," he said. "I did not know what  would become of me." He said he was so sick that "I would do anything so  (authorities would) leave me alone."  </P> <P> Speaking through an interpreter, Younis described how an American doctor  provided him only with ice for his broken and tightly manacled wrists until  after he had signed his confession.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Events Before Skyjacking  </P> <P> In riveting detail, he also outlined events leading to the 1985 skyjacking of  Royal Jordanian Flight 402 in Beirut, Lebanon. He described how, in the midst  of clashes between Shiite and Palestinian gunmen in Beirut, he was summoned by  a commander of Lebanon's Amal Shiite militia and told that he would hijack a  plane the next day.  </P> <P> The defense's case rests largely on evidence that Younis followed what he  thought were legitimate military orders from superiors who are recognized  political and military officials. Amal is headed by Lebanese Justice Minister  Nabih Berri. As Younis and earlier prosecution witnesses testified, Amal also  works in West Beirut alongside the Lebanese Army in protecting key facilities,  such as the airport and American University of Beirut.  </P> <P> On June 10, Younis said, he was ordered by Amal military commander Akel Hamiyeh  to hijack a plane to Tunis, where Arab League foreign ministers were to meet  the next day to debate the Shiite-Palestinian fighting. While he and four  others were held incommunicado overnight, Younis was handed a statement to be  read on arrival in Tunis, demanding the Palestinians' removal from Lebanon  because the Amal feared that the presence of Palestine Liberation Organization  guerrillas might provoke strikes by neighboring Israel.  </P> <P> He testified that he was chosen to head the mission because: "I always carried  out any military order given to me without exception. They trusted me not to  harm civilians."  </P> <P> Asked by Francis D. Carter, his court-appointed defense attorney, what would  happen to him if he had refused, Younis told of another Amal member who was  shot through both legs for turning down an assignment. Judge Aubrey Robinson  Jr. interjected to ask what assignment Younis meant. "To participate in the  fighting," Younis replied.  </P> <P> He said he did not pick the jet to be hijacked. "It was selected by the  military commander. It was the only plane taking off in the morning . . . so it  would get to Tunis before the meeting started."  </P> <P> Carter has sought to portray Younis as a victim of Lebanon's 14 years of civil  strife. Younis told how his 2- and 5-year-old sons are named for brothers  killed in sectarian fighting. He will be cross-examined today in the case,  which is expected to go to the jury this week.  </P></p>

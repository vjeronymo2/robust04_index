			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAN TIMES FOR FOREIGN MOVIES  </P> <P> I am frustrated by the ever-shrinking availability of foreign-language films in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Imagine how I felt when I experienced the same problem when visiting France a  year ago. The triplex in Avignon offered a choice of (1) a Rambo movie, (2)  Mickey Rourke and (3) Schwarzenegger. If you can't find a French film in  France, where then?  </P> <P> ROXANE ALKASLASSY  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

In an unusually frank interview, Merkel admitted that in the  four years since reunification, her party, the CDU [Christian  Democratic Union], had made a number of mistakes, particularly  in the east, which threatened to damage its chances seriously in  the l9 elections it faces this year.    "A headwind is blowing hard into our faces," she said, in a  reference to the political climate in eastern Germany. "My  biggest fear is that voters may find the experience of democracy  so repugnant that they will stay away from the polls."    Merkel, an east German MP who is also minister for women and  youth affairs in the Federal Government in Bonn, was speaking in  the run-up to the CDU conference in Hamburg, at which strategy  for Germany's election marathon will be decided.    There is disillusionment with all parties in eastern  Germany,  but opinion polls have shown that Kohl's party could not expect  to win more than 30 percent of votes in the region if a general  election were held now.    Merkel blamed the drop in the CDU's popularity in the east  on  the initial "very high" expectations over German reunification.  But the east Germans were not necessarily justified, she said,  in thinking that they had been given a false promise by Kohl  when he assured them in a pre-l990 election speech that their  region would soon be a "blossoming landscape."    Merkel said: "We have made the landscape blossom as much as  possible in the amount of time available. But the process is  taking longer than anyone expected. There is disappointment in  many areas. It is going to be a much more difficult election  than before."    She admitted that the government had made a mistake by  failing to stress that reunification would also bring widespread  unemployment to eastern Germany, together with a western system  of bureaucracy which failed fully to recognise east German  qualifications.    Unemployment and insecurity about the future are considered  to be among the main reasons for the decline in the CDU's  popularity. Last week unemployment in Germany as a whole reached  a postwar record of more than four million, and 17 percent of  eastern Germany's workforce are without jobs. Most analysts  maintain that if the CDU loses large numbers of eastern votes in  Germany's October general election it will be ousted from power  in Bonn or forced into a coalition with the opposition Social  Democrats.    Merkel also conceded that her party had failed to stress the  sacrifices of reunification early enough in western Germany,  which obliged voters to cut back their high living standards.  "One of the main problems is that neither the Chancellor nor  any economic institute realised how bad a state the east German  economy was in at the time of reunification," she said. "But  what was the alternative: should we have said no to  reunification?"    Merkel insisted that the CDU would not waver from its  pro-Maastricht course and a commitment to widening EU membership  eastwards -- despite opinion poll showing that around 72 percent  of the German electorate was opposed to the Maastricht Treaty's  provisions.    However, she conceded that part of the blame for the lack of  enthusiasm for Europe lay in Bonn's failure to conduct an open  debate, Danish style, on the issue.    She indicated that her party had been hit badly by the  public  controversy last year over Steffen Heitmann, the Saxon justice  minister and the CDU's initial choice of candidate for the  German presidency. Heitmann was forced out of the running  because of criticism about his views on women, the Holocaust,  and Europe.    But there is to be no let-up, she hinted, in the CDU's  efforts to discredit Johannes Rau, the opposition SPD's  presidential candidate, by insinuating that he had been  supported by East Germany's communist regime.    Rau is the most popular choice among many Germans to replace  Richard von Weizsacker as president in elections this May. He  has been accused by the CDU of wanting to shut down a west  German centre monitoring human rights abuses in the former East  Germany, in return for communist support.    Merkel underlined that the CDU had no special recipe  designed  to win votes: "We can only say what we have done and how we  intend to carry on. I remain optimistic. If people don't  accept that they can vote for someone else."</p>

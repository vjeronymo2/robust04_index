			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU deals with the German-French  summit, noting: The spring storms in both countries' relations  have abated. Nothing is left of the irritations over Germany's  nonparticipation in the Normandy celebrations, the differences  on European policy, and the questions about the future path of  united Germany in Europe. The course of the consultation  meeting in Alsace has made it clear that both governments will  unerringly continue their close cooperation for the benefit of  both countries and for further European construction. This does  not mean that in the future there will not be any new  contentious issues, about which brains will be racked in Bonn  and Paris. However, both are willing to solve such conflicts,  FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU says.    SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG notes: One of the results is the  decisions to combat xenophobia more systematically than so far.  The German side praises this as success. However, there are  silent differences, which are not mentioned in communiques,  because the French are only moderately enthusiastic about the  attempt to distribute a problem, which public opinion mainly  feels to be a German burden, on several shoulders. The European  Union [EU] presidency, which Germany and France will take over  for six months each as of 1 July, is to be used to make the EU  more dynamic. The Germans want to begin with improving Europe's  competitiveness by, among other things, striving for a reduction  of ancillary wage costs. Mitterrand, however, has always been  rather loath of agreeing to something that basically means a  reduction of social benefits, SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG points out.    FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE advocates the following view: The  busy activities that were presented in Mulhouse with a view to  the double EU presidency, should not cover up the fact that  European policy is entering a period of calm. The Maastricht  Treaty has been concluded. France begins to overcome the  uncertainty, which had affected the politicians in Paris after  the upheaval in Europe. Whatever Kohl and the  Mitterrand-Balladur couple intend for their presidency -- the  Bundestag election campaign here and the competition for  Mitterrand's succession over there will dominate political  activities over the next few months, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE  summarizes.    NEUE ZEIT from Berlin notes: Once again a German-French  summit has ended in agreement -- surprisingly, one must say,  because one of the main issues, namely bringing the East  European states closer to the EU, has so far been considered a  contentious issue. However, suddenly it seems to have been  settled, after President Mitterrand has come out in favor of  expansion to the East without any deductions and compromises.  In Paris, pragmatism has won out, since there are still many  years between the yes to acceptance and the actual expansion,  NEUE ZEIT says.</p>

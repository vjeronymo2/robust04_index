			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Fan Yingli (2868 5391 0448)] </F>   [Text] Urumqi, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- In 1993, Xinjiang has  made considerable progress in various economic sectors,  including industrial and agricultural production, opening up to  the outside world, infrastructural construction projects, and  development of natural resources. Xinjiang's 1993 GNP is  expected to increase about 10 percent over that of 1992, and  revenue income from various localities will rise 33.1 percent  over that of 1992. Relatively sizable increases have been  registered in total industrial and agricultural output, total  foreign trade value, influx of foreign funds, and total  investment in fixed assets.    Rural reform has enormously raised the productivity in  agricultural and pastoral areas. Xinjiang has registered  another bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry for  the 16th consecutive year in 1993. Total grain and cotton  output are expected to reach 7 million and 700,000 tonnes  respectively. The agricultural sector has begun to rapidly gear  toward the market economy. Farming endeavors and the industrial  sector have undergone relatively extensive restructuring.  Productive and efficient agricultural projects yielding  high-quality products have begun to appear in Xinjiang.    The continued implementation of Xinjiang's policy on opening  up its border areas has enabled Xinjiang to open wider to the  outside world. In 1993, Xinjiang's total foreign trade value  was $910 million, increase 30.6 percent over that of 1992. The  value of foreign trade transacted by Xinjiang's border areas  amounted to $580 million or 63.6 percent of Xinjiang's total  foreign trade value, up 82 percent over that of 1992.    Xinjiang's most outstanding achievement has been the  development of its natural resources. Surveying and exploration  for oil and gas in Junggar, Tarim, and Turpan-Hami Basin have  reported a series of major breakthroughs. Xinjiang's crude oil  output has surpassed 10 million tonnes for the first time in  1993, and its capacity to process crude oil has reached 7.65  million tonnes. The results of exploring for nonferrous metals  have been remarkable, and exploration for natural resources has  also yielded a series of encouraging accomplishments.  Exploration and development of underground resources have  reached large-scale and advanced levels.    Xinjiang's comprehensive economic progress has brought more  and more benefits to the people of various nationalities. In  1993, Xinjiang's peasants and herdsmen per capita annual income  was 780 yuan, increase 5.4 percent over that of 1992. Urban  residents' income also rose relatively noticeably.</p>

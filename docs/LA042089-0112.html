In Washington, meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Samuel  K. Skinner told the Senate that industry plans for dealing with an Alaskan oil  spill had been a "zero" on a scale of one to 10. Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.),  chairman of the environmental protection subcommittee, said the response to the  spill has demonstrated "a complete breakdown" of the procedures that were  supposed to have been in effect since the federal government approved the  Alaskan pipeline 16 years ago.  </P></p>

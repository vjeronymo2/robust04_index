			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Surveys arouse oil surplus fears THREE SURVEYS published yesterday estimated oil production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries at more than 25.1m b/d in October, arousing fears that production may outstrip demand this quarter. However, the news had little impact on a market which had already seen oil prices fall almost Dollars 1.50 in 10 days. Brent crude for December delivery ended yesterday at Dollars 19.42 1/2 a barrel, up 12.5 cents from Friday, but well off the Dollars 20.80 it reached in mid-October. Petroleum Argus magazine estimated Opec production at 25.18m barrels a day, Platt's Week at 25.21m b/d, and Paris-based Petrostrategies magazine at 25.3m b/d. Nervousness about the possibility of excess production had already taken hold of the market last week. Traders said no single factor seemed to be depressing prices, but rather a combination of rumours and suspicions. Reports circulated that Kuwait was pushing for rapid expansion of its crude capacity towards 2m b/d. Kuwait is at present producing about 1.3m b/d, while Iran announced a one-week increase in production last month from about 3.5m b/d to 4m barrels a day to test new production capacity. There was further speculation about the possible return of Iraq to the export market. Iraq was banned by the United Nations from exporting oil after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Recent remarks by the head of the UN commission on Iraq, together with the possibility of victory for Mr Bill Clinton in the US election, aroused fears that Iraq might return sooner than expected. On Friday, rumours hit the market that Saudi Arabia planned to raise its output to 8.8m b/d this month - rumours which the kingdom was quick to squash. Analysts had previously been forecasting a tight market this winter. This had pushed Brent crude close to Dollars 21 a barrel in October, with predictions that it might reach Dollars 22 during the winter. With some forecasters predicting a colder-than-normal winter, and world oil stocks at a four-year low, the weather was seen as the factor most likely to affect prices. The recent slide has damaged that confidence. But analysts insist that the fundamentals are still strong. 'I must emphasise I think supply and demand are nowhere near as out-of-kilter as this price would suggest,' said Mr Mehdi Varzi, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the London brokers. Mr Varzi believed the underlying reason for the price fall might be lack of direction from Opec. Many traders were nervous when the communique at Opec's last meeting referred to agreement on a 'market share' rather than the more usual 'production ceiling'. 'People hate cartels, but in most commodity markets there is someone who guides the price. The last Opec meeting did not give a clear signal,' Mr Varzi said.</p>

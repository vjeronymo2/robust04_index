			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: COWBOYS SIGN UNHAPPY SOLOMON  </P> <P> Linebacker Jesse Solomon signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a large pay cut  Thursday and participated in an afternoon workout.  </P> <P> After practice, he blasted the Cowboys for not trading him, criticized the  team's take-it-or-leave-it offer and even refused to shake owner Jerry Jones'  hand.  </P> <P> Solomon had been holding out since he turned down an offer reportedly worth $2  million over three years. He said he reluctantly signed a two-year deal that  will pay him $170,000 for the remainder of this season and $375,000 in 1991.  Last year, he earned $460,000.  </P> <P> The NFL's trading deadline was Tuesday, forcing Solomon either to accept the  Cowboys' offer or to sit out the rest of the season.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 12 HOMELESS PASADENA FAMILIES RELOCATED  </P> <P> Twelve Pasadena families removed Friday night from a roach- and rat-infested  apartment building have found permanent new quarters within a mile of their old  home, city officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Pasadena Fire Chief Kaya Pekerol said the city used nearly $17,000 in emergency  funds to relocate the mainly Latino, low-income residents, who will receive  federal rent subsidies in their new homes.  </P> <P> Pekerol said the relocated residents need furniture, and donations are being  accepted by the city under the Raymond Relocation Fund.  </P> <P> The 48 residents were moved out of their apartment building at 543 N. Raymond  Ave. after the city declared it a public nuisance and a safety hazard. Owner  David O. Howard was ordered to make repairs and may have to contribute toward  the relocation costs, Pekerol said.  </P></p>

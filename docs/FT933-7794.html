			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Ransomes suffers downturn to Pounds 1.2m RANSOMES, the grass cutting machinery maker, yesterday announced interim results which, according to Mr John Kerridge, the new chairman, represented a setback in its recovery programme. At the pre-tax level profits for the six months to end-June fell from a restated Pounds 1.84m to Pounds 1.21m on the back of a 12 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 89.7m. However, after adjusting for exchange rate differences, the turnover increase was only 1 per cent. Operating profits declined from Pounds 6.24m to Pounds 5.4m and losses per share widened from 2.6p to 4.4p. Payment of a dividend on the convertible preference shares, due on October 31, has been postponed. The company's ordinary shares fell 5p to 19p. Commercial grass machinery sales increased to Pounds 48.3m (Pounds 46.4m) but at constant exchange rates declined by 9 per cent. The principal shortfall arose in the US, which was adversely affected by a continuing sluggish economy and adverse weather conditions. The French market showed a significant decline while the performance in the UK was flat with 'no evidence of any economic recovery affecting the group's markets.' Exports, however, were 'encouraging' with signs of markets in the Far East showing continued growth. At the operating level, profits of the commercial grass machinery activities fell from Pounds 3.98m to Pounds 2.4m, while those of the consumer side improved from Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.96m. With all divisions showing improvements, sales of the consumer division advanced by 30 per cent to Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 25.5m), or 23 per cent after adjusting for exchange rate movements. For the 1992 year better grass growing conditions helped Ransomes swing from losses of Pounds 4.6m to profits of Pounds 900,000 pre-tax on turnover 6.7 per cent ahead at Pounds 156.6m. At the half year end the group's bankers remained fully supportive of the measures being adopted by the board. Mr Kerridge joined Ransomes late last year after retiring for health reasons as deputy chairman of Fisons.</p>

Some 47 percent of  employed Spaniards over the age of 15 supported the strike  called by the Workers Commissions and the General Workers Union.  The population are divided in assessing whether the strike did  or did not represent a success for the trade unions, but in any  event they believe it is the government which was damaged most:  65 percent of the public believe the strike has damaged the  image of Felipe Gonzalez' government. This is the overall  conclusion of a snap opinion poll conducted by Demoscopia for EL  PAIS on Thursday [27 January].    The percentage of interviewees who believe that the protest  was beneficial for the trade unions' image is twice that of  those who believe it has harmed them -- 45 percent, as against  22 percent. On the other hand, those who believe that the  strike has damaged the government's image total 65 percent.  Only 2 percent of those polled believe the government's image  has benefited, while 17 percent believe it has not been  affected. The government is thus perceived by the Spanish  people as the main loser in a strike which was not observed by  an absolute majority of the working population.    With respect to the observance of the protest, 47 percent of  Spanish workers over the age of 15 went on strike, as against 50  percent who did not do so. The remaining 3 percent did not  answer the question. These figures represent a sharp contrast  with those for the 14 December 1988 general strike.    At that time, according to the Demoscopia poll figures, the  percentage of the working population who supported the strike  was put at 75 percent; thus the participation on this occasion  was almost 30 percent lower than at that time. In the current  poll, the estimate of the level of observance of the strike was  made, on the one hand, by asking the interviewees who said that  they were working (and who represent 40 percent of the sample)  whether or not they went on strike, and, on the other, asking  all the interviewees whether those over the age of 15 and in  employment living in their homes observed the strike.    Thus, on the basis of the 800 interviews conducted (40  percent with people working, 11 percent with people unemployed  or seeking their first job, and 49 percent with nonworking  people), it was possible to gather information on the employment  status and the attitudes toward the strike of a total of 919  people, which represents a sound basis for estimating the true  extent of the strike.  <H5>  Success or Failure </H5>   Some 76 percent of the workers voting for United Left  supported the strike, as against 58 percent of the workers  voting for the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], and 24  percent of those voting for the People's Party.    Although a majority (specifically, 45 percent of those  polled) believe the strike will serve no purpose, the majority  reaction now, as happened after 14 December [1988], is that the  government should negotiate new labor market reform with the  trade unions. Such is the opinion of 58 percent of the Spanish  people, a percentage which rises to 66 percent among United Left  voters and 65 percent among PSOE voters.    Public opinion is divided over the trade unions' success  with  their protest: 37 percent of those interviewed believe that  they had "a great deal" or "a fair amount," as against 34  percent, who believe "little" or "none." Only among workers who  voted for United Left are those who believe in the trade unions'  success an absolute majority (68 percent).    The main reasons why the interviewees believe citizens went  on strike are, in the first place, in order to protest against  the way in which government is being conducted (44 percent say  so), and, next, fear of the pickets and public disorder  (mentioned by 35 percent). Only 27 percent believe that those  who did not go to work Thursday did so because they agree with  what the trade unions say. The dominant perception in society  thus seems to be that this was more a strike against the  government than in support of the main trade unions.    Even among those who supported the strike, the reason cited  most often to explain their stance is opposition to the way in  which government is being conducted. This confirms the  predominantly antigovernment protest character which this strike  seems to have had for everybody.</p>

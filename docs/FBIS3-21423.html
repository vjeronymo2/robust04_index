Reacting to the recent speech of Ms Robin Raphel, U.S.  assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, in  Washington, an official spokesman in a strongly-worded statement  said such references "tend to provide encouragement to Pakistan  and terrorists sustained by them to continue with their violent  activities" in Jammu and Kashmir.    He asserted that "no comparison can be drawn between the  situation in Afghanistan and Jammu and Kashmir."    He said the situation in Afghanistan was a by-product of the  cold war whereas Jammu and Kashmir had been facing a massive  campaign of terrorism aided and abetted by Pakistan. "The only  link between Afghanistan and Jammu and Kashmir is that weapons  and mercenaries have moved from both Afghanistan and Pakistan  in support of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir."    The spokesman said such references by U.S. officials were  "unhelpful and hinder resumption of the democratic political  process and a return to normalcy (in Jammu and Kashmir) which  the Government of India is striving to bring about."</p>

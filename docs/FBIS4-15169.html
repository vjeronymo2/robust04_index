			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Makhrin: "Soviet Power in Krasnaya Presnya"] </F>   [Text] The city of Moscow's Krasnopresnenskiy Rayon Soviet  presidium has adopted a decision to resume the activities of  this organ of power. The decision notes that using his  unconstitutional edicts, Yeltsin abolished the lawfully elected  organs of representative power. The elections to the municipal  soviets were fixed for March, then June, and now it is planned  to put them off until the fall. But local self-government has  been put entirely in the hands of an army of bureaucrats. You  get the impression that this has been done on purpose.    The decision says that having become defenseless, Krasnaya  Presnya residents are appealing for help from their deputies  whose powers remain effective until 1995. In connection with  this, the rayon soviet's activities resumed as of 28 March. It  will hold consultations for Muscovites on legal questions and  questions of housing, defend people's rights in the courts, and  publicly monitor the executive branch's doings which are at  present unchecked.    A public office for the rayon soviet has been set up.  Sessions of the rayon soviet and its inner soviet should resume  work in the space of a month. It has been decided to halt their  activities only after the election in Moscow of the municipal  soviets.    It has been reported to the editorial office that Rayon  Soviet Chairman Aleksandr Krasnov has already been summoned to  the city prosecutor's office, where there is concern about the  rayon soviet's having resumed its activities.</p>

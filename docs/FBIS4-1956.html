			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the station reporter's dispatch from  the press briefing held on 15 March by the province's branch  office of the People's Bank of China, by the end of February  this year the province's volume of saving deposits made by both  urban and rural residents surpassed the record of 100 billion  yuan and reached 101.36 billion yuan. It ranked the province  fifth among the provinces across the country, which have scored  the volume of over 100 billion yuan in residents' bank saving  deposits and include Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei.  The current number of financial institutions in charge of  saving deposit business or in acting of this business reaches  more than 1,400 that have accommodated more than 90,000  full-time or part-time personnel. The number of saving deposit  categories has increased from the several in the 1970's to more  than 20 at present. These financial institutions have also  provided more rooms for customers to select the bank's catalogue  for saving deposits.    Cong Zhenglong, vice governor of the province, delivered a  speech at the press briefing, in which he said: The large-scale  increase of saving deposits made by both urban and rural  residents has expanded the bank resources of funds, reinforced  the capability of financial departments in releasing credits and  loans, and provided the strong and effective guarantee of funds  for promoting the economic development in the province. He  said: 1994 is a year in which the province will make a crucial  step in the reform of financial systems. Along with gradually  accelerating the pace of turning the specialized bank business  into commercial one, the position occupied by saving deposits in  handling credits and loans by the financial institutions will  become more important. Therefore, financial institutions should  seize the current favorable opportunity to launch a large-scale  propaganda campaign on saving deposits and to mobilize all  social forces to further set off a new upsurge of grasping  saving deposits.</p>

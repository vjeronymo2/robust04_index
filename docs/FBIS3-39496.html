Bonn announced this Tuesday [15 February]  after an investigating magistrate of the Federal Court applied  for an arrest warrant for a Serb living in Munich suspected of  complicity in genocide, murder, and serious assault. This is  the first time that the "international principle" of the  criminal code has been employed. Human rights organizations  have reported for some time that a considerable number of  "suspected torturers" at Serbian concentration camps were  residing in Germany. Law enforcement agencies have indications  of links between Serbian criminal organizations in Germany and  perpetrators of human rights violations in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

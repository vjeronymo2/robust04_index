			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Osborne &amp; Little in loss after disposal Osborne &amp; Little held its profit in the half year ended September 30 1992, but exceptional costs on the sale of the French subsidiary dragged it into loss. Turnover of this maker of wallpapers and furnishing fabrics was Pounds 8.87m (Pounds 8.79m) and the resultant profit came to Pounds 394,000 (Pounds 384,000). But the exceptionals of Pounds 1.2m led to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 802,000. Following the sale of Fardis, the level of gearing had fallen from 118 per cent at March 31 to 14 per cent. Losses per share for the period totalled 13.48p (earnings 3.58p) but the interim dividend is held at 2p.</p>

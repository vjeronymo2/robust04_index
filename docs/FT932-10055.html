			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Gamble in the North Sea: UK oil tax reforms raise crucial questions about resource management Few measures in the March Budget created as much of a rumpus as Mr Norman Lamont's proposals to reform the taxation of North Sea oil. Apart from opening up divisions within the oil industry, they raised crucial questions about how the UK should manage this important resource. The repercussions reach parliament today with the debate on the finance bill, for which a senior backbench MP has tabled amendments intended to cushion the impact of the changes. But the government, in the person of Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, who is responsible for the measure, is refusing to yield. 'I have listened to all the representations we have received, and none of them contained anything that we had not considered before the Budget,' he says. Although the debate will be about the extent to which oil companies should be allowed to set their exploration costs against their oil taxes, the real issue is how the UK should make the most of its remaining oil and gas reserves. Should they be treated as a strategic asset and exploited to the full or only as the market dictates? Mr Lamont, the chancellor of the Exchequer, is proposing to cut the petroleum revenue tax (PRT) on existing large North Sea fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, and to eliminate the tax altogether on new fields. But at the same time, he wants to end oil companies' right to set their exploration costs against their total PRT bill. The effect will be to make production from developed fields more profitable, but increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset. In his Budget speech Mr Lamont described PRT as 'increasingly anachronistic'. It was introduced in 1975 at a time of surging production and high oil prices to ensure that the Exchequer got its fair share of oil profits. Today, with the oil price close to a 20-year low in real terms, there is less incentive to increase production at such a high tax rate. The ostensible aim of the changes, therefore, is to adapt the North Sea tax regime to the requirements of a mature oil province where further large finds are unlikely and interest has shifted to making the most of developed reserves. But the underlying motive is also to boost tax revenues. The Exchequer's earnings from the North Sea have fallen from a peak of Pounds 12.2bn in 1984-85 (more than half of it from PRT, and the rest coming from royalties and corporation tax), to only Pounds 1.35bn last year, of which a mere Pounds 50m came from PRT. Although the Treasury will lose from the cut in the PRT rate, this loss will be more than offset, it says, by the abolition of exploration allowances, leaving a net addition to tax revenues of Pounds 300m next year and Pounds 400m the year after that. A third motive is to bring North Sea taxation in line with the government's overall approach of reducing tax rates and eliminating allowances. According to Mr Dorrell, PRT at 75 per cent is the highest rate of any tax in the country and the abolition of allowances will stop oil companies effectively exploring at the taxpayers' expense. But in trying to boost its revenues and bring oil taxation in line with its fiscal philosophy, will the Treasury actually damage the prospects for the North Sea? There is a danger that Mr Lamont will kill the incentive to explore at the very moment when the UK needs to make that extra push to find its last, difficult, fields. Will oil companies reinvest the savings from lower PRT to squeeze more out of the North Sea or will they just pocket the money and spend it elsewhere? More broadly, there is the question of whether the new tax regime will handicap the UK in the increasingly competitive international market for oil company investment. These various issues depend on how the outlook for the North Sea is viewed. Contrary to popular perceptions, Britain's oil production has not peaked. Output is forecast to reach record levels of more than 125m tonnes in the middle of this decade. As for reserves, the UK has extracted a total of 1.6bn tonnes of oil to date, and has between 610m and 2.1bn tonnes of recoverable reserves left. The Department of Trade and Industry estimates in its latest Brown Book (its oil and gas annual) that there could also be between 530m and 3.3bn tonnes to be discovered. In addition, output and reserves of natural gas, which are playing a fast-growing role in the country's energy balance, are both rising. So while the North Sea may be mature in the sense that it is well explored and developed, it is far from being played out. The Treasury's view is that the days of jumbo discoveries are past, and that the job now is to ensure that known fields produce their maximum yield. This view is supported, predictably perhaps, by Shell and BP, operators of two of the largest fields in the North Sea, Brent and Forties, who stand to gain from the PRT cuts. Mr Chris Fay, managing director of exploration and production at Shell, believes that more than half of the North Sea's oil has either been pumped out already or is currently under development. This leaves a quarter which has been discovered and not yet developed. 'The Budget is rewarding successful exploration by reducing production taxes, but any exploration must be carefully costed and justified rather than be merely a gamble as was often the case under the old regime,' Mr Fay said. However, the Treasury's argument is strongly opposed by smaller companies who have taken the lead in the North Sea exploration effort as discoveries have got smaller. They warn that the abolition of PRT allowances will lead to a sharp drop in drilling and appraisal activity. Where it is currently worthwhile for a company to develop a field of 15m barrels, the new tax regime would quadruple costs and raise that threshold to 60m barrels, these companies say. The consequence will be fewer additions to oil reserves and therefore, ultimately, less tax revenue for the Exchequer, to say nothing of lost jobs and other social costs. 'It means that there will be a tranche of oil and gas reserves that will not be exploited,' says Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer at Lasmo, the independent company with large North Sea interests. 'They'd rather leave that unexploited than give back the tax benefits. I hope that they have struck the right balance.' Judging by the concern shown by many backbench MPs, the public is also worried that the UK will fail to make the most of its oil assets. The combination of low oil prices, rising costs and harder-to-find reserves has already led to a fall in the number of exploration wells being drilled. This suggests that incentives to explore should be sharpened, rather than reduced, these MPs believe. But Mr Dorrell decries what he describes as 'the National Coal Board culture of seeking to recover a resource regardless of the cost'. It is not in the country's interest, he says, to provide tax breaks for companies to develop oil and gas deposits which are not economic in their own right. He believes it is the country's duty to leave them in the ground for future generations to develop when technological advances or rising energy prices make them economic. He wants to change the North Sea from a low-risk, low-reward province to one where oil companies take more of the risk, but also keep more of the profit if they are successful. If this results in oil being left in the ground, that is what the market thinks best, according to Mr Dorrell. The threat of a sharp fall in exploration may have been exaggerated by independent companies who stand to lose their tax breaks. As much as 40 per cent of current exploration activity is being conducted by companies which pay no PRT against which to offset the cost, Mr Dorrell says. The other important uncertainty is whether the government is correct in assuming that oil companies will reinvest their PRT savings in the North Sea. Again, the oil majors are promising big benefits as development projects are accelerated to take advantage of lower PRT. Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum, said: 'The PRT changes will bring more barrels out of the North Sea. Some projects will move up the pecking order of priorities worldwide because of the new tax regime.' BP yesterday announced it would develop nine oil fields in the central North Sea earlier than planned because of the Budget changes. The company said that development of the fields - the Eastern Trough Area Project, which will cost between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn over the next five years - was given a 'significant impetus' by the new PRT rules. But the smaller companies take a different line. Mr Francis Gugen, finance director of Amerada Hess, points out that even after the PRT cut, profits from large North Sea fields will be taxed at 71 per cent by the time corporation tax is added in. 'Why invest in something with that sort of tax rate when you could invest elsewhere?' he asks. Amerada has said that it will transfer exploration out of the UK North Sea if the Budget changes go through. Whether a flight of drill rigs out of the North Sea actually occurs depends on how the UK stacks up against other oil producing regions. Under the new regime, the rate of tax on North Sea profits would range from 33 per cent on fields exempt from PRT, to 71 per cent on fields that pay it. This is a relatively low rate by international standards (in Norway companies pay a flat 78 per cent). But the abolition of allowances will put the UK at a disadvantage to Norway which allows full tax relief for exploration and where geologists believe there are still large fields yet to be discovered. In spite of the high costs and maturity of the North Sea, a study by Wood MacKenzie, the oil analysis group in Edinburgh, found that the UK still compares well with other countries in its attractiveness for drilling. The study was completed before the PRT changes, but Wood MacKenzie believes they will not affect the appeal of the UK's oil and gas resources. Wood MacKenzie plotted the number of commercial oil discoveries against the number of wells drilled for nine countries in three distinct regions worldwide: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in south-east Asia; Angola, Congo and Gabon in west Africa; and Norway and the UK in the North Sea. The analysts found that, in the past 20 years, the UK was behind only Norway in the number of commercial oil finds. But because of its increasing maturity, the UK slipped into sixth place when it was ranked on the success of wells in finding commercial oil discoveries in the past five years. The study also compares the countries on a risk-reward basis which ranks the drilling success rate with the attractiveness of the fiscal regime. This was conducted before the PRT changes. The UK ranked joint second with the Congo after Vietnam. But Wood MacKenzie stresses the importance of the host government's attitude to the oil industry in attracting its migratory capital. Mr David Black, an industry consultant at Wood MacKenzie said: 'One of the disappointing features of this PRT change is that the UK was always regarded by the industry as politically and fiscally stable: everyone knew how you played the game, but this has been destroyed at a stroke.' Mr Black said the lack of consultation over the changes and the retrospective nature of the move had shocked the industry. The industry still hopes that the Treasury will agree to transitional arrangements to soften the blow and restore the UK's hospitable image. These arrangements, proposed by Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West, and other senior Tory backbenchers, involve continuing tax relief for wells where companies have made commitments to drill but have not yet started work. This will be financed by raising the proposed PRT rate from 50 per cent to 55 per cent until the end of 1996. Mr Lamont is taking quite a gamble with his proposed reforms. If they work, he will have called the oil industry's bluff about their potentially disastrous impact. Britain will enjoy the double benefit of continued exploration and more intensively managed North Sea fields. But if he has misjudged the situation he may not only stifle new exploration, but he could also kiss goodbye to billions of dollars worth of future North Sea investment.</p>

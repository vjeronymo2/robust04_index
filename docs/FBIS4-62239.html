			<p>BFN     [Text] The Pacific Fleet has changed the composition of  ships taking part in the Putina-94 operation aimed at combating  illegal sea fishing in the Far East.    Throughout several weeks of the first stage, from April 20  to  May 10, two trawlers controlled the catch and the use of fish  resources of Russia in the Aniv Bay.

During the first stage of the operation, crews of over 20  Russian and four foreign vessels were brought to justice,  Interfax was told by the commander of the Pacific Border Guard  District, Major General Vitaliy Sedykh.    He said that about 700 vessels, including 200 foreign ones  were spotted in Russia's economic zone. Of this number, over  100 Russian and over 20 foreign vessels have been checked.

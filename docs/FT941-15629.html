			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Amnesty attacks US over death penalty Amnesty International accuses the US of executing innocent and mentally ill people, in a report to be released today, Reuter reports in London. The death penalty in the US was arbitrary, racist and more expensive than imprisonment, the human rights group said. It has written to President Bill Clinton calling for an urgent presidential commission into the use of the death penalty. The London-based group highlighted ways in which the penalty was used. One man on death row in the US was cleared last year but other innocent people had gone to the electric chair, Amnesty said. It criticised the US for executing people in the last five years for crimes committed when they were minors. Amnesty referred to what it called the ingrained racism of the death penalty: '40 per cent of death row prisoners are black, compared to just 12 per cent of the population.' It said also more than 50 mentally of ill or impaired prisoners have been executed since 1982.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (15): Printing money to meet the loss - The problem of state-owned enterprises THE APPETITE of Turkey's state-owned enterprises for funds is widely acknowledged as a threat to the stability of the economy, yet the politicians have been unable to come up with a solution. The state has a stake in 235 enterprises, ranging from public utilities, basic metals and mining, to trading houses and department stores. Total losses of all the state-owned corporations come to around Dollars 3bn, or 2 per cent of gross national product. The financing of these losses, generally through printing new money, has added to the burden on the budget, and is estimated at around 4 per cent of GNP. In addition to the financial losses, their share of gross fixed investment, while declining, is still about 16 per cent of the total, concentrated in the sectors of energy, transportation and telecommunications. Their demand for funds crowds out other borrowers, and, in cases where they receive support direct from the treasury, adds to the fiscal imbalance. Employment is close to 600,000 and has risen in recent years, despite declining financial performance. The initial task for any government is how to convert these concerns into joint stock companies under Turkey's commercial code. Regulatory reform, particularly in the utilities and other sectors enjoying natural monopolies, needs to be enhanced. Without such measures, any future reorganisation will only become much more costly. Economists say a political, as well as a business, decision has then to be made as to which are to be privatised and which closed down. The government is said to be considering contracting out the management of privatisation; however, this does not address the need for a political commitment to decide the fate of these state-sector companies. Efficiency, manning levels, quality of management: in all these areas the state businesses have fallen woefully behind the private sector. A World Bank report on the sector suggested the main problem was that the companies are 'not run as commercial enterprises but as government departments'. Under their articles of association, many have inherited conflicting tasks. Take Tekel, the state tobacco monopoly, which is directly controlled by the finance and customs ministry - indeed, its chairman, Mr Mehmet Akbay, is a former tax expert at the ministry. Tekel not only has 80 per cent of the cigarette market, it also has a statutory obligation to buy tobacco from the farmers at a subsidised price set by government. In the late 1980s, in the face of market liberalisation and the arrival of foreign imports, the company invested heavily in new product lines. Its 2000 brand of blended cigarette is still more successful than the imported Marlboro product. Indeed, imports have fallen recently. However, Philip Morris is now investing in a plant in Turkey, and, under new investment rules, once production reaches 2,000 tonnes, will be able to market and distribute its own product, and eat into Tekel's market share. Perhaps even more than the liberalisation of the sector, Tekel is suffering from the burden of its price support activities. Like many state companies, it has built up stocks, incurring warehousing fees and tying up badly needed working capital. Large inventory accumulation is a feature of many of the agriculture-based state economic enterprises, partly as a result of the abundant harvest in 1990, but to a larger extent because of the generous levels of support prices, which are typically well above world levels. Clearly, any reform of the farm-based state enterprises will have to go hand in hand with changes in the subsidy policy, which for so long has been seen as a universal cure for an ailing agricultural sector. Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, has proved equivocal on the state-sector issue. He publicly acknowledges the need for reform. Yet his only contribution so far has been to bail out Metas a private-sector iron and steel company. In effect, Metas's debts to state-owned banks were converted to equity. The state has thus taken a new stake in a troubled private concern, a policy favoured in the import substitution years before 1980, but which led to the plethora of minority stakes in so many private companies today. On the fate of Zonguldak, the loss-making hard coal company on the Black Sea, Mr Demirel says it will be impossible to close it down. The mine employs 50,000 people, and there is little alternative work in the area. Mr Demirel's Social Democrat coalition partners might be even less inclined to consider closure of state companies like Zonguldak, which have traditionally provided the party a steady supply of votes. The issues are gargantuan. First, the companies need to adopt the disciplines of the market-place. At present, not being subject to the commercial code, their performance is not subject to the provision on bankruptcy. Managers are civil servants, and earn civil servants' salaries, which has proved a disincentive in attracting quality personnel. Economists say pricing is too often related to political decisions. For example, in the run up to the election in 1991, the Motherland party government restrained prices in a bid to hold back inflation in the weeks ahead of polling day. The dramatic 11 per cent increase in January was largely a measure of the price increases which state enterprises had to make to cover their deficits. Their accounting methods also leave a lot to be desired. Moreover they have tended to disguise their dismal financial performance by making deferred payments, arrears and, in the case of the grain procurement board TMO, looking to the central bank to fund their activities. In many cases the problems of the state sector banks relate to the non-performing loans extending to the state sector enterprises. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economics minister, is pushing, so far with little success, to set up a new agency to handle the restructuring of these companies. Critics of her proposal say it would merely create another layer of bureaucracy, and would still not address the fundamental issue of whether there is the political commitment to shake up the state sector. However, the OECD, in its latest report on the Turkish economy, welcomed the move. Some companies are making efforts to ready themselves for privatisation. Turk Hava Yollar, the national airline, for example, is now looking at its fleet sizes and yields, and is planning strategic alliances. But in general the public sector appears to be drifting further into trouble.</p>

Attending the meeting are the 18 commanders in chief of  national navies and a member of the Inter-American Defense Board.    At issue are different topics of interests for different  Navies. The commanders will meet with President Lacalle during  the week.    The agenda includes contributions by each delegation and  provides for some of the issues to be discussed behind closed  doors.    Vice Admiral James Coates, the Uruguayan Navy commander in  chief, confirmed that a meeting with the president is scheduled  for midday on 24 March at the Punta del Este Yacht Club.    He said: "The National Navy will present two issues. One  refers to the inter-American war games, a technical issue of  minor importance compared to the second issue: the South  Atlantic Maritime Area. Uruguay for the first time is hosting  the organization's coordinator."    Coates said the organ "is a maritime traffic control  organization that has existed for many years. Uruguay, Brazil,  Paraguay, and Argentina are members."    He said: "The issue is very important, not just for us, but  for all other Navies as well. It is the only case in the world  of cooperation between Navies from different countries on such  an important issue as maritime traffic control. This is a  military issue which has many implications that go beyond the  military sphere of influence including ocean contamination, the  control of oil spills, the control of fishery plundering  actions, arms contraband, drug trafficking, and similar items.  All these topics come under the chapter of maritime traffic.  This is the first time four countries have cooperated on  something as important."    Regarding the commanders' meeting with Lacalle, Coates said:  "The president has had the courtesy to invite all the  participants to a luncheon during which we will probably  exchange ideas on different issues with the representatives of  the Navies of the Americas."</p>

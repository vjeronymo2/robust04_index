			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL ROADS  </P> <P> In response to "Bulldozers Grind Away Illegally Along the Coast," Part I, July  17:  </P> <P> I read the piece with shock and dismay. How can such a thing be? Why isn't  something being done about it? The rape of the land by developers is one of the  most insidious of all crimes, and yet, it goes virtually unpunished.  </P> <P> Until people regard such crimes as crimes, the developers will continue to rob  others of their right to a good quality of life. Overdevelopment results in  traffic congestion, destruction of plant and animal life, and pollution. The  laws that are already on the books need to be enforced!  </P> <P> ROBERT THOMPSON  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / British Coal accused of 'wrecking' A Conservative MP yesterday accused British Coal of 'deliberate wrecking action' when it removed new equipment from the last pit in the Durham coalfield, diminishing its chances sale to the private sector. Mr Peter Atkinson, MP for Hexham, attacked the dismantling and removal of shearing machinery and pit props from Wearmouth colliery ahead of its official closure on Friday. British Coal confirmed it was taking out equipment with a written down value of Pounds 8.3m from Wearmouth, where it has spent Pounds 24m in the last four years opening up new reserves, but insisted the items were required at other pits. It said it had undertaken to maintain the fabric of the colliery, which has not yet been advertised, while the licensing and leasing process took place. Mr Colin MacLeod, chairman and owner of Caledonian Mining, a contracting company interested in acquiring the Sunderland pit, warned that the removal of machinery 'could make it so costly we couldn't go in'. Mr MacLeod said he wrote to British Coal last month on the day it announced Wearmouth's closure saying his company was 'extremely interested' in the pit but had received no response. British Coal should have talked to potential customers before remov-ing machinery, he said. 'It's of most value if it can keep that mine open and keep men in jobs,' he said. His plans would mean employing between 600 and 700 at Wearmouth, he said. Most of the 670 presently employed there will lose their jobs this month, in an area where alternative work prospects are poor. 'Whatever they get from us for it, it will be worth it to the people who originally paid for it - not British Coal but the taxpayer,' said Mr MacLeod. He added that he understood that British Coal had 'yards full of gear and pit tops full of supports'. Wearmouth is the only one of 31 pits that were named for closure in October 1992 that Caledonian Mining wishes to acquire, although it has expressed interest in British Coal's privatisa-tion. Mr Atkinson suggested equipment removal might be an attempt by British Coal managers who were interested in a management buy-out and wanted to prevent private sector competition. British Coal rejected this, pointing out that 20 pits were being offered to the private sector at the moment. Sunderland Labour MPs Mr Billy Etherington and Mr Chris Mullin are also pressing British Coal to retain machinery at Wearmouth. Mining unions have pledged support for a private takeover in the interests of saving jobs.</p>

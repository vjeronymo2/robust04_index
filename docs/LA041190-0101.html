			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FINLEY IS SHARP IN 7-0 WIN;  </P> <P> ANGELS: HOME RUNS BY DOWNING, DAVIS AND BICHETTE LEAD OFFENSE.  </P> <P> Early or late in the season, preceded by a shortened spring or by the usual  preparations, Chuck Finley's pitching performance Tuesday night at Anaheim  Stadium was impressive.  </P> <P> The left-hander allowed the Mariners only two hits in 6 1/3 innings' work and  watched while his teammates slammed three home runs, a combination that brought  the Angels a 7-0 victory, their first of the season.  </P> <P> The Angels had not recorded a victory of any kind since a 6-3 decision over  Milwaukee in an exhibition game on April 1. They had lost their last seven  exhibition games and their season opener on Monday.  </P> <P> Both hits off Finley were by Henry Cotto, who had an infield single in the  third and a double in the fifth that he unsuccessfully tried to stretch into a  triple. Finley struck out two and walked one before yielding to Mark Eichhorn.  </P> <P> Chili Davis and Dante Bichette hit home runs in the second off Seattle starter  Randy Johnson (0-1), who is 6-foot-10. Johnson, who played baseball and  basketball at USC, was relieved in the sixth by Jerry Reed, who was victimized  for three runs in the seventh.  </P> <P> Reed got the first two outs in the seventh but gave up a single to Wally Joyner  and a walk to Davis before Brian Downing drove a 2-and-2 pitch into the  left-field seats for his first home run of the season.  </P> <P> Eichhorn preserved the shutout by pitching 2 2/3 strong innings, earning his  first save as an Angel and his first save since June 2, 1988 when he was with  Toronto. He allowed only two hits, and his defense did its part to hold the  Mariners scoreless in the eighth, when Edgar Martinez doubled and moved to  third on Cotto's grounder to the right side. Brian Giles followed with a shot  to third that was gobbled up by Rick Schu, who held Martinez at third.  Pinch-hitter Scott Bradley ended the inning with a grounder to second.  </P> <P> The Angels scored their last two runs in the eighth off rookie Brent Knackert  on an RBI-single by Johnny Ray and a sacrifice fly by Joyner. So sure of the  outcome were the 23,508 fans that about a third of them left before Seattle  batted in the ninth.  </P> <P> Even before Downing's three-run blast in the seventh, the homers by Davis and  Bichette had given the Angels a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Davis, who had been the designated hitter in Monday's season opener, led off  the second inning by lacing a 3-and-2 pitch from Johnson that appeared to be  over the middle of the plate over the left-field fence.  </P> <P> Downing, making his first appearance of the season, was the designated hitter  Tuesday night. His absence from the Opening Day lineup Monday even broke a  streak of 11 straight appearances in the Angels' Opening Day lineup.  </P> <P> Downing grounded out his first at-bat, but Bichette ripped a high 2-and-0 pitch  over the fence in right, to the right of the 370-foot sign.  </P> <P> The home run was Bichette's first at Anaheim Stadium since April 12, 1989, when  he hit one off Oakland's Curt Young. The Angels led the American League last  season with 145 home runs, two fewer than the major-league leading Mets.  </P> <P> The Angels might have prolonged the second inning, but were foiled. Lance  Parrish reached when second baseman Harold Reynolds bobbled his grounder, and  Parrish moved to third when Rick Schu doubled to left-center. Mark McLemore  followed with a grounder to second, and Reynolds' throw home was in time to get  Parrish. Devon White struck out to end the inning.  </P> <P> Seattle tried to mount a threat in the fifth, but the Angels' defense held  firm. Henry Cotto looped a hit down the right field line, reaching second  easily and then trying for third. Bichette made a strong throw to McLemore,  whose relay to third baseman Schu was in time to get Cotto and end the inning.  </P> <P> Finley helped his own cause in the sixth. Reynolds hit a grounder to the right  side that was scooped up by Joyner, leaving Finley and Reynolds to race to the  bag. Finley bounded over to first, colliding with Reynolds and sending both  somersaulting into foul territory. But Finley held onto the ball and displayed  it to first base umpire Vic Voltaggio, who gave the out sign.  </P> <P> Through six innings, Finley had allowed only two hits and had struck out two.  </P> <P> Johnson, however, didn't last through the sixth. He yielded a leadoff single to  Downing, then after getting Bichette to take a called third strike he walked  Parrish, which signaled the end of his evening. Right-hander Jerry Reed  relieved him and closed out the inning by getting Schu and McLemore to fly to  left.  </P> <P> Finley kept going strong into the seventh, but the Angels had Mark Eichhorn as  insurance. Finley got Griffey on a grounder to second for the first out of the  inning, but walked Alvin Davis after falling behind 3 and 1, the first walk he  issued in the game. That was all pitching coach Marcel Lachemann needed to see:  Lachemann promptly trotted out to the mound to take Finley out and call for  Eichhorn. The crowd gave Finley a warm hand as he strolled back to the dugout.  </P> <P> Finley made 78 pitches in his 6 1/3 innings, walking one and striking out two.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Angel pitcher Mark Langston, who will start against his former Mariner  teammates tonight, said he will block out memories of his old friendships once  the game starts. But he confessed that he misses his old roommate, Alvin Davis,  with whom he used to share post-game snacks. "It's tough to eat a whole pizza,"  Langston said.  </P> <P> Mariner outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. is a dutiful son. Remembering that Tuesday  was the 40th birthday of his father, Cincinnati outfielder Ken Griffey, Sr., he  asked the Mariners' public relations director, Dave Aust, to call Houston --  where the Reds were playing -- and put a congratulatory message on the  scoreboard.  </P> <P> Chili Davis, who was limited to designated hitting Monday because of persistent  tightness in his groin, was in left field Tuesday, with Devon White in center  and Dante Bichette in right. Claudell Washington, a left-handed hitter, was  removed from the lineup against the left-hander Randy Johnson. Washington also  has a plantar's wart on his left foot, but padding in his shoe alleviates his  discomfort.  </P> <P> "A lot has to do with Johnson, and a lot has to do with Chili being able to  play the outfield," Manager Doug Rader said of the lineup changes. Bichette, he  said, "may end up platooning with Claudell. It depends on who produces and is  swinging the bat. I don't believe in strict platoons. It might be a reverse  platoon where Claudell hits left-handers better than right-handers. That  happens a lot."  </P> <P> Third baseman Jack Howell, who sprained his left ankle last Wednesday, was  available for pinch-hitting duty Tuesday night. However, Rader said he probably  would wait until Howell was able to start before he'd use Howell at all. "I'm  not convinced (using Howell to pinch-hit) is the right thing to do," Rader  said. "When he's ready, the thing to do is have him start. You're prepared to  play looser."  </P> <P> Bob McClure, who received a cortisone injection in his left elbow Monday, will  be re-examined today. Rader said he was hopeful that McClure might be able to  throw today or Thursday. . . . Kent Anderson, who had been bothered by rib  cartilage problems, is available. . . . Trainer Ned Bergert said shortstop Dick  Schofield, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list April 1, is progressing  rapidly enough to have taken ground balls. However, Schofield isn't as advanced  with his lateral movement. . . . Second baseman Johnny Ray has a slight  inflammation near his right shoulder blade. It's being treated with heat and  ice and isn't considered serious. . . . The Angels' Opening Day loss was their  third straight. They also lost their openers in 1979, 82 and 86 and went on to  win division titles.  </P></p>

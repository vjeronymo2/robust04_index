			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / HK appoints Chinese chief secretary The Hong Kong government yesterday designated Mrs Anson Chan as the territory's next chief secretary. She is the first Chinese appointment to the administration's most senior position, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. The appointment will allay some concerns over the government's commitment to introducing more Hong Kong Chinese into the upper echelons of its administration and civil service. There had been an uproar over moves to allow expatriate civil servants to extend contracts by switching to local terms. She will replace Sir David Ford in November. He was chief executive secretary for six and a half years, and will become commissioner in the Hong Kong government's office in London. Mrs Chan was born in Shanghai but has spent most of her life in Hong Kong and has worked within the government since 1962. Mr Chris Patten, the governor, yesterday described her as 'a real fighter for the livelihood and interests of Hong Kong'.</p>

START II is yet to be  ratified by Russia. Meanwhile the latter's missiles, including  the heavy SS-18, continue to be removed from operational sites.  This work was at its height during the summer and fall of last  year. As in the past, missile men and defense experts displayed  prompt and coordinated action at all the stages of the reduction  process right up to the removal of missiles from silos and the  draining off of missile fuel components. On the one hand, they  were working under pressure of a tight schedule since every  missile had to be removed from alert duty on strictly preset  days and hours, while on the other hand they had to ensure that  all the operations were carried out without any dangerous  pollution of the environment ensuing. [video shows missile being  removed from silo, personnel donning gas masks, fuel being  siphoned off] [passage omitted]    [Correspondent over aerial view of missile test range  captioned "Radar-TV, VoyenTV"] Our industry cannot do something  that it was never equipped to do, in other words to salvage  simultaneously up to 2,000 ICBM's, hundreds of thousands of  tonnes of special fluids and nuclear and chemical munitions.  What is more, we lack the necessary resources.    This also applies to cleaning up the Russian Missile Forces'  sole test range which covers an area of 175,000 hectares.  During test launches certain parts of the delivery vehicle  separate. They contain toxic rocket fuel residue. All this  does not burn up in the atmosphere but falls to the ground and  into water reservoirs. Two years ago the leadership of the  Missile Forces together with (?"Transres"), a special science  and production center, tried for the first time to carry out a  mass cleanup of the test range, using their own resources. More  than 2,000 tonnes of delivery vehicle debris was collected, but  only a small part of the test range was cleared.    By agreeing to sweeping reductions of the most powerful and  technically most sophisticated missiles, Russia has not only  forfeited its status as an influential partner in resolving  strategic issues, but it also finds itself in a most  disadvantageous position in terms of the need to observe all the  necessary ecological and environmental protection safeguards  during the elimination of the stockpiled weapons. [video shows  aerial view of missile test range, test launch, computer  graphics, debris littering the test range] [passage omitted]    [Correspondent over video of operation to remove nose  section  from silo, captioned "RADAR TV"] Today Russia is reaping the  fruits of the most critical period of its military policy when,  as a result of cuts in military production, it was forced to  extend the guaranteed period of service of nuclear missiles on  alert duty. Consequently, the safe service life of 30 percent  of these missiles has already expired. And another 30 percent  will turn into a potential nuclear threat in two years' time.  Russia is faced with the task of scrapping more than 20,000  nuclear munitions by the year 2000. And since the pace of the  salvage process is very slow, we may again fall hostages to the  nuclear threat, but this time because of being incapable of  carrying out mass industrial salvaging of such a vast quantity  of nuclear charges.    The radiation background at the launch site is only just  above the permissible limit [video shows counter reading].  Furthermore, all the operations are controlled by several  specialists simultaneously. Therefore the removal of the nose  section at the launch site is by no means the most dangerous  operation. [video shows operations above ground and detailed  view of interior of missile silo] [passage omitted]    [Video shows nose section removal operation over largely  unintelligible exchanges between officers] [passage omitted]    [Unit Commander A. Gribov, over video of site being guarded  by a soldier, sign reading "Mines," nose section being loaded  onto truck] It has to be said that this is by no means the  least important or worst of our weapons. Fortunately, it has  never been used in practice. But the tests that were carried  out showed that both the missile and the warheads are excellent  and highly effective.    [Correspondent over closeup of nose section being loaded  onto  truck] The nuclear nose cone of the SS-18 missile can carry 10  nuclear warheads. At the moment there is nothing to compare  with it in the world.    This unusual cargo will be carried in this neat truck only  as  far as the nearest depot. Before entering the industrial  salvaging process, it has a difficult journey along worn-out  Russian roads ahead. [video shows warhead being loaded, truck on  the move] [passage omitted]    [Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander in chief of  Strategic Missiles Forces, over video of missiles on railroad  platforms in a siding in snowy location] We have established  two bases for scrapping missiles, the Surovatikha base, and  Pibanshur near the city of Izhevsk.    [Correspondent over video of missiles being dismantled in  large hangar] Pibanshur and Surovatikha are Russia's first  bases for scrapping ICBM's using resource-saving technologies.  Following the removal of the dangerous fuel components, each  SS-17 and SS-18 missile will be carefully dismantled. In this  way the Surovatikha base will be able to scrap more than 40  heavy missiles a year. This means that thousands of tonnes of  expensive metals and alloys will be returned to industry.    As is known, the previous class of missiles --  intermediate- and shorter-range missiles -- were scrapped by  means of explosions. To the general amazement of our  compatriots, billions of rubles were turned into ashes and  smoke, quite apart from the damage that was done to the  environment. This is why the two new enterprises -- which,  incidentally, have been set up by the missile forces themselves  within their department -- unquestionably mark a long-overdue  step toward savings of state resources spent on disarmament.    For the time being inadequate funding is hampering the  entire  federal program for recycling ecologically dangerous materials  from scrapped weapons. The Surovatikha base could make up this  shortage of funds through the sale of part of the salvaged  materials to other enterprises for processing. But the latter  do not have any money either.    While a search for coordinated action by the ministries and  departments interested in industrial recycling is under way at  the top, the missile men have to bear the full burden of this  work themselves. [video shows detailed views of salvage  operation with camera switching back to railroad siding at the  end] [passage omitted]    [Correspondent over video of an SS-18 on a truck, followed  by  computer graphics, captioned "RADAR-TV" and "VoyenTV"] To  replace the multiple reentry vehicle missiles which are being  scrapped, Russia is planning to build another multiple-warhead  missile [mnogoblochnaya raketa] based on the SS-25. However, as  distinct from the heavy SS-18 missile, the new missile cannot be  guaranteed to penetrate the opponent's anti-missile defenses,  since the SS-18 was capable of releasing, in addition to its 10  warheads, up to 1,000 false targets into orbit. Scientists at  the Moscow Heat Technology Institute intend to make up for this  forced minus-point in the design of the nose section of the new  missile by making these missiles easily reequipable into the  "Start" system which can be used for launches for scientific  purposes either right now or in the event of arms reduction.  Admittedly, the engineers and designers will have to find the  money to further develop this project themselves in order to  preserve the scientific potential of Russia's only institute of  this kind.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] has  given a new government five years to implement a reconstruction  and development program. COSATU says political freedom for  workers in 1994 will mean a vote for democracy, a vote for jobs,  a vote for peace and a vote for improved living conditions.  However, these objectives will be achieved only through a  concrete program which sets out clear priorities, targets and  time frames.</p>

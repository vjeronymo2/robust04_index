			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Allied merger plan referred to MMC THE PROPOSED Pounds 510m merger of the UK brewing operations of Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and retailing group, and Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, was referred yesterday to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said the planned joint venture, Carlsberg-Tetley, raised questions of competition in the UK beer market which deserved investigation. The MMC has been asked to report by June 12. The 50-50 joint venture, announced in October, would bring together Allied's six breweries, which make brands such as Castlemaine lager and Britain's best-selling ale, Tetley, and Carlsberg's modern brewery at Northampton. The combined operation would command about 18 per cent of the UK beer market, close to Bass, the leader, at 23 per cent. Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, is understood to have advised Mr Lilley of his concern that this further consolidation would not involve any weakening of the brewer's links with pub retailing. Carlsberg-Tetley would supply Allied's tied estate of more than 4,000 pubs. Mr Lilley gave a warning when he approved the pubs-for-breweries swap between Grand Metropolitan and Courage less than 18 months ago that 'the greater the degree of concentration in the industry, the more reluctant I will be to allow further increases in market share by acquisition'. He also said that any increases in concentration by mergers involving the big brewers would be unwelcome unless they were counterbalanced by a weakening of their links with pub retailing. Allied, which considers the merger vital to its future competitive position, said it was disappointed by the referral. The company has run into difficulties with the OFT in its attempt to meet government orders to free 2,800 pubs from tied beer supplies. It leased 734 pubs to Brent Walker last month in spite of an OFT warning that the pubs would not count towards its disposal target.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Jing Shuzhan (2529 2118 1455) and reporter </F> Jia Yong (6328 3057)]    [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar (XINHUA) -- An All-Army Center for  the Study of the Theory of Building Socialism with Chinese  Characteristics was founded today at the PLA [People's  Liberation Army] National Defense University. On behalf of the  Central Military Commission (CMC), Yu Yongbo, member of the CMC  and director of the General Political Department, attended a  ceremonial meeting to express his congratulations. He urged  all-army theoretical workers to shoulder their historical  mission and provide better services to army building and reform;  to the strategic mission of arming the whole army with the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the  improvement of the army's Marxist theoretical level; and to the  self-awareness and resolution of the broad masses of officers  and soldiers in carrying out the party's basic line.    The center, which is located in the PLA National Defense  University, is one of five devoted to the study of the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Establishing  these centers is a strategic move by the CPC Central Committee,  aimed at strengthening the whole party's ideological  construction and pushing forward China's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive. The center's fundamental tasks are to  deepen the whole army's theoretical studies, continuously  enhance the quality and effectiveness of such studies, and to  guide cadres and soldiers to accurately assess, based on the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  various new experiences and problems cropping up in today's  society; and to help them sum up new experiences and conduct new  theoretical explorations by closely integrating the realities of  reform and opening up to further enrich and develop the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    During his speech, Yu Yongbo pointed out: Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics represents an energetic Marxism for contemporary  China, a strong ideological weapon for pushing forward China's  cause of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and a  fundamental guiding principle for all our work. The fundamental  task for the ideological and theoretical front lies in arming  the thinking of the whole party, whole army, and people across  the country with the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. At present, China's economic restructuring has  developed to a critical stage where major breakthroughs are  integrated with overall progress. Only when we strengthen the  study and publicity of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and turn it into a genuinely strong  spiritual pillar for the whole party, whole army, and all  nationalities across the country, and enable them to  conscientiously apply it in answering and solving various  important issues encountered during the course of reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive, can we make new  contributions to reform, development, and stability; and ensure  the success of the great cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    Yu Yongbo said: The center's tasks include the following  points: First, by summing up our party's past experiences, it  should comprehensively and accurately master the scientific  system of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. It should unswervingly uphold and carry out  the party's basic line, and play an exemplary role in studying  and mastering the guiding spirit of this theory. Second, by  closely combining the realities of reform and opening up and  with the help of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, it should explore and answer various important  theoretical and practical issues in our society; and play a  leading role in explaining and giving publicity to the party's  various principled policies. Third, while giving prominence to  the army's own characteristics, it should strive to implement  Comrade's Deng Xiaoping's ideological thinking concerning army  building in the actual work of troops during the new period. It  should provide theoretical explanations for some important  issues in army building, and play a consultative role for the  CMC and the three headquarters in making scientific decisions.  Fourth, it should pay attention to the situation of the army's  ideological construction at all times and guide the troops to do  a good job in instilling this theory. It should make great  efforts to encourage healthy trends, and play a guiding role in  improving spiritual civilization construction. Fifth, guided by  the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, it  should continuously strengthen contacts and cooperation with  research centers of the Central Party School, Chinese Academy of  Social Sciences, and State Education Commission as well as other  research institutes. It should play a linking role in  facilitating the flow of exchanges and results of civil-military  research activities. It should shoulder the great  responsibility of "arming the people with scientific theories"  and provide better services to the state's reform, opening up,  and modernization drive as well as to the enhancement of the  troops' combat effectiveness.    Attending the meeting were responsible comrades of the  General Political Department, PLA National Defense University,  Propaganda Department, Central Party School, State Education  Commission, and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.</p>

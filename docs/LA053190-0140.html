			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CALTRANS MAY CLOSE ROADS, CHIEF WARNS  </P> <P> Caltrans Director Robert Best has threatened to simply close the highways on  which construction workers are exposed to traffic. Best and California Highway  Patrol Commissioner Maury Hannigan made a joint plea to drive safely and  soberly through highway work zones and "end the slaughter of California highway  workers."  </P> <P> In less than two months, five Caltrans workers have been killed, including two  early this month along Interstate 5 in Stockton who were struck by a suspected  drunk driver. The toll attributed to errant motorists is 25 since 1972. Best  issued a statement saying: "If we can't stop the carnage, then we may have to  curtail or eliminate night construction work, or close roads while work is  being done. We will do whatever it takes to get this necessary work done  without sacrificing the safety of our road workers."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HEIR, APPARENTLY;  </P> <P> ENERGY: UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, OCCIDENTAL'S RAY IRANI HAS STAYED IN CHAIRMAN  ARMAND HAMMER'S GOOD GRACES. BUT HE'S NOT A HAMMER CLONE.  </P> <P> The president's office at Occidental Petroleum Corp. has had so many occupants  that the joke had been that it should have a revolving door.  </P> <P> Over the years, several ambitious executives arrived and were touted as heirs  to Armand Hammer, the globe-trotting millionaire, Russophile, art collector and  strong-willed chairman of Occidental. But each would eventually lose favor and  depart, generally after public disagreements with the 91-year-old "Doctor."  </P> <P> That is, until Ray R. Irani.  </P> <P> Irani, 55, the company's president and chief operating officer, last month  became the first man ever to be approved by the board to replace Hammer, should  the chairman either die or retire.  </P> <P> How has Irani -- described by acquaintances as brilliant, ambitious and  plain-speaking -- hung on where similar officers have failed?  </P> <P> "He was the type of person who recognized the problem some of us had with Dr.  Hammer, and he just made up his mind, come hell or high water, to put up with  him," said one former executive who asked not to be named. "Ambition only goes  so far, but Irani was willing to do it. I admire the guy's patience; he lets  Dr. Hammer take all the credit for everything."  </P> <P> But that's not the whole story, observers said. Dissident shareholders and  others speculate that Irani is merely biding his time until he can assume  control. They hope that he will redress what they argue have been excesses by  Hammer that have hurt Occidental's stock value and return to shareholders.  </P> <P> "Irani has his own mind on where the company should be going. That was my sense  after meeting with him" in November, said Dale M. Hanson, chief executive of  the California Public Employees' Retirement System, a major Occidental  shareholder. "But Dr. Hammer casts a long shadow, and I think (Irani) has to  function as a lord in waiting."  </P> <P> Publicly, Irani dismisses such characterizations. He has nothing but praise for  his mentor and adds that he plans to continue in Hammer's footsteps even after  he takes charge.  </P> <P> "To speculate on what I might or might not do is very strange, particularly  since Dr. Hammer and I work together very closely," he said in an interview  recently. "But to say there will be a dramatic change is incorrect."  </P> <P> Irani is already managing the company's day-to-day operations, while Hammer  increasingly acts as the big thinker, charity worker and ambassador of  goodwill, analysts and observers said. Recent visitors described the chairman  as frail and thin, though the company maintains that he has been in excellent  health since he had a pacemaker implanted in November.  </P> <P> "If there's any work being done there, constructive work and something that  brings the bacon back home, it's being done by Irani," the former executive  said.  </P> <P> Hammer declined to be interviewed for this story.  </P> <P> Once Irani takes over, how much will he depart from Hammer's lead? Analysts  doubt that he will veer sharply from current strategies. But institutional  shareholders confide that, even now, Irani does not always act on some of  Hammer's ideas for the company, though he listens to them.  </P> <P> Once he takes over, Irani may have to take a hard look at some of Occidental's  longtime holdings and policies, including its traditional dividend payout and  high corporate debt level.  </P> <P> Analysts speculate, for example, that Irani may be tempted to sell Occidental's  remaining 51% share of IBP Inc., the Nebraska-based meatpacker and a company  that appears to have little in common with Occidental's core chemical and oil  and gas businesses.  </P> <P> Irani said he has already turned down several offers for IBP and denied that he  is thinking of selling, though analysts credit him with the idea of selling 49%  of IBP to the public in 1988 in an offering that raised $960 million.  </P> <P> One of Irani's major tasks once he takes over will be mollifying shareholders  angered by Occidental's involvement with the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and  Cultural Center, intended to house Hammer's art collection.  </P> <P> Occidental has committed $85 million to build and endow the museum, which is  being built next to Occidental's Westwood headquarters -- a commitment that has  generated shareholder lawsuits and spurred a proposal to form a shareholders'  rights committee under Occidental's board at the company's annual meeting in  May.  </P> <P> One shareholders group called it the "20th Century equivalent of the pyramids  for Dr. Hammer."  </P> <P> The subject is so touchy that Irani refused to discuss it at all, except to  say, "We're comfortable with what we're doing." But Irani has shown a  willingness to meet with Hanson, head of the California public employee group,  and other shareholders to discuss the company in general terms.  </P> <P> Attending to Details  </P> <P> Irani stands to inherit a company that analysts have speculated is ripe for a  takeover. The unusual announcement of Irani's future succession was meant in  part to calm a stock market that sent Occidental's stock up sharply each time  Hammer became ill, speculating that a corporate raider could step in should  there be management turmoil in the event of Hammer's death.  </P> <P> Whatever his plans, Irani has won praise for being more concerned with company  operations and attending more to the details of running Occidental than was  Hammer.  </P> <P> Analysts have said they also find him more down to earth than Hammer, who is  known to favor the company of presidents and kings. Irani canceled a January  visit with New York analysts so that he could be in Los Angeles when his  30-year-old daughter gave birth to a son, Irani's first grandchild. (As it  turned out, the baby was born a couple of days early, so Irani just missed the  birth.)  </P> <P> Irani's ultimate succession would complete a meteoric ascent that began in  1953, when he graduated with honors from American University in his home town  of Beirut. He went on to earn a doctorate in physical chemistry from USC in  1957 at the age of 22, his official biography says.  </P> <P> In the next three decades, he rose quickly through the corporate hierarchies of  such chemical companies as Monsanto Co., Diamond Shamrock Corp. and Olin Corp.,  ending up as president of Olin in 1980. Along the way, he racked up 50 U.S. and  more than 100 foreign patents, published more than 50 technical articles and  wrote a chemistry text.  </P> <P> "I think he was recognized as a young opportunist," said Edward P. Lyons, who  was Olin's chief financial officer and vice chairman during Irani's tenure. "He  would either get to the top at Olin or get to the top somewhere else. He was  destined by his ability, by his background and by his drive to achieve the  top."  </P> <P> Irani did not immediately respond to overtures from Hammer that he run  Occidental's chemical unit -- not until Occidental's board agreed to his salary  demands. Irani had cash compensation of $2.125 million in 1988, according to  the company's 1989 proxy statement.  </P> <P> Irani's abrupt departure from Olin in 1983 ruffled feathers there, Lyons said.  When former Olin Chairman John M. Henske died recently, Irani did not attend  the funeral.  </P> <P> "The chairman resented to a degree when Ray left and people left with him, so I  would have been surprised if he had come," Lyons said.  </P> <P> But co-workers recalled that Irani was a strong motivator of his staff,  engendering such loyalty that several Olin managers, including Dale R.  Laurance, followed him to Occidental. Laurance is now Occidental's executive  vice president for operations.  </P> <P> Close Relationship  </P> <P> At Occidental, Irani found himself in a position that had been previously  occupied by other hard-driving, ambitious executives. After a honeymoon period,  each had fallen out of favor with Hammer.  </P> <P> Former President Joseph Baird left after getting the blame for Occidental's  failure to acquire Mead Corp. Former President A. Robert Abboud departed after  being caught in a battle for power between Hammer and director David Murdock.  Former Vice Chairman Zoltan Merszei left after being passed over first by  Abboud, then by Irani. All three men declined to comment for this story on  their conflicts with Hammer.  </P> <P> Irani's official designation as Hammer's successor may result from Hammer's  recognition that he is getting on in years. But it may also be due in part to  an unusually close working relationship between the two. "Dr. Hammer trusts him  a great deal," Laurance said.  </P> <P> Irani will inherit a company sculpted almost single-handedly by Hammer into an  unorthodox combination of oil and gas assets, natural gas pipelines, chemical  operations, coal and meatpacking. Unlike most large oil companies, Occidental  chose not to get into refining and marketing, instead concentrating on  chemicals.  </P> <P> Occidental's net income has not broken records. It fell in 1989 to $285 million  from $302 million the year before. Earnings would have been even lower if not  for profitable asset sales and acquisitions, including after-tax gains from  asset dispositions of about $49 million in 1989 and a gain of $190 million from  a stock offering and asset sales in 1988.  </P> <P> Operating earnings were slightly up in 1989, to $1.39 billion from $1.38  billion. But that came mainly from chemicals. Earnings fell in every other  operation, including oil and gas, natural gas pipelines, meatpacking and coal.  </P> <P> Even so, the company has maintained a high annual dividend since 1974. In 1989,  it was $2.50, even though net income has not covered the dividend since 1984.  </P> <P> Irani and other Occidental officials defend the dividend, saying it is pegged  to Occidental's healthy cash flow. Irani said he has no plans to change the  dividend policy, which wins the loyalty of the company's shareholders, 64% of  whom are small investors.  </P> <P> Occidental also maintains a high level of long-term debt, in part to dissuade  raiders and in part reflecting Hammer's willingness to pursue any deal that  promises a good return. Irani admitted that reducing debt is a priority, but  added -- echoing Hammer -- that Occidental will not be deterred from a  profitable acquisition merely to avoid incurring more debt.  </P> <P> Still, in 1989 Occidental restructured its long-term debt, which stood at  $8.153 billion at the end of last year, or more than half of total capital,  which includes total debt, preferred stock and shareholders' equity. The  pay-back period was lengthened to take advantage of rising oil prices, and  interest rates were lowered.  </P> <P> A problem for Occidental's stock is that the company regularly issues new  shares to generate cash, analysts said. In January, a successful offering of 23  million new shares raised $586 million to help reduce debt, but it swelled the  number of outstanding shares to 293 million from about 100 million in 1984.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ambitious Plans  </P> <P> Irani has ambitious plans to increase revenue and income in 1990. The company  will boost capital spending by 7%, to $1.3 billion, with the greatest increases  going to oil and gas exploration. That includes aggressive drilling programs in  South America, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and China, as well as major  redevelopment of the Piper Field in the North Sea off the coast of the United  Kingdom, which the British government approved late last year.  </P> <P> Occidental has a 36.5% interest there. Production was halted by the June, 1988,  explosion that destroyed the Piper Alpha platform.  </P> <P> Piper production is expected to resume in 1992. The company also plans to  develop satellite fields near existing production facilities. A total of 275  million barrels of oil and condensate should be recovered from these North Sea  fields, of which Occidental's share will be about 100 million barrels, Irani  said.  </P> <P> Occidental stands to profit as crude oil prices rise and because of certain tax  breaks on new production from the North Sea. In 1989, Occidental said it  replaced about 130% of its total worldwide production of oil and gas through  new finds and acquisitions.  </P> <P> In the United States, Occidental completed a major restructuring of its  domestic oil and gas operations, cutting 900 jobs and saving about $100 million  a year. Occidental already has among the lowest costs of production in the oil  industry, an average of about $3.15 per barrel in 1984-88, in contrast with an  industry average of $5.58, according to John S. Herold Inc., an oil industry  research firm in Greenwich, Conn.  </P> <P> On the chemical side, analysts expect earnings to fall in 1990.  </P> <P> Irani, a chemical engineer by training, gets credit for taking Occidental's  moribund chemical operation and transforming it into the company's most  profitable unit and the source of 76% of Occidental's operating income.  </P> <P> "What Oxy had before was a checkerboard, a hodgepodge," said Andrew Gray III,  an industry analyst with the Pershing division of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;  Jenrette Securities Corp. in Jersey City, N.J. "He got them to the starting  point, which was the ethylene business, and filled in the gaps they had moving  down the pipeline . . . integrating the company," he said.  </P> <P> Irani's experience as a chemical researcher and executive enabled him to  recognize the value in unwanted chemical properties and to snap them up at  bargain prices. He oversaw a series of canny acquisitions of chemical plants,  assets and companies, culminating with the 1988 purchase of Cain Chemical for  $2.2 billion.  </P> <P> As a result, Oxychem is now a leading U.S. producer of several high-value  chemicals used to make everything from plastic pipe to antifreeze to garbage  bags to wire coatings. Gray estimates the total worth of Occidental's chemical  operations at about $7.6 billion.  </P> <P> More important, Irani integrated Occidental's chemical business, increasing its  flexibility and enabling it to withstand the ups and downs of the market a  little better than its competitors. When prices are bad, Occidental can use  chemicals that it produces in its own plants; when prices are good, it can sell  them on the open market. Many chemicals can be made with natural gas liquids  from Occidental's own oil and gas unit.  </P> <P> Occidental thus seems well positioned to ride out an expected slump in the  chemical business in 1990, analysts said. Irani said capital spending in  chemicals will remain flat at $330 million this year, which will go toward  achieving an internal goal of reducing annual production costs by $100 million.  </P> <P> Despite the company's plans, Irani -- perhaps mindful of his predecessors'  fates -- refused to compare himself to Hammer or take credit for the company's  accomplishments. "I have a very close relationship with him; he values my  opinion and I value his, greatly," he said.  </P> <P> And with modesty uncharacteristic of Hammer, he added: "You have a successful  operation by having a number of people contribute."  </P> <P> </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> After-Tax Operating Income  </P> <P> In millions of dollars  </P> <TABLE

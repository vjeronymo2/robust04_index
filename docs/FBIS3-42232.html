The  government dug several wells, reclaimed 5,000 feddans of land,  and set up a number of farms to ensure provisions for the  "Yarmuk," "al-Hudaybiyah," and "al-Qadisiyah" camps, where  Egyptian, Algerian, Tunisian, and Palestinian terrorists will be  trained in addition to some Asian and African nationals.    Dr. Usamah Bin-Ladin, who is wanted by the law in several  Arab countries, is helping the Sudanese Government to finance  these camps. Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir issued a  decree--which was published by the newspaper AL-INQADH on  Wednesday, 5 January--granting 1,550 square meters of  residential land to Bin-Ladin's al-Hijrah Company to build its  headquarters on.    Al-Bashir's decree also transferred the ownership of  "al-Mukabarat" agricultural project in the Northern region to  Bin-Ladin. Agricultural produce from the project's 20,000  feddans will be used to supply the terrorist camps. These camps  are being opened in the Northern Region in the wake of the  amendment of the Sudanese Citizenship Law.</p>

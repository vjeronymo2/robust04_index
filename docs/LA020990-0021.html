			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: BLACK HISTORY MONTH EVENTS PAY TRIBUTE TO THE IMPACT OF BLACKS IN  AMERICA  </P> <P> It started as a 10-ton block of sand on the concourse of Hawthorne Plaza. But  every day, faces out of black history emerge at the hands of sand sculptor Todd  Vander Pluym and his crew.  </P> <P> With passers-by watching Tuesday, the faces of Shirley Chisholm, the first  black woman to serve in the U.S. Congress, and musician Stevie Wonder appeared.  Before the work is completed next week, six more figures from black history --  from 19th Century underground railroad "conductor" Harriet Tubman to medical  pioneer Dr. Charles Drew and civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. --  will have taken shape.  </P> <P> Terry Magiliaccio, marketing director of the Hawthorne mall, said that 65% of  his shoppers are black, and the mall wanted to do "something special" for Black  History Month during February. "This is our interpretation of history," he  said.  </P> <P> The mall is not alone in paying tribute during the month to the black impact on  America. Cities, schools and libraries are joining in, and local events include  free dance and musical performances, community festivals, an essay contest,  storytelling, poetry, a program honoring black students, and discussions about  black athletes and black activism and politics.  </P> <P> "Our focus is to bring forth individuals who have made significant  contributions . . . and to elevate the self-esteem of young blacks," said Kai  Parker, who first organized Gardena's annual Black History Month celebration  nine years ago primarily for students. "We teach them their history so they can  produce their dreams," she said.  </P> <P> Among Gardena's events this year is the city's first African-American Cultural  Fair on Feb. 24 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Rowley Park Community Center, 13220  Van Ness Ave. Attractions will include arts and crafts, food, storytelling, and  booths providing books on African and black culture and information about  getting into college and fighting illiteracy.  </P> <P> At Cal State Dominguez Hills, philosophy professor and African-American History  Month chairman Rudy Vanterpool said events will emphasize "contributions made  by African-Americans, from medicine to sports to education, art and politics.  The idea is to capture the imagination and interest of everyone."  </P> <P> In daylong programs Wednesday and Thursday, the university -- 1000 E. Victoria  St., Carson -- will spotlight high school academic excellence and will present  talks and workshops on blacks and athletics. Among speakers will be tennis star  Arthur Ashe and sports critic Richard Lapchick . Public lectures will be given  Wednesday at 2 p.m. by Lapchick, who will speak on the politics of sports, and  Ashe, who will speak at 4 p.m. on the social impact of black athletes.  </P> <P> Like Gardena, the university also will stage an open-air festival March 3 from  10 a.m. to 4 p.m. with entertainment, food, art, a book fair, children's events  and information on community health services.  </P> <P> In addition to the centerpiece sand sculpture, Hawthorne Plaza -- at Hawthorne  and El Segundo boulevards -- has on tap:  </P> <P> * We Tell Stories, Saturday, noon, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. The storytelling troupe  will present tales out of black literature, inviting children from the audience  to participate.  </P> <P> * A grooming seminar with actress Barbara Walden, Sunday, 1 p.m.  </P> <P> * The Nyna Shannon Andersen Ensemble in "Black Music in America," Feb. 17, 1  p.m. and 3 p.m. Performances trace black music from the time of slavery through  the development of jazz.  </P> <P> * An essay contest for Hawthorne Unified School District students in grades 4  through 8. Essays will be based on the lives of leaders depicted in the sand  sculpture.  </P> <P> Aside from the cultural fair, Gardena will present:  </P> <P> * All That Dance Co. in "Dance Against Drugs," Saturday, 3 p.m., Ken Nakaota  Community Center, 1700 W. 162nd St. The show by a young cast combines dance and  narration and, as Parker put it, "says to young people, drugs do kill."  </P> <P> * "A Salute to Broadway" by the Blackwell International Academy of Performing  Arts, Feb. 17, 6 p.m., the Nakaota center. Highlights from six musicals will be  presented by 60 young performers.  </P> <P> Other Cal State Dominguez Hills events are:  </P> <P> * Panel discussion on the role of women in black liberation, Monday, 7 p.m.,  Humanities and Fine Arts Recital Hall. Panelists include Cynthia Hamilton, Cal  State Los Angeles political science and Pan-African studies professor.  </P> <P> * Three local poets will read their work Feb. 26, 7 p.m., Recital Hall.  </P> <P> * Panel discussion on grass-roots political activism, March 12, 7 p.m., Recital  Hall. Panel includes Hamilton and community activist Ron Wilkins.  </P> <P> * Panel discussion on "Gang Members and Lack of Self-Respect," March 19, 7  p.m., Recital Hall.  </P> <P> * Orlando Taylor, Howard University language specialist, speaking on "Black  English and Academic Performance," March 21, 4 p.m., Recital Hall.  </P> <P> Three films honoring Black History Month will be shown at the main Inglewood  Public Library, 101 W. Manchester Blvd. Black artists will be spotlighted  Wednesday at 7 p.m.; Harriet Tubman, Feb. 21, 7 p.m., and black music, Feb. 28  at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Faith United Methodist Church, 1713 W. 108th St., will salute black history  during 11 a.m. Sunday services throughout February and will have a benefit  "African Marketplace" Feb. 17 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  </P> <P> Actress and arts educator Marla Gibbs will be honored for her achievements Feb.  25, 2 to 4 p.m., at the A.C. Bilbrew Library, 150 El Segundo Blvd., Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Although the month's events focus on black culture and history, organizers say  they want to attract the whole community. Said Vanterpool of Dominguez Hills:  "We're trying to create an atmosphere for appreciating and understanding each  other and opening up a possibility for dialogue."  </P> <P> Gardena's Parker said she wants the celebration to bridge the gaps between  people of different cultures, saying: "We can live together if we can  understand and respect one another and our differences."

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: French bank rises 9% unexpectedly CREDIT National, the French corporate banking group, saw net profits rise by 9.1 per cent to FFr585.9m (Dollars 103.6m) in 1992 from FFr537.2m in 1991, in spite of the pressures on France's financial sector. In recent weeks a series of French financial institutions have announced disappointing results for 1992, when the banking sector was affected by weak demand for credit, higher borrowing costs following the September currency crisis and exposure to the precarious property market. Credit National, by contrast, fared well, in spite of having to increase provisions - mainly because of the need to make write-downs on its property portfolio and investments. The group managed to produce a healthy 15 per cent increase in operating profits to FFr725m. The group also benefited from a positive contribution from its partnership agreement with IKB Deutsche Industriebank, the German corporate banking group. Credit National and IKB are expanding their partnership into a cross-shareholding agreement under which each would take 5 per cent of the other's equity.</p>

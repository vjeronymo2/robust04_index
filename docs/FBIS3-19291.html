			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "Paris Criticizes </F> UNPROFOR"]    [Text] France will increase its contingent of 6,042 men by  an additional 800 men, in theory for a period limited to three  months. These reinforcements, drawn mainly from the 9th Marine  Infantry Division (2d RIMa [marine regiment], RICM [expansion  not given], 6th Engineers Regiment), will form a third French  battalion in Sarajevo.    For a long time Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has opposed  these reinforcements. He only recently consented to the  dispatch of the addtional troops after three vital preconditions  were met: The arrival on the spot of other UN contingents; the  return to France by 15 June of the battalion deployed in  Krajina; and better protection for the French blue helmets.    Originally, the prime minister's surprise visit on Sunday  [13  March] was intended to provide support and encouragement to the  French battalion stationed in Bihac, one of whose soldiers was  killed on Friday by a Serb or Bosnian marksman. Indeed it  primarily enabled Edouard Balladur to convey a message: Paris  expects the United Nations to show a more vigorous reaction when  French blue helmets suffer a deliberate attack, as was the case  on Saturday evening.    "The Serbs began to attack French elements at 1830. The  decision to respond by air fire was not made until 2335. Much  too late, especially because it was night." Colonel Chanier,  deputy chief of the SIRPA [Armed Forces Information and Public  Relations Service], said yesterday that the reaction time should  be reduced to less than one hour. Once you go beyond that,  efficacy is no longer guaranteed and the response tends to  become a reprisal action, which the UN resolutions would not  authorize.    How is it possible to move more quickly? On Saturday, the  procedure was as follows: The blue helmets attacked in the city  of Bihac reported the incident to their command posts which  requested air intervention at 1900, reporting the matter to the  military chief of the Bihac pocket, who alerted General Rose.  At 2030, the chief of the blue helmets in Bosnia reported the  matter to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] Chief General Cot.  There were then requests for explanations by the forces on the  spot. At 2150 General Cot telephoned Mr. Akashi, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's personal representative, and then sent him the  official request for an air intervention at 2240. The matter  was then referred to New York, before coming back to Zagreb,  where permission to intervene was given by Mr. Akashi at 2335.    During a private conversation, the prime minister informed  Mr. Akashi that it was "imperative" to rapidly review this  procedure. Gen. Joel Marchand, coordinator of French resources  in the former Yugoslavia, was instructed to ask UNPROFOR to  establish a rapid and effective decisionmaking process.    At the same time, Mr. Merimee, the French ambassador to the  United Nations, is to request that the delegation of powers,  currently entrusted to the UN secretary general's  representative, be given to members of the military. Or, at the  very least, that it be in the hands of authorities who are  permanently reachable.    These provisions are of a technical nature. They will be  adopted if there is a real political will within the United  Nations. Hence the political pressure which Edouard Balladur's  visit to Bihac represented.</p>

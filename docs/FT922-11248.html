			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Aircraft deal provides further test for India A Dollars 600m loan to finance the purchase of aircraft for Air India is expected to be put out for syndication among banks in London later this week, the latest test of the growing confidence among international bankers in the country's economy. India's access to international capital has been greatly enhanced since its budget in February. Measures to open up the economy to greater competition, reduce the budget deficit and allow partial convertibility of the rupee have encouraged a growing group of financiers to lend to the country again. The purchase of four Boeing 747-400 aircraft by Air India was backed late last year by ANZ and Citicorp, which together advanced Dollars 600m as a bridging loan pending completion of export credit agreements. With that process now complete, the banks are understood to be ready to put the deal out to syndication, a move that will test the international banking community's willingness to advance a substantial credit to the country. India's rehabilitation in the eyes of the international banking community was demonstrated with the completion of a Dollars 100m credit earlier this month to pay for imports of crude oil and petroleum products. The lending margin on the facility was set one third lower than on a similar credit arranged six months ago, signalling greater confidence in the Indian economy. The latest oil-related credit was the first significant facility to be arranged since the February budget. The 180-day syndicated bank credit, arranged in London by ANZ Grindlays for Indian Oil Corporation, bears an interest margin of 1 percentage point over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). The banks charged a 1.5 point interest margin for a similar facility for IOC agreed last November. Other credits to India are expected in the coming months. Eximbank of the US has made clear that it will back Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn of exports to the country. 'The positive signs have encouraged companies to look at India as a market to sell capital goods,' says one banker involved in recent credits for the country. The partial convertibility of the rupee is likely to change the financing of imports of capital goods into India. Rather than being forced to borrow in foreign currency to finance imports, Indian companies are now able to convert rupees to pay for foreign purchases, potentially reducing the demand for foreign currency lending.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: WHITTAKER LOOKS AHEAD  </P> <P> Whittaker Corp. chief Joseph Alibrandi made a lot of money for his shareholders  in the late 1980s when he began dismantling the former mini-conglomerate. Now,  the 61-year-old Alibrandi is focusing on Whittaker's next phase -- as a much  smaller firm but a very profitable one, he says.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Whittaker's stock closed last week at $11 a share, up from  $10.625 the previous week, despite the broad market's selloff. Since Jan. 1,  the stock has risen 35%.  </P> <P> Investor interest in the stock picked up again last week after the firm  reported earnings for the quarter ended April 30. Though Whittaker, now an  aerospace and biotechnology company, reported a loss from continuing operations  of 40 cents a share, that represents the last of its transition quarters, after  its June, 1989, recapitalization. Under Alibrandi, Whittaker borrowed heavily  to pay out a $40-a-share dividend. To repay the debt, Alibrandi has sold pieces  of Whittaker, continuing a 1986 divestiture plan. The big piece sold this year:  specialty chemicals, to Morton International for $220 million.  </P> <P> Alibrandi said the divestiture plan is "essentially done" and he's now focused  on running the firm -- and hunting for acquisitions in Whittaker's two core  areas. The company should return to profitability this quarter, thanks to a big  drop in interest expenses and continuing healthy sales growth in its two lines:  </P> <P> * In aerospace, Whittaker is a leading producer of controls, radar systems and  cable for commercial and military jets. Although Alibrandi admits that defense  cuts will affect Whittaker, "defense is a smaller and smaller part for us" in  key businesses such as controls, he said. Excluding one-time charges, aerospace  operating profit rose 11% in the latest quarter; revenue rose 13%.  </P> <P> * In biotech, Whittaker makes diagnostic kits for blood testing, living tissue  cultures and tissue-growing solutions. Operating profits were up 10% in the  latest quarter on a 12% revenue rise. "We see tremendous opportunity here,"  Alibrandi said.  </P> <P> In fiscal 1991 (beginning next Nov. 1), some analysts have estimated that  Whittaker could earn about $1.50 a share on revenue of $220 million. If that's  accurate, Whittaker stock, at $11 now, is selling for just seven times 1991  earnings.  </P> <P> A handful of institutional investors own big chunks of Whittaker's shares,  leaving relatively little free to trade. One of those owners is Michael Price,  who runs Heine Securities in Short Hills, N.J. Heine had about 600,000 of  Whittaker's 8.3 million shares at March 31. Price's discipline is searching for  strong companies that generate healthy cash flow, and Whittaker fits that bill,  he said. "We think the stock is worth $15," he said.  </P> <P> Alibrandi, who himself owns 10% of Whittaker's shares, says he's "aiming to  prove Price is too low" in his estimate.  </P> <P> Retail Sell Signal? It had been a great spring for retailers' stocks -- until  last week. May sales reports came in disappointing, partly because of cold  weather across much of the country.  </P> <P> The ensuing stock selloff was brutal for a few retailers in particular. Few  were hit harder than Gap Inc., which plunged 15.3% for the week to $56.125.  </P> <P> Thomas Tashjian, retail analyst for Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles,  says he told clients to take profits in Gap on June 1. Gap had an aggressive  sales plan for the first half of the year, Tashjian says, but the May cold snap  meant low sales of Gap shorts and T-shirts.  </P> <P> Now, though "we are getting some good signals on early June sales, they're not  at a pace to make up for the shortfall" at Gap, Tashjian said. Translation: Big  markdowns are coming.  </P> <P> But Tashjian still sees Gap earning $3.60 a share this year. That gives the  stock a price-to-earnings multiple of about 15 now, which is about the market  average. Tashjian figures that makes the stock a buy for anyone with a  long-term perspective. This isn't the first time Gap has stumbled, but its  managers are some of the savviest in the business -- they just can't predict  the weather.  </P> <P> At the other end of the retail spectrum, L.A.-based Carter Hawley Hale  (Broadway, Weinstock's, Emporium) saw its stock jump 20% for the week, to  $6.625. It wasn't Carter Hawley's May sales report that did it, because sales  were lousy. Instead, analyst Edward Weller at Montgomery Securities said a  rumor was going around that the firm wants to sell its Thalhimers department  stores in the East. Carter Hawley wouldn't comment. In any case, analysts warn  that this debt-heavy company remains a stock for speculators only, because it's  still bleeding red ink.  </P> <P> RETAIL DISCOUNTING  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Fri.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="2" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Loss for week:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Stock  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> close  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Points  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Pct.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Gap Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $56 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -10 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -15.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Limited  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 46 1/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -3 7/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -7.7%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Home Depot  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 56 3/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -4 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -7.4%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dayton Hudson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 72 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -3 3/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -4.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Price Co.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 37  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -1 1/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -3.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May Dept.

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: SA gold mine plans R284m rights issue Joel, the South African gold mine controlled by Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, yesterday announced a R284m (Dollars 82m) rights issue and new mining plan. Joel will redeem R150m worth of preference shares, and pay for the early stages of an eight-year R657m revamp of the mine's underground and surface operations through the issue of 98m new shares at 290 cents each. JCI, which is part of the Anglo American group, and the Sanlam life insurance company, holders of 55 per cent and 7 per cent stakes in Joel, will take up their entitlement to the offer. The balance will be underwritten by Smith New Court and NM Rothschild. JCI has sunk R900m into Joel since 1987, but in the past year considered closing or merging it with the neighbouring Beatrix mine, owned by Gencor. Joel's results have been dented by high working costs and heavy borrowings.</p>

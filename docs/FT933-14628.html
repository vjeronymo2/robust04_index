			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China treats foot-and-mouth outbreak as 'state secret' THE CHINESE government is treating as a 'state secret' widespread outbreaks of foot and mouth disease on pig farms in the country's south while infected meat is still being sent to market. Agriculture officials have confirmed outbreaks of epizootic aphthae, which they refer to as 'disease number five', in Jiangsu, Guangdong and Anhui provinces. One official in the south-eastern city of Suzhou in Jiangsu, refusing to give details, would say only that it was a 'state secret'. The disease is an air-born virus that, while not infecting people who eat the meat of diseased pigs, render sthe pork unfit for human consumption. A western agriculture expert based in Beijing said it was standard international procedure to slaughter all infected animals and then incinerate their carcasses. He said that once epizootic aphthae made an appearance among livestock, it spread rapidly and could be 'very nasty'. He added that it could easily be prevented with wide-ranging anti-viral drugs not widely used or in some cases even available in China. Pigs farmers in China's south began slaughtering hogs in large numbers about two months ago, but there has been no suggestion of localised quarantining or of preventing the sale of the infected meat. Pork is by far the favourite meat of the Chinese. Rising affluence has led in recent years to a drop in pork consumption, though it still accounts for more than 70 per cent of all meat eaten in China. Figures from the Ministry of Agriculture show that last year China raised 380m pigs, 13.17m in Guangdong and 21.22m in Anhui. Most of the country's pork is produced in south-western Sichuan Province, which is also China's most populous. There have been no reports so far of any foot and mouth outbreaks in Sichuan. A veterinarian in Nantong city on the Yangste River north of the major port of Shanghai said the disease was 'no longer a serious problem in Jiangsu Province'. But he said there were outbreaks in Guangdong and Anhui provinces, where substantial quantities of pork are produced for both domestic and export consumption. Officials in both those provinces denied the existence of foot and mouth disease on local pig farms. The Nantong vet said 'disease number five' usually spread through southern pig farms in early spring but pork from infected animals was sent to market, as normal and as a matter of course. He said details were kept secret because China was 'not a signatory to the relevant international agreement that bans the export and sale of infected pork'. Most of the pork consumed in the British colony of Hong Kong and the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau, both of which border Guangdong Province, is imported from China. China also exports significant quantities to the states of the former Soviet Union and to North Korea, with smaller amounts sold to Japan, Thailand, Singapore, the Netherlands, Germany, France and Czechoslovakia. Last year Hong Kong also imported 25m kg of frozen Chinese pork. On an average day, 7,686 live pigs cross the Chinese border into Hong Kong, 1,411 from Guangdong. The colony's health department says imported pigs are routinely inspected for foot and mouth disease, as well as other infectious diseases and pest infestations. The colony's veterinary officer said he had no knowledge of people getting sick from eating meat from pigs infected with epizootic aphthae. 'Meat from animals with foot and mouth disease, even accidentally contaminated, rarely cause disease in human beings,' the health department said. 'There has not been any case (of illness) reported through consumption of meat in Hong Kong.'</p>

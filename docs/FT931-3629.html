Horizon sets out to discover 'Whatever happened to star wars', Ronald Reagan's super wizzo giant ray gun system for shooting enemy missiles out of the sky (8.00 BBC2). World In Action reveals that almost half the UK's ambulance services are failing to meet government standards. Perhaps we ought to have a patients' charter . . . (8.30 ITV).

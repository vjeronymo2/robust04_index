			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Sterling faces test STERLING will face the true test of its late rally last week, as the markets gather in full force after the new year holiday. Its moves in a thin market last week were dismissed as exaggerated and misleading by many traders. There was some speculation that the pound would come under renewed pressure, although dealers believed that the Bank of England would be more visible in supporting the UK currency than in recent weeks. 'The bank has sufficient reserves to fend off a fairly good downwards push on the pound,' said Mr David Dean, assistant chief dealer at Barclays. The pressure for a rise in interest rates had been eased somewhat by sterling's strength. 'At the moment things are looking comfortable,' said one senior dealer. Sterling, along with the dollar, had become a safe haven for investors fleeing the D-Mark. But traders said were expecting a reappraisal of the pound and the dollar this week. In the US, investors will be watching the outcome of President George Bush's visit to Tokyo this week, where it is likely that he will win some concessions to keep the yen firm. President Bush arrives in Tokyo on Tuesday. The urgency of his efforts to put some life into a moribund economy will be highlighted by the employment report due out this Friday. 'We will find out just how awful the US economy really is,' said Dr Mark Austin, economist with Hongkong Bank. The Federal Reserve has been debating the need for a further cut in its fund rate as a last-ditch measure to spark economic recovery before the election.</p>

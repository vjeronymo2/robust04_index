			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hsia Wen-szu (1115 2429 1835): "Beijing's </F> Political Situation Is Critical and Unpredictable"]    [Text] A reformist economist recently commented on  Beijing's political situation, and shook his head. He only  uttered four characters in conclusion: "Full of unpredictable  crises and dangers."    He said: The current political situation is extremely  complicated. Various signs show that Deng Xiaoping is no longer  able to control the overall situation. Since the end of last  year, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji have held the power in their  hands and have been going their own ways. They even wantonly  changed Deng's policies. Some conservatives also acted more  flagrantly, and even tried to totally overthrow the reform line  set forth by Deng in the past more than 10 years.    In an article about Beijing's situation I wrote in April, I  quoted an authoritative source saying that Deng Xiaoping could  not say anything when meeting Shanghai leaders at the last  Spring Festival. The remarks quoted by the newspapers were all  uttered by his daughter. Moreover, Deng Xiaoping had not given  any policy instruction in the past few months. The remarks by  Deng being spread outside the mainland might all be cooked up by  Deng's family members and Deng's personal office.    The information was recently reconfirmed by another Beijing  source, who told this author that Deng Xiaoping always stayed at  home in Beijing and had become completely senile. He could only  utter some indistinct murmurs and could not say even a complete  sentence. What he wanted to say was completed and expressed by  his daughter Deng Rong, and Deng was also rather confused and  muddle-headed.    The source said that as Deng's health was getting worse, he  was no longer able to concern himself about any political  affairs. In September last year, the mainland newspapers  suddenly made public some of Deng's remarks, and stressed  "development is the last word." This reflected Deng's discontent  with Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic control. In fact, the remark  was created by Deng Rong and the Deng Xiaoping Office, who tried  to issue the paramount order in the name of Deng Xiaoping.  However, Deng Rong's action could only play a temporary role.  After Deng Xiaoping appeared on television during the Spring  Festival this year, Jiang Zemin and other leaders no longer gave  any consideration to his existence.    The source said that political circles in Beijing generally  agreed that Deng Xiaoping was already a living dead man, and the  political situation would not be affected by his existence or  nonexistence.    The fact that showed Deng Xiaoping's inability to control  the  political situation was that de-Dengism had appeared in Beijing.    At the national propaganda work conference last January,  Jiang Z emin suddenly again mentioned the subject of "peaceful  evolution," which became taboo after Deng's inspection tour of  the south in 1992, and talked a lot about criticizing bourgeois  liberalization. After that, a number of leaders in Beijing also  talked about the issue of "peaceful evolution."    Moreover, the CPC authorities also gave a new interpretation  to Deng's opinion on guarding against and opposing Leftism. Not  long ago, an instruction of the Central Propaganda Department  was issued to the press institutions in Beijing, saying that  Deng Xiaoping's opinion on guarding against Leftism mainly  referred to things in the economic field rather than in the  political and ideological field. In the political and  ideological field, there should not be anti-Leftism.    Some people in political circles in Beijing said that Lu  Ping's remark that Hong Kong cannot become a political city was  a new interpretation by the CPC authorities of the "one country,  two systems" principle. If "one country, two systems" is  applied to the political field, that will mean that China will  give up the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.    In fact, the leftist turn of China's political situation  from  the beginning of this year indicated the beginning of de-Dengism  pursued by the CPC authorities.    The Beijing sources said that at present, only Chen Yun  among  the old guard still maintains a certain influence in the CPC  leadership. Chen Yun was satisfied at Jiang Zemin's tough  performance, and also expressed appreciation of Jiang Zemin's  ploy of alternately releasing and arresting pro-democracy  activists. Recently, when commenting on Jiang Zemin's work,  Chen Yun said that Jiang could "correctly assess the situation  and take resolute and realistic action."    As the economic reform in the mainland of China entered the  throes of the stage marked by the agricultural crisis, the  runaway inflation, the strained state treasury, and the upsurge  of labor unrest, the CPC authorities shifted the top priority  from economic growth to the maintenance of stability and the  prevention of popular unrest. Before another anniversary of the  4 June incident, the CPC Political Bureau held an enlarged  meeting, once again stressing the need to take all necessary  means to prevent troublemakers' activities. It stressed that  dissidents should be caught boldly, and it does not matter if  anybody is wrongly caught. Anyhow, troublemakers must not be  given any opportunity to do what they want.    In order to tighten control over pro-democracy activists, an  addition will be made to Article 18 of the Penalty Regulations  for the Management of Public Security concerning the treatment  of those convicted who are put under surveillance, deprived of  political rights, released on parole, or sentenced with  suspension, so that pro-democracy activists released from prison  may be rearrested at any time.    In accordance with a central instruction, the local  authorities in all parts of the country have tightened up  surveillance over dissidents. According to Guangdong sources,  former pro-democracy activities working in Guangdong were all  investigated and interrogated. Recently, many dissidents in  various parts of the country were arrested or suddenly  disappeared. Wei Jingsheng, a leading figure in China's  pro-democracy movement, was arrested in March. Since then,  nobody knows his whereabouts. Although the CPC authorities  denied that Wei would be charged with treason, Beijing sources  said that the authorities would apply the new Penalty  Regulations for the Management of Public Security to accuse Wei  of violating the rules for release on parole.    In the new arrest spree, many ex-activists were wronged as  the CPC authorities pursued the policy of "rather arresting  1,000 innocent people than letting one activist off." A former  activist in Hunan went to do business in Beijing and met a  friend who was also a former activist. In the sensitive pre-4  June period, he was detained for more than 10 days in Beijing,  and was again taken away by the local public security  authorities after returning to Changsha. His whereabouts remain  unknown to other people.    Many localities have set up special bodies for preventing  turmoil and set up riot police brigades in accordance with the  central instruction. Two months ago 10 antiriot regiments of  the People's Liberation Army were on the highest level of alert.    A mainland intellectual told me that China was now  experiencing a white terror. The degree of such terror was  demonstrated by the parade of 10,000 antiriot troops in Changsha.    During the pro-democracy movement in 1989, Changsha City in  Hunan was one of the cities witnessing the strongest popular  ferment. In early April, the city set up a 10,000-strong  antiriot force composed of public security personnel, armed  police troops, and militia units. The headquarters of the  antiriot force was located in the college district on the west  bank of the Xiang Jiang. In order to intimidate the public, on  17 May, the antiriot force staged a large-scale parade around  the city. The policemen carried machine-guns and rode  motorcycles; and the militiamen carried wooden clubs and rode on  large trucks. The mighty procession was filled with an  atmosphere of killing, which made people recall the dramatic  scenes of the worker guards during the Cultural Revolution.    According to Changsha people, when the antiriot force was  founded, the daily allowances issued to its members were  collected from random fines imposed on taxi drivers and drivers  of other vehicles. This aroused strong resentment among the  taxi drivers, and their business was seriously affected.    As the CPC authorities, which had turned to the leftist  side,  feared the appearance of popular unrest, the conservatives, on  the contrary, tried hard to stir up trouble in society and abet  workers in staging strikes.    After Zhu Rongji exercised macrocontrol to tighten up the  supply of credit, the state-owned enterprises whose business  results were always poor were suddenly faced with a halt to  blood transfusions. Innumerable large factories and mines were  forced to suspend operation wholly or partly, and workers there  could not maintain their basic livelihood. Incidents of labor  unrest arose one after another in all parts of the country. An  official trade union cadre told me that strikes are happening  almost every day in China.    In the previous issue of KAI FANG, I wrote a report about  the  incident in which 100,000 workers in Heilongjiang took to the  streets to stage a petition-demonstration. The latest news is  that somebody in the central authorities was fanning such  strikes behind the scenes. The sources said that some people of  the former Wang Zhen Office recently became very active in some  factories and mines, where workers were living in difficult  conditions. They agitated for people there to stage strikes and  disturbances. The sources said that such people acted according  to the ideas of some conservatives in the central authorities.  Labor unrest mainly took place in state-owned enterprises. The  conservatives said that the reforms had driven workers to a  position of losing their means of livelihood, so the  disturbances staged by the workers could defend the socialist  public ownership system. Obviously, these people tried to add  to the troubles of the top leadership and thus force the top  leadership to back down from the ongoing reforms.    The underground labor activists were confused after learning  about this. They organized workers to struggle for their own  rights and interests, but they did not want to be used by the  conservatives. So they did not know what they should do.</p>

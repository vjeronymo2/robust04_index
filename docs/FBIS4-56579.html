			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 5 May (EFE) -- Haitian parliament  President Frantz Robert Monde has asked the United States and  the United Nations to pressure ousted Haitian President Jean  Bertrand Aristide to appoint a prime minister, otherwise the  deputies will fill the void in the executive branch.    Monde's request, contained in letters sent to President Bill  Clinton and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, was  disclosed in Haiti on Wednesday. This is one day after the  United States presented the UN Security Council a draft  resolution for a total trade embargo against Haiti to pressure  the military to give up power. Monde indicated to Clinton and  Butrus-Ghali that he favors negotiations between Haiti to save  whatever is left of the nation. He also asked Clinton not to be  influenced by members of what he called "the black caucus" in  the U.S. Congress because they are defending their own interests  through the Haitian crisis.    Meanwhile on Wednesday, a group of deputies analyzed  President Clinton's warning to the military coupists to  relinquish power. Duly Brutus, from the Progressive Nationalist  and Revolutionary Haitian party, socialist in leaning, said the  best way to avoid the loss of sovereignty is to request General  Raoul Cedras, Armed Forces chief, to fulfill his promise to  resign -- in keeping with the agreement signed at Governor's  Island in New York in 1993.    Nevertheless, other deputies, such as Pierre Francois Vital,  have proposed the appointment of a temporary prime minister by  parliament until Aristide designates one, as provided for in the  Constitution.    Legislator Joseph Lambert suggested Aristide be asked to  order the Armed Forces to take a position to defend the country  in light of possible U.S. military intervention. Lambert said  that if Aristide does not issue this order, he will be blamed  for the U.S. intervention and tried for it.    Senator Bernard Sansaricq reiterated his petition that  Constitutional Article No. 149 be implemented, and that Supreme  Court President Emile Jonassaint be appointed temporary  president.    In addition to the critical political situation, two  sympathizers of deposed President Aristide were arrested  arbitrarily in Port-au-Prince at the end of April. The OAS-UN  civilian mission, which is in Haiti supervising the human rights  situation, denounced these arrests.    The international mission expressed "great concern" over  these arbitrary arrests and the illegal detentions, and asked  the Armed Forces to respect legal dispositions regarding human  rights and the mental integrity of individuals.    The wave of violence heightened in the past hours when the  body of Jean Verdy Bastien, head of a lottery company, renowned  businessman, and owner of the "Celeste F.M" radio station, was  found. Bastien, a wealthy businessman who was linked to  political groups opposed to President Aristide, was shot to  death in Port-au-Prince the night of 4 May. The motive for this  murder remains unknown.    In April, five employees of another lottery company were  also  shot to death under circumstances still unknown. Today, local  media reported that on 4 May, three bodies riddled with bullets  were found in various areas of the country.</p>

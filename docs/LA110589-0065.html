			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HATCHET MAN  </P> <P> Remember New Century/Vista's "The Stepfather," the 1987 suspense thriller about  a murderous family man? It won positive reviews, but never did find an audience  -- despite four different ad campaigns.  </P> <P> So why are we getting "Stepfather II," opening in N.Y.C. this weekend, with a  release here Friday?  </P> <P> "There is a strong, strong awareness of the first movie," figured Russell  Schwartz, exec VP of Miramax Films, which releases "II" through its Millimeter  Films division -- awareness based partly on the original's exposure in cassette  and TV syndication.  </P> <P> As for advertising this time around: "We're not pulling any punches. . . .  We've made a very substantial TV buy and we're going big and broad."  </P> <P> That includes two TV campaigns -- a genre horror spot, another aimed at an  upscale audience, focusing on the movie's psychological aspects.  </P> <P> Tag for both: "Make Room for Daddy." Stacy Jenel Smith  </P></p>

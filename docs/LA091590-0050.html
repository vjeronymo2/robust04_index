			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SRI LANKAN TROOPS FACE HEAVY RESISTANCE IN REBEL STRONGHOLD  </P> <P> Government troops fought house-to-house with Tamil rebels in the town of Jaffna  on Friday, a day after Sri Lankan forces stormed a colonial fort in the rebel  stronghold to rescue a trapped garrison.  </P> <P> Military sources said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were putting up  strong resistance as troops advanced to clear rebel positions around the fort.  </P> <P> "There's house-to-house fighting going on there," a military officer said.  </P> <P> About 1,600 soldiers stormed into Jaffna on Thursday and relieved the garrison,  which had been under rebel siege for the past three months.  </P> <P> By Friday morning, 24 soldiers, including five officers, and 130 rebels were  killed in the first 24 hours, military sources said. About 130 soldiers were  wounded.  </P> <P> In the farming outpost of Vavuniya, 70 miles south of Jaffna, a senior military  officer said Tamil rebels were becoming divided and were sending peace feelers  to the army.  </P> <P> "We ignore them or pretend to have not received these messages," the officer  said. "The rebels in this area seem to want a cease-fire. But that is for the  politicians to decide. Until then, we will hold and consolidate our positions."  </P></p>

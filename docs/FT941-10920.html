			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (5): Exciting investments with a rosy glow - Most countries are moving rapidly up the development curve Asia provided some of the world's most exciting investments last year. US institutional investors, in particular, became more aware of the economic prospects for the region, as markets in the developed world appeared less appealing. East and south-east Asian countries, after years of rapid growth, do increasing amounts of business with each other. Their development is therefore more self-sustaining and less reliant on the health of the industrialised world - though they still depend very much on keeping their exports competitive. Most countries are moving rapidly up the development curve, seeking to focus on higher technology and expertise and leaving labour-intensive, low-cost production to emerging countries such as China and Vietnam. South-east Asian markets saw large inflows of foreign cash at the end of 1993 and a number have since seen price corrections. However, their economic outlook remains rosy. Hong Kong, too, saw a big influx of investment from abroad in spite of the Sino-British row over its political development. Investors are attracted to the Hong Kong market as a proxy for China, which is seen as the world's most promising growth prospect over the coming decade but still offers only limited means of direct portfolio investment. The exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, however, are likely to see many more companies listed in the next few years. South Korea and Taiwan are viewed as attractive markets by foreign institutions. However, the governments in Seoul and Taipei severely restrict the amount and means of investment from abroad. The Indian subcontinent has seen economic reform and promises more, with India already boasting a large and well-developed stock market which is increasingly catching attention abroad. Governments in New Delhi, Islamabad and Colombo still have to overcome chronic political problems before they can boast the kind of economic growth rates seen further east. But there is considerable potential. Elsewhere, Vietnam's economic reforms may soon lead to the establishment of a stock market. Mongolia, mired in economic problems, boasts a stock exchange which has been used to hasten privatisation.</p>

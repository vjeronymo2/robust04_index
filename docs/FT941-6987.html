			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Small, but thinking big - Chamberlain De Broe, fifth in a series on fee-based advisers Four years ago, James Higgins launched Chamberlain De Broe with a handful of colleagues plus 'a top-up mortgage and a couple of gold cards.' Today, he is laying plans for a mini-flotation in the summer. Little wonder that he claims the insurance industry exaggerates consumers' resistance to fee-based advice. He says: 'We will be selling off part of the company to raise finance to duplicate this London office in a number of towns. Basically, we are saying that Chamberlain De Broe has come from nowhere to a turnover of Pounds 1m in four years and it is now going somewhere else. I don't want to stay a small player. I think the country can support Chamberlain De Broe offices in every major city.' A business studies graduate, Higgins worked in the financial services industry for 10 years before founding Chamberlain De Broe in 1990. During that period, he became increasingly uncomfortable with the prevailing sales-driven environment. He says: 'I wanted to advise on savings which paid no commission whatsoever: to have the pleasure of being able to say to people 'Keep your money in the building society and we will tell you when to jump.' If someone comes in with a lot of money, we want them to retain us - but we don't want to sell them anything on the first day. 'People know there is no vested interest in what we say. I don't like what commission hunger does to people. I remain convinced that the structure of the industry has worked against the consumer and the adviser having a sound relationship.' The fledgling firm, with its made-up name, had some good fortune soon after launching when it produced a booklet on inheritance tax planning. Such publications may be common - but this one was mentioned on a Channel 4 television programme. Before Chamberlain De Broe's tiny staff could catch its breath, 12,000 people had asked for a copy. Higgins says: 'We didn't even have computers and it cost us a fortune, but that's where it really started because we had put a bit in the booklet on the fees versus commission question. We survived because there was a high level of demand. We received a lot of positive editorial because we were telling a different story and that was newsworthy. To be blunt, the reason people call, and follow through, is because there is not a lot of opposition out there.' Like many fee-based advisers, Chamberlain De Broe does not bill clients for an initial meeting. 'It gives us a chance to see if we can do anything for them,' Higgins explains. 'At the moment, I try to see all new prospective clients. We put a lot of effort into understanding the client in the first place. We concentrate like crazy.' While Chamberlain De Broe does not require any minimum initial investment from a client, it does not pretend it can help the Pounds 20-a-month saver or the investor of modest means. Higgins suggests that the average Chamberlain De Broe retainer client 'will probably need to be someone with capital of around Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 200,000 before we can add value.' Once a client is signed up, the firm aims to be his financial general factotum. Five staff deal with private clients and two more handle the still small corporate client business. Chamberlain De Broe's execution-only services, which tend to centre on unit trusts, new launches and new issues, are charged on a fixed-rate basis. 'These people don't need attention, by and large,' says Higgins. 'They know what's what out there and they want to deal.' Fees for the firm's all-embracing retainer service - which provides regular reviews of all a client's affairs and personal contact once a year - are more fluid and reflect the compexity of his needs. They could be as low as Pounds 450 but the average is Pounds 1,800. Higgins says: 'We try to time-base the fees as much as we can. We look at someone and see how much time they will take, over the year. If someone comes in with Pounds 2.5m, for instance, you know they will take up more of your time.' Although Chamberlain De Broe does a considerable amount of investment work, this is not the major feature of its personalised financial planning service. 'We do the asset allocation but we farm out the investment management,' says Higgins. 'My idea is to be the focal point of the client's affairs.' No client money is handled by the firm.' Higgins favours a pyramid structure for clients' investment portfolios. 'The base has loads of cash, particularly at the moment. The little bit on the top is the risk money.' He cites Genesis Chile as one of his successes. 'It did incredibly well for us but, in the same market, we went into a Latin American warrant fund where I panicked totally. I went in, made 5 per cent overnight and bailed out. It then shot up.' The Chamberlain De Broe London office is on the corner of Haymarket, near Piccadilly Circus, and the firm will open another branch in the West Country later this year. Higgins anticipates a trouble-free launch. He says: 'I have gone through the learning curve. Today, I won't waste so much effort on the execution business. It is attractive for cash flow but there is not much profit and there was a time when far too much of our resources were going to these clients.' Higgins adds: 'What we are trying to do is bring the personal service back. The financial services industry doesn't offer that. It offers a sales service.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Independents  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Name of financial adviser:       Chamberlain De Broe Ltd Address of head office:          130 Jermyn Street,                                  London                                  SW1Y 4OJ Date firm was established:       March 1990 Regulator:                       Fimbra Funds under management:          Pounds 30m not including BES, Gibs or                                  execution-only sums Number of clients:               170 retainer; 2,500 execution only Number of offices:               1 Minimum investment accepted:     None Services offered:                Personalised 'bespoke' financial                                  planning and investment execution-only                                  services Fees:                            Pounds 1,800 (average)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Observer: Casting wide It is not often that British Aerospace is held up as a role model. However, its speedy choice of a new chairman to replace John Cahill may help Fokker, the loss-making Dutch aircraft maker, narrow its search for a successor to Erik Jan Nederkoorn. Nederkoorn, who seems to have been even more unpopular with some of his troops than Cahill, quit Fokker after failing to get the board to agree to his restructuring plans. However, the Dutch are still smarting over last year's sale of a 51 per cent stake in Fokker to Germany's Dasa, so it's extremely unlikely that the controlling shareholder dare parachute in a German, at least at this early stage. On the other hand, Dasa is thought to be reluctant to hand over the helm to yet another prickly and emotional Dutchman. Fokker's headhunters, Egon Zehnder, could do worse than follow BAe's lead and suggest a chairman from a neutral country. BAe does not expect any difficulty getting its articles of association changed so that it can accommodate America's Bob Bauman.</p>

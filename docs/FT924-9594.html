			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Reynolds plans aluminium car component facility REYNOLDS Metals, third-largest of the world's aluminium groups, is to spend Dollars 26m on a plant at Auburn, Indiana, to produce aluminium extruded components for the automotive industry. Technology for the components - such as bumper systems, door intrusion beams and sunroof tracks - was developed at a Reynolds' plant in the Netherlands. Several employees will be transferred from there to the new facility in the US, which is due to start up in late 1993. Reynolds, in common with most of the other western world aluminium companies, has identified the automotive industry as a key market with long-term potential. Mr Richard Holder, chairman, said recently the most conservative forecasts predicted the aluminium content of the average US car would more than double in the next five years from 170lbs in 1991 to 350lbs. He said Reynolds would make a much better return on its aluminium in this kind of fabricated form. The Indiana plant will be highly automated, employ about 120 people, and have the capacity to use 14m lb of aluminium a year. Reynolds is following in the wake of its main rival, the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa), which is setting up its own aluminium car component plant in Germany and has joint ventures in Japan and the US with Kobe Steel and Aluminium. Hydro Aluminium of Norway is also expected shortly to announce an aluminium car components plant at a facility in Michigan.</p>

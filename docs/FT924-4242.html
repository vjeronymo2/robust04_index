			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Observer: Jefferson in blue jeans It sounded odd a month ago when Germany's official welcome of Bill Clinton's victory called him 'William'. But perhaps the German government knew something nobody else knew then. With the announcement of plans for January's presidential inauguration, humble Bill has suddenly become not only William but also Jefferson, which happens to be his middle name and quite a convenient one for any US president. In sketching out the four-day inaugural celebrations, Democrat chairman Ron Brown talked of the national 'rite of passage'. In reality what Washington is going to experience is a right to party. It includes 10 inaugural balls (which at Dollars 125 a ticket are cheaper than Reagan's and Bush's bashes), eight big public events including a special party for the homeless with the admission fee being food and clothing, and a 'gathering' for diplomats at Georgetown University, Clinton's alma mater and also home to the US school of foreign service. The total bill will also undercut the Reagan and Bush inaugurals at around Dollars 20m - 90 per cent funded, like Norman Lamont's legal bills, by private contributors with the rest coming from sales of officially sanctioned souvenirs. For the socially conscious, William Jefferson Clinton will wear black tie to the balls, but jeans to his Arkansas party.</p>

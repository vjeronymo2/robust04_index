			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: British red tape a barrier to trade with Poland Sir, Your leader, 'The way ahead for Poland' (January 21), draws attention to the remarkably quick privatisation of its retail, wholesale and service sectors. The difference from even one year ago is dramatic and you rightly pinpoint the Polish entrepreneurial spirit in achieving this. What is perhaps less understood in the west is that this transformation has been achieved following the dismantling of Polish import controls and the lifting of visa restrictions on Polish businessmen in most EC countries. The effect is visible at Frankfurt airport where one now constantly hears the Polish language spoken; snippets of conversations about commodity prices, discounts, transport costs - all the tiny details which are the oil of a modern retail system. It is also visible on the motorways of western Europe, where Polish registered trucks move the goods which ultimately appear on the shelves in Polish shops. Now, the same entrepreneurial spirit which has transformed the retail sector is begining to have an effect on manufacturing. By-passing the moribund state industries, individuals and groups are setting up factories to produce industrial and consumer goods which a modern society needs. Everything from satellite TV dishes to electric power cables, plastic bottles and petrol pumps. To do this, they need modern production equipment. Where do these entrepreneurs buy their equipment? Naturally, they buy from suppliers to whom access is easiest. A Polish businessman intent on establishing a plant for making plastic bottles for soft drinks, gets into his car and drives, without hindrance, to German, Italian and French potential suppliers. To go to Britain, though, he still needs a visa. And to get this, he must firstly obtain a written invitation from a British company, then he must submit an application at the British consulate in Warsaw, then he has to queue for hours to suffer a personal interview and finally weeks, or months later (or sometimes never) he gets a visa. Why should he bother himself with the trouble and humiliation? Britain is further away and there are few products which Britain makes which cannot be bought closer. Poland is a country of 40m people ranking in size as one of Europe's largest economies. It has a well-educated industrialised population, it is investment starved and it has an entrepreneurial business class which is buying now] Mostly they are not buying in Britain.

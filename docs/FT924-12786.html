			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Russia needs Dollars 500m to train accountants THE RUSSIAN parliament is expected to apply for up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 290m) in foreign aid to help train millions of accountants over the next few years, Andrew Jack writes. Mr Anatoly Sheremet, head of accounting at Moscow State University and an influential figure in the emerging accountancy profession, said he met officials from the World Bank last week to discuss loans for training proposals. He thought it likely that the Russian parliament would apply to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund over the next few months. He estimated that Dollars 500m would be required to cover the costs of training teachers, translating and publishing textbooks and buying computers. Mr Sheremet, who was visiting the US to attend the World Congress of Accountants last week, said: 'I told the World Bank: Without accountants there will be no market economy.' The Association of Accountants of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which he heads, has estimated a need for more than 2m new accountants in the next three to four years, including 100,000 with skills equivalent to chartered accountants.</p>

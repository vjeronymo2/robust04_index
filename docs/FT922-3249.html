			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Gascoigne sale nets Pounds 5.5m for Spurs TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, the north London football club controlled by Mr Alan Sugar and Mr Terry Venables, has received nearly Pounds 6m after completing the sale of Paul Gascoigne to Lazio of Italy. After paying about Pounds 300,000 to Newcastle United, Gascoigne's former club, and other expenses, Tottenham will gain Pounds 5.5m. This will give it net cash for the first time for some years. Debt peaked at about Pounds 15m and the previous biggest con-tribution to its reduction was a Pounds 7m rights issue announced in December and underwritten by Mr Sugar, the chairman, who also heads Amstrad, the consumer electronics group. Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said the net cash achievement followed expenditure of about Pounds 2.5m on players. However, a further Pounds 2m remained to be paid in stages. Apart from the Gascoigne sale, Tottenham's 1992-93 profits will benefit from a new Pounds 1.9m three-year sponsorship contract with Holsten, the German lager company. This roughly doubles the previous contract figure. The Premier League's proposed television deal with BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, should bring in Pounds 1.5m, much more than the previous figure for Football League matches. Amstrad distributes satellite dishes and Mr Sugar has been a leading advocate of the BSkyB deal. A further fillip will be provided by a 'duel' between Tottenham and Lazio. Tottenham said yesterday that Mr Venables, chief executive, was negotiating the television rights for the home and away games. TV fees and gate money could total Pounds 500,000. Tottenham returned to profit in the six months to November 30 with Pounds 810,000 pre-tax in a period that included most of the close season. Results for the year to May 31 are expected to be announced in September.</p>

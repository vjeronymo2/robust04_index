			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by RID correspondent Anatoliy Vitkovskiy: "We Need </F> Socialism With a Human Face"]    [Text] This remarkable saying is still favored by the  majority of Belarusian citizens, however, currently, it has  acquired a "deeper" sense, because the aforementioned "face,"  according to the opinion of the majority of our citizens, should  be... private.    The scenario looks like this: According to the poll "We and  Our Time," conducted by the Independent Institute of  Socioeconomic and Political Research, along with the  International Center of Support of Entrepreneurship, the  majority of respondents -- 40.9 percent -- think that socialism  is the most appropriate social system for Belarus. Capitalism  is supported by 31.6 percent. At the same time, 52.8 percent  think that private ownership is economically more efficient.  Only 29 percent favor social ownership. Some 11.7 percent  support a rational combination of private and social ownership.    Emotions caused by nostalgia for "the best, the most humane  in the world" will likely dominate people's minds for a long  time to come. In connection with this, we would like to learn  what social order our current leaders are building in our state.  It is high time to clarify this provocative question.</p>

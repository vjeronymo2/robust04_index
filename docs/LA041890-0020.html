			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EDISON DENIES CLAIM OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT;  </P> <P> UTILITIES: AN EMPLOYEE OF THE LOS ANGELES-AREA COMPANY CHARGED THAT POWERFUL  CUSTOMERS GET FASTER SERVICE DURING OUTAGES.  </P> <P> Southern California Edison officials Tuesday denied an employee's claim that  the Rosemead-based utility has lists of powerful customers who get faster  service during power outages.  </P> <P> Reginald Henry, a 17-year Edison employee, made the allegations at a Monday  press conference in San Diego arranged by Utility Consumers Action Network, a  San Diego-based consumer group that is challenging Edison's efforts to take  over San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. The list supplied by Henry included the  names of Edison executives, a former U.S. attorney general, several Los Angeles  Times executives, corporate officers and a handful of California lawmakers.  </P> <P> Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps acknowledged that the utility's district offices  maintain "sensitive customer lists," but said they "do not exist to provide  preferential service treatment to any customers."  </P> <P> Rather, Phelps said, the lists are compiled to "provide rapid telephone  notification to individuals who have a need to know the nature and extent of  power outages . . . Edison seeks to restore all circuits affected as quickly as  possible."  </P> <P> Henry has "completely misrepresented and distorted the purpose" of the lists,  Phelps said.  </P> <P> Henry alleged that Edison has made a practice of developing lists titled  "Officers, Directors and Other Sensitive Customers." "The purpose of the lists  is to provide priority service to the residences of those on the lists in the  event of circuit interruptions and extended outages," Henry said.  </P> <P> The alleged "practice of redlining customer services is a graphic example of  the arrogant and insensitive spirit that permeates Edison's upper management,"  Henry said.  </P> <P> However, in a telephone interview, Henry was unable to recall any specific  examples of discriminatory or preferential service given anyone on the list. He  described generally a 1988 situation when supervisors in Edison's Monrovia  district argued about whether to send a crew to restore service to a VIP or to  a so-called low-tolerance customer. Henry said the "important" customer was  served before the other customer.  </P> <P> UCAN Executive Director Michael Shames on Tuesday maintained that preferential  treatment "is unlawful and elitism at its most insidious." UCAN has asked the  state Public Utilities Commission to prohibit Edison from using the lists to  arrange preferential customer treatment.  </P> <P> "I don't know anything about it," said PUC President G. Mitchell Wilk. "What  we're going to have to do, obviously, is look at the allegations and see if  there is any substance to them, or whether they are just (the charges of) a  disgruntled employee. . . . That's the challenge for us. . . ."  </P> <P> Wilk acknowledged that most utilities maintain contact lists of government  officials who are to be contacted if "they have a major problem . . . (but)  that's very different from a preferential service list. . . . I think we have  to be real careful about taking the word of one employee before we get all the  facts."  </P> <P> A utility "must provide service to all customers on an absolutely  non-discriminatory manner," said Edmund Texeira, interim director of the PUC's  Division of Ratepayer Advocates.  </P> <P> Henry said he is on stress disability leave from his job and has a claim  pending against Edison. He was most recently a customer service manager in the  company's Monrovia district. Phelps described Henry as "a disgruntled Edison  employee who has a history of making misleading statements about the company."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which  represents about 6,000 Edison employees, also maintained that the lists exist.  "We've known about these lists for a long time," said Dean Cofer, business  representative for IBEW Local 47. "When there is an outage, those are the areas  they check first."  </P> <P> However, Cofer was unable to supply specific examples of the lists being used  to restore service of the supposedly preferred customers first.  </P> <P> Among the nearly 40 names on the list supplied by Henry were former U.S. Atty.  Gen. William French Smith, Vons Grocery President William Davila, three Los  Angeles Times executives -- President and Chief Operating Officer Richard T.  Schlosberg III, Chairman Tom Johnson and Donald Wright, a senior vice president  -- and Edison Vice President Mike Peevey. The list also included executives of  several Los Angeles-area corporations, a California assemblyman and a state  senator's aide.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Patrick Lee in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

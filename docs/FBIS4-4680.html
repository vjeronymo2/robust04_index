			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding the government's procedure of buying  imported rice and wheat from trading companies through bids, it  has been revealed that the Food Agency director general, who  represents the government, has sent written instructions to 28  trading companies every six months informing them before the  bidding actually takes place what share each company will  receive in the upcoming grain auction. This was discovered by  ASAHI SHIMBUN. The actual amount of rice and wheat purchased by  the government almost coincides with share noted in the Food  Agency's written instructions, which are known as "voices from  heaven." According to several sources, major trading companies  rig their bidding prices. Because of this, this newspaper  became suspicious of the practice in which the Food Agency  conspired with certain trading companies over import rights and  interests.    ASAHI SHIMBUN obtained a letter dated 1 October 1993 which  was sent to a trading company. The agency's director general  sealed the letter by using his seal, and the letter specified  the percentage share that the company was to receive at the  wheat auction in the latter half of fiscal year 1993. Moreover,  the letter states that "we are notifying you that we have  decided on the following." "Voices from heaven" have been sent  to trading companies' top executives, including their  presidents, twice a year, on 1 April and on 1 October.    The Import Department of the Food Agency explains that "the  purchase process was not wholly dependent on bidding because the  agency was entitled to make decisions on purchase contracts."  However, a company which bid the lowest price won the contract.  An official of a trading company said it was a "competitive  bidding." Although it looked like a competitive bidding, the  trading companies decided which company would bid the lowest  price on the basis of the percentages determined by the Food  Agency.    In this regard, a senior Fair Trade Commission official  said:  "Even if the agency was entitled to make decisions on purchase  contracts, it would be bid rigging by the trading companies if  what was revealed is true. If the Food Agency director general  is sending out such `voices from heaven,' these make competition  between trading companies a mere facade."    Although annual grain imports amounted to about 200 billion  yen in fiscal year 1992, they will increase significantly  starting in and after fiscal year 1993 because of emergency rice  imports and the partial liberalization of Japan's rice market.    Bidding is conducted every Wednesday at the agency for  foreign grain expected to be imported in a one-week period two  months after the bidding takes place. The agency works with 26  trading companies for wheat imports and 20 for rice imports, and  it asks them to submit price quotations. These firms are called  "listed importers." However, the agency chooses several  companies who submit the lowest bids and places orders with them  on a weekly basis.    Six months of weekly orders equal the share that the agency  ultimately granted each company through the "voices from  heaven." It is the job of the 10 leading trading  companies--including Mitsui and Co. and the Mitsubishi  Corporation--who were given the largest import shares among the  listed importers to coordinate weekly shares and tender prices.  This practice of coordinating matters started several decades  ago. It is said that the weekly bidding prices of low-ranking  trading companies are also determined by the 10 leading  companies.    The Food Agency does not publicly release information on the  shares of grain it purchases from each trading company, and  previously no changes were made to the shares granted to each  company. However, the shares of the top 10 companies have been  changing slightly ever since a case in which beef importers  rigged their bidding prices was uncovered in 1988. A trading  company official explains, "This [changing of shares] is a  maneuver designed to conceal the bid riggings."</p>

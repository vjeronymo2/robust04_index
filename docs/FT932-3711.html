			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Comment turns bearish after a good week BOURSES, according to the Eurotrack 100, registered a good rise on the week. But analysts and strategists, meanwhile, were pushing them into the underweight basket, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN closed the week where it had begun with a further fall in Ferruzzi, down L73 or 9 per cent at L732. This followed news that the group had handed executive powers to the group of creditor banks headed by Mediobanca. As a result the banking sector also dived, with Mediobanca losing L310 to L16,270 at the close before slipping to L15,900 on the kerb. Among the other creditor banks, BCI lost L274 to L5,242 and Credito Italiano L105 to L2,693. There were fears, said some analysts, that should a debt-for-equity swap proceed in relation to Ferruzzi, similar arrangements might be negotiated for other debt-laden groups. Montedison eased L5 to L975 at the close before sliding to L890 in after hours trading. However, Edison, seen as one of the remaining jewels in the Ferruzzi empire, remained steady, easing just L3 to L5,010. The Comit index slipped 1.35 to 531.89, little changed on the week. PARIS was supported towards the close by a stronger Wall Street. The CAC-40 index gained 9.21 to 1,920.43, up 3.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was a moderate FFr2.5bn. Most analysts were expecting a rate cut on Monday given the recent strength of the franc against the D - Mark. Among the day's movers, LVMH corrected Thursday's fall following its annual meeting, picking up FFr22 to FFr3,705 while, in the financial sector, UAP gained FFr22 to FFr3,705, and Suez FFr2 to FFr299 in high volume. Eridania Beghin-Say, the sugar, agro-industrial and branded foods company controlled by Ferruzzi, rallied FFr8 to FFr691, down 3.6 per cent on a week affected by the problems at its Italian parent. FRANKFURT returned from holiday, and raised suspicions of window dressing ahead of the June 30 valuations. The DAX index climbed another 7.91 to 1,680.98, up 2.6 per cent on the week and just a few points short of its March 31 level. Turnover rose from DM5.4bn to DM5.8bn. Carmakers had another good day, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen rising by DM9 to DM473, DM8 to DM587.50, and DM4.30 to DM340.80 respectively, leaving analysts with their eyebrows raised. In Dusseldorf, Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck said that the bank was a seller of Daimler and VW, and that earnings per share here were going to be lower than the optimists were expecting. In London, Mr Bob Barber and Mr James Longhurst of James Capel looked at European car sales, reduced their forecasts and said that share prices had held up 'amazingly' well this year, concluding: 'The automotive sector has only underperformed the JC European index by 2 per cent in the year to date, and we predict a major downward correction in share prices late this year.' MADRID closed a week of nervous, then muted reaction to the Socialist election victory with a fall of 1.3 per cent, the general index closing 0.36 higher on the day at 257.91. In London, Ms Anna MacDonald and Mr Victor Galliano of Baring Securities said that it was time to sell the Spanish market. It has been a good performer so far this year, but the Socialist win made aggressively lower interest rates and widespread privatisation less likely. 'Investors looking to buy for a recovery,' they said, 'will do better elsewhere.' AMSTERDAM featured a 5 per cent gain in Hoogovens, partly on hopes for a recovery in the sector, and partly on a stronger aluminium price. The shares gained FL 1.50 to Fl 32.10 as the CBS Tendency index lost 0.2 to 107.1, a week's rise of 2.3 per cent. ING, which disappointed the market on Thursday with flat first quarter figures, recovered 70 cents to Fl 63.60. VIENNA rose 2.7 per cent, the ATX index closing 12.43, or 1.5 per cent up on the day at 837.73. ISTANBUL advanced to another record high supported by political optimism and good half year company results. The index rose 148.35 to 8,835.51 for a week's gain of 5.5 per cent.

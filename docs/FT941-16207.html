			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign activity helps Nikkei as Hong Kong rebounds A surge of buying by overseas investors, prompted by increasing caution over south-east Asian markets, pushed up share prices, and the Nikkei average gained 1.8 per cent, its fourth consecutive rise, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index put on 319.43 at 18,443.44 and the Topix index of all first section stocks added 20.27 at 1,501.29. The Nikkei opened at the day's low of 18,186.52 and advanced on buying by arbitrageurs and foreign investors, with the bulk of overseas orders coming from Europe. The index hit a high of 18,567.06 in the early afternoon, but later lost some ground on profit-taking by corporate investors. Volume was 470m shares against 322m, as overseas buying countered increased profit-taking ahead of March book closing. Rises overwhelmed falls by 947 to 124, with 93 issues unchanged. The ISE-Nikkei 50 index firmed 4.04 to 1,253.76. In spite of the increase in selling by corporations and financial institutions, Mr Yasuo Ueki of Nikko Securities said most corporate investors, who are looking to take profits, particularly on banking stocks, were willing to wait while share prices continued to rise. Blue chip electronics and large-capital steel companies were targeted, with Sony rising Y140 to Y1,560 and Sumitomo Electric gaining Y20 at Y1,410. Hopes of increased government investment in telecommunication networks supported telecom and cable and wire companies: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone put on Y11,000 at Y798,000, Fujitsu Y2 at Y881 and Furukawa Electric Y9 at Y626. Comments by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, of a possible reduction of the landholding tax, encouraged buying of real estate companies. Mitsui Fudosan rose Y50 to Y1,200 and Mitsubishi Estate Y27 to Y974. Some export-orientated stocks fell on profit-taking. NEC receded Y5 to Y957, Nissan Motor Y8 to Y752 and Toyota Motor Y10 to Y1,840. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 427.12 to 20,278.28 in volume of 56.3m shares. The index moved above the 20,000 level for the first time in two months. Roundup It was a day of divergent trends as some of the region's markets resumed an upward path following last week's falls. Pakistan and Jakarta were closed for holidays. HONG KONG was a case in point, staging a strong technical rebound to finish sharply higher. The Hang Seng index gained 365.46, or 3.3 per cent, at 11,366.94, but was off the day's high of 11,421.80. Turnover contracted to HKDollars 10.8bn from Friday's record HKDollars 15.2bn. Brokers commented that the gains were seen across the board and there were no evident signs of an exodus by overseas funds, in spite of last week's recommendations by some Japanese and US analysts to reduce weightings. BOMBAY continued where it left off on Friday as foreign funds increased their presence. The BSE 30-share index added 139.89 or 3.8 per cent to 3,802.09. Some brokers commented that optimism was being fuelled by hopes that the government would accelerate economic liberalisation plans. BANGKOK, however, added to Friday's falls and eased steadily during late trading. The SET index closed off 30.15, or 1.9 per cent, at 1,545.28 in turnover of Bt20bn. Finance and securities shares were the big losers, with the sector down 7.6 per cent and accounting for 52 per cent of market turnover. AUSTRALIA firmed on strong futures trading with the All Ordinaries index ending 12.6 higher at 2198.6 having opened up 10.6 points. Turnover was ADollars 497.5m. Attention closely followed insurance companies that may have exposure to property damaged by the bush fires in New South Wales. The Insurance Council of Australia has provisionally reported that the fires could cost insurers ADollars 100m. SEOUL closed lower as the stock market stabilisation fund placed sell orders worth Won60bn. The composite index shed 16.97 to 873.04. SINGAPORE rebounded strongly in a technical reaction to three successive days of falls last week. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 57.96 to 2,424.36, but was off an intra-day high of 2,426.56. Volume was 629.5m shares. TAIWAN lost early gains on heavy profit-taking in the electronics and financial sectors. The weighted index, which had seen an intra-day high of 6,560, finished down 31.32 at 6,343.83. Turnover was TDollars 141.6bn. MANILA added to its losses following Philippine Long Distance Telephone's further fall in New York on Friday. The composite index shed 70.17 to 3,089.39 with PLDT down 90 pesos at 2,090 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR recouped some of Friday's losses on a technical rebound, with the composite index closing 16.02 higher at 1,206.75 after a high of 1,221.90. NEW ZEALAND enjoyed a steady start to the week with the NZSE-40 capital index finishing up 27.36 at 2,251.51, with most sectors showing good advances.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Roof falls in on Spanish union ambitions: Government has had to step in to save housing empire SPAIN'S largest and most belligerent trade union, the socialist General Workers Union (UGT), has been embarrassed by the collapse over Christmas of its housing and financial empire just a month before a general strike it is leading against government reforms of the labour market. Only the despised government, by making new credits available to the UGT businesses, can keep them going and save the union from both financial catastrophe and the anger of thousands of working class families who have joined its co-operative venture to build new homes, mainly around Madrid. Ministers and senior officials have been struggling to contain their delight at the discomfort of the UGT's outgoing leader, Mr Nicholas Redondo, who has led calls for the strike. The government has clearly got Mr Redondo in an awkward position. One barely straight-faced official said earlier this week: 'We make no connection between the strike and the UGT's business troubles.' Two days earlier, the government's official credit institute had agreed to help keep total bankruptcy from the door of the holding company, IGS, with a loan of Pta10bn (Pounds 49m). In return, the UGT has been forced to pledge all its assets - including the Pta10bn property portfolio given to it and other unions after the restoration of Spanish democracy in the late seventies - as a guarantee. IGS and its property co-operative, PSV, have gone into receivership after paying off three big creditors with the help of the government loan. But there are many others. Overall IGS owes more than Pta40bn and at the rate IGS losses are running, the government loan, only Pta1.2bn of which is new money, will not last long. The affair, though not yet tainted with accusations of corruption, bears a disconcerting resemblance to the collapse of Neue Heimat, the huge housing group mismanaged and finally lost in 1987 by the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund (DGB), the German union federation. IGS and PSV were modelled on the DGB's business ambitions. The DGB was, in fact, an early and short-lived partner in Unial, an insurance company set up by the UGT to try to capture business from members in the early 1980s. But at the time when Neue Heimat was collapsing around the heads of their German cousins, the UGT leaders, and Mr Redondo in particular, let themselves be persuaded that they should become the motor of a huge housing programme for workers and created IGS and PSV along with a private company. The union would supply home buyers and the private sector partner would secure financing. In 1988 IGS had plans to build 5,000 homes. That quickly swelled, along with the UGT's sense of its own importance, to 20,000. IGS created a construction and a mortgage company and a travel club for people who paid up to buy homes or deposited money, in the hopes of getting a home, with IGS. Estimates vary, but it is thought that between 20,000 and 50,000 people have either begun paying or saving for UGT-provided homes. Spanish unions have relatively few members but they were given great property-based wealth and factory-floor power after the end of General Franco's dictatorship. The UGT was also very close to the Socialist government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez when it was first elected in 1982 but has become a political opponent in recent years as government economic policies have drifted to the right. The explosion of speculative ambition at the UGT has a lot to do with the hierarchical structure of the union and the detachment of the union leadership from workplace issues. Union leaders see themselves as big players on the national political scene but their isolation from power recently has forced Mr Redondo especially to seek other ways of political expression. Providing cheap housing for the masses was one way of showing Spain (or perhaps Mr Gonzalez) what he was capable of. General strikes - a success in December 1988 and a flop in 1992, with plans for a third next month - are another. But it is all going badly. If the government is to be believed, the strike on January 27 will not alter its determination to loosen the rigid Francoist labour practices that make it cripplingly expensive to fire workers in Spain. The failure of IGS is probably the final humiliation circumstance will force upon Mr Redondo, who is retiring in 1994. It was he who first propelled Mr Gonzalez to the leadership of the Socialist party in 1974 while it was still in exile. Now the two men do not speak. Now, as angry IGS 'clients' clamour for their money outside IGS headquarters in Madrid, Mr Gonzalez is sure to be working hard to wrest maximum political benefit from the UGT's financial straits, by securing before January 27 the savings and hopes of the home buyers who put their faith in the UGT. A government-inspired rescue of IGS will not avert the planned strike but it will nicely blur the picture that unions have drawn of him as a waster of public money and a destroyer of dreams.</p>

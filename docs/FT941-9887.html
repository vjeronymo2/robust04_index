			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metal group unit allays fears Buderus, the German building material and heating technology company 80 per cent-owned by the troubled Metallgesellschaft group, said yesterday the near-collapse of the parent company had not affected its own activities. Mr Hans-Ulrich Plaul, chief executive, said yesterday the parent's crisis had not changed how customers and suppliers sought to do business. Buderus had no 'contractual ties' with the parent company, Mr Plaul said, reiterating comments made a month ago as Metallgesellschaft's problems came to a head. Buderus' aim was to pay all shareholders a sound dividend, he insisted. Buderus, acquired by Metallgesellschaft as part of its purchase of the non-paper activities of Feldmuhle Nobel in 1991, is commonly regarded as a jewel in Metallgesellschaft's crown, one of the more robust of the group's some 260 subsidiaries. In its 1992-93 financial year it made pre-tax profits of DM133m on turnover of DM2.77bn. It announced yesterday profits for the three months to December of DM41m (Dollars 24.1m), up from DM30m in the comparable period. The company has often been mentioned as a potential sale candidate for Metallgesellschaft. However, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive of the metals, mining and industrial group, has explicitly ruled out such a measure. Another possibility is that Metallgesellschaft will reduce its stake. Mr Plaul, however, said yesterday he was not aware of any such moves. More details are likely to emerge on February 22 when Mr Neukirchen will outline his strategy for the future of the group.</p>

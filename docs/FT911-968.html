			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Staging a staggered, unstaggable sale - Roland Rudd reports on the government's plans for its BT offer THE GOVERNMENT is considering two separate offers for its BT shares in an unprecedented departure from past privatisations. Under proposals being discussed by ministers, a fixed allocation of BT shares would be offered to the British public before they were offered to institutions. The new shares would be released in batches every 24 or 48 hours over an extended period. Each batch would be offered to investors at a fixed discount to the existing BT share price. Although the discount would not change, the share price would be subject to market fluctuation. It is therefore possible that investors buying shares on a Tuesday could get them at a cheaper price than those buying on a Thursday. To prevent investors stagging the issue, by hopping in and out of the sale to make a profit, new BT shareholders would not be able to trade their shares until the end of the offer. There would have to be a daily linkage between retail outlets, such as banks and building societies, and a central computer to alert them as to when a given batch of shares had been sold. Taurus, the automated system which will handle the settlement of stock market transactions, would have been ideal but is unlikely to be operating by the end of the year. However, ministers do not believe this is an intractable problem. The institutions, UK and foreign, would then be offered shares in the allocation for the 'rest of the world'. Government advisers are determined to narrow the normal three-week gap between pricing and trading for the sale to institutions. In theory, they believe it could be as short as 24 hours. The innovative proposals are designed to allow retail institutions to process millions of individual applications. In the event of the government selling all of its 48.6 per cent stake, worth some Pounds 11bn, the banks believe there could be as many as 5m applicants. If even half that number were persuaded to use banks to buy shares it would cause chaos. The extended retail sale, described by one banker as similar to a gilts tap stock - when the government holds back stock to avoid flooding the market - is being enthusiastically embraced by the banks. Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of National Westminster Stockbrokers, said: 'A rolling discount to enable batches of BT shares to dribble out over an extended period would eliminate the massive problems faced by retail institutions selling shares in a short space of time.' The proposal to price the new BT shares at a discount to the existing price, known as a 'formula priced approach', could overcome the problems associated with the 1987 British Petroleum sale when the market crashed - wiping out the discount offered to potential investors. Opposition to the proposals centres on fears that two separate offers would lose the pricing tension between the retail market and the institutions. There are also fears that potential investors like certainty, and would therefore prefer to know the exact price of the new shares before the application date. The Treasury will not decide the structure of the sale until its deadline for submissions on how to sell shares to individual investors expires on May 15. However, the fact that ministers are willing to discuss such radical proposals for the sale indicates that it is likely to be very different from past privatisations.</p>

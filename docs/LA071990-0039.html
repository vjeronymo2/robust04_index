			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW GAS-POWERED TANDOOR OVEN FOR U.S. KITCHENS  </P> <P> An Indian restaurant without a tandoor oven is like a Mexican restaurant  without a tortilla. At least, that's the way it is in the United States, where  tandoori chicken, lamb tikka, seekh kebab and other grilled meats dominate  virtually every menu.  </P> <P> Without a tandoor, it's impossible to duplicate these succulent meats, or to  make naan breads, which are slapped on the tandoor's walls to puff and brown in  what seems like seconds.  </P> <P> Home cooks attempting to copy these foods either give up in frustration or  content themselves with a not-very-authentic simulation. Importing a clay  tandoor from India is expensive, and although there are dealers here who can  supply the ovens, installing, maintaining and stoking them seems the province  of the professional.  </P> <P> But this may change, thanks to Surjit S. Kalsi, president of Dynamic Cooking  Systems Inc. of Huntington Beach. Kalsi has introduced a stainless-steel,  gas-powered tandoor that comes in two sizes: a commercial oven for restaurants  and a small model for home use.  </P> <P> The large oven can accommodate 10 to 12 whole chickens and up to a dozen naans.  The home version can hold at least five naans and 8 to 10 whole chicken legs.  Shaped like an inverted cone, the domestic oven weighs approximately 50 pounds  and stands 2 feet tall. It operates with a propane tank, thus making it  portable, or it can be attached to a gas line. In about 15 minutes, the oven  heats to full tandoor power: 900 degrees. At that temperature, a chicken leg  will cook in 10 minutes or less, and a naan in a minute or so. The sides of the  commercial oven remain cool to the touch when it is in use. The outer shell of  the home model does heat up, but not enough to burn.  </P> <P> Kalsi compares the steel ovens to the clay tandoor in this fashion: "It's like  the difference between a bullock cart and an airplane. They both get you from  point A to point B, but one is faster, easier and cleaner."  </P> <P> But ask Sada Riva Rao, the chef and owner of Bombay Grill, if he'd use a steel  tandoor and he emphatically says, "No, ma'am -- you can't control it. It burns  the chicken and the bread." And, he insists, the texture of naan baked in a  non-clay tandoor isn't as soft and smooth as it should be. (Rao tried using a  metal tandoor in a San Francisco restaurant.)  </P> <P> Other purists insist that only a charcoal-fueled, clay tandoor can produce  authentic tandoori flavor. Kalsi disagrees. "Charcoal does not impart flavor,"  he says. "Flavor is imparted by juices dripping on the charcoal and producing  smoke." In his ovens, the juices drip onto lava rock and produce the requisite  smoke.  </P> <P> Whereas the clay tandoor must be fueled constantly and cleaned of the resulting  ashes, the lava rock in the steel ovens will last for a year. And the ovens are  self-cleaning, requiring only an occasional wipe-down, Kalsi said. Unlike the  clay tandoor, the steel ovens will not crack or flake.  </P> <P> Kalsi introduced the steel tandoors two years ago. Initially they met with  resistance from the Indian community, but that is changing, he said. So far, he  has sold about 200 of the commercial ovens, shipping some of them across the  country, and 300 of the home size. The large oven retails for $1,600, the home  size for $350.  </P> <P> Formerly vice president of engineering with an appliance manufacturing company,  Kalsi launched the ovens as a back-yard project. He came up with the design,  ordered the parts from outside and assembled them. Now Kalsi operates from a  roomy factory, where he also produces cooktops, outdoor barbecues and  commercial Korean barbecue units.  </P> <P> The tandoors are literally part of the family. The home model is named Surya  and the restaurant model Swaneel, after Kalsi's sons. Wife Kawaljit (Kali)  lends a hand when Kalsi needs someone to demonstrate that naan breads will  stick to the steel sides (traditionalists believe they will stick only to clay)  or that chicken tikka (marinated chunks of chicken) can acquire true tandoor  flavor in the steel oven.  </P> <P> Kalsi is from Jullundur in the Punjab, where tandoor cookery is a common  pursuit, and his wife is from Lucknow, the capital of the state of Uttar  Pradesh.  </P> <P> "We have not changed the concept. What we have done is use different material,"  Kalsi said. "It's old technology brought to a modern age."  </P></p>

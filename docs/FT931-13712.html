			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heath leads protests at role in Gulf SIR EDWARD Heath, the former Conservative prime minister, yesterday expressed vehement opposition to any suggestion that British ground troops might be deployed in Kuwait. Sir Edward also used the Commons debate on Iraq to join the Labour front bench in urging that the United Nations should be given a greater role in seeking a way forward in dealing with Iraq. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, said no request had been received from the Kuwaiti government, but Sir Edward emphasised that the defence of Kuwait should be a matter for the Arab league since there were no direct British interests there. In the first opportunity for a full debate at Westminster on recent events in the Gulf, growing unease among some MPs was apparent. Of particular concern were Sunday's cruise-missile attack on Baghdad, in which the al-Rashid hotel was hit, and the purpose of the operations. While some suggested that there was a danger of drift in the aims of the allies, Sir Edward was among the most outspoken in calling on the allies to give up any expectation of removing Saddam Hussein - it alienated the rest of the Arab world, he warned. Mr Rifkind said that the hit on the al-Rashid hotel was a 'tragic accident' but said that the allied operations had gone to great lengths to avoid hitting non-military sites, and insisted that the ultimate blame must lie with Saddam Hussein. 'He must bear the responsibility for not bowing to the will of the international community before force became necessary,' he said. While Mr Rifkind was unequivocal in his condemnation of Saddam Hussein and his failure to keep to UN resolutions, Mr Tony Benn, a former Labour cabinet minister, said he detected a change of tone in the minister's words about the two 'no-fly' zones in the north and south of Iraq. Mr Rifkind said that he expected the RAF to be involved in patrolling the two zones for the forseeable future, but underlined that the existence of the zones did not affect the territorial integrity of Iraq itself. Mr Benn, who led a revolt of Labour backbenchers, suggested that it was a sign that even the government had been slightly chastened by the change of mood since the raids, but went on to accuse the allies of 'odious hypocrisy' in the selective importance they attached to the enforcement of only some UN resolutions. He warned that the bombing had strengthened Saddam Hussein and undermined the authority of the UN. The call from Sir Edward for a personal role for Mr Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, in finding a solution and his support for a better communications system for the UN followed a similar argument for more UN involvement put by Mr David Clark, the shadow defence secretary. Mr Clark welcomed the UN Security Council's discussion on Tuesday but said that it had been limited and a further debate would be useful. He also urged the government to consider a new resolution which would make it clear that if Iraq had a government that would abide by UN resolutions, then economic sanctions would be lifted.</p>

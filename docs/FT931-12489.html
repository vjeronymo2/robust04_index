			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Accountancy Column: Monolithic system in need of drastic reform - The burdens the UK's auditing regime places on smaller companies THE TIME has come to reform the UK's monolithic system of financial reporting and auditing, which applies virtually identical accounting and auditing requirements to all companies regardless of size. Standards setters and the government have until now chosen to gloss over the problems the current system creates. In the present climate of reform, this gloss is beginning to wear very thin. There have been a number of significant changes to the financial reporting and auditing regime in the last couple of years. Some recognise the differences between large and small organisations and those where public interest is involved, but many do not. While it was never admitted, the standards issued in the past by the now defunct Accounting Standards Committee and the Auditing Practices Committee were more geared to the listed and other larger public interest companies. That trend continues under the bodies created more recently. Unless some means of distinguishing these different groups is found, improved standards in large company accounting and auditing will be held back by the need to reflect the limited resources of small companies, and small companies will continue to suffer unnecessary burdens. This creates a substantial imbalance. There are only about 2,100 domestic UK listed companies and a further 1,500 large private companies with profits over Pounds 500,000 and turnover greater than Pounds 15m. That is a tiny proportion of the estimated 400,000 to 500,000 active trading companies in the country. Similarly, just 161 firms audit all the domestic listed companies, and adding in the 1,500 large private companies brings the total to 300 auditors. That is a small fraction of the UK's 14,000 registered auditors, most of which never see a large client. On accounting issues, the Financial Reporting Council and the Accounting Standards Board are overtly focused towards larger companies. Unless legal distinctions are made, their mission to tighten reporting will add substantial burdens to small companies. The problem lies in company law, which makes no distinctions based on size. There is a concession which allows small companies to file abbreviated accounts with Companies House. But this adds work, since the law still requires full accounts to be prepared for shareholders. The position is at least as bad for auditing as it is for accounting. Audit regulation applies the same rules to all auditors regardless of the size and risk profile of their clients. The problem is illustrated in the recently published reports from the regulatory bodies on the first year of audit regulation, which indicate that many firms are falling short of the standards set by the regulators. We would not wish to excuse poor standards of work, but the application of auditing standards and guidelines in their present form to the audit of small companies is not easy. The Auditing Practices Committee was created in 1976 in response to public concern about one or two scandals in large companies. It recognised the different requirements of the small company by recommending a form of audit report with limitations on scope which are inherent in the audit of many small companies. But no really practical guidance was offered. This form of report was withdrawn in 1989 to the indignation of many small firms. An exposure draft on the audit of small companies was issued by the committee shortly before its demise in 1991, but offered little advice on application. Since then little has happened. The Auditing Practices Board had small company audits at the very end of its list of objectives for 1992, but there has been no sign of a statement yet. We are currently researching the impact of audit regulation on practices of different sizes. It is becoming apparent that sole practitioners are finding the new regime very arduous. Regulation is having the greatest impact on smaller practices where public interest issues are minimal. There has been little effect on the conduct of audits in the large firms acting in the public markets. When asked about the effects of regulation, a partner from a large firm said: 'There are no new messages and no challenges.' By contrast, a sole practitioner said: 'In a word, devastating'. A real concern for smaller firms was ignorance about what the regulators really expected and a genuine desire for more practical authoritative guidance which was not linked to commercial organisations. This gulf between the auditors of small and large companies, and between the public interest areas and the low-risk small audits, became embarrassingly obvious last week at an open forum in Chartered Accountants' Hall in London, where the APB's paper on the future development of auditing was being debated. The paper explores various ways in which the role of the auditor could be extended and independence strengthened in order to meet the 'expectations gap' and recommends limitation of auditors' liability. It is explicitly directed at listed and public interest companies. The small practitioners in the audience did not welcome the proposals, arguing that any change would affect everyone. One speaker claimed that the smaller firms were being 'sucked into' the problems of the larger ones and that the costs of extending auditing would be another encouragement for companies to evade regulation. Extending the scope of audits and limiting liability may have some attraction for the larger firms, which find it difficult to get insurance cover. Our research suggests that these issues are far less important for the auditors to, and the owner-managers of, many small businesses. A partial solution to the difficulties of applying one set of standards and one regulatory framework to such a diverse group might be the abolition of the statutory audit for small companies. But any change will take considerable time. More important, the government is currently only considering abolition for companies below the VAT threshold for turnover below Pounds 36,600 a year. Many small companies are above this limit. The regime for audit regulation will be reviewed at the end of this year. It would be an appropriate time to consider whether the one set of regulations can be effective across the board, or whether the regime is too onerous for the small firms and insufficiently challenging for larger ones. While concessions in accounting regulations for smaller companies may require changes to the law, the position is easier to remedy for auditing. Audit regulations require auditors to comply with auditing standards, but they do not specify what these standards should be. That means the Auditing Practices Board could develop distinct, practical and meaningful guidelines for the audit of small companies, which comprise the overwhelming majority of UK businesses. It is time that a little more attention was paid to the needs of these companies and their auditors. We do not believe it is realistic to apply the same accounting and auditing regime to the local sweet shop and to ICI. Nor is it sensible to expect the same standards to apply to a sole practitioner and to Price Waterhouse. Stella Fearnley is Grant Thornton lecturer in accounting at the University of Southampton.

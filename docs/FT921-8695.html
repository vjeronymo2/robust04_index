			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / January car output slips 16% UK CAR production in January was down 16 per cent year-on-year because of a further fall in demand from both domestic and export markets. Output was sustained early last year by a rise in export production. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned yesterday that exports could no longer be relied on to counteract poor domestic sales. According the SMMT and the Central Statistical Office, car production last month fell 16 per cent to 95,279 from 113,472 in January last year. Commercial vehicle output fell by 10.7 per cent to 16,507. Seasonally adjusted, car output in the six months to the end of January was 17 per cent lower than in the previous six months, and 20 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year before. Export output in the past six months - seasonally adjusted - was 2 per cent down on the same period a year before but 17 per cent lower than in the previous six months. Output for the whole of last year fell 4.5 per cent to 1.23m from 1.29m in 1990. Toyota results, Volkswagen forecast, Page 10</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> MERGER OF HEALTH CLINICS APPROVED  </P> <P> The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a plan to  consolidate eight health clinics and to establish a new branch of a mental  health outreach program in Oxnard.  </P> <P> Under the plan, eight clinics in Oxnard will be consolidated into one at the  Centerpoint Mall at Saviers Road and Channel Islands Boulevard. The new clinic  is expected to open early next year.  </P> <P> The plan was praised as "exactly the kind of thing we need" by Supervisor  Maggie H. Erickson. "It makes sense from the point of view of the clients and  from the point of view of the clinics," she said.  </P> <P> Six of the eight clinics serve residents of Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Camarillo  by providing immunizations, family planning services and treatment for sexually  transmitted diseases. The two other clinics, which provide a range of medical  services in south Oxnard and the La Colonia neighborhood, may remain open after  the consolidation, said Phillipp K. Wessels, director of the County Health Care  Agency.  </P> <P> The new clinic at the Centerpoint Mall will also offer prenatal and pediatric  care, sparing women and children in need of such care from having to travel to  the County Medical Center in Ventura.  </P> <P> Wessels estimated the cost of converting two former stores in the mall to be  about $950,000. The funds will be provided by Ventura County Medical Center  revenues and other funds already allocated, he said.  </P> <P> The supervisors also approved the leasing of a former J.C. Penney store at 555  S. A St. in Oxnard to house a team from the Mental Health Department's Small  Community Outreach Treatment and Support, or SCOTS, program.  </P> <P> Four teams now serve Oxnard as part of SCOTS, which is funded by a $16-million  state grant for the development of outreach systems, said Dr. Duane Essex, the  department's deputy director.

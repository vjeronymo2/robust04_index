			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Jobs: Reaping the benefits of teamwork - The problems of management science NEARLY all of us work with other people. Most of us are interdependent in the sense that we have to help, support and reward each other at work. No one can whistle a symphony; it takes the team effort of an orchestra to play it. Whether we call them groups, sections, squads or teams, most of us realise how much our productivity and satisfaction is due to them. This pretty obvious point is now the latest management obsession. Management science, if there can be such a thing, is notoriously faddish. Not long ago it was strategic planning that was the key to organisational success. Then it had to do with organisation structure. After that the gurus said that once the corporate culture (another oxymoron) was right, Eldorado was just around the corner] All these solve-all solutions have now reached their sell-by date. But there is, fortunately, a new solution to all the hard-pressed manager's needs. Teamwork, it seems, will solve all your problems and lead to happy, healthy, productive workers. So business sections of books shops bulge with books, nearly always written by people called Chuck, Randy or Ed, on teams and teamwork. They rejoice under crypto-sporting titles such as Team-Power, or How to be a team player; Winning Big. Their message is simple: the power of the waterfall is nothing but a lot of drips working together. No matter how great a warrior he might be, a chief cannot do battle without his indians. What supporters of the team concept argue is this: bearing in mind that management is the art of getting things done through people, you need to let your people know what your goals are - what you want to accomplish, why you want to accomplish it, how they will benefit from it and the role they will play in accomplishing it. This is another way of saying that the members of the management team must be able to identify themselves individually with the company's overall goals. No chief executive, no top management group ever reached these goals by themselves. Unless the entire management team is aboard, the company will never get there. What has caused this explosion in restating the obvious? The answer is partly in the American obsession with the Japanese, who are still perceived by the Pearl Harbour generation as mindless, but highly disciplined, killers. The post-war Japanese miracle has puzzled - indeed terrified - the Americans. What is the Japanese secret of success? Answer - team-work. The Japanese come from a collectivistic culture and hence naturally do things in groups or teams. We in the Anglo-Saxon world come from an individualistic culture, which selects on, rewards and values individual effort. No matter how much teamwork achieves in our culture, the results tend to get identified with a single name. We therefore have to endure various mildly humiliating training courses (many in the great outdoors) to encourage teamwork because it is not natural to us. While it is true that no member of a boat crew is praised for the individuality of their rowing, this is an exception to the rule. The Japanese, I presume, don't feel obligated to attend individualism courses to learn how to 'become their own person', or 'do things their own way'. They are natural collectivistic team players. This individualism in our culture runs deep. We are, however, loyal to some groups: usually those we have been forced to join, or with whom we have endured hardship and difficulty. Family, school class-mates and fellow military conscripts often do command our loyalty. But, because we don't have jobs for life and find it easier to get promotion by moving between organisations, we rarely stay long enough in a team to be really part of it. The life of a team goes through various stages: forming (the getting together); storming (arguing over who does what, who is leader, etc); norming (the acceptable explicit and implicit rules); performing (actually working well after the early stages have occurred); finally, teams go through mourning (when they break up). But all this takes time and many of us never really stay long enough in a particular team to appreciate its worth. But how seriously do companies which have swallowed the team solution really take the idea? Yes, they do talk it up; go on endless (and expensive) courses; they even partly restructure sections into 'new teams'. Yet very, very few reward the team, rather than the individual. Most performance management systems (the euphemism for how pay is determined) are explicitly geared to the individual. Yes, team work in the sense of contribution to the team may be a criterion which is rated, but it is usually only one of many. Also, we rarely hire people with a team in mind or indeed hire whole teams. Michael Winner got it right when he said: 'Team effort is a lot of people doing what I say.' The teamwork philosophy of co-operation, interdependence and group loyalty is counter-cultural. Our business heroes are for the most part egocentric, rugged individuals, not team players. Team work may be a really good idea, but don't fool yourself either that it is a total solution or that a couple of fuzzy warm courses will do the trick.

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Brussels cuts EC growth forecast to 0.8% in 1993 THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday cut its forecast for growth in European Community countries this year to 0.8 per cent from 1 to 1.5 per cent. It laid most of the blame on the sluggish German economy. EC finance ministers in Brussels reacted with an effort to talk up prospects for an early cut in European interest rates, an accelerated growth package and the view that the worst of the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism was over. In a joint statement, ministers reaffirmed their determination to support member states participating in the ERM and issued an unusual statement welcoming the new Irish government's decision to defend the punt's existing parities with other ERM currencies. 'The Council believes this policy is entirely justified,' ministers said. Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said the statement reflected a joint belief that recent speculation against the punt, the French franc and the Danish krone was unwarranted. 'Personally I believe the worst is over,' he said, echoing similar statements last week by EC central bankers. Irish officials said they believed the punt had 'weathered the ERM crisis', and were visibly pleased that EC finance ministers had agreed to Dublin's request for a statement aimed at cowing speculators. But ministers were guarded about an early return of the Italian lira to the ERM, despite agreement on an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.5bn) medium-term balance of payments loan. At yesterday's meeting - the first high-level macroeconomic discussion at ministerial level during the Danish presidency of the EC - the mood of solidarity was damped by the gloomy growth forecasts produced by the European Commission. According to the Commission's projections, growth in the EC this year to 0.8 per cent will fall from 1.1 per cent in 1992. This is lower than last month's Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development outlook which forecast 1.2 per cent for the Community in 1993, and less than the Commission's earlier guarded hopes of growth between 1 and 1.5 per cent. The Commission said it expected Germany to remain flat, with France and Spain each reaching a meagre 1 per cent. But the Commission said it expected growth of 1.3 per cent in Britain in 1993 - marginally higher than the Treasury forecast of 1 per cent. Mr Christophersen said the improvement was a result of a gain in the UK's competitive position following sterling's depreciation after its exit from the ERM last September, as well as the British government's success in fighting inflation. Several EC ministers yesterday expressed polite hopes of an imminent cut in German interest rates. Mr Christophersen - along with Mr Thor Pedersen, Danish economics minister - expressed confidence that plans for a wages pact between unions and employers in Germany coupled with proposals for a tax rise in 1995 should pave the way for an early cut in Bundesbank interest rates. Ministers also agreed to accelerate plans for an EC growth package. A new European Investment Bank lending facility to finance roads and telecommunications in western and eastern Europe should be ready by the end of the month. A crucial element in the EC package is ensuring that member states live up to their promises to promote growth through a shift from current to capital spending, moderate wage settlements, and other measures to create jobs.

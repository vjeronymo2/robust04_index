			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia Signs Tank Deal: Saudi Arabia has signed a $3.1-billion deal to  buy 315 M-1A2 tanks and support equipment from General Dynamics Corp. The  Pentagon said the deal, which was approved by Congress last year but has been  awaiting a final Saudi go-ahead, was signed Sunday. It will provide a major  financial boost for the big U.S. defense firm. The U.S. Army decided last year  not to buy any more M-1 tanks, and officials at General Dynamics said the Saudi  deal would allow the firm to keep open at least one of its two plants -- the  one at Lima, Ohio -- and perhaps its second plant at Warren, Mich.  </P></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Quiet coup at the Linoleum Palace: Reforms are under way at the Treasury, but some critics believe they do not go far enough Under attack for being too isolated, the UK's most important government department, the Treasury, yesterday took the unusual step of opening its doors to outsiders. Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, presided over the first meeting of its new forecasting panel of seven private-sector economists. The meeting is part of a more widespread exercise in engineering an open debate on how the government reaches decisions on economic policy and on how to improve them. 'The panel is a rare opportunity to have a structured public debate about the economy,' said one member, Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University. 'The creative possibilities are enormous.' Some critics complain the moves towards openness are largely cosmetic. Even so, nobody can dispute the number of initiatives set up by the Treasury in the wake of its recent misjudgments about the UK economy and Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Today, the Treasury is to issue the second in its new series of monthly monetary reports, which are supposed to shed more light on its thinking in areas such as interest rates and inflation - until now a mostly secret process. In recent months the Treasury, which besides controlling interest rates also has the final say on public spending and tax policy, has set up a panel of representatives from big companies, which meets three times a year to give the department views about economic trends. Reacting to criticism that the Treasury has an inadequate understanding of business, Sir Terry Burns, the department's permanent secretary, last year called in Mr Howard Davies, the former Treasury official who is now director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, to advise on ways to foster more contacts with the outside world. Sir Terry has since instructed his top 100 Treasury officials to spend at least a day a year visiting British companies. The Treasury has also indicated it wants to attract more outsiders to work within the department on a part-time basis. One example is Professor Charles Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics, who is working at the department for a day a week and said his role would be 'in-house academic'. The Treasury - dubbed the Linoleum Palace by irreverent outsiders - is a stimulating place for an academic to work. Such is the range of issues it deals with that many areas of activity in the UK, from buying houses to the design of nuclear missiles, are influenced to some degree by Treasury policies. Partly because of this range of responsibilities, the department is often the butt of criticism from groups that feel their views have been left ignored. Though the most important decisions are taken by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, much of the power rests with often-anonymous Treasury officials. In the past year, critics from industry, the City and other government departments have become more vociferous. That has been mainly because of the Treasury's failures in monitoring the recession and its lack of preparedness for the currency storm which swept Britain out of the ERM. Many business leaders are perturbed by the Treasury's recent poor record. Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive at the Rentokil pest-control and environmental services group, said: 'The Treasury's economic forecasts have been misguided, and so have many of its decisions.' Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of food manufacturer Northern Foods, argues that many of the Treasury's failures in judging the economy stem from a 'disastrous' lack of understanding about the needs of industry. Although the Treasury appears to recognise the problems, it is moving only slowly to a new policy of forming better links with industry, commerce and the academic world. One difficulty is that, under civil service convention, Treasury officials' advice to ministers is normally considered secret, letting ministers consider privately a range of possibilities, before a final policy decision. According to Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, the shift so far does not add up to much. 'We still have the Treasury having its own debate about economic policy and another, unconnected debate going on outside.' Any changes in the Treasury's way of working which result from the new initiatives will relate to two important areas: people and organisation. Most of the top officials are Oxbridge-trained and have spent all their careers either in government or other public-service jobs. Exceptions are Sir Terry and Mr Budd, who both worked together as economists at the London Business School in the 1970s. Sir Terry came to the department in 1980, initially as chief economic adviser. He stepped up to the top job nearly two years ago. Since then he has lost much of his early reputation as an outsider wanting to shake up Whitehall. Mr Budd, who joined the Treasury in September 1991 from Barclays Bank, where he was economic adviser, has emerged as a force for change within the organisation. A frequent criticism by business leaders and politicians is that Treasury employees, however bright, have too narrow an understanding of the world outside government. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, who runs a family wine business, said: 'I'd like to see more people at the Treasury with a gut feeling about how industry works.' Although self-confidence has been a feature at the Treasury for decades  - a result of its role at the centre of power - Sir Douglas Wass, Treasury permanent secretary from 1974 to 1983, reckons that the current long spell of Conservative government may be a factor behind the Treasury's difficulties. He said that the Treasury had not employed enough 'mavericks' who would question ministers' own judgments about the economy. Mr Richard Tolkien, a former Treasury official who is now head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, said: 'Inside the Treasury in the early 1980s, if you did not go along with ministers' views, you prospered less than those who did.' One way forward has been proposed by Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, another member of the forecasting panel, who would like to see officials attaching their names to specific initiatives. That, he believes, would eventually encourage the promotion of officials with good ideas. A separate criticism is that the Treasury is simply too powerful. Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum, a research group, said the Treasury had an important job in restraining growth in public spending. But the effort it puts into this deflects from other equally important tasks, such as establishing the right relationship between central and local government, and attracting more private capital into roads and railways. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive of the Graseby electronics group (formerly Cambridge Electronic Industries), said: 'The Treasury spends too much time asking how it can cut spending, rather than asking how to spend money on useful projects.' Following on from suggestions that the Treasury is doing too many jobs, many  -including the CBI's Mr Davies and Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a private sector think-tank - have called for it to be split up. Mr Britton said: 'The Treasury is trying to be both an Office of Management and Budget, and a Council of Economic Advisers (the two US institutions supervising public spending and overall economic policy). It ends up being neither.' Such ideas are not on the agenda at present. And no one pretends that a 'devolved' Treasury - with its functions scattered around other government departments, possibly with monetary policy being handed over to a newly independent Bank of England - would by itself guarantee better times for the UK economy. But if the Treasury's new initiative fails to deliver more successful policies, pressure for more radical changes will mount.</p>

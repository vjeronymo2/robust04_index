Officials of the Metropolitan Expressway Public Corp. said the  11-kilometer tunnel project, which will begin in 1995, is aimed  at easing traffic congestion in central Tokyo.    This is expected to become a very hard construction project  as the heavily populated area is patchworked with gas and water  lines, not to mention rivers and underground railways. The  total cost of the project has been put at some 840 billion yen.    About of half that amount is to be used for the purchase of  private land, since property rights extend below the surface of  the land. But so far the public corporation has only managed to  buy up a fourth of the needed land.    The tunnel will be a spacious 40 meters wide and accommodate  the latest fire prevention and antipollution technology.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xia Haitao, Song Bingheng, and Liu Shun] </F>   [Text] Cairo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Egypt and China have  firmly established their political relations and such relations  should spur economic cooperation and trade exchanges, Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak said in an interview with Chinese  resident journalists in Cairo Monday prior to his visit to China.    "Since April 1976, I have visited China several times, each  time has left me a very deep impression," Mubarak said, smiling,  when meeting with the Chinese journalists in a large study in  his Heliopolis Presidential Palace.    The president will pay a three-day state visit to China from  April 21 to 23 at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang  Zemin. This will be his sixth tour of China and the fourth since  he became president.    Sino-Egyptian relations have both historical and political  dimensions, said Mubarak, pointing out that Egypt is the first  Arab and African country to recognize the People's Republic of  China.    So far as the political dimension is concerned, he said,  these relations are based on a firmly established friendship  that consists in cooperation, consultation and coordination on  international and Arab issues.    These relations proceed from the major role played by China  on the international arena and the important role enjoyed by  Egypt in the Arab world, the Middle East and Africa, he added.    The president noted that the historical heritage of both  Egypt and China, mutual confidence between the two countries and  their cooperation in the economic, cultural and scientific  fields have laid a solid foundation for mutual understanding  between the two peoples, which has in turn further boosted the  strong friendly ties existing between Cairo and Beijing at the  highest level.    "If our political relations have become so firmly  established, we of course hope that our economic cooperation and  our trade exchange will come up to the same level."    The big progress the Chinese have made in their economic  development and the impetus that has been given to the Egyptian  economy in recent years are likely to create wide prospects for  Egypt and China to expand their trade and increase their shares  in the world trade, Mubarak said.    Those two facts are also likely to enable Egypt to make use  of the industrial and technological progress achieved by China,  he added.    "We cannot ignore the importance of the economic and  political role of the countries in Asia, particularly in the Far  East, which contribute 50 percent of the world production, that  foreshadows that the next century will be the century of Asia,"  Mubarak said.    Egypt's cultural and religious ties with a number of Asian  countries have promoted Egypt to devote due attention to  fostering cooperation and understanding with the Asian  countries, he said.</p>

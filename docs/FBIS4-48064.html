			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] There was some respite in Kigali this afternoon.  The United Nations' plane that had to make a U-turn yesterday  finally managed to land early this afternoon at the airport in  the Rwandan capital. RFI's special correspondent, Jean Helene,  was on board:    [Helene] Heavy weapon fighting, which had been going on  since  dawn, stopped early this afternoon, shortly before the arrival  of the Hercules C-130. The UNAMIR [United Nations Mission in  Rwanda] said that it had asked the belligerents for a special  truce in order to be able to evacuate the body of the Ghanaian  peace-keeper killed on Monday [9 May] night. He was hit by  shrapnel from a shell that fell on the Amahoro stadium, where  nearly 3,000 refugees are being guarded by Ghanaian soldiers.  The UN plane remained on the ground for 20 minutes while UN  troops were paying homage to their comrade.    Exchanges of artillery fire resumed at dusk, albeit less  heavily, in the suburbs of the capital. According to the news  that we have, the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] troops have not  made any significant progress in Kigali for the last 48 hours  despite extremely violent fighting, including near the Kanombe  camp, where some 4,000 para-commandos are stationed. According  to some observers, the strategy of the RPF is to bomb the camp  for several days running before launching a ground attack. More  to the south, the RPF has gained ground and it can now either  move up to Kigali or go on eastward toward Gitarama, the  headquarters of the transitional government. It will certainly  run into the government forces deployed in the area in order to  stop its advance. [passage omitted]</p>

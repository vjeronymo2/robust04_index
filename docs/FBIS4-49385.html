			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (XINHUA) -- South Korea today urged  Japan to clarify its justice minister's remarks related to World  War II and take "appropriate" action.    It was nothing short of "throwing cold water on efforts by  both countries to improve South Korea-Japanese relations for an  incumbent cabinet minister to make such remarks," South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told Japanese Ambassador Goto  Toshio in a meeting here.    In an interview with the Japanese national newspaper  MAINICHI  Tuesday [2 May], Shigeto Nagano, Japan's newly-appointed justice  minister, claimed that his country wanted to liberate Asian  colonies from European imperialism during World War II.    He also dismissed the "rape of Nanjing," in which Japanese  soldiers killed some 300,000 Chinese civilians in 1937, as "a  hoax."    Nagano's remarks immediately raised anger in South Korea, a  victim of three decades of Japanese colonial rule before its  liberation at the end of World War II.    Han said Nagano's remarks have greatly shocked the South  Korean Government and people. He added, "Such distorted  historical perspective is very regrettable."    Demanding action on the incident, the South Korean foreign  minister said that Tokyo should take "appropriate measures" for  Nagano's remarks.    However, former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  who  left office last week, called World War II "a war of aggression"  and said it was wrong.    On Wednesday, new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  described as "inappropriate" the remarks made by his justice  minister about the killing of an estimated 300,000 Chinese  civilians by Japanese troops.    "My view on the past history is that our past actions,  including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable  suffering and sorrow for many people," Hata said in a brief  statement shortly after arriving in France for a two-day  official visit.</p>

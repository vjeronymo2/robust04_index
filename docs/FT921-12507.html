			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Stores weigh benefits of Sunday trading: The virtues and vices of seven-day opening for the grocery trade AS THE row about the virtues or vices of Sunday trading starts to abate, the grocery trade is beginning to assess whether the profits from seven-day trading outweigh its difficulties. The equation is a complicated one; the early conclusions mixed. At one level Sunday opening has proved a conspicuous success. Many shoppers clearly appreciated the opportunity to buy food on Sundays in the run-up to Christmas. J. Sainsbury, for example, was forced temporarily to shut its doors at some stores because of the deluge of consumer demand. But it would be misleading to draw sweeping conclusions from this atypical trading period. While it may have been profitable for stores to trade on Sundays in December, it may not pay them to do so in the slow trading months early in the new year. Budgens, the neighbourhood grocery chain which was one of the first food retailers to open on Sundays, announced this week that it would scale down its experiment with seven-day trading because of the extra costs and intensified competition. Another indication of the trend is that many of the bigger grocery chains have reduced the number of stores they open. For example, the Safeway chain opened 229 of its 264 outlets in England and Wales in the run-up to Christmas but has since settled on a figure of 114. Nielsen, the market research company, has reported a significant fall in demand for Sunday shopping following Christmas. Extrapolating from a sample of 7,100 consumers, Nielsen suggests that 2.4m homes went shopping on December 22 dropping to 800,000 by January 12. But it suggested that the Sunday shopper was likely to spend far more on average than those shopping during the week. Even though demand may have dropped, it may still be profitable for stores to open. In a recent stockbroker's report, Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite Institutional Brokers, estimated that the big grocery chains had only to increase their total sales by 2 per cent to make Sunday trading profitable. He argued that the extra labour costs of opening on Sundays represent a small proportion of the fixed costs of running a superstore. He said that there were considerable benefits to be gained from more efficient usage of capital, plant and distribution networks and reduced levels of wastage. 'Just like many things that have happened in the sector in recent years Sunday trading is another spur to efficiency - but only for the bigger and better grocers,' he said. The opportunity to generate additional sales and win market share from smaller independent operators is crucial for the long-term success of Sunday trading for the big multiples. In a recent report on the grocery market, Verdict, the retail consultants, found that the big food retailers were indeed stimulating additional sales and were not just spreading the week's sales more thinly over seven days instead of six. It estimated Sunday food sales at Pounds 50m a week - equivalent to more than Pounds 2.5bn a year. In total, the UK food market is worth about Pounds 44bn. But perhaps the best indication of the shape of things to come on the Sunday trading front in England and Wales is the example of Scotland, where seven-day trading has long been legal. Hundreds of grocery stores trade profitably all week. In the case of the Asda grocery chain, for example, Sunday sales account for 16 per cent of the total, representing its third best trading day. But Asda believes it will take a long time to build up a similar proportion of sales in England and Wales. One added factor in the cost equation in England and Wales is that of public perception. None of the directors of the big supermarket chains relish the adverse publicity associated with 'law-breaking'. Additional moves by Usdaw, the shop workers' union, highlighting the alleged pressure that some companies have put on staff to work on Sundays, has reflected badly on a trade that is highly dependent on fostering a responsible image with its customers. But in the absence of government action, the simple answer to whether the big chains will continue to open on Sundays is that while their competitors remain open they cannot afford not to do so themselves.  ------------------------------------------ TESCO COST AND PROFIT  ------------------------------------------ Year to February 1991                   Pounds m    % of sales  ------------------------------------------ Cost of goods     4,695          74.0 Distribution        160           2.5 Store costs         140           2.2 Store labour        540           8.5 Other labour         90           1.4 Depreciation        100           1.6 Leases               60           1.0  ------------------------------------------ Cost of sales     5,785          91.2 Admin costs         140           2.2 Operating profit    420           6.6  ------------------------------------------ Turnover  (exc VAT)        6,345         100.0  ------------------------------------------ Source: Tesco and HCIB estimates  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Shareholders return to court BBL  -Changing roles for the Belgian bank's owners BELGIAN banks are beginning to look exciting again. On Tuesday, Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the country's second largest bank, confirmed it was being courted by three of its largest shareholders - all financial services companies - with a view to linking their simpler personal insurance products to BBL's extensive retail banking network. BBL has been at pains to emphasise that such commercial links will not necessarily mean shifts in its shareholder register, but analysts and investors are not so sure. 'You can come up with all sorts of scenarios,' says one. 'The shareholder structure of BBL is very disparate and very unstable.' The widespread ownership of BBL's shares dates back to the 1980s, when Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), the sprawling Belgian holding company chaired by Mr Albert Frere, redistributed its 40 per cent stake in the bank among a number of institutional shareholders. Many of those were insurance companies making portfolio investments. To preserve the stability of the structure, the largest investors, including GBL, agreed to notify each other about purchases and potential sales of their shares. That syndicate's shareholdings now represent more than half of the bank's capital. However, the accelerating liberalisation of the EC financial services sector means European insurers are no longer mere passive investors in banks. The trend is towards so-called 'bancassurance' links between the two financial sectors. Germany is criss-crossed by national and regional alliances; French banks now write more than 50 per cent of their new life insurance business; and many British building societies have linked with life assurance companies. At the same time, Belgium's banking supervisors have recently agreed to relax rules which restrict the role of shareholders in banks. Now they can have a greater hand in shaping policy. Board changes announced at Tuesday's annual meeting of BBL reflected the new regime: two GBL executives - including Mr Gerald Frere, son of Albert - were elected to the board, as was a director of the Belgian unit of Winterthur, the Swiss insurer which owns a 4.78 per cent stake. Another large player - Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING) - is also agitating for more power in the group. The Dutch financial services company was formed last year through one of Europe's most spectacular bancassurance mergers, between the largest Dutch insurer, National Nederlanden, and NMB Postbank, its third largest bank. ING, which owns 5.86 per cent of BBL's shares, was already a focus for speculation about the bank's future because of press reports last year indicating it wanted to bid for the group. It never commented then, but on Tuesday it said it certainly wanted a seat on the board and confirmed that it was discussing various forms of banking and insurance co-operation with BBL. ING is not a lone suitor, a fact which could create friction. BBL is much deeper into talks with the Belgian group, Royale Belge - most of which is controlled by Union des Assurances de Paris - and Winterthur. Details of the deals under discussion are sketchy. Mr Jacques Thierry, BBL's chairman, said on Tuesday the position would be clearer by the time of the next board meeting in March. 'There'll be no revolution in the bank's shareholder structure,' he added. Keeping commercial and investment collaboration separate may be difficult, however. BBL already sells insurance products linked to savings or loans, and reinsures these through its insurer-shareholders, in line with the size of their holdings. Winterthur has suggested it would be logical to raise its stake - perhaps to the same level as Royale Belge's 9.35 per cent holding - as it increases its influence over management of the company. As one Brussels analyst pointed out yesterday, insurers spurned in any bancassurance deal might just decide to sell out, upsetting the balance of power within the share register. This is all potentially good news for simple investors in BBL, shares in which have risen nearly 14 per cent since speculation about an ING bid began. They may well be advised to hold on. GBL said before Christmas the bank's main shareholders had no intention of selling their BBL shares to ING 'in the current circumstances'. Those circumstances are gradually changing.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BBL'S MAIN SHAREHOLDERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Shareholder                                %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Groupe Bruxelles Lambert                 11.53 La Royale Belge/Urbaine UAP*             11.72 SBH Investment                            7.53 Internationale Nederlanden Groep**        5.86 Winterthur                                4.78 Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund      3.21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * UAP controls 47 per cent of Royale Belge and 2.37 per cent of BBL.

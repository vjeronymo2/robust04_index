			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Offensive launched against Khmer Rouge THE Cambodian government yesterday launched a military and political offensive against the Khmer Rouge with attacks on three of the guerrilla group's bases. In pre-dawn raids, soldiers from the newly unified Cambodian armed forces pounded Khmer Rouge bases in north-western Cambodia with mortars and heavy artillery. 'We won't allow the Khmer Rouge to occupy their own zone any longer,' said government co-chairman Prince Norodom Ranariddh at an open meeting with the other co-chairman, Mr Hun Sen. 'From now on, any group or party that is outside the government is outside the law,' the prince said. 'And if they are outside the law then they are the enemies of the government, and guerrillas.' 'There is no need to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge,' Mr Hun Sen said. 'The Khmer Rouge must give its army to the government and open its autonomous zone.' The government has also been broadcasting radio appeals and dropping leaflets on Khmer Rouge soldiers calling on them to desert their commanders and join the national army. They are being offered a reward and an equivalent rank to the one they have in the Khmer Rouge. United Nations officials said it was not clear how successful the military offensive had been. The national army has made inroads into the three Khmer Rouge bases, which are logistical centres, but so far they are not in control of any of them.</p>

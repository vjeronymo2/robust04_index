			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Judge Postpones Keating Decision: Citing a "strong possibility of resolution"  between the government and attorneys for Charles H. Keating Jr., former chief  of failed Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, U.S. District Judge Stephen  V. Wilson delayed ruling on a Justice Department suit that would require  Keating to disclose his assets.  </P> <P> Instead, Wilson gave attorneys for both sides until Wednesday to reach a  settlement in the case. The Justice Department, seeking to enforce an Office of  Thrift Supervision order, Friday filed suit against Keating, seeking the  disclosure and a partial freeze of his assets. Wilson also rejected a motion by  Keating's attorneys to transfer the case to Phoenix.  </P></p>

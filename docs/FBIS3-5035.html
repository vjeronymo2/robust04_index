Meanwhile, in a public session on 1 March, a U.S. Department  of State spokesman confirmed that the U.S. deputy assistant  secretary of state's remarks calling for the abolition of the  National Security Law were made by a responsible authority and  reveal [palkida] the U.S. official position.    Faced with the U.S. side's position urging the abolition of  the National Security Law, the South Korean authorities and the  Democratic Liberal Party went around busily reacting with  remarks about interference in domestic affairs and so forth.    On the other hand, a spokesman of the opposition Democratic  Party, said that the U.S. side's expression of its official  position calling for the abolition of the National Security Law  is, in terms of universal principles, rightful [tangyonhan], and  strongly urged the authorities to abolish the National Security  Law.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Observer: Free wheeling The only certain way of determining the real worth of a company car to employees - and despite Norman Lamont's best endeavours, they still seem to be a sight more attractive than a 'go-anywhere' London Underground ticket - is when the purring little perk is taken away from them. According to advertising agency Foote Cone &amp; Belding, which has just de-wheeled its staff, the answer is anywhere between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 7,000 - the range of pay rises it has handed out by way of compensation. Other companies seem likely to follow suit, notwithstanding threats from Customs and Excise to levy VAT on those who, unlike some of their colleagues, decline the cash option and keep the wheels. FCB owned a fleet of 80 cars with a balance sheet worth of Pounds 1m and an annual cost - in terms of servicing, insurance and depreciation  - of Pounds 500,000 and decided enough was enough. Chris Whitworth, the agency's finance director, says that the costs of providing the company car simply became prohibitive. He reckons many of those whose cars were taken away have not even bothered to replace them.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Building boost predicted for next year reaching a low point in the second half - but will rise modestly next year as house building recovers with the slow improvement expected for the economy, the joint forecasting committee for the construction industries predicted yesterday. The committee estimated that output had fallen 6 per cent last year to Pounds 29.9bn at 1985 prices, and it expected a further 2 per cent fall this year followed by a 1.5 per cent rise next year. The forecast, published by Construction Forecasting &amp; Research, is the first the committee has compiled independently of the National Economic Development Office, which was abolished last month. The forecast estimated that the value of new work fell 11 per cent between 1990 and 1992 to Pounds 17.8bn at 1985 prices. The fall last year was estimated at 4.5 per cent compared with the 7.5 per cent fall forecast six months ago. The change is due to a much higher estimate of output for social housing and a revamped assessment of the workload in the private industrial sector. The committee pointed out, however, that expressing the reduction in the volume of work in 1985 prices masked the figure for loss of work in current prices. 'It is the latter which matters to firms large and small right across the country, and it is estimated at 20 per cent in the past two years,' it said. 'This highlights the extent to which the recession in the industry has forced prices down.' A further 4 per cent downturn in new work was forecast for this year, with another considerable fall in private non-residential construction only partly offset by increases in housing and public non-housing output. New work was predicted to rise by 1 per cent next year based on further increases in housing output. The committee commented that the sole measure in the government's Autumn Statement that benefited construction was the release of Pounds 750m to housing associations to buy 16,000 homes by the end of the financial year. The forecasts for this year show variations between construction sectors. Public and private housing output were both predicted to rise 10 per cent this year and 11 per cent and 12 per cent respectively next year. The outlook for private commercial work remained gloomy, the committee believed, mainly because of the surplus of offices. Construction Forecasts, Winter 1992.

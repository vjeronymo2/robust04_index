			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Writ issued against BCCI auditors LAWYERS acting for the liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce and International issued a writ in the High Court yesterday claiming damages against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young, the bank's former joint auditors. The writ - in the name of the BCCI holding company and its two banking subsidiaries, BCCI SA, registered in Luxembourg and BCCI (Overseas) based in Grand Cayman - claims damages and compensation, alleging negligence, breach of duty and breach of contract relating to BCCI audits for 1985 and 1986. It names 36 defendants in Britain and overseas, including the Grand Cayman, the Bahamas, Luxembourg and Belgium. Mr Christopher Cowan, the former Price Waterhouse partner who at one time headed the team which carried out the full BCCI audit, is named. Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, and Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young, are sued in their personal capacity and on behalf of others working in their businesses. The two firms jointly audited the accounts of the BCCI group until 1987, when Price Waterhouse became sole auditor. The writ refers to a letter from the Luxembourg Monetary Institute to the directors of BCCI SA dated October 21 1985 in its statement of claims. Both firms said they were not surprised by the legal action, adding that it was a protective measure used when the time allowed under the statute of limitations was running out. The audit for 1985 marked a crucial stage in the BCCI fraud because it covered a period when losses in the BCCI treasury operations accumulated to some Dollars 633m. The government will wait for the results of the official BCCI inquiry under Lord Justice Bingham before commenting on a Commons' committee's report on the affair, Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday.</p>

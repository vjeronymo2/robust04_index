			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING'S MANFUSOS: FROM BACKSTRETCH TO THE FRONT OFFICE  </P> <P> Frank De Francis is the focus of most stories concerning Maryland's  thoroughbred tracks. The president of Laurel and Pimlico is dynamic, innovative  and his accessibility extends his visibility.  </P> <P> But De Francis' behind-the-scenes associates -- headed by minority partners Bob  and Tom Manfuso -- have played significant roles in patterning the resurgence  of Maryland racing.  </P> <P> "Our relationship is one of almost family," De Francis said. "They give me the  benefit of their opinions and their views. We don't always agree. They don't  pretend I'm always right, nor do they back away from every issue. But they give  me the respect to make the decisions for this organization."  </P> <P> John A. "Tom" Manfuso Jr. actually retired in 1979, when Burton Parsons  Pharmaceutical, the company his father had purchased 31 years before, was sold  for more than $100 million. Tom, who had served as the company's vice  president-general manager, headed south to enact major decisions regarding  golf-club selection on Florida's fairways.  </P> <P> Bob Manfuso, who had been Burton Parsons' marketing and sales director, turned  his attention to a product that had fascinated him and brother Tom since their  childhood days in Chevy Chase, Md. -- the Maryland thoroughbred. Bob owned and  bred them, and late in 1984 he was elected president of the Horsemen's  Benevolent and Protective Association.  </P> <P> Bob's tenure lasted only 10 days. He resigned in early December to purchase  Laurel Race Course with De Francis and brother Tom, who had grown weary of  abundant leisure.  </P> <P> Soon after the purchase of Laurel -- a few days before Christmas 1984 -- the  doorbell rang at Tom Manfuso's Chevy Chase home at about 2 a.m. Outside stood a  policeman and a minister who told the Manfusos that their 21-year-old son,  Thomas Allen Manfuso, had been killed in a car accident.  </P> <P> Tom, still pierced by the loss, spoke little of the incident. "You never  recover. You just learn to handle it better," he said. "When you have something  like that happen, the best therapy is to get busy and stay active. The purchase  of Laurel was a godsend for me, something I could throw myself into."  </P> <P> The Maryland racing industry was in need of such attention. Attendance and  handle were stagnant and the state's takeout was high, stifling purse growth.  Horsemen defected and fans lost interest, the esthetics of Bowie, Laurel and  Pimlico reflecting the industry's paralyzed state.  </P> <P> "I loved horses, I loved the racing, I loved the backstretch," Bob Manfuso  said. "I knew that Maryland racing was in trouble, and I knew that we were  rapidly deteriorating to a very mediocre product in terms of the sport. It  became very clear to me that someone was going to have to buy one of these mile  race tracks if Maryland were ever to move forward."  </P> <P> Vice president-executive secretary of Laurel and Pimlico, Bob Manfuso is in  charge of the tracks' racing operations, determining the overall quality of the  racing stock and structuring stakes programs. The industry's improved health in  recent years has brought added challenge to Manfuso's job; fattened purses have  enticed out-of-state horsemen, placing a premium on stall space.  </P> <P> As vice president-secretary, Tom Manfuso is responsible for the physical plant,  its modifications and maintenance. He is overseeing construction of Pimlico's  Sports Palace, scheduled for completion before the track reopens in March, and  has been negotiating with harness-track owner Mark Vogel regarding  Laurel-Pimlico simulcasts to Delmarva Downs, the harness track near Ocean City,  Md.  </P> <P> Bob and Tom Manfuso look nothing alike. Tom, eight years older at age 59, is  taller, broader, darker complexioned. He scarcely moves his lips when he speaks  in raspy baritone, and he wears conservative business suits and eyeglasses that  get darker in sunlight. Bob dons tweed and khaki and maybe an argyle sweater.  His hair is curlier and much lighter than Tom's, his features finer. His voice  is deep and clear.  </P> <P> Bob Manfuso had gotten to know De Francis by helping him syndicate the stallion  Hail Emperor, and he approached De Francis about the possible purchase of  Laurel. De Francis, who had revived the troubled Freestate Raceway, said he  would be interested, providing he gain controlling interest. The deal was made,  although De Francis did not actively participate in direct negotiations. He  resigned as Maryland secretary of economic and community development, and one  of racing's most daring, imaginative and profitable management teams was  assembled.  </P> <P> Until then, track ownership had been the only aspect of thoroughbred racing  untouched by the Manfuso family. John Manfuso Sr. began breeding and racing  horses in the 1930s, and he would take his sons to the track to watch morning  workouts and the mechanics of the backstretch. Exposure to afternoon races  would come much later.  </P> <P> "He was funny that way," Bob said of his father. "The morning was one thing. I  remember vividly Thanksgiving and Christmas in those days, when he used to buy  full-dressed hogs and give them to whoever was training for him, the  backstretch help, and we always went with him as a traditional kind of thing.  But you never went to the races with him in the afternoon. I think I snuck out  a couple of times on my own, but you didn't come with him until you were 14 or  15."  </P> <P> "The tough part about it was that we'd had exposure to the horses he'd bred,  and the exciting times in the morning when they'd work," said Tom. "Obviously,  you'd like to see what they could do in the afternoon. It was a natural  curiosity for a kid to have."  </P> <P> Tom carefully followed the career of Aneroid, a sore-legged yearling his father  bought at an auction in Upperville, Va., and who later defeated the renowned  Seabiscuit.  </P> <P> As Tom entered Landon School in Bethesda, Md., his interests shifted toward  team sports, but young Bob soon began tagging along with his father. "Bobby, as  far as horses were concerned, had a more acute interest than Tommy," John  Manfuso Sr. said. "As Tommy got older, suddenly it was football, tennis,  basketball."  </P> <P> Tom was an all-New England tackle at Bowdoin College, where during his junior  year he determined his career objective. "We were playing Williams, and my dad  called and said he'd like to see me in New York after the game," Tom said. "He  told me he was considering purchasing a pharmaceutical company, and would I be  interested in participating. I told him that excited me, and I was very anxious  to go in with him."  </P> <P> He began after serving two years in the Korean War. Bob joined the family  operation after graduating from Princeton.  </P> <P> The growth of his business did not limit John Manfuso Sr.'s outside interests.  "Even then," son Tom said, "he devoted a tremendous amount of time to the  horsemen's association."  </P> <P> John Manfuso Sr. was a longtime national president of the HBPA. Always a  horsemen's advocate, he remained a backstretch sentry of sorts even after his  sons and De Francis purchased Laurel, then Bowie and Pimlico.  </P> <P> "I won't hesitate to criticize them on the race track, particularly about the  backstretch part of things," John, 85, said. "But they haven't given me too  much to squawk about."  </P> <P> Tom and Bob Manfuso said they consider themselves horsemen first and foremost.  With George and Jeff Huguely they established Fourbros Stables in 1974.  Investing $2,500 apiece, they bought a 2-year-old filly named Crackerfax for  $8,000 and a yearling for $2,000.  </P> <P> "What intrigued me about (Crackerfax) at the time was that my father stood Salt  Spray, and Crackerfax's dam had produced a couple of very solid runners," Bob  Manfuso said. "I was prejudiced, but I thought Salt Spray had the touch for  being a very useful stud."  </P> <P> The stable quickly prospered. Crackerfax went on to win two stakes races and  $129,019, and two years later Fourbros struck again. They paid $14,500 for a  yearling son of Tentam at a Timonium sale.  </P> <P> The colt was Shelter Half, a multiple stakes winner who earned $236,337 before  retiring in 1980. He was syndicated and stands at Glade Valley Farm in  Frederick, Md., Fourbros retaining 10 stallion shares.  </P> <P> Then emerged Green Book, who rose to prominence as a 3 year old in 1987 and  became Fourbros' most recent stakes winner. As Green Book was preparing to  return to the races last spring, he developed a slab fracture and was sidelined  for the year. He's back in training now and is expected to soon resume his  career at age 5.  </P> <P> Bob and Tom Manfuso also have racing and breeding interests separate from  Fourbros. Their partnership with Frank De Francis -- himself a thoroughbred  owner and breeder -- thus created a management team well versed as to the  interests and concerns of horsemen.  </P></p>

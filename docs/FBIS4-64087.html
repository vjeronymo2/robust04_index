			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russian Federation Central Bank </F> Changes Tactics of Currency Market Regulation"]    [Text] The Russian Central Bank plans to change its  tactics of regulating the ruble's exchange rate against the  dollar by carrying out hidden interventions through networks of  authorized banks. At the same time, the Central Bank is going  to reduce its presence at the Moscow Interbank Currency  Exchange, Igor Knyazev, deputy chief of the bank's currency  operations administration, said. This scheme is expected to be  more efficient because authorized banks will benefit from  putting their into circulation, which, in turn, will create a  "cash flow."</p>

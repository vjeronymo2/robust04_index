			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Talks fail to end Caterpillar strike ATTEMPTS to restart contract negotiations between Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, and the United Auto Workers union have failed. Both sides in the three-month-old dispute appear to be digging in for a lengthy battle. After a brief meeting on Wednesday, the UAW rejected the company's latest amendments to its previous contract proposal. The union said that the modifications fell short of 'an equitable pattern agreement'. Pattern agreements are comparable labour contracts within an industry. The UAW is determined to win a contract similar to that it agreed last year with Deere &amp; Co, also a heavy equipment maker. Caterpillar said it was 'disappointed' with the UAW's decision and it warned that its latest proposal was its final offer. The company had asked for a return to the bargaining table this week after recalling some 5,600 union members it had locked out last November. The lock-out was in retaliation for a partial strike by 2,400 UAW members. The union, however, has placed those 5,600 members on strike, bringing the total number of strikers to 8,100. The UAW represents a total of over 16,000 Caterpillar workers. The union also charged that the company was engaging in 'union-busting behaviour' by hiring a private security company which it claims has been known to use very heavy handed tactics in labour disputes. While the strike affects plants in four states, the economy of Illinois, where Caterpillar is based, is being hit especially hard.</p>

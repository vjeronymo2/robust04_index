			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Austrian sales indicate a desire for the real thing - International Offerings The latest wave of Austrian privatisations indicates the government is finally relinquishing its tight grip on the country's banking and manufacturing industry. Moving away from the late 1980s policy of phony privatisations, when it sold minority shares in state assets but always retained majority or voting control, there are growing signs that the government is finally going for the real thing. That was borne out by last week's completion of the privatisation of Austria Mikro-Systeme International (AMS), which became the first company in Austria to be completely privatised. The flotation in May of 51 per cent of VA Technologie, and the planned disposal by the government of its 26 per cent blocking minority in VAE Eisenbahnsysteme in the autumn, also indicate the government means business. Progress on other privatisation projects - notably OMV and Creditanstalt-Bankverein - has been less encouraging. The sale of 20 per cent of OMV to Abu Dhabi in May still leaves the government with a 52 per cent holding. It promises to sell more, but investors could be forgiven for believing the desire to retain an Austrian majority still stands. The ongoing squabble over Creditanstalt, the country's number two bank, could further fuel such suspicions. The government, which holds 49 per cent of Creditanstalt equity and 70 per cent of the voting rights, wants to sell part of its holdings before the end of the year. But a political dispute - intensified by political mudslinging and horsetrading in the run-up to the October 9 general elections - has arisen over the rival bids which it has received. The first bid came from CS Holding, the big Swiss international financial group, which hopes eventually to own 100 per cent of the bank. Mr Ferdinand Lacina, finance minister and member of the Social Democratic party, made clear at an early stage that he looked favourably on the CS bid. But Austria's conservative business establishment, fearing that Creditanstalt under CS would become less sympathetic to their interests, quickly put together a consortium to make a counter bid. Germany's Allianz insurance group joined the fray, confirming last week that it is interested in Creditanstalt, although it has yet to make a formal offer. 'The whole thing is rather messy and isn't doing a lot of good for Creditanstalt,' grumbles an Austrian banker, who says he leans towards the CS Holding offer. 'If the consortium gets in, everyone will want to have a say, whereas under CS Holding, there would at least be a clear-cut strategy.' In spite of official foot-dragging, Austrian equity issuance is expected to pick up again once the elections are over and the international equity markets come back to life. The next wave of privatisations is expected to include the sale of the state holding company OIAG's remaining 26 per cent stake in VAE Eisenbahnsysteme; the partial sale of companies such as Creditanstalt, Bank Austria; and the privatisation of the few remaining viable firms belonging to OIAG. Further sales of shares of Verbund, the big national electricity producer, and EVN, the Lower Austrian electricity and gas utility, may also be on the cards. Although Austrian equities have had an impressive run in recent months, their outlook remains rosy, supply notwithstanding, in a market expected to benefit from steady, low-inflation growth lifted by EU membership and accompanied by further cuts in short-term rates.</p>

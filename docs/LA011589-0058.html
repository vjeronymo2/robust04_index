			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> REAGAN HELD FAST TO SENSE OF PURPOSE  </P> <P> Even the oldest living Americans can recall only three Presidents who served at  least two terms and left office still held in high regard by most of their  fellow-citizens: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and now Ronald  Reagan.  </P> <P> The six-year stretch of unbroken, noninflationary economic growth that Reagan  calls his proudest achievement is described by George F. Will, in an incisive  Newsweek essay on his White House friend, as "a debilitating feast," force-fed  by huge budget deficits that "mortgaged much of our future vitality."  </P> <P> I share that view, but the legacy of deficit spending can be overcome if  prosperous Americans accept a slightly reduced standard of living and the  necessity of paying the bills Reagan postponed. More worrisome to me is the  damage that half a generation of young Americans has suffered as a result of  Reagan policies, which widened the gap between rich and poor, between whites  and minorities.  </P> <P> History will not deal kindly with his Administration's deliberate efforts to  slow down or reverse the two previous decades of steady progress in reducing  poverty and discrimination. It was not just Ed Meese and Brad Reynolds pushing  Justice Department lawyers into court battles to reopen settled issues of  civil-rights enforcement. It was Reagan himself signaling moral indifference to  the struggle for equality.  </P> <P> He was neither heartless nor biased personally, but he was deaf to calls for  justice. The Great Communicator used all his rhetorical tools to advance the  causes he cared about; unfortunately, justice was not one of them. In his  farewell address, to take but the latest example, the word "freedom," or its  variants and derivatives, appears 15 times; the word "justice," not at all. He  frets about young people's ignorance of America's heritage. But for eight  years, he encouraged the nation to forget that the Pledge of Allegiance gives  equal weight to "liberty and justice for all."  </P> <P> But there have been offsetting gains. The appraisals of the Reagan presidency  give due notice to the peaceful character of the world scene as he departs and  the dramatic improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, for which he must share  plaudits with Mikhail Gorbachev and others.  </P> <P> It's unimaginable that the rush of state-local initiatives in education,  economic development, welfare reform, housing and other fields would have  occurred if Reagan had not effectively slammed the door on preemptive federal  action. The result has been an invigoration of those close-to-home governments,  the emergence of a dynamic generation of state and local leaders and, one must  believe, a greater sense of involvement by citizens in the challenge of  improving their own communities.  </P> <P> That is one major part of the Reagan legacy I hope will not be lost or  forgotten.  </P></p>

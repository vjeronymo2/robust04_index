			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / People: Ladbroke board adds non-execs The restructuring of the Ladbroke board after the retirement of former chairman Cyril Stein continued yesterday with the appointment of two non-executive directors. Hugh Collum, chief financial officer of SmithKline Beecham, the healthcare group, and Derek Williams, a director of Cadbury Schweppes, are to join the board. Williams' assumption of full duties is to be delayed, however, because of his participation in a rival bid to run the national lottery. Williams, 55, is a director of the Camelot Consortium of lottery bidders. Ladbroke is a partner of MAI in the Games for Good Causes consortium. To avoid any conflict, Williams will only take up his position on February 14, after bids have been submitted. Between his appointment and the award of the lottery licence, Williams will not be present at board discussions or receive papers relating to Ladbroke's bid. As well as being a director of Cadbury Schweppes, Williams is managing director of the Coca Cola and Schweppes Beverages joint venture. He joined Cadbury Schweppes in 1975 as personnel director of Schweppes Beverages. In 1980, he became responsible for manufacturing and was made managing director in 1984. Collum, 53, spent 17 years in the brewing industry before joining Cadbury Schweppes, where he was finance director. He became finance director of Beecham in 1987 and co-ordinated and implemented the merger with SmithKline Beckman.</p>

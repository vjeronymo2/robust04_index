			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government today expressed confidence in the  manner in which the director of the Kenya Wildlife Service  [KWS], Dr. Richard Leakey, was running the organization.    Addressing an international press conference in his office,  the minister for tourism and wildlife, Mr. Noah Katana Ngala,  however said the government was taking the allegations of  mismanagement at kws very seriously and investigations on the  reported malpractices have already commenced.    Mr. Ngala said there was indication that the parastatal had  violated the law in its operations, including its own act, and  warned stern action will be taken against those involved in  irregular activities. He said the ministry, in conjuction with  the auditor-general cooperations [as heard], was looking into  allegations of improper employment and payment of irregular  salaries to some of the staff at the organization. He said it  was irresponsible for some people to claim that unqualified  personnel were being employed and their tax-free salaries pegged  to the dollar without the authority of both the organization's  board of trustees and the minister for finance.    The minister said he had documentary evidence some  recruitment by the organization was being done of favoritism and  not on qualifications and that salaries are being fixed  arbitrarily by the management without any reference to the board  of trustees. He said it had also come to the ministry's notice  that certain major policy matters had been implemented by the  management without approval of the board and the organization  was involved in illegal collection of funds from the members of  the public.    Other issues being investigated include the translocation of  the animals from the national parks to private sanctuaries,  where owners were charging fees and while the organization was  operating on huge unauthorized bank overdrafts.    He assured the residents of Narok that the government has no  intention of handing over Masai Mara Game Reserve to KWS. He  appealed to the public to give the ministry ample time to  complete its investigations, adding that appropriate measures  will be taken to correct the situation.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney debt sale hits snag The first sale of secondary debt in Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, is believed have run into problems because Midland, the UK bank which is selling the FFr130m loan (Dollars 21m), has delayed completing the deal. Speculation in the New York secondary debt market suggested that the Bank of England was putting pressure on Midland to abandon the proposed sale. Both Midland and the Bank of England declined to comment on the issue. Midland, one of the 64 international banks that own Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn net debt, is understood to have agreed in principle early last month to sell its FFr130m portion of debt to a US investor for 60 per cent of its original value. The deal was agreed subject to documentation. This process usually takes three weeks for the first transaction in a sizeable company such as Euro Disney, and Midland was expected to complete the transaction a few days ago. However, US sources said that the deal had been delayed over the past few days. This has led to speculation over the role of the Bank of England, which has expressed concern about the effects of uncontrolled secondary debt trading. The Bank has formed a working party of banks in an effort to develop a code of practice that would require buyers of distressed debt to comply with the Bank's set of principles for the restructuring of troubled companies. The Midland deal had been regarded by secondary debt specialists as a watershed transaction which could have opened up a lucrative market in Euro Disney and helped to establish the distressed investment market in Europe. The secondary loans market has expanded rapidly in the US. But there is now an imbalance between the amount of capital available and the dwindling number of distressed investment opportunities, prompting US investors to look to Europe.</p>

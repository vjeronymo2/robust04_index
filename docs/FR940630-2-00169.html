The maximum number of points for each TA program is 100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Rating of the ``applicant'' or the ``applicant's organization and staff'', unless otherwise specified, will include any sub-contractors, consultants, sub-recipients, and members of consortia which are firmly committed to the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Potential effectiveness of the application in meeting needs of target groups/localities and accomplishing project objectives for each TA program for which funds are requested (40 points).

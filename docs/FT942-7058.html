			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Accountant fails in appeal over censure A leading accountant yesterday lost his appeal against a finding that he failed adequately to supervise an employee who was convicted of forgery and deception. Mr Brian Worth, a former head of the investigation committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, was 'admonished' by its disciplinary committee last November. The action was over his supervisory action while chairman of Clark Kenneth Levanthal, an international network of accountancy firms including Clark Whitehill in the UK. The institute investigation was triggered in late 1991 after the conviction of Mr Nicholas Young, a former executive director of CKL. Mr Worth resigned from the investigation committee later in 1991. The appeal committee yesterday said it found the complaint proved and ordered Mr Worth to pay Pounds 1,000 costs. Mr Young used CKL's address and stationery to attract investors and claimed their money would be invested in offshore trusts. In fact it was used to bet on horse races. Clark Whitehill said: 'We are entirely clear that we have no legal liability.' Mr Worth's solicitors said the institute had found he had no connection with or knowledge of the fraud, and he had received the mildest punishment possible.</p>

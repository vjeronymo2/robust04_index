			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 SPORTS BODIES CAN KEEP FILES, HIGH COURT SAYS  </P> <P> Ruling that the NCAA and the Southwest Conference are not government  organizations, the Supreme Court today let stand a lower court finding that  investigation files on Southern Methodist and other SWC schools need not be  turned over to news organizations.  </P> <P> In a case sparked by a football recruiting scandal at SMU, the court upheld a  U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that the NCAA and SWC are not  subject to the Texas Open Records Act. The appeals court had overturned a  decision by another federal judge.  </P> <P> Because of NCAA sanctions against SMU, which is in Dallas, some Texas news  organizations sought disclosure of files compiled by the NCAA. They also sought  files compiled by the SWC, which includes four public universities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> '73 State Law Invoked  </P> <P> When the requests were denied, the news organizations sued, invoking the 1973  state law that requires "governmental bodies" receiving "public funds"  generally to make public their internal documents.  </P> <P> A federal trial judge ruled that the state law applies to the NCAA and the  Southwest Conference, and ordered that the sought-after documents be  surrendered so it could be determined which should be made public. The U.S. 5th  Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling last July 26.  </P> <P> The appeals court agreed that the NCAA and the SWC receive public funds, but it  said they are not governmental bodies, defined as organizations "supported in  whole or in part by public funds."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Perot Ordered to Show Cause: In Fairfax, Va., Circuit Court Judge William  Plummer ordered H. Ross Perot's new company, Perot Systems Corp., to show cause  why it should not be held in contempt of court for violating an earlier court  order. Electronic Data Systems charged that on three occasions PSC violated an  injunction issued by Plummer prohibiting PSC from "soliciting, negotiating for,  entering into, or performing any contract or other business relationship"  before Dec. 1, 1989, that "contemplates or calls for any profitable return at  any point in time." Plummer issued the order Oct. 21 and made it permanent  April 13. Under the conditions of his sellout agreement with EDS, Perot agreed  not to compete with EDS until Dec. 1, 1989.  </P></p>

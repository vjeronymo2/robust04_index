			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TODD RUNDGREN AND HIS FANS TAKE A BAD TRIP BACK TO THE '70S  </P> <P> Todd Rundgren turned another year older Saturday. But then, for Rundgren, who  has never left the 1970s, age must be relative.  </P> <P> A collection of his worshipers gathered for the first of a four-night  celebration at the Coach House on his birthday, greeting him with mylar  balloons, flowers and drunken bellows of "Happy Birthday, Todd!" every three or  so songs. (The engagement continues with shows tonight, Tuesday and Thursday.)  </P> <P> And Rundgren, as master of ceremonies, threw a party that was part  "progressive" and "mellow" rock revival, part soapbox philosophy and part  theater-orchestra -- all with a healthy measure of pretension.  </P> <P> For all the vast musical expanses Rundgren has covered through more than two  decades and 27 (!) albums, his birthday party ultimately added up to little  more than a flashback weekend.  </P> <P> This was a performance chock-full of Worst-of-the-'70s trappings, save disco:  </P> <P> A 12-piece mega-band. Ten-minute songs. Rock as Broadway theater. And lots of  "jam sessions" (remember those?), indulgent guitar solos and endless stretches  of mellow.  </P> <P> For the sold-out crowd of stuck-in-1970-something partyers, this was utopia.  </P> <P> But for anyone who was thankful that the Sex Pistols, Patti Smith and the  Ramones dismantled the paradoxically labeled progressive-rock movement, this  was the unbearable lightweight of Todd's being.  </P> <P> Backed by a guitarist, bassist, two horn players, two keyboardists, two  drummers and three backup singers, Rundgren through most of the two-hour-plus  set sang and conducted the orchestra, baton in hand, wrapped in a kimono and an  air of self-importance.  </P> <P> He combined a sampling of crowd-pleasing standards, drawn mainly from his 1980s  work, with a trilogy from his recent stage musical ("The Smell of Money," "If I  Have to Be Alone" and "Love in Disguise") and plenty of new material from his  upcoming "Sessions" project, to be recorded during a five-night stint next  month at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts.  </P> <P> That the result was so thoroughly reminiscent of a decade long past is evidence  that while Rundgren has constantly stretched the boundaries of his own music,  his reputed status as a pioneering rock experimentalist is negligible.  </P> <P> Most problematic, however, is Rundgren's lack of lyrical depth. For example, a  new song he unveiled Saturday as his solo acoustic attack on censorship offered  nothing more imaginative than "(Expletive) you, Tipper Gore" or "I just wanna  (expletive) you, Jesse Helms."  </P> <P> But, an entire cult lives out there, residents of Todd Nation, many of whom  bought their Utopia Times subscriptions and "I Witnessed Todd" bumper stickers  on their way into the show.  </P> <P> And for those disciples, Rundgren is a tireless performer who knows and loves  his audience, and gives them what they want on a Saturday night -- as evidenced  by the countless standing ovations and outbreaks of dancing in the danceless  club.  </P> <P> For them, the '70s live on.  </P> <P>  Todd Rundgren plays tonight at 9 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano,  San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $25. Continues Tuesday and Thursday. Information:  (714) 496-8930.  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Northern front Mr Martti Ahtisaari was elected president of Finland on Sunday. His experience as a senior UN diplomat should come in useful at a turning-point in Finnish foreign policy. If all goes well, Finland will be a member of the EU next year. Like two of the other three candidate countries (Austria and Sweden), it has a tradition of neutrality; and like the third (Norway), which belongs to Nato, it has a direct border with Russia. Enlargement will thus have important implications for the EU's common foreign and security policy (CFSP). All four countries are under pressure to commit themselves to joining the Western European Union (WEU), which is the EU's defence arm but also the 'European pillar' of Nato. They are keeping their options open. Finland has said it will take a decision only after holding a referendum on EU membership. Given the popularity of the neutral tradition in the three countries that have it, and the deep suspicion of all things supranational in Norway, it would not be surprising if they opt, at least to begin with, for observer status in WEU - as Denmark and Ireland have done among existing EU members. But Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, has already warned his compatriots this may not be a tenable long-term option. Ireland, he pointed out in a speech before Christmas, will have to preside over the conference to revise the Maastricht treaty in the second half of 1996, which will see a big effort to adopt a common defence policy, linked explicitly to the Atlantic alliance. That would be a big change for former neutrals to adjust to, and it will be understandable if not all of them are prepared to make it at once. Ideally the whole of the enlarged EU should eventually be linked to Nato. Until that is possible, at least the link between Nato and WEU should be carefully preserved. Otherwise, states which belong to both organisations will be in the awkward position of giving a guarantee to their fellow WEU members, with which the US would not be associated. Those members or would-be members of the EU that are not yet prepared to opt clearly for Nato membership should content themselves with observer status in WEU.</p>

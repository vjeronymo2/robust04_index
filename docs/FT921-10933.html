			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome study backs efficacy of Retrovir WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceutical group, yesterday published preliminary study results demonstrating that Retrovir halved the likelihood of healthy people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) developing Aids and related diseases. The data also challenged doubts about the drug's toxicity in healthy HIV-positive patients. Wellcome's shares rose 24p to Pounds 11.73 in a falling market. The company said that, if the findings were confirmed by full analysis, the range of HIV-positive people who would benefit from Retrovir would be broadened. The data showed that patients receiving a placebo had a 28 per cent probability of deterioration compared with 14 per cent of those on Retrovir. Analysts said the study, which involved nearly 1,000 patients, should be taken seriously and could prove influential on medical opinion. Mr Robin Gilbert, analyst at James Capel, pointed out that, although the study patients had taken high doses of 1,000mg a day, the drug had been well tolerated. This suggested the drug's reputation for toxicity was not justified for healthy HIV-positive patients. A shorter Anglo-French study has recently come to the same conclusion. Wellcome has had difficulty selling the drug to HIV-positive people who have not developed Aids because of fears about the drug's toxicity. Many patients have been taking lower than recommended dosages. 'The implication of this study is that anybody with HIV - even those at early stages of the disease - will benefit from the drug,' said Professor David Cooper, chairman of the international co-ordinating committee for the trial. Wellcome was cautious about any immediate increase in sales following the study. The company pointed out that the results were preliminary and that the drug would have to negotiate regulatory hurdles before it could be administered to patients without Aids symptoms. Any financial benefits were not likely to emerge until next financial year, said the company. Last year, the drug had sales of Pounds 177m. Mr Jonathan de Pass, an analyst at BZW, said: 'This study should help the company overcome the perception of the drug's dangers. We believe sales forecasts have been scaled down too far. If the perception can be changed, usage could grow moderately fast to as much as Pounds 400m a year.' See Lex</p>

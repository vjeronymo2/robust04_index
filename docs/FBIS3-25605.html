It relates to the powers of  regions. Late last night the Negotiating Council agreed to the  principle of the provinces exercising a form of exclusive  powers, which has been a major alliance demand. It was decided  that a law passed by a provincial legislature should prevail  over national legislation. A national government will only be  allowed to set minimum standards, with reference to the word  concurrent having been dropped. The two proponents of the  concession said there was now no reason for the Freedom Alliance  to stay out of the election.    [Begin recording] [Government negotiator Roelf Meyer] We can  truly state now that the Negotiating Council, through the  proposals that were put to it for consideration today, and if  accepted all together, now addresses all the concerns that were  raised in the process of further negotiations with the Freedom  Alliance.    [African National Congress negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa] We  believe, sir, that with this agreement the Freedom Alliance  parties have no further reason, whatsoever, in staying outside  the process in refusing to participate in the elections, and we  would call upon all of them to consider these proposals and  accept them as such -- as the meeting of the Negotiating Council  today virtually closes the chapter of negotiations in the formal  sense, for amendments to the constitution, and that we should  now proceed with these amendments to parliament and prepare the  country for elections.

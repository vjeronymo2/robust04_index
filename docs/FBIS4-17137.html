			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech by President Geydar Aliyev at the enlarged </F> meeting of the heads of rayon executive authorities and leading  ministry and law enforcement officials in the presidential  offices on 17 April--recorded]    [Text] Esteemed participants of this convocation; this  meeting is of an extraordinary nature. It is related to the  fighting in the front-line areas and the measures that are  required in that regard. It is common knowledge that the  Armenian military forces moved on 9 and 10 April to intensify  their aggression and attacks on Azerbaijan's territory and our  positions on the front lines. They have maintained their  attacks until now.    We asked that talks be held to end the attacks. It is common  knowledge that I appealed to Azerbaijan's people through the  radio and television network on 12 April. Furthermore, I  appealed to the Armenian leaders, the Armenian people, the  Armenian and Azerbaijani citizens in Daghlyk [Nagorno] Karabakh,  the international community, the CIS leaders, and international  organizations to inform them about the situation. I stressed  that Azerbaijan demands that the attacks be halted, peace talks  be held, and the necessary agreement be reached.    The international community and foreign countries reacted  favorably to my appeal. Regrettably, the Armenian side and the  Armenian military forces have maintained their claims and tried  to distort the situation. They have been trying to blame  Azerbaijan for the attacks.    It is common knowledge that the CIS heads of state held a  summit in Moscow on 14 and 15 April. I held talks with  President Boris Yeltsin during the summit. I also held talks  with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin; Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev; several CIS heads of state; and President Levon-Ter  Petrosyan. I made an official speech on 15 April. That speech  has been broadcast by the television networks and published in  the press. You are already aware of it. I stressed that the  CIS cannot remain indifferent toward the fighting between  Azerbaijan and Armenia. In particular, it must take concrete  measures to obstruct the Armenian military forces' latest  attacks. A debate was held on my proposals. Later, a joint  communique by the CIS heads of state was approved. That, too,  has been published in the newspapers. It said that the CIS  heads of state have considered the fact that the leaders of  Azerbaijan and Armenia have expressed support for a cease-fire  agreement. Yes, I expressed support for a cease-fire agreement.    Other views also were expressed. You are already aware of  them. However, regardless of the joint communique by the CIS  heads of state, the Armenian military sub-units fired on  Azerbaijan's positions and attacked them from various directions  on 15 and 16 April. Serious and bloody fighting took place  yesterday, last night, and today. All that has shown that the  Armenian leaders have rejected our peace initiatives. Although  they purport to agree, they continue to maintain their approach,  which is aimed at forcing Azerbaijan to accept an agreement  which will be in their favor.    You have been informed through the television reports that I  expressed my views on the very recent Armenian attacks during  the closed session of the CIS heads of state. A debate was held  on the matter. Journalists asked me and President Ter-Petrosyan  to comment on the matter during the press conference that was  held after the summit. I briefly explained the situation.  However, President Ter- Petrosyan said that Armenia is not  involved in the war and that the fighting is between Azerbaijan  and Daghlyk Karabakh. Furthermore, he stressed that Armenia is  prepared to sign Russia's [peace] plan together with all the  participants of the CIS summit. However, the question is as  follows: What right does Armenia have to sign that plan if it  is not a party in the war? Obviously, the Armenian officials  have exposed their approach.    All that may be regarded as an interesting development.  However, not for us. What is important for us is the  maintenance of our present positions and the defense of our  republic's territory. Regrettably, I wish to reiterate that we  have suffered severely from the unending Armenian attacks. We  have lost many people. Bloody clashes took place in several  residential areas yesterday. Some of them were lost and then  taken back. The situation changes every day. Therefore,  establishing what goes on is impossible. However, it is common  knowledge that the Armenian military forces have launched very  strong attacks. That is a fact. We must also admit that their  attacks have been at a very professional level.    Meanwhile, we have been informed from the front-line areas  that those attacks have not been organized only by the Armenian  military forces. Observations indicate that foreign forces have  been involved in the organization and launching of those  attacks. That state of affairs has greatly exacerbated the  situation in the front-line areas.    I must also stress on the basis of the information I have  received that the Azerbaijan military sub-units have retaliated  against the serious and devastating attacks appropriately. They  are bleeding and dying to become martyrs in the effort to defend  the homeland. Of course, they have been confronted with  difficulties. They have been forced to withdraw in various  places. Nevertheless, they have continued to defend our  territory.    I was informed this morning that Ferhat Askerov, who was  named a national hero in view of his services during the  fighting in Shusha in 1992, was martyred while heroically  fighting to defend Sumu in Agdamskiy Rayon last night. But,  there are others as well. I have mentioned his name because he  was a renowned national hero. Many of our people have been  martyred while fighting to defend our homeland's territory.  That is very natural. That state of affairs is an indication  of our people's and Army's heroic nature and courage. It is  also an indication of the fact that our people can block the  Armenian attacks more effectively and skillfully in the future.    I urge you to observe a moment of silence to commemorate the  memory of the sons and citizens of Azerbaijan who have been  martyred in the latest fighting. [silence observed to  commemorate martyrs; Aliyev continues]    God bless their souls. I convey my condolences to the  families of all our martyrs. I wish to assure them on behalf of  Azerbaijan's people that they will never be forgotten. They  will always be remembered by Azerbaijan's people as heroes.  Their heroic services will strengthen and elevate Azerbaijan's  people and create the basis for the safeguarding of Azerbaijan's  territorial integrity.    Regrettably, I also wish to stress that some of our citizens  have acted in a cowardly way and deserted from the front lines.  Some of them fled to save their lives. Regrettably, that state  of affairs is still continuing. That is a situation that  weakens our defenses and keeps us from retaliating against the  Armenian attacks in an appropriate way. Undoubtedly, no one  will treat the cowards and deserters respectfully. Furthermore,  no one will treat their families and relatives respectfully.  They will always be hated by the community. I am convinced  that they will be brought to account in accordance with our laws.    I feel the need to reiterate a point that I stressed in my  radio and television speech on 12 April. We have serious  problems in the effort we are making to organize our army and  find the necessary officers and men for the military units.  That is due to the inefficient maintenance of the state of  mobilization and to the cases of desertions from the military  units, that is, in addition to desertions from the front lines.    The matter was seriously discussed during the meetings that  were held by the leaders of the rayon executive authorities and  military commissars in Beylagan and Barda on 11 and 12 April.  We gave serious instructions to the leaders of the rayon  executive authorities and administrative organs to strengthen  their struggle against such cases. The main task of each and  every individual and the officials in particular is to  contribute toward the effort made to provide men and officers  for the military units, establish discipline, and obstruct  desertions. Another more serious task does not exist. Nothing  can be done in connection with the pending economic and  political measures and nothing can be done to meet the wishes of  the people because we shall be defeated if we fail to defend our  territory. The enemy forces will advance to occupy the  remaining part of our territory. Who will survive after that is  unknown.    In view of that, I am obliged to reiterate that what I have  mentioned is our main task and problem. The developments that  took place in the front-line areas on 15, 16, and 17 April  indicate that we have failed to change that state of affairs.  We face a serious situation at the present time. We have made  several peace initiatives. We have had recourse to the CIS.  The CIS issued an important statement on 15 April that noted  that the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to  immediately implement a cease-fire agreement. However, the  Armenian military forces launched strong attacks against  Azerbaijan's positions on the same day. Apparently, the peace  initiatives have failed to yield results.    President Boris Yeltsin emphatically agreed in our private  talks and in the general convocations we had later that a  cease-fire agreement has to be imposed. He emphatically asked  me and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan to move to end the  shooting. President Yeltsin also said that he would even visit  Azerbaijan and Armenia to help us resolve the matter if we do  not object. However, the strong attacks by the Armenian  military forces on 15, 16, and 17 April, that is, shortly after  the talks we had with President Yeltsin, showed that the  Armenians do not attach importance to talks and statements. They  only wish to pursue their aggressive intentions and maintain  their aggressive policies.    We have appealed to the international organizations. My  appeal was conveyed to them through our channels on 12 April.  It was conveyed to the UN organization, the UN Security  Council, the CSCE, and all the heads of state. However, the  Armenian aggressors have not drawn any conclusion from the  developments. They have maintained their aggressive and  occupationist policies and their activities within the framework  of those policies.    Considering that state of affairs, our most important and  urgent task is to establish our Army, provide the necessary  manpower for our military units, help the Army, and stop  desertions. How many of you are here in this meeting hall? How  many of you can sincerely say that you have effectively  fulfilled that task? I have not been able to see anyone who has  done that in this meeting hall.    Everyone believes that others must fulfill that task but  whether he himself does so does not matter. Therefore, I wish  to ask: Why are we trying to defend our homeland? Why should  Azerbaijan continue to exist? When are we going to rid  ourselves of Armenia's aggression? When are we going to  guarantee the defense of our people?    We have discussed all those matters. However, considering  the fact that the necessary result has not been achieved, I have  decided to invite you to attend this extraordinary meeting. We  do not need a lot of time. I do not know how things are for  others, but each and every moment is very important for us. So,  we must hold substantial talks in this meeting hall. We must do  everything we can today, tomorrow, and in the next few days to  see to it that the requirements of the state of mobilization in  the Republic are quickly fulfilled. We must establish new  military units from our reserves. We must also help the Army in  other respects. We must take the necessary measures in the  front-line areas.    I was informed from the front lines last night that the  Barda  Battalion's troops fled in the vicinity of Terter. I was forced  to call the executive authority in Barda to ask why the men from  that rayon fled. Barda and Terter are so close to each other  that there is nowhere to go. I was informed by the head of the  executive authority a few hours later that he went to the area  and instructed his men to return to their posts. Why has that  situation come to pass? Why should the head of an executive  authority run here and there to collect his men from this or  that town in the night? However, that is not the only case.    I have conveyed my views to you on our heroic fighters and  martyrs, particularly on Ferhat Askerov, who became a national  hero in Shusha. The deserters have defamed and dishonored  Azerbaijan's people and worsened our present situation. In view  of that, I believe that we must discuss the concrete measures we  need at the present time.    The matters that should be discussed are crystal clear.  However, I wish to outline the tasks to be fulfilled:    First, I wish to stress that the quarterly task related to  the military call-up must be fulfilled. That task requires that  the head of the executive authority, military commissar, chief  of police, procurator, and head of the state security  administration in each and every rayon, city, and locality  personally control every issue, including the fulfillment of the  quarterly task of the military call-up. Fulfilling that task  does not mean that you will go and transfer the matter in  question to the military commissar's office and then come back  to report that you have fulfilled your task. No, that is not  the way to fulfill your duties. You are responsible. You will  see to it that recruits apply to the assembly points. You will  follow the way they are drafted in the assembly points.  Furthermore, you will control how they fulfill their military  obligations in the military ranks for some time. I do not wish  to make calls in the future to say that the Barda Battalion,  Koykey Battalion, Mingechaur Battalion, and this or that  battalion have abandoned their positions. I do not want any  official to inform me two or three days later that he has done  what was necessary. That is your obligation. You must always  keep your duties in mind. You must follow the men from your  rayons to establish the way they serve in the military forces.    I received a call before I left for Moscow. It informed me  that the Khachmas Battalion in Agdamskiy Rayon dispersed and  fled. I called the head of the Khachmas Executive Authority at  0100 in the morning. I forced him to go to Agdamskiy Rayon to  reorganize his men. Is that my job? Should I be doing that?  Why do we have officials serving as heads of executive  authorities if I have to instruct or force them to fulfill their  duties? Therefore, you are responsible not only to fulfill the  procedures required for the conscription of recruits but also to  see to it that the conscripted recruits report to serve in the  military units they are assigned to. You must follow the way  they serve. That is your task until this state of affairs ends.  Undoubtedly, each and every rayon will be instructed in that  regard.    However, I wish to appeal to the executive authorities,  leading officials, and the esteemed people of the occupied  rayons as follows: The people of your rayons have become  refugees. They are living in various areas. Many of them are  unemployed. Instructions must be given to those rayons because  they had many young men. They must join the military units and  make an effort to liberate their occupied lands. I do not agree  with the view that they will have to fight to liberate other  rayons. All the Republic's citizens are equally responsible for  the defense of Azerbaijan's territory, regardless of the city or  rayon they come from. All the citizens are expected to fulfill  their patriotic duty in the same way. Regarding the occupied  rayons, I wish to say that the young men from them who are  unemployed must join the military ranks to defend Azerbaijan's  territory. I believe that that will be an honorable duty for  them.    That is the second issue. Let me reiterate that you are  responsible for the work in the call-up of recruits and matters  related to the mobilization. In fact, all the rayon and city  organizations are responsible together with you. That task has  to be fulfilled.    Meanwhile, the law enforcement organs must seriously work to  establish those who avoid the mobilization and the call-up for  conscription. The military commissar's office has proposed that  individual centers be established to carry out the work. That  system was applied in the past. However, it was not successful.  In fact, it led to negative developments from time to time.  Therefore, I believe that that is not an appropriate system.  Let me stress that the district police inspectors are well  aware of the people in the areas they serve. They are well  aware who does what, who is employed or unemployed, and who  avoids conscription. They are well aware of all that.  Therefore, our police organs in particular must concern  themselves with the work to be carried out. That also applies  to the procuracy organs. Serious and urgent measures must be  taken against those who avoid the requirements of the  mobilization regime and the call-up for conscription. The  people must be urgently informed about the measures.    The number of deserters has increased. We have discussed  that many times. The duty of the rayon and city executive  authorities and their leading officials must be to establish the  deserters in each and every rayon, district, and city and return  them to the military forces. Serious work must be carried out  in that regard. I have established a deadline for the  mobilization and call-up procedures. The requirements of the  call-up for conscription must be fulfilled in three days and  those of the mobilization in five days. We have allowed 10 days  for the return of the deserters to their units. All the  deserters must be forced to return to their units in 10 days. I  wish to reiterate that charges will not be brought against the  deserters who return to their posts. Very serious measures must  be taken against those who fail to do so in 10 days.    The number of positive cases in that regard are not few. For  example, I can recall the meeting I had with Colonel Elburus  Orudzh oglu on 13 April, that is, after my appeal to the people  through radio and television on 12 April. He informed me that  100 deserters returned to their units to serve and fight after  my appeal. What I mean is that our life is not full of only  negative developments. We also have many positive developments.  However, we do not mention them often much because our general  situation is unfavorable. I was very happy to be informed of  the situation by Colonel Elburus Orudzh oglu 24 hours after my  appeal. I agree that 100 men is not a large force. However,  they wished to correct the mistake they made. They rushed to  rejoin their military units on the front lines. They joined the  fighting. That was a move worthy of respect and attention.  That was not the only case. There were many more.    Therefore, serious work has to be carried out in 10 days.  The deserters must be returned to their units. The matter  requires serious attention. The procuracy and other  investigation organs must take serious measures to bring the  deserters who fail to return in 10 days to account. I am  convinced that our procuracy and judicial organs will  effectively and accurately apply the laws and the provisions of  the Republic's criminal code. I am also convinced that the work  they carry out will create the conditions we need to change our  general situation.    I wish to particularly outline the work to be carried out by  the military commissars. You have observed that I have assigned  all these tasks to the leaders of the executive authorities, the  police, procuracy, and security organs, and the military  commanders. Actually, the matter mainly concerns the military  commissars. They must concern themselves with that work.  However, we have said several times that the military  commissars have not been able to successfully fulfill their  duties. In fact, they do not wish to do so because of certain  reasons. In view of that, I wish to stress that I am not  satisfied with the work of the military commissars. The  Republic's military commissar has disclosed in this meeting hall  that a criminal investigation has been initiated against several  military commissars. I wish to urge that the work in that  regard be quickly carried out and the people be informed of  their mistakes.    Considering the need to establish discipline and law and  order in that field, I have decided to take action as of today.  That is as follows: The appointment and discharge of the  military commissars must be subject to the approval of the  presidential apparatus.    The matter was transferred to the Defense Ministry.  Regrettably, serious shortcomings have been allowed by the  Defense Ministry on that matter until now. Therefore, I will  instruct the presidential apparatus to study the situation of  all the military commissars and advise me as to which military  commissar can or cannot work in the future. That information  must be conveyed to me in 10 days. I will decide on the matter.  Undoubtedly, I will do so on the basis of your detailed  reports. You will establish who can or cannot work in 10 days.  I will instruct the defense minister today to comply with that  rule. I will instruct that military commissars be neither  appointed nor discharged without the consent of the presidential  apparatus and that the research be carried out in 10 days.  Undoubtedly, the research must be carried out in cooperation  with the Defense Ministry. However, I wish to recommend that  the president's adviser also participate in that process.    Speaking in this meeting hall, the Republic's military  commissar has expressed his opinion on the work of several  military commissars. I have received information that the work  of Lieutenant Colonel Amirov Gusayn Miral oglu, military  commissar of Dzhelalabadskiy Rayon; Major Rakhimov Vadim Ferman  oglu, military commissar of Kuba Rayon; and Lieutenant Colonel  [first name indistinct] Orudzh Ferhad oglu, military commissar  of Masally Rayon, has been very unsatisfactory. As such, they  have been unable to fulfill their duties. I am removing them  from their posts as of this moment. Furthermore, I am  instructing Minister of Defense Mamedov to issue orders for  their removal from their posts in accordance with my  instructions in two hours. Send them to the front-line areas.    Complaints have been made against the work of the police  organs. We have received information from several rayons from  time to time that the police organs disobey the executive  authority and that the head of the executive authority is unable  to control them. We have also received information that  arguments take place between the procuracy and that the police  organs and the head of the executive authority are unable to  resolve this or that problem. All that undermines discipline  and law and order and worsens the situation. We cannot accept  such a state of affairs. Therefore, I wish to underline the  following: The head of the rayon executive authorities are the  representatives of the president. They are accountable to the  president on every development in the rayons. Therefore, all the  rayon organs are subordinate to the heads of the rayon executive  authorities and they must work together. However, that does not  mean that the heads of the rayon executive authorities can do  anything they like. No, that is not so. I am asking for  businesslike relations between the heads of the executive  authorities and the rayon organs. Under the existing grave  conditions, I want everyone to help each other. I want the  clashes and arguments between them from time to time to be put  aside.    The heads of the executive authorities are competent  officials. They must use their authority. However, the  authority that has been transferred to them has placed  significant responsibility on their shoulders. That  responsibility requires them to set an example for all the other  organs in every domain, including work, morale, and loyalty to  obligations. If they fail, then they cannot fulfill their  obligations.    The arguments among the administrative organs in the rayons  must be removed. I do not wish to go into detail on that  matter. The administrative organs must work together. They  must cooperate to fulfill the main tasks. I expect the heads of  the executive authorities to see to that matter.    Suggestions have been made to the effect that we have to  take  additional measures because of the serious situation in the  Republic. Yes, similar suggestions were also made in the past.  The Republic is in a state of war. Our life and activities  must be reorganized in accordance with the demands of the  military situation. The people must realize until that is done  that everyone can be called to defend the homeland. The  situation at the present time is that a part of the community is  in the front line areas. They are fighting. Our officers and  men in the military forces are fighting. They are being killed  every day. Many of the refugees are in a very miserable  condition. However, a certain group of people have a  comfortable life, particularly in Baku. They are not concerned  with the war. Nor are they concerned with the situation of the  people who live under grave conditions. They have plenty to eat  and drink. However, they must not display it. Entertaining in  restaurants and other places will not help our situation at the  present time.    I have stressed several times that nothing can be more  effective than the experience we have gained in the past. The  people lived in the same way during World War II. Consumption  of bread was 400 or 500 grams per person. That applied to  everyone. No one tried to get double that amount. Naturally,  there were exceptions. However, they were very few.  Unfortunately, certain people eat, drink, and entertain in the  restaurants at the present time. They do not think about the  continuing bloodshed. They do not think about the people who  are dying of hunger. Furthermore, they make suggestions on how  this or that should be done.    In view of that, I believe that the demand for the  declaration of a state of war for the strengthening of  discipline is justified. We must consider that state of affairs  and take the necessary measures. Meanwhile, I wish to appeal to  our people to conscientiously consider the way we live at the  present time. Everyone must live in accordance with the  conditions of war and defend our territory. Any other  alternative does not exist.    The Republic's military commissar has said that several  decrees are inappropriate. That viewpoint was also expressed  earlier. I do not know why changes have not been made. Who is  responsible for making proposals to have the decrees changed?  Is it the military or the legal advisers? They should have  done so. If the matter concerns the presidential decrees, then  proposals should be made to the presidential apparatus. If laws  have to be changed, then the National Assembly should take  action to resolve the matter in three or four days. I wish to  instruct the presidential adviser on military affairs and the  legal department of the presidential apparatus to draw up their  proposals in three days.    I wish to assure you that the serious talks we had in this  meeting will yield results. We shall make changes in various  fields in the near future. I wish to stress that I am convinced  that Azerbaijan's people and the officials they have trusted and  placed in high-level positions are aware of how grave the  present situation is for our republic. They will draw the  necessary conclusions and take the necessary measures.    Thank you. I wish you success in the effort you will make to  fulfill your tasks.</p>

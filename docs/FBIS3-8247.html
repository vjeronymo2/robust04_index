Therefore, if it later comes to light that  a civil servant had, for example, cooperated with the agents of  Department III/III [former secret service], the sanction can  only be public humiliation, said Fabian Jozsa, whom we  interviewed on the implementation of the bill on examining the  political past of people in certain important positions.    [Jozsa] The government does not intend to issue an order on  executing the law on agents because the law precisely regulates  the steps of examination. However, regarding certain technical  details of the procedure, instructions will have to be issued,  but these will only help the work of the committees. The  premises, the necessary equipment, and the fees for the  participants will have to be ensured. Naturally the government  will bear the costs. It is worth mentioning that the law on the  legal standing of civil servants has to be applied in the case  of the committee members who will carry out the examinations --  who will be judges elected by parliament for a limited period --  because the service conditions of the judges will be suspended  during this time.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do I understand correctly that many  committees will operate?    [Jozsa] Yes, as a result of a deputy's proposal, the bill  makes it possible for the necessary number of committees to  operate to fulfill the tasks. Parliament will have to decide  this issue.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The original proposal contained the names of  people to be examined in order of importance, thus determining  the order of the examinations at the same time. Therefore, the  parliamentary deputies will be first, followed by the president  of the republic and the government members, while certain heads  of state-owned banks and insurance companies will be examined  last of all, this being the last point on the list.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] When will the bill come into force?    [Jozsa] According to the plans, only the rules on forming  the committees and their activities will come into force when  the law is announced; the other rules will come into force on 1  July.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does this mean that we cannot expect any  examinations before the elections?    [Jozsa] It would be technically impossible to begin the  examinations earlier. However, this will not be a problem  because the examinations will have to be started right after the  new Parliament is formed. The law does not actually extend to  the parliamentary candidates, therefore, this cannot influence  the decision of the voters.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In what period of time does the examination  of these people have to be completed?    [Jozsa] The law stipulates one year; all these people have  to be examined during this period. The same will happen if  someone takes up his position later; his examination will have  to be completed within one year of his taking up his position.  The law will remain in force until July 2000; therefore, the  Parliament formed after the 1998 elections will also be examined.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The bill does not envisage the application  of sanctions, but can people who are found to have cooperated  with the III/III service expect to face legal consequences as  far as their employment is concerned?    [Jozsa] No, but this would be out of the question in the  case of people in elected positions. The law stipulates public  humiliation as the only sanction. I believe that this will make  everyone think, and former agents will voluntarily leave after  -- or even before -- the examination. It is worth mentioning  here that, in addition to former III/III members, the law also  applies to all those people who regularly received agents'  reports because of their position, namely the former secretaries  of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee, the  former members of the Political Committee, and former prime  ministers, interior ministers, and defense ministers.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Are you planning to examine the candidates  before filling positions that fall under the government's sphere  of authority?    [Jozsa] The law does not give authority for this. Prior  examination cannot be a condition for employment because this  would be against the Constitution. Therefore, if someone is  later found to have, for example, cooperated with Department  III/III, public humiliation can be the only sanction in this  area, too. At the same time, naturally, the person who makes  the appointments will try to find people with immaculate past  records in other ways; for example, a statement by the candidate  could be a solution. However, a false statement cannot have  legal consequences as far as employment is concerned.</p>

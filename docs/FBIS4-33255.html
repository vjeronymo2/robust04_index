			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fortaleza correspondent Flaminio Araripe] </F>   [Text] Planning Minister Beni Veras has announced that  Regional Integration Minister Aluizio Alves has authorized the  revamping of the National Department of Drought Control (DNOCS),  reducing the number of directorates from 17 to four. Veras said  this process would be implemented this month. In addition to  the elimination of 13 directorates, the name of DNOCS might be  changed to National Department of Semi-Arid Zones [Departamento  Nacional do Semi-Arido]. DNOCS allegedly drilled wells, in an  irregular procedure, on a ranch owned by Chamber of Deputies  President Inocencio Oliveira (PFL-PE) [Liberal Front  Party-Pernambuco State].    Four regional directorates -- Pernambuco, Ceara, Piaui, and  Bahia -- will be eliminated. The central administration's  directorates in Fortaleza, namely Water Resources, Fish Farms,  Irrigation, and Administration-Finance, would be spared. DNOCS  Director General Hildeberto Araujo has confirmed the revamping.    DNOCS, established in 1909, now has 3,183 employees and a  $240 million budget subject to approval by Congress. According  to Araujo, President Itamar Franco will, within the next few  days, form a commission to study a transfer of jurisdiction of  the Sao Francisco River, which was proposed by the Regional  Integration Ministry.    Beni Veras proposed forming a commission to study the use  and  protection of the Sao Francisco River, a commission to be formed  by 10 northeastern states. The jurisdiction transfer of the  river would involve the states of Pernambuco, Ceara, Rio Grande  do Norte, and Paraiba. The proposal includes the establishment  of a national park to protect the river's headwaters vegetation  on both banks.    According to the planning minister, Bahia State, which has  been benefiting from the river by using aqueducts, is being  "selfish" in opposing the project to transfer jurisdiction of  the Sao Francisco River to the northeastern states, where there  are no permanently flowing rivers.</p>

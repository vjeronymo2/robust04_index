			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Bonn offered as base for WTO The German government yesterday submitted its formal offer to site the future World Trade Organisation in Bonn, in a hopeful but probably forlorn bid to tempt the WTO away from the Swiss city of Geneva, home of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The German offer came just a day before the bid deadline, in a letter from Mr Gunther Rexrodt, economics minister, to Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt director-general, and Mr Andras Szepesi, chairman of the Gatt contracting parties (members). A decision on the location of headquarters for the WTO, which is due to supersede Gatt next January, is planned before the August break. No other contenders are expected. Singapore has denied it is a candidate (though it hopes to host the first ministerial meeting of the WTO). Details of the German and Swiss offers will be given to members of the WTO preparatory committee today. German officials said yesterday that the WTO had been offered eventual possession of the new federal parliament building overlooking the Rhine once its present occupants moved to Berlin in 1998. In the meantime, the WTO's 500-plus staff would be housed in a new building close to the old parliamentary chamber which would serve as a meeting and conference room. Switzerland is offering Gatt's present lakeside headquarters and construction of an adjoining conference room. The Swiss package also includes more generous terms on immunities and privileges for WTO staff and diplomatic missions than Gatt now enjoys, and a more relaxed approach to granting work permits for family members - two important gripes among Geneva's international community. Although Bonn says it will pay towards removal costs, trade diplomats say the expense and upheaval involved in moving from Geneva almost certainly rule it out. For many poor countries, the expense of establishing a new specialist diplomatic mission in Bonn would be prohibitive, whereas in Geneva a single mission can cover the range of international organisations. Gatt's present staff has also shown a marked lack of enthusiasm for the idea. Moreover, Germany's EU partners are unenthusiastic, especially France which has already declared itself for francophone Geneva. 'The WTO's presence in Geneva means French is one of the three working languages, which is good for the influence of our country and our culture,' Mr Gerard Longuet, French trade minister, told the French parliament last month.</p>

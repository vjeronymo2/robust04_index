			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Letter: Why an industrial tribunal was moved Sir, I was interested to read Lisa Wood's article (April 12) on the location of the London Industrial Tribunals. There were some errors in it which I am happy to correct. First, the tribunals are independent judicial bodies and it is I, not the Department of Employment, who shoulders responsibility for their location and removal. Second, I have no plans to move the London North Tribunals from their present address in Woburn Place, WC1. It is one of the two largest tribunal centres in the country and will continue to serve the needs of the greater part of London. Third, it is necessary to move the London South Tribunals because the end of the lease of their premises is in view. Their catchment area, at present, stretches to the south coast and will eventually include the area of the Brighton Tribunal office. I therefore decided that a move out of central London had a number of advantages both as to cost and to site the tribunals more centrally in the region they will serve. The fact that one of the present chairmen tells your reporter that we are all 'hopping mad' may have a little to do with their personal convenience. The region's catchment area remains to be reconsidered and it is a little premature for the chairmen to decide that the move will be inconvenient to the tribunal users. I am confident that most users will find the move rather more convenient and accessible. Timothy Lawrence, president, Central Office of the Industrial Tribunals, 93 Ebury Bridge Road, SW1</p>

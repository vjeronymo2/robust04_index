			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Peugeot to axe jobs AUTOMOBILES Peugeot, the French car maker, said yesterday it would cut 2,597 jobs this year, its biggest workforce reduction since 1988, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The company blamed declining European demand for cars. The move, the latest in a series of job cuts across French industry, is part of Peugeot's strategy to increase productivity by 12 per cent a year. This is needed to close the gap between itself and Japanese car makers before they win free access to European markets from 1999. The job losses represent a 5 per cent reduction of the 50,000-strong payroll. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry and trade minister, said the government was continuing to study plans for closer links between Renault, the state-owned car group, and Volvo, its Swedish partner.</p>

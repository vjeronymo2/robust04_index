Asked why he preferred  to be in Brazil when there was a tense situation in Paraguay,  Wasmosy said that what is happening in Paraguay is simply  demagogic populism.    The president said that all social groups have the right to  petition for whatever they please, adding that he would never  resign his post. Then, he ironically told journalists that they  themselves could also ask for his resignation.    "We are living in a democracy, and I would not like to  intervene in this game of demagogic populism. I am here today  because these people have fulfilled something they promised me  they would do. In October they will again do something I  requested, which will benefit us all and will reduce production  costs," Wasmosy said in justifying his presence at the ceremony  to inaugurate the interconnection between the Tiete and Parana  Rivers in Sao Paulo State. Asked about Cadelpa's [Paraguayan  Cotton Chamber] position, Wasmosy said we should not attack the  association excessively because it has always cooperated with  the government and peasants. The president then outlined  Cadelpa's efforts in favor of a successful cotton harvest year  and used almost the same words used by Cadelpa to explain the  meaning of the documents seized and aired by the CBII  [Congressional Investigating Committee on Illegal Activities].</p>

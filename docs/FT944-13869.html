			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Trade News: EU's export credit rules seen as threat Brussels' plans to harmonise export credit within the European Union risk imposing extra delay and red tape on European exporters just when they face fiercer competition from the US, the leading French credit agency warned yesterday. Mr Francois David, president of Coface, the newly privatised agency which underwrites a quarter of French exports, said it was 'not absurd to have a common export credit policy'. This, he said, was particularly the case when some of Europe's leading exporters were transnational companies, such as the four-nation Airbus consortium, or the Franco-British venture of GEC-Alsthom, and where in the absence of harmonisation the risk appreciation of different EU insurers was very different. 'But exporters often already find it difficult to get a credit at the national level,' Mr David said, predicting that harmonisation at the EU level would create further delay with credit offers evaluated by 'people (in Brussels) who might not be experienced and who might introduce political arbitrage among the Twelve (member states)'. The US and Japan 'would be happy to see Europe put itself into another straitjacket', he said. In July the European Commission proposed 'common principles for guarantees and premiums in the area of state-supported medium and long term credit insurance' with greater transparency in the geographic coverage of different EU credit policies. At the time, the Commission denied that the plan would impose 'a straitjacket on the member states and their agencies', saying it would allow assurers 'considerable leeway to diverge from the principles laid down, provided they inform the Commission and other member states'. A senior Commission official said yesterday that the plan, which still has to win approval by the Council of Ministers, emerged out of guidelines prepared by a group of national officials from the Twelve. A former head of Aerospatiale's international division, Mr David complained that Washington was mounting a 'diplomatico-commercial offensive without precedent' in support of its aerospace, military and agriculture exports. He cited a recent seven-year credit on a US wheat sale to Morocco, noting that credits were supposed to match the lifetime of a product or project, and President Bill Clinton's overt involvement in last February's Dollars 6bn worth of Boeing aircraft to Saudi Arabia. This newly aggressive policy meant that the US now accounted for 30 per cent of the world total of export credit of more than five years maturity, compared to only 15 per cent three years ago, Mr David said.</p>

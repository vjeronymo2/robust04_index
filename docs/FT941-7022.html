			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Sagging Dow unable to obtain uplift Wall Street US stocks were mixed yesterday as investors tried to shake off the lingering effects of Thursday's big sell-off, writes Frank McGurty in New York. In a break from the recent pattern, the blue chip index was the laggard. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.12 at 3,838.78, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 pushed 1.80 ahead to 466.06. NYSE volume reached 274m shares. The secondary markets showed some improvement. The American SE composite was 1.87 ahead at 467.45, while the Nasdaq composite gained 4.34 to 783.78 as technology stocks bounced back. Investors took advantage of a quiet session to adjust their positions in the wake of a 51-point drop in the Dow industrials the previous day. Bargain-hunters turned out early, lifting the bellwether index by 15 points at the opening. However, the bounce was short-lived, and share prices soon sagged in listless mid-morning trading. A firmer trend in the US Treasury market provided little positive motivation, even though plunging bond prices had contributed to the swoon in stocks on Thursday. Bell Atlantic, which triggered Thursday's rout with its decision to scuttle its proposed merger with Tele-Communications Inc, slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 . But US West was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 40 1/2 . The regional telephone group has a Dollars 2.5m stake in Time Warner's entertainment division. On the Nasdaq, TCI's A shares, which dropped Dollars 1 7/8 on the news of the merger's collapse, rebounded Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 24, after Mr John Malone, its chairman, succeeded in reassuring money managers on the company's strategic goals. Among other technology stocks hit hard the previous session, DSC Communications tacked on Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 1/4 , Antec took back Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 20 1/4 . and Cisco Systems regained Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 73 1/8 . Informix rallied Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 23 3/8 after Salomon Brothers upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'. A notable exception to the positive trend was Sybase, a software developer, which slid Dollars 3 to Dollars 43 1/8 . Mexico Equities ended a volatile session modestly higher as investors took positions and then profits in quick succession. The 36-share IPC index ended up 4.06 points or 0.16 per cent to 2,596.39. A total of 145.6m shares had traded, with advances topping declines 57 to 26. The index moved between a low of 2,566.43 and a high of 2,611.66 during the session. It closed the week down 112.83 points or 4.16 per cent. Canada Toronto stocks ended the week on a positive note, closing solidly higher in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index was up 35.11 points, or 0.81 per cent, to 4,364.23, for a loss on the week of about 14 points. Advances edged declines 385 to 365, volume of 58.69m shares was down from 68.92m. Trading value was CDollars 786.4.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme People's Court has announced its  decision on severely punishing, in accordance with the law,  criminals involved in the two major smuggling cases in Rushan  and Zhuhai cities. The two cases involved huge amounts of  smuggled goods, and the circumstances of the crimes were vile.  The first case also involved such offenses as offering and  accepting bribes and bending the law for personal gain. Among  the offenders were leading cadres of leadership bodies of party  and government and law-enforcement departments, including the  head of a commerce bureau, the political commissar of a border  subbureau, a deputy head of a border brigade, and the secretary  of a city CPC committee. Violations by those who know the law  and are themselves in charge of carrying it out are incompatible  with legal principles. Popular indignation will not be assuaged  if they are not harshly punished in accordance with the law of  the land.    The serious way in which the two major smuggling cases was  investigated and punished represents an achievement of the  anticorruption drive. At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out  explicitly: "Party members, high- and middle-ranking cadres in  particular, must heighten their awareness and set a good example  by being honest and observing discipline. As for those corrupt  elements, we must punish them in accordance with state laws and  party discipline, no matter who they are. We must not tolerate  or abet their wrongdoing." The Rushan city case was a serious  instance of providing an armed escort for smuggling, in which  the smugglers worked hand in glove with a handful of  law-enforcement personnel and local cadres who offered  assistance and who helped cover it up. The case in Zhuhai city  was one of providing an armed escort for smuggling in which the  smugglers worked in collusion with a law-enforcement official  who abused his power for personal gain. From these two cases,  we can see how rampant the crime of smuggling has become; from  the severe punishment that the offenders in the two cases  received, we can see the firm determination of the CPC Central  Committee to tackle major cases in the anticorruption drive and  the effective measures it has taken in this regard. Facts have  shown that any violation of the law, regardless of who the  perpetrator is and where it takes place, will be punished by the  law. Any violator, even those who made contributions to reform  and construction, must be prosecuted according to the law. All  citizens are equal before the law -- this is the fundamental  principle of the socialist legal system.    Smuggling is a serious economic crime that eludes the  state's  administration of international trade and that illegally rakes  in extraordinary profits. The crime of smuggling batters the  domestic market, harms the development of national industries,  obstructs normal international trade, disrupts the economic  order, corrupts social conduct, contaminates the ranks of  cadres, and tarnishes national sovereignty and dignity. For  this reason, the crime of smuggling is a major political issue  as well as a major economic issue.    The fact that the crime of smuggling has, in spite of  repeated injunctions, gone from bad to worse and even drawn in  many leading cadres and law-enforcement personnel -- as has been  amply demonstrated -- can be attributed to the mistaken  understanding of some leading cadres, to the bad practice of  protecting small-group interests in some localities and  departments, and to the widespread corruption in some government  and law-enforcement organs. Local protectionism and  departmental cover-ups have served as, intentionally or not,  "air raid shelters" or "umbrellas" for smuggling crimes. A  handful of localities or departments put local or departmental  interests above overall national interests by following the  practice of "countering a central measure with a local one" to  undermine the overall national interest. This is very wrong and  will lead to dangers if it is allowed to develop unchecked. From  the Rushan case, we can see that these offenders were not, as  they themselves claimed, "dedicated heart and soul to the public  interest" or that "no money went into their pockets." They are  rather unclean and are guilty of, in addition to smuggling, a  whole bunch of economic offenses including taking bribes. Past  experience and lessons told us that we must set strict demands  on cadres in accordance with party discipline and state laws,  educate them on keeping the cardinal principles in mind, take  the overall situation into account, and place the fundamental  interests of the state and the people above everything else.  Strictness embodies real care, while toleration will lead to  the destruction of many cadres, which would mean losses far  greater and more unfortunate than economic losses.    Some people contend as if smuggling, whether carried out  either openly or on the sly, should be tolerated in order to  develop a socialist market economy. Some localities even come  up with the ridiculous theory of "prosperity through smuggling."  They are only finding excuses for smuggling. To develop a  socialist market economy, we must have strict standards and a  sound legal system. Moreover, we must also strengthen and  improve macroeconomic regulation and control, safeguard the  uniform implementation of the decrees of the central government,  and ensure a normal order in economic operations and social  life. Every country in the world without exception strictly  bans and cracks down hard on smuggling. There has never been a  country that has established a socialist market economy and that  has accomplished an economic takeoff on the strength of  smuggling. Just think, if we allow -- in the course of reform,  opening up, and establishing a socialist market economy --  smuggling to run rampant and people to fatten themselves by  undermining the interests of the state, then who will want to  work honestly or engage in legitimate business? Which foreigner  will then want to come here to set up factories or do business?    The lesson to be learned from these two smuggling cases is  profound and thought-provoking. In the important talks he gave  when he visited the south in 1992, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:  "We should pay persistent attention to two tasks--the  continuation of reform and opening and a crackdown on various  crimes. Both tasks require tenacious efforts. The attack on  various criminal activities and the elimination of a variety of  hideous phenomena allow no leniency." As China has entered a  new phase of economic restructuring -- a phase of combining a  package of reforms with breakthroughs in key areas -- this year,  it is of great significance to properly handle the relations  between reform, development, and stability and to perform the  various tasks well. Only when we attend to the two tasks with  equally tenacious efforts will we be able to truly seize the  opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development,  and ensure stability. Only then will we be able to ensure that  the great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics will advance from victory to victory.</p>

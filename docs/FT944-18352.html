			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Sainsbury makes second US foray: Purchase of Dollars 325m stake in Giant Food sets stage for further expansion J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, is strengthening its presence in the US by taking a Dollars 325m (Pounds 205m) stake in Giant Food, the Washington DC-based supermarket chain. The deal is Sainsbury's second foray into the US, after taking control of the Shaw's supermarket chain in the north-eastern US in 1987. It gives the UK retailer a strong position on the eastern seaboard, and a trading presence in seven of the 10 wealthiest US states. Giant, the 15th-largest US food retailer, has 107 stores in the Washington DC metropolitan area, including surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia, and 42 in or around Baltimore, Maryland. It dominates these local markets - with 44 per cent of the Washington DC grocery market - and made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 151.8m last year on sales of Dollars 3.57bn. Sainsbury is acquiring 9.5m non-voting 'A' shares, giving it 16 per cent of Giant's equity, and 125,000 'AL' voting shares. It will have 50 per cent of voting rights and the right to elect three of Giant's seven board directors. The total consideration is Dollars 325m in cash, funded from borrowings and cash resources. The shares are being acquired from family members of the late Mr Jac Lehrman, co-founder of Giant. The remaining 50 per cent of voting shares are owned by the other co-founder and chairman, Mr Israel Cohen, 82. Mr Cohen has no children involved in the business, but Sainsbury would not comment on whether it had first refusal on Mr Cohen's shares in the event of his death or a decision to sell. 'This is very much a first step,' said Mr David Sainsbury, chairman. 'We will see how things develop. We regard the North American market as one of the major areas of growth for the group in the future'. Mr Cohen welcomed the deal, saying he looked forward to a 'productive relationship'. Mr Sainsbury said he had long admired Giant, founded in 1935, which had a very similar trading philosophy emphasising customer service and value for money. The company's non-voting shares are traded on the American Stock Exchange. Giant plans to expand into the surrounding states of Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where it has identified 36 possible locations. It expects to open at least six stores annually. Mr Sainsbury said this would take it into states where Shaw's was also planning to expand. He added there was much scope for joint buying between the chains and Sainsbury in the UK, and for exchange of expertise in areas such as distribution and systems. After a slow start, Sainsbury has more than doubled operating profits in Shaw's over the past seven years, through centralising distribution, introducing 'value-added' services such as pharmacies, and increasing the level of higher-margin own- label products to 25 per cent - compared with a 14 per cent average for US food retailers. Mr Sainsbury said there was scope for similar initiatives at Giant, but analysts warned that Sainsbury did not have overall control and would have to treat the US chain's existing management with sensitivity. Sainsbury is paying almost 22 times consensus prospective earnings of Dollars 1.55 per share, a small premium to the US grocery retailing sector which analysts suggested was justified by the opportunities provided by the investment. Sainsbury's shares rose 2p to 402p in a falling market. While Mr Sainsbury said the group was still examining expansion options in continental Europe, yesterday's move suggests it sees the US as offering the most attractive prospects.

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Top-end investors get tax breaks A package of incentives for private investors will give the richest plenty to smile about. Investments of up to Pounds 100,000 will enjoy tax relief of up to 60 per cent thanks to a modification of the enterprise investment scheme. New rules for venture capital investors, a widening of the scope of personal equity plans (Peps) and an extension of tax-exempt savings accounts (Tessas) are all good news for personal investors and savers. Venture capital trusts will provide income tax relief at 20 per cent and capital gains tax relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year. This will mainly apply to investments in unquoted trading companies. The chancellor said he intended the scheme to be more attractive and easier to use. It has been made considerably more appealing since the outline introduced a year ago. Gains on existing investments, which would normally attract 40 per cent capital gains tax, can be rolled over free of tax into suitable investments - such as venture capital trusts. Investors in Peps will be allowed to invest in corporate bonds, preference shares and loan stocks - as well as in equities and unit and investment trusts. Peps allow investors to put up to Pounds 6,000 a year into a general Pep and another Pounds 3,000 a year into a single company Pep free of income tax and capital gains tax. But gilts are still not approved for Peps. Holders of Tessas will be able to deposit Pounds 9,000 of the proceeds in a new tax-free account when they mature. The chancellor, however, killed one of the oldest tax-free schemes for small savers. Save-As-You Earn, which allowed a maximum monthly contribution of Pounds 20, paid tax-free interest of 8.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago del Estero, 7 Jun (NA) -- Santiago del  Estero's Pension Fund was taken over peacefully by about 300  people, including pensioners, to reject the organization's  imminent transfer to the national administration.    Daniel Cejas, president of the pensioner and retired people  coordinating board, announced that the group will resist the  government attempt to transfer the Pension Fund to the nation  "to the final results."    "The peaceful takeover that started around 0700 will  continue  until federal trustee (Juan) Schiaretti shows up to listen to  the people and pensioners," Cejas said.    On 6 June, in the largest protest demonstration since the  social outburst in December, some 3,000 people marched in front  of the federal trustee's office to repudiate the transfer of the  Pension Fund to the national administration and the Savings and  Loan Fund's reorganization.    According to the administration headed by Schiaretti, a  native of Cordoba Province, the Pension Fund runs a deficit of  about 5 million pesos per month, or 60 million pesos a year, and  needs an in-depth reorganization.    Cejas in turn denied the deficit and warned: "The people of  Santiago are mad and ready to resist this bad government. We  spoke with many ministers and all of them gave us half answers.  This is why we want to talk with Schiaretti."</p>

The Council of  Ministers also debated a bill that amends the Central Bank Law  by reducing the amount of credit the bank can extend to the  Treasury and to the public sector.    The Council of Ministers met under Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller for two and a half hours last night. After the meeting,  State Minister Aykon Dogan made a statement on the issues  discussed. He pointed out that the Council of Ministers debated  a bill drafted by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security  amending the law on civil servants unions and on their right to  sign collective wage agreements and stage strikes. He said that  the Council of Ministers decided to give the bill its final form  at the next meeting and to conclude the work on the bill.    Dogan said that the Council of Ministers also discussed a  bill that amends the Central Bank Law by reducing the amount of  short- term advance loans the bank can extend to the Treasury,  as well as the amount of credit it can extend to the public  sector. He stressed that this bill is a very serious step  toward a situation in which public financing is conducted by  secure sources outside the Central Bank. In this way, he said,  the Turkish lira will eventually become a currency that is  sought after once again.    Dogan stated that the Council of Ministers also debated  decrees aiming at increasing exports and increasing foreign  exchange revenues and opened them to signature. He explained  that the decrees invoke measures by which exports will be  supported more strongly and systematically within the general  rules of GATT and international trade.    The state minister pointed out that the Council of Ministers  also decided that the new financial sources needed by the  commercial sector will be allotted to Eximbank. With this  decision, Dogan said, exports are expected to gain a new  dynamism in the coming season.    Aykon Dogan stated that $17.5 billion are expected in export  revenues in 1994. Next year, he added, this will cover the  current accounts deficit, which is more than $5 billion this  year.    The state minister also announced that the Council of  Ministers decided to reduce the value added tax on hotel and  restaurant services in tourist installations, except for  nightclubs and bars, from 23 percent to 15 percent.</p>

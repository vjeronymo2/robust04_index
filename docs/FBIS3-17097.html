			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga report on interview with Deputy Defense </F> Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev; place and date not  given: "Russian Peacemaking Forces In Operation...."]    [Text] Information on the status of peacemaking forces was  released 22 March by the Russian Ministry of Defense.    At present, Russian troop contingents are performing  peacemaking missions in Bosnia (UN peacemaking forces),  Tajikistan (collective CIS peacemaking forces), the Dniester  Region, and South Ossetia.    In January 1994, the independent Russian infantry battalion  in Bosnia was increased to 1,200 men. The battalion is serving  in the "East" sector. The bulk of the battalion's forces are  located on the 36 checkpoints separating the forward positions  of the Serbs and Croats. For the purposes of monitoring the  cease-fire in Sarajevo, a Russian battalion unit (400 men)  completed a two-day march along mountain roads and took up  positions along the dividing line.    In the Dniester Region, Russian peacekeeping forces are  represented by four motorized infantry battalions with an  overall strength of around 1,800 men.    In South Ossetia, there is one motorized infantry battalion  numbering 523 men. Apart from this, there are around 1,000  Russian servicemen in Abkhazia.    Russian peacekeeping forces are subordinate to the Ministry  of Defense, which exercises command and control through Deputy  Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev. General Kondratyev  explains:    [Kondratyev] Peacekeeping forces are made up purely of  volunteers from among servicemen's ranks. They undergo special  training at a Russian Army training center. Personnel  participate in dividing the conflicting sides, escorting  humanitarian aid cargoes, evacuating the population from combat  zones, and blocking the flow of weapons into the conflict zones.  However, it is worth distinguishing between the terms  "peacekeeping forces" and "collective peacemaking forces" in  which we are taking part. The collective peacemaking forces  comprise the 201st Motorized Infantry Division with  reinforcements, which is stationed in Tajikistan. Not long ago,  the 27th Guards Motorized Infantry Division and the 45th Guards  Motorized Infantry Division, as well as an independent parachute  battalion, were allocated from the Russian Armed Forces to  perform peacemaking functions.    [Burbyga] What losses have been incurred by the troop  contingents performing peacemaking functions?    [Kondratyev] Unfortunately, there have been losses. In all,  we have lost 107 men, and 193 servicemen have been wounded.    As of today, five groups of Russian UN military observers  are  taking part in peacekeeping operations being performed under the  aegis of the United Nations. There are 16 men in the Near East.  That is, eight in Egypt, four in Israel, three in Syria, and one  in Lebanon, while there are 15 men on the Iran-Kuwait border, 30  men in the Western Sahara, two men in Cambodia, and 23  servicemen in Yugoslavia.    [Burbyga] What kind of funds are being earmarked to finance  these operations?    [Kondratyev] In 1992 alone, over 2.5 billion rubles [R] (at  1992 prices) were spent on financing peacekeeping operations on  former Union territory from the Defense Ministry budget, while  in 1993 this figure was over R26 billion. [Kondratyev ends]    As of 22 March, the number of dead among servicemen  performing peacemaking functions was 107, while the number of  wounded was 193.    In terms of regions, the figures break down as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |dead                     |wounded                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Former Yugoslavia        |2                        |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dniester Region          |16                       |23                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |South Ossetia            |2                        |1                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |North Ossetia, Ingushetia|28                       |60                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Abkhazia                 |6                        |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tajikistan               |53                       |77                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

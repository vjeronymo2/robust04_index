This, "because," Mario Segni argued, "they are not  government blocs or alliances capable of governing, but merely  tactical electoral groupings that are bound to fall apart  immediately after the election." However, the alliance centered  on the Pact, which has confirmed Mario Segni as its candidate  for the premiership, is "a real government alliance with  homogeneous programs and objectives."    The Pact leader recalled the major conflicts within the two  rival alignments -- within the left over government stock, NATO,  and public appointments; and within the right over virtually  everything, in view of the fact that [Northern League leader]  Bossi wants to have nothing to do with [Italian Social Movement  leader] Fini. Therefore, Segni said, "serious dangers would  ensue for the country if the others were to win: On the one  hand, there are those who cite fascism, and, on the other, those  who have remained beyond the Berlin Wall." Segni also described  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's promises to reduce taxes as  "demagogic and rash," and pointed out that Governor of the Bank  of Italy Antonio Fazio has already issued this warning: "To  promise a major reduction of tax pressure means to forget about  the problem of the public debt."    La Malfa condemned the errors committed by Berlusconi (by  allying with Fini) and Occhetto (by allying with [Communist  Renewal] Bertinotti), but argued that the dialogue remains open  with the League. Martinazzoli, however, spoke about "Bossi's  delirium."    What about them? "Either we have sufficient votes with which  to govern or we will stay out of it," Segni said, though in view  of the heavy blow dealt to his lists, he would be happy to  obtain the 4 percent necessary to accede to the 25 percent  proportional quota. But, he said, if there is no majority, the  country will be in trouble. He therefore agrees with the  desirability of a constituent government ("as long as it does  not include the fascists," Amato added). He is also in favor of  a second electoral round, "which would facilitate governability  and encourage alliances." Martinazzoli commented: "We would  already have achieved this, had it not been for the opposition  from Occhetto, who had to pay heed to [Communist Renaissance  leader] Cossutta and [Rete leader] Orlando on alternate days."  Looking at the postelection situation, the PPI secretary, while  recognizing Ciampi's merits, would prefer a government "more  consistent with the philosophy of a parliamentary republic,"  because, he explained, "a country would have to pay for the  eclipse of politics."    The Pact for Italy's program was also presented at the press  conference. It contains five main points: a major reduction of  unemployment, the reform of public finance, the completion of  the institutional reform, the creation of social institutions  based more on solidarity than on bureaucracy, and a foreign  policy that espouses the Western ideals of freedom and democracy  with a view to countering the resurgent specter of ethnic,  racial, and religious hatred.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour revolt ends Iraq consensus THE opposition among some Labour MPs to the allied attacks on Iraq turned into open revolt last night, breaking the broad consensus between the main political parties. Mr Tony Benn, a former Labour cabinet minister, led 21 opposition MPs in voting against the government at the end of the first full Westminster debate on Iraq since the recent incidents. Labour's official position was to support ministers in upholding United Nations authority, and the government won the vote by 156-21. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, acknowledged the unease that had been expressed by some Labour MPs and by Sir Edward Heath, a former Tory prime minister, about the purpose of the allied intervention. He said that the allies' objectives were clear within the United Nations charter and had been put at risk by Iraq's actions: the coalition aimed to maintain the integrity of Kuwait; eliminate the threat from nuclear and chemical weapons; and deter attacks on Shias and Kurds in Iraq. Mr Hurd expressed disappointment that the Gulf states had made so little progress in organising the defence of the region since the Gulf war, but insisted that the extent of UK involvement was reasonable. Some of those now voicing misgivings about the allied attacks would, he added, have voiced far larger ones had the coalition not responded to the Iraqi provocation. Sir Edward argued that the defence of Kuwait should be a matter for the Arab league since there were no direct British interests there, and expressed vehement opposition to any prospect of UK ground troops being deployed in Kuwait. He warned that the actions of the coalition had strengthened Saddam Hussein and served to alienate other parts of the Arab world. He also joined the Labour front bench in urging that the United Nations should be given a greater role in seeking a way forward in dealing with Iraq. MPs unhappy with the coalition action also highlighted Sunday's cruise-missile attack on Baghdad, in which the al-Rashid hotel was hit; the allies' apparent expectation that they could remove Saddam Hussein; and the failure to act evenhandedly in support of UN resolutions other than those applying to Iraq. Responding to Labour pressure for the government to help resolve the UN's underfunding, Mr Hurd said that the UN did not have the finance or support for the task it was taking on, especially since it had begun to get involved in matters within an individual country as well as between countries. Its future role would be a serious question for peace-keeping in the world.</p>

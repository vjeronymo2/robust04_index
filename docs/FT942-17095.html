			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Greek inflation falls to 10.2%: Economic Watch Greek consumer price inflation fell to 10.2 per cent year-on-year in March from 11 per cent in February. In March the consumer price index rose by 2.9 per cent against February because of sharp rises in clothing, footwear, consumer durables and household goods after the winter sales. East German industrial orders rose 14.8 per cent in December and January against the same period a year ago, suggesting that recovery in the five eastern Lander is gathering pace. Orders for investment goods rose 10.1 per cent in the period, while consumer goods orders rose 24.1 per cent. Foreign orders fell 20.6 per cent, mainly because of a drop in Soviet orders. Belgium's budget deficit in the first quarter was BFr274.2bn (Pounds 5.3bn), up from BFr327.9bn a year earlier. The deficit narrowed by BFr52bn between the first quarter of 1994 and 1993.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Train attack Gunmen thought to be Moslem militants attacked a train in southern Egypt on Saturday night, the first such assault in more than a month. They opened fire on a sleeper travelling from Aswan to Cairo but no one was injured, security sources said. The attack took place near the town of Abu Tig, on the Nile 340 km south of Cairo, at about midnight. Eight trains have been attacked in roughly the same area this year. The attacks have had a devastating effect on the tourist industry.</p>

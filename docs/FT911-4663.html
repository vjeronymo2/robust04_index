			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses reflect New York and international liquidity THE CONTINENT was encouraged by Wall Street's overnight performance, and high levels of liquidity among international investors, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS ignored poor company results and, thanks to Wall Street, the CAC 40 index finished up 26.54 or 1.5 per cent at 1,829.45. Thomson-CSF added FFr6 to FFr152. Late on Tuesday the defence electronics company reported a fall in 1990 profits but held the dividend. Michelin, the tyre maker, put on FFr1.40 to FFr89.60 in spite of loss last year and warnings of further losses in 1991. Peugeot, with earnings scheduled for release early today, rose FFr2 to FFr538. In the retail sector, Nouvelles Galeries fell FFr79 or 8.9 per cent to FFr801 with a small 2,200 shares traded after news that the Swedish company Proventus sold its 25 per cent stake to Galeries Lafayette and CCF, the bank, defusing speculation of a possible takeover bid. Galeries Lafayette, which now has a stake of 38.39 per cent in Nouvelles Galeries, lost FFr35 to FFr1,730. FRANKFURT climbed to its highest levels so far this year, the FAZ index peaking 5.62 higher at 686.01 and the DAX hitting a new 1991 high of 1,623.83, up 20.47. Volume climbed again, from DM6.5bn to DM8.2bn. Daimler led the market up, putting on DM17.50 to DM704.50 on the German motor industry's relatively strong performance, and on the excellent sales of its new 'S' series, said Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. Chemicals rose further on yield considerations, with BASF up DM3.90 to DM250.90 ahead of today's supervisory board meeting, at which the dividend will be decided. In pharmaceuticals, Altana rose DM20.50 to DM573 on higher profits and dividend. Special situations saw Continental up another DM8.50 to DM233; observers suspected more Italian buying of the Pirelli target. PWA reflected good prospects for the world paper industry with a DM9 rise to DM274. Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the construction group, came late in the day with a two-for-eleven rights issue at DM500 day, leaving the shares, DM3.50 higher at DM897. Funds raised would be used to finance its expansion in eastern Germany. AMSTERDAM recouped Tuesday's losses with Wall Street and some positive company statements boosting sentiment. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 97.3, just below the day's high of 97.4. In the paper sector, KNP put on Fl 2.70 or 5.0 per cent to Fl 56.40 after the company forecast a rise in first half 1991 net profit. Buehrmann Tetterode, which has some joint ventures with KNP, put on Fl 2.50 or 4.2 per cent to Fl 62. Wolters Kluwer, the publisher closed Fl 2.10 or 3.8 per cent higher at Fl 56.50 after saying that it expected 1991 net profit to rise at least 15 per cent and that it was negotiating to buy a major European legal publisher. MILAN was led higher by banks and insurers on the first day of the May trading account. The Comit index rose 7.25 to 594.91. Generali gained L440 or 1.2 per cent to L37,340 on persistent rumours that it planned to buy Toro from Fiat and in spite of a denial from Fiat. Toro jumped L445 or 1.7 per cent to L27,155. Demand for banks focused on three state-controlled institutions. Banco di Roma, soon to be merged with Banco Santo Spirito, climbed L58 to L2,733 and Credito Italiano put on L36 to L2,606. Banca Commerciale rose L50 to L94,730. BRUSSELS featured Societe Generale de Belgique, which jumped BFr100 or 4.5 per cent to BFr2,340. It announced a divestment programme, and sharply lower profits on Tuesday. The Bel20 share index rose 2.75 to 1,212.15. VIENNA saw trading boosted by the surprise anouncement that magnesite producer Radex had bought a majority stake in Veitscher, the other main Austrian producer. But the index eased 1.1 from its third successive high for the year to 594.95 as Radex and Veitscher each slipped Sch45, to Sch925 and Sch810 respectively. COPENHAGEN was restrained by losses at Hafnia, the insurer and a rights issue at Sophus Berendsen which controls the London-listed Rentokil. Hafnia 'B' shares fell DKr20.50 to DKr509.50 and Baltica, in which Hafnia has a 30 per cent equity stake, by DKr20 to DKr740. Berendsen lost DKr20 to DKr1,480 but the CSE index, reflecting management changes in the AP Moller shipping group, still managed to close 1.07 higher at 350.93. STOCKHOLM ended lower on news that new orders dropped 11 per cent in February. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 3.8 to 1089.1. OSLO was lifted by higher oil prices. The all-share index climbed 7.02 to 482.11 in turnover worth NKr272m.

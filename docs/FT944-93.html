			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Flat year for house prices forecast by lenders House prices will not recover significantly in 1995 because of government plans to restrict mortgage interest payments for those on income support, the Council of Mortgage Lenders says today. In a gloomy forecast for next year, the council says measures in the Budget last month to cut help for unemployed home-owners have introduced 'a new uncertainty and nervousness' into the market. By the end of 1995, it expects house prices to be just 2 per cent higher than now. It anticipates house sales will rise by less than 5 per cent to 1.325m in 1995 compared with about 1.28m this year. However, net new lending for homes next year is expected to reach Pounds 22bn - an increase of about 13 per cent on estimates for this year. The importance of the mortgage benefit cuts, to be implemented from the start of next October, is that they will probably mean lenders will be more cautious about taking on new business. Potential borrowers may also be deterred by the restrictions: they include reduced benefits for new claimants with mortgages, and no mortgage interest entitlement for the first nine months of a claim for new claimants who have taken out loans after the start of next October. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies and other lenders, is more optimistic about the prospects for 1996, however. It believes that once the impact of the mortgage benefit changes has been absorbed, more positive underlying factors such as rising real incomes and stable interest rates will come to the fore. It forecasts that base rates will be 7.5 per cent by the end of 1995 compared with 6.25 per cent today. The uncertainties that would come from another flat year like 1994 for the housing market, as the council predicts, were highlighted yesterday in figures for monthly mortgage lending by the larger British banks. These showed that new lending in November was slightly higher than in October, but still less than in November last year. New gross lending totalled Pounds 1.67bn (increased by the inclusion of Pounds 100m of mortgages transferred from a non-bank source) in November, compared with Pounds 1.54bn in October and Pounds 1.59bn in November last year. New net lending last month was Pounds 736m, compared with Pounds 576m the previous month and Pounds 819m in the equivalent month in 1993. New loans approved but not yet undertaken slipped to a value of Pounds 1.47bn compared with Pounds 1.42bn in October.</p>

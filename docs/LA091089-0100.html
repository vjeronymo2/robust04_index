			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A parliamentary commission unexpectedly rejected two Cabinet members proposed  by Poland's new prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki. The agriculture commission  turned down Czeslaw Janicki, of the United Peasants' Party, as a deputy prime  minister and minister for agriculture, and Rural Solidarity activist Artur  Balazs as minister without portfolio for agricultural development. Sources said  the commission saw no reason to create what is a new post for Balazs to work  alongside the Agriculture Ministry. Concerning the rejection of Janicki, the  PAP news agency said that at least one commission member found Janicki's  answers to questions too general. The commission's decision is not binding.  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Apollo makes Pounds 4.9m placing as build-up costs hit profits APOLLO METALS, the USM-quoted aluminium processor and distributor, plans to move up to a listing with a Pounds 4.87m placing and open offer to repay bank borrowings and invest in growth. It has also reported, as expected, a fall in first half ended March 31 pre-tax profits from Pounds 711,000 to Pounds 588,000. It was hit by the cost of building up its new French and German operations. Stockbrokers Griffiths and Lamb have conditionally placed 5.22m shares, and are offering them at 101p on the basis of 2-for-5 ordinary or 2.76-for-5 preference shares. The ordinary closed down 2p at 111p. The directors will not take up any new shares. Placing proceeds will reduce bank borrowing to minimal levels from Pounds 5.45m now, representing gearing of more than 50 per cent. Mr Albert Hargreaves, chairman, said the company hoped for mainly organic growth: 'We will be sticking to the knitting.' Turnover for the six months rose to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 12m) helped by international sales more than trebled to Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 1.21m). Loss-making German operations, which started trading in early 1992, contributed sales of Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 529,000); break-even is expected by December. It hopes to repeat the sales pattern of the UK, up slightly at Pounds 10.8m, where during the downturn some buyers have found Apollo's just-in-time supplies of processed aluminium more attractive. The five-strong French sales team, operational from the end of 1991, contributed turnover of Pounds 496,000 (Pounds 128,000) and is almost breaking even. Exports elsewhere rose to Pounds 1.84m (Pounds 549,000). Orders for aerospace products were down, accounting for a third of turnover. Long-term orders were worth a quarter of sales. Operating costs increased to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 11.2m) reflecting capital spending of Pounds 1.6m mainly in Germany and a Pounds 500,000 purchase of materials processing equipment. Net interest payments were Pounds 183,000 (Pounds 58,000). The interim dividend is stepped up to 1.2p (1.15p) out of earnings per share of 3p (3.5p).</p>

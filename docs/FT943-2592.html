			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / China seeks foreign funds for petrochemicals boost China plans investment of Yn100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) in its outdated petrochemical sector by the year 2000, with a big chunk of the funds coming from abroad, including equity participation. Mr Li Yizhong, vice president of the China Petrochemical Corporation, promised an aggressive approach to capital raising on world markets to overcome one of the acknowledged weak spots of the Chinese economy. 'It's apparent that we should resort to international capital markets other than just rely on domestic funds to achieve our goals. . . utilising foreign capital, especially direct investment, would be our long-term strategy,' Mr Li told the Business Weekly newspaper. He said that before 2000 China would give priority to revamping and expanding existing facilities, especially those in coastal regions accessible to crude oil imports. Sino-foreign joint venture refineries would be allowed to sell part of their product in the domestic market, Mr Li said. China is negotiating investment deals with several big oil producers and refiners, including Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state oil company, for the establishment of joint venture refineries. China's need for additional refining capacity is underscored by the fact that with 20 per cent of the world's population, it has just 3.7 per cent of world capacity for crude oil processing. It last year became a net importer of crude oil, and demand for refined products is continuing to grow rapidly, in line with explosive economic growth. In 1993, China exported 3.38m tonnes of product, but imported 12.8m tonnes. Crude imports reached 15.65m tonnes. Total output of crude last year was 143.7m tonnes from both onshore and offshore fields, but China is struggling to maintain these production levels. Beijing earlier this year clamped down on crude oil imports in an effort to bring order to a chaotic local market, but Mr Li predicted that imports would rebound next year. Buoyant demand would last for a long time to come, he said.</p>

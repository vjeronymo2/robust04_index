			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan oil group's US unit plans Dollars 1bn issue THE US subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, Venezuela's state-owned oil company, is planning an offering of Dollars 1bn of bonds in the public US market. A registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission covers the issue of Dollars 1bn of senior notes by PDV America. This consists of Dollars 250m each with five and seven-year maturities and Dollars 500m of bonds with a 10-year maturity. Salomon Brothers is managing the issue, which is guaranteed by the Venezuelan parent and Propernyn, a Dutch subsidiary which holds the parent's European, Caribbean and US assets, including PDV America. PDV America is the holding company of Citgo Petroleum and the Venezuelans' 50 per cent stake in Uno-Ven, a joint venture with Unocal. As the state oil company is widely seen as well-managed, and since the borrower is a US entity with significant assets in the US, it may be regarded by some investors as a better credit risk than the Republic of Venezuela. Petroleos de Venezuela's total foreign debt at the end of May was Dollars 4.07bn, newspapers in Caracas reported yesterday. Despite a 15-month political crisis in Venezuela, Venezuelan borrowers have been been fairly active in international capital markets this year, following a period last year in which market access for Venezuelan borrowers was closed. There have been six international bond issues this year - four in the name of the republic and two in D-Marks  - totalling Dollars 530m. The parent was borrowing earlier this year in the domestic debt market in Venezuela, where real interest rates are very high. The government, heavily behind in payments on its domestic commitments, hopes the withdrawal of the oil company from the domestic market will create a space for it to borrow to fund its deficit.</p>

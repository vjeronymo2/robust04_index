			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, June 13 (AFP) -- UN troops in the eastern  town of Gorazde intervened Monday to avert a clash between 100  Moslem refugees trying to return to their homes and armed Serbs  determined to stop them, a UN official said. Around 100 Moslem  civilians had crossed to the east bank of the Drina River and  were preparing to march on their homes within a UN- designated  three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone when 15 armed Serb  civilians appeared within the zone, Commander Eric Chaperon said.    A UN peacekeeping patrol intervened rapidly and sent both  groups back to their respective zones, Chaperon said. The  incident "was settled peacefully, but the problem remains and so  could happen again," he said.    Gorazde, designated a "safe area," is home to thousands of  refugees who were forced out of their homes and villages in the  region in the early stages of the war in 1992. The exclusion  zone is off limits to Serb military forces. A truce negotiated  last week in Geneva came into effect at midday Friday and is  generally holding, according to UN spokesmen.    The planned four-week ceasefire was violated a number of  times over the weekend. The latest incident was an attack  Sunday by Bosnian Serbs on a British UN patrol comprising two  armoured personnel carriers on a frontline near the northern  town of Maglaj. There were no casualties in the incident in  which 30 machinegun bullets hit one of the the vehicles. The  British troops fired back with 80 rounds before withdrawing a  short distance.    General Michael Rose, chief of UN forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, said meanwhile that he was generally  encouraged by the decrease in fighting, since "nothing stops  immediately." He said he had visited some of the most sensitive  frontline areas Sunday and found that things were "fairly quiet."</p>

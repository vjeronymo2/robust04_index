			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help AAH advance 13% to Pounds 42m Acquisitions and a buoyant drugs market helped AAH, the pharmaceuticals distribution group, increase pre-tax profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 42m in the year to March 31. The outcome, struck on sales ahead 14 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn, were also helped by a net Pounds 2m exceptional gain arising from the disposal of the builders' supplies division. The Pounds 7.1m profit on disposal was reduced by a Pounds 5m charge for rationalising the wholesale drugs business. Mr Bill Revell, chief executive, said 1993-94 had been a difficult year in spite of the 4 per cent increase in the overall prescription market. The healthcare division had faced tough competition and an increasing government squeeze on prescription drug prices. Delays in accrediting AAH's computer systems programme for local doctors had also hit profits. The group had taken steps to improve the efficiency of wholesaling, including reducing distribution outlets and upgrading technology. This programme would be accelerated in the current year, Mr Revell said, and paid for with the Pounds 5m restructuring charge. Operating profits were ahead 13 per cent in the UK wholesaling division to Pounds 24.8m. Net margins improved by 0.2 points to 2.3 per cent. Cahill May Roberts, the Irish drugs distribution business, contributed Pounds 3.9m in operating profits, against Pounds 1.7m last time, in its first full year with AAH. AAH expanded its retail pharmacy business with the acquisition of 77 outlets for Pounds 27m. Operating profits were up 30 per cent at Pounds 7.3m on sales almost doubled from Pounds 58.9m to Pounds 104.6m. Mr Revell said AAH intended to focus on the growing over-the-counter market, in spite of competition from supermarkets and drug store chains. The proposed final dividend was 11.9p for a total 3.5 per cent higher at 17.9p. Earnings per share were up 6 per cent to 34.8p. After adjusting for the exceptional items, earning fell by 5 per cent to 31.1p. COMMENT This was a year of continuing disappointments for AAH, leading to downward revisions in profits forecasts as the year progressed. AAH met expectations in the end, but investors are likely to remain wary until the latest actions begin to bear fruit. In its favour is the growing demand for drugs and AAH's market position. Forecasts are for Pounds 45.5m. The shares, which fell 10p to 449p on the results, are trading on a prospective p/e of about 13 times. AAH appears to be undervalued, but it is too early to say much more.</p>

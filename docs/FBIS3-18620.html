The committee has for long been the desire of the UUP  [Ulster  Unionist Party] leader, James Molyneaux, who believes it will  further enmesh the North into the British state.    Mr McGrady said it would run contrary to the inter-party  talks process which was based on the "nothing is agreed until  everything is agreed" principle.    The setting up of the committee would be "part of the  Major/Molyneaux" deal -- a deal which Mr Molyneaux has denied  even existed, said Mr McGrady.    "The committee would not contribute to solving any of the  political, economic or social problems facing the North. It  would simply facilitate the continuing of a sterile political  stalemate," he said.    Nationalists now represent between 40 percent and 45 percent  of the electorate and the proposal did not reflect  proportionality or fairness, he said.    His party wanted the inter-party talks to recommence to  address all the relationships which exist between the islands of  Britain and Ireland.</p>

Other CIS Republics in Line for Same  Treatment"]    [Text] Ashgabat -- "On 22 February we are cutting off gas  supplies to Ukraine," Turkmen President S. Niyazov announced at  an extraordinary session of the Cabinet of Ministers. "We  acknowledge that this is an extreme measure which was not part  of the government's plan; the government tried to settle the  problem by all the channels available to it. But in the end  Turkmenistan's compromise steps did not find due support from  the Ukrainian side -- which is only to be regretted."    Let me remind readers that a month ago, replying to a  proposal by the leaders of the "Turkmengaz" corporation to shut  off the valves on the gas pipeline in response to Ukraine's  systematic refusal to pay for gas and its violations of the  agreements it had signed, Saparmurad Niyazov stated: "I agree  that as a result of late payments for gas supply by our CIS  partners, the Turkmen economy is experiencing considerable  hardship. But, however difficult things might be for us, we  cannot fail to take account of far more serious problems in the  states concerned, and we are therefore willing to compromise...."    Today the treasury in Ashgabat is owed some $1.5 billion in  debts from last year and this year. According to expert  opinion, this is seriously undermining the state's balance of  payments and the convertibility of the national currency.    Take Ukraine, whose debts for Turkmen gas amounted to $700  million last year and grew by just over another $150 million  during January and the first 20 days of February. On dozens of  occasions the Turkmen side has warned, requested, and tried to  cajole the Ukrainian leadership to settle up at least partially,  if not in dollars then at least in commodities. The reply was  as follows: If you shut off the valves on the gas pipeline, we  will obtain our gas unilaterally from the "Russia-Europe" gas  export pipeline, thus depriving you of foreign currency for  export deliveries of fuel....    For some time now Turkmenistan's chronic debtors have  included Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and  Georgia; their negotiated limits expire any day now, and  consequently gas supplies to these states could also be cut off.    Partners' lack of obligingness and their failure to pay for  gas are hitting the Turkmen economy hard, impacting first and  foremost on people's welfare. Crazy prices for goods and food  and an occasional lack of everyday staples, coupled with an  inability on the government's part to double or triple the  population's pay -- which it promised to do on several occasions  last year -- are the consequences of the debt problems.    Naturally, as R. Robinson, IMF permanent representative in  Turkmenistan, stated, Turkmenistan will find a way out of the  situation that has developed, but in order to do this it must  not only work extremely hard in the budget, financial, and  taxation spheres but also tighten its purse strings....</p>

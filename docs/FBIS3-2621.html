			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] China is heading for a deficit of nearly 70 billion  yuan (HK$62.16 billion) this year, according to the budget  speech that Finance Minister Liu Zhongli will deliver to the  National People's Congress tomorrow. The Budget will paint a  grim, if realistic, picture of the financial state of the  country.    Sources who read a copy of Mr Liu's speech last night said  the Finance Minister had predicted a slowdown in the growth of  revenue and a surge of expenditure this year, leading to a  gargantuan shortfall.    Total expenditure in 1994 is projected at 542.9 billion  yuan,  up by 15 percent from last year. The central treasury is  forecast to receive a total of 475.9 billion yuan of revenue  this year, representing a 7.7 percent increase over the previous  year.    This results in a budgetary shortfall of 67 billion yuan. By  contrast, the budget deficit for 1993 was 20.5 billion yuan.  However, Mr Liu said the accounting system this year had been  changed to bring the Budget more in line with international  practice.    Chinese economists said last night that the change had made  it difficult to gauge the true extent of the difference between  the deficits. They pointed out that if the new accounting  system had been used last year, the deficit would have been much  higher than 20.5 billion yuan.    Mr Liu said that the increase of revenue for 1994 would be  "restrained" by the fact that the "revenue base" last year was  already considerable and that room for expansion was limited.  Tax exemption to be given to the ailing state industrial sector  would mean a cut of income of 14 billion yuan, he said. Mr Liu  also said the total size of domestic and foreign debts would  reach a staggering 129.2 billion yuan this year, up by 39.3  billion yuan from 1993.    Allocations for agriculture would be boosted to 37.8 billion  yuan, which translated into a dramatic growth of 17.4 percent  over the previous year. Agrarian-related expenditure include  the setting up of a risk fund, increased investments for the  rural sector in general, and measures to guarantee an increase  for the income of farmers of at least five percent a year.    Science, technology culture, and education will get an  increase of funds from 18 to 20 percent in the face of frantic  lobbying from these sectors.    On the expenditure plan for 1994, a staggering 187.4 billion  yuan has been set aside for providing funds to regions. It is  understood that these cover tax returns to regions under the new  tax reform programme.    Nonproduction type of infrastructure is estimated to cost  the  central treasury a total of 12 billion yuan.    Expenditure on social development will reach 19.4 billion  yuan.    A total of 62.3 billion yuan will be spent under a category  called "construction of the Government and regime." It is not  known whether that also covers defence expenditure.    The central treasury is to spend a total of 13.1 billion  yuan  on price subsidies.    According to the Budget, the actual revenue in 1993 stood at  511.4 billion yuan, up by 23.2 percent.    The actual total expenditure last year was 531.8 billion  yuan, representing an increase of 21.2 percent.    Total expenditure on defence in 1993 was 43.2 billion yuan,  slightly higher than the estimate of 42.5 billion yuan in last  year's budget. The Budget attributes the increase of  expenditure to funds for money-losing enterprises, wages  doubling from an estimated four billion yuan to eight billion.    The Finance Minister revealed that the financial situation  both at the central and region levels had been so severe that  some regions had met difficulty in paying wages for workers.  Describing the financial situation as "severe" and "tough," Mr  Liu said the tight situation would be aggravated further by  factors such as the high-level investment in fixed-assets,  increased procurement prices for grain, and higher expenditure  on wages for civil servants.    Mr Liu has laid down the major tasks for this year as:  Tightening control on expenditure, strengthening macrolevel  adjustment and control, cutting expenditure by governments of  all levels; increasing funding for education, agriculture and  infrastructure development; and limiting the money supply. The  Finance Minister also indicated that funds for national defence  and the law-and-order establishment would be "assured."  Analysts expect the defence budget to go up on a par with the  13 per cent increase granted to the People's Liberation Army  last year.    In his 25-page report, Mr Liu insisted that drastic fiscal  reform in the past two months had proven "correct" with no major  problems resulting. But he would call on legislators not to  relax their fiscal prudence because there was always discrepancy  between the targets laid down in the policy and the reality.  "This is inevitable," Mr Liu said.    He urged regions to coordinate their interests and keep a  constant watch on the implementation of tax reform. Any  problems should be nipped in the bud before they get worse, he  said.    Regions were warned to take the "overall national interest"  above their own and not to make their own local regulations on  taxes and other financial matters. Mr Liu will also urge  delegates to strictly follow the Budget, adding any local level  budget deficits "will not be acceptable." The battle against  malpractices in taxation such as evasion and avoidance should  continue unabated he said.    Localities will also be asked to ensure the smooth issuing  of  government bonds. Under the new budget, the central government  is to curb expenditure while ensuring adequate funds for  essential capital projects.</p>

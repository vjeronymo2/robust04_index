			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Bosnian UN Ambassador </F> Muhamed Sacirbey at UN Headquarters in New York on 18 February  by Itay Engel -- recorded; Sacirbey speaks in English]    [Text] [Engel] Is there room for optimism with regard to  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? We sought to clarify and  elaborate on this matter with Bosnian UN Ambassador Muhamed  Sacirbey. On the phone from New York this morning, we first  asked him to tell us how he perceives and interprets Bosnian  Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's evidently dramatic declaration  that the war has come to an end.    [Sacirbey] These are the words of a man, of course, who has  lied in the past and who has misrepresented the situation in the  past. So, we will wait for his deeds rather than for his words.    [Engel] Sacirbey emphasized that he was not thrilled by the  idea of deploying Russian troops on the hills surrounding  Sarajevo, even if this results in a Serbian retreat.    [Sacirbey] As we know right now, there is growing Russian  nationalism that now is gaining its expression through the  Serbian fascism. We certainly do not welcome the presence of  Russian troops overlooking the hills of Sarajevo. We were not  consulted on this matter, and we should not accept it.  Certainly, this would be akin to an invasion for us.    [Engel] At this point, Sacirbey quite skeptically referred  to another positive development in Sarajevo over the past 24  hours: the surrender of Serbian weapons to UN troops.    [Sacirbey] While, in fact, the heavy weapons, at least some  of them, may be withdrawn or placed under the control of the  United Nations -- the Serbian heavy weapons -- it is important  that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted. And as long as the  Serbians continue to control the communications, the  transportation lines in and out of Sarajevo, as long as they  continue to control the electricity, the water, then I do not  believe the siege is lifted.    [Engel] Finally, in view of his interpretation of the events  and two days before the deadline on the ultimatum to end the  Serbian siege of Sarajevo, we asked the Bosnian UN ambassador  whether he believes air strikes by NATO troops are still the  right thing to do.    [Sacirbey] Well, of course, we need to see if the heavy  weapons are withdrawn, but it's my opinion that there are too  many elements that are opposed to the air strikes at any cost  and that the air strikes, I think, are sought to be avoided by  any means, including the means of defining withdrawal and  control of Serbian heavy weapons in such a way that it's so  permissive that the Serbians....    [Engel] Sacirbey went on to say that some people are so  convinced that such air strikes should be avoided at any cost  that they are even persuading themselves that the Serbians are  handing in their weapons to the United Nations and,  consequently, are meeting the conditions imposed by the United  Nations in a way that obviates the need for air strikes.  Sacirbey said: I only hope that NATO and the West make sure  that their demands are met in the field in an objective and  genuine manner which at least coincides with the way I interpret  terms such as cease-fire and withdrawal.</p>

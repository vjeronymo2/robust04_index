			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA does not agree with this argument. The EPA believes the argument depends both on inferring the presence of the word ``all'' in section 112(d)(3)(A), and (as discussed above) on ignoring, or incorrectly construing, the meaning of the word ``average.'' Section 112(d)(3)(A) simply does not say ``the emission limitation achieved by all sources within the best performing 12 percent*&blank;*&blank;*''. Congress' use of the words ``achieved by'' cannot reasonably be stretched to accomplish such a rewriting of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arguments Concerning Structure of the Statute.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters argued that elements of the statute's structure support the Lower Floor Interpretation. For example, some commenters argued that the Lower Floor Interpretation best reflects EPA's authority to consider cost and other factors in setting standards more stringent than MACT Floor. Other commenters argued that the Lower Floor Interpretation best reflects the distinction between existing source MACT and new source MACT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA does not agree with these arguments. In fact, the Higher Floor Interpretation fully preserves both of these structural elements of the statute. With the Higher Floor Interpretation, just as with the Lower, EPA still has authority to establish existing source standards more stringent than the Floor based on enumerated criteria. With the Higher Floor Interpretation, just as with the Lower, there is still a distinction between the Floor for existing sources and the level of control required for new sources. (Under section 112(d)(3), standards for new sources must be at least as stringent as ``the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source''). The fact that there may be ``less distance'' to travel above the Floor with the Higher Floor Interpretation does not establish an inconsistency between that interpretation and other parts of the statute, nor does it mean that the interpretation is flawed in any way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, structural arguments tend to favor the Higher Floor Interpretation more strongly than the Lower. Section 112 was passed in its current form to ensure quick and dramatic reductions in air toxics emissions. Congress was frustrated with the slow pace of toxics control prior to 1990, and many members in part blamed EPA for weak controls. See, e.g., H. Comm. Rep. 101&hyph;490 at 150&hyph;54, 322&hyph;23; S. Rpt. 101&hyph;228 at 128&hyph;33. The structure and purpose of section 112 as a whole indicates that section 112(d)(3)(A) was intended to establish a stringent minimum level of control for hazardous air pollutants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional Arguments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters argued that the Higher Floor Interpretation would require EPA to set MACT Floors that failed to correspond to real-world control technologies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA does not agree with this argument. The EPA believes that the argument depends upon a flawed premise: That the word ``average'' can only mean ``arithmetic mean.'' In fact, there are a number of conventional methods for determining the average of a data set, including the median. Congress did not mandate a particular method of determining ``average'' or central tendency in section 112(d)(3)(A), and the choice of methodology_whether median, mean, or some other measure_can often change the results markedly. For example, if the five facilities that make up the top 12 percent of a source category are achieving reductions equal to 99 percent, 98 percent, 95 percent, 94 percent and 93 percent, EPA need not set the MACT Floor equal to the arithmetic mean of these values, which is 95.8 percent. Using the Higher Floor Interpretation, EPA could set the MACT Floor equal the median of these values, which is 95 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This discussion responds to the most significant comments on legal issues received in response to the March 9, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document. Other comments on legal issues are addressed in item number VI&hyph;B&hyph;61 in docket A&hyph;90&hyph;19. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA believes that Congress spoke with clarity in section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act. That provision_requiring standards to be no less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources''_lends little support for an interpretation under which standards might be set at the emission limitation achieved by the worst performing member of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources. The legislative history offers no support for such an interpretation, and indeed points strongly in the opposite direction. The EPA believes that the Higher Floor Interpretation represents the best reading of the statutory language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discretion in Setting Floors for MACT Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In today's notice, EPA announces its conclusion that Congress intended the Higher Floor Interpretation. The effect of this decision, however, is not to identify any particular number (e.g. the 94th percentile) as the Floor for all MACT standards. EPA retains discretion in important respects in setting Floors for MACT standards, and intends to exercise its discretion, within the statutory framework, to promulgate MACT standards that best serve the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

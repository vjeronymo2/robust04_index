			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] Editorial Urges Policy Coordination To  Prevent Repeated U.S. Interest Hikes    Hikes in U.S. interest rates have adversely impacted upon  world currency and capital markets. The modification of  financial policy on the part of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board  (FRB) was a logical measure to prevent an overheating of the  economy and to correct the bubble phenomenon, but, as financial  markets become globalized and increasingly affected by  computerization, the aftereffects are of an unexpected  magnitude. Since the world economy as a whole is just nearing  signs of a recovery, the advanced nations face the need to seek  policy coordination to prevent a chain of hikes in U.S. interest  rates.    In response to the combined 0.5-percent hike in the federal  funds (FF)--which influence short-term market rates--in two  stages by the FRB, 30-year government bonds, which serve as an  index for long-term U.S. interest rates, temporarily rose to 7.4  percent. The hike in U.S. interest rates has caused New York  Stock Exchange indices to drop 10 percent from their recent  peaks. Turmoil in U.S. securities markets has adversely impacted  not only markets of advanced nations such as Japan and Europe,  but newly emerging markets found in Asia, Central and South  America, the former East European nations and Africa to which  large sums of U.S. capital were flowing. [passage omitted]    The fact that changes in policy in the United States had a  worldwide ripple effect attests to the fact that national  barriers no longer exist in terms of the flow of capital.  Moreover, the computer dependence of markets has had a tendency  to amplify fluctuations. Such circumstances make it almost  impossible for monetary authorities of the various nations to  intervene and shield their markets from the effects of rising  U.S. interest rates.    The problem is that the effects of those policy changes have  impacted on the Japanese and German economies which hold the key  to future worldwide economic recovery. Now that there is the  fear that foreign capital once flowing into Germany will flow  out of that country, there is the possibility that the German  Federal Bank will hesitate to continue with its policy of easing  restrictions on the money markets. The situation in Germany  could very well serve to shackle monetary easing policies of the  other European continental nations. Rising long-term interest  rates are a headache for Japan, too, where it appears that the  economy is ready to bounce off from the bottom of the cycle.    The seven advanced nations (G-7) have no choice but to  reconstitute their efforts at policy coordination. Lurking under  the surface relative to the current monetary turmoil is the huge  recurring U.S. international balance of payments deficit.  Reducing the international balance of payments deficit will  require the Clinton administration to cut federal government  deficit spending and encourage a reversal in the savings rates  which has fallen to 4 percent of earnings.    Japan must clearly enunciate tax reform primarily  encompassing an income tax cut and a future hike in consumption  tax. If government deficits should rise in an uncontrolled  manner, the pressure on long-term interest rates will rise. We  must also launch a market-opening plan of substance as a means  to overcome Japan-U.S. economic friction which can become the  cause for securities market turmoil.    Unfavorable news impacting on securities markets such as  President and Mrs. Clintons' Whitewater scandal, Prime Minister  Hosokawa's resignation and tension in the Korean peninsula are  intensifying. Political factors coming into play just as world  economic tides are about to change make securities markets more  susceptible to chain reactions. This is the very reason why  there is a need for renewed coordination by monetary authorities  at the G-7 Finance Ministers Meeting scheduled for the end of  June.</p>

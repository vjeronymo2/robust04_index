			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Magnum Pounds 1.23m in the red Magnum Power, which designs built-in uninterruptible power supply units (Bi-ups) and is planning a USM flotation through a placing with institutional investors, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.23m for the year to May 31, on turnover of Pounds 59,000. The prospectus for the flotation, which was issued yesterday, also shows that the company lost Pounds 155,000 in the year to May 31 1992, which the following year rose to Pounds 482,000 on turnover of Pounds 10,000 as the company developed its technology. However, Magnum's directors express their confidence in the prospectus that there is 'potentially a large market for Bi-ups, which is currently served by the manufacturers of external uninterruptible power supply devices.' Bi-ups can be built into electronic equipment, such as personal computers, to protect against the loss of valuable data and equipment damage if the primary power supply fails. Magnum was founded in 1990 by Mr Vincent Lavin, chief executive, who claims to have invented Bi-ups the previous year, and Mr Ian Irvin, finance director. The flotation is sponsored by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance.</p>

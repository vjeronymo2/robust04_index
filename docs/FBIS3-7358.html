Korea"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comments on the ever more intensified interference in and  suppression of the press by the "Security Planning Board" (SPB)  [Agency for National Security and Planning -- "NSP"] in South  Korea.    The "SPB" not only strictly bans the press from reporting  about the mounting struggle on South Korean people against the  flunkeyist treacheries of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique and  its confrontational row against the North, their anti-American  and anti-fascist struggle for democracy and their anti-war and  anti-nuke struggle but also manipulates the subsidized media to  mislead public opinion over the "nuclear issue of the North",  the news analyst of the paper says, and continues:    The tightened control on the press by the Kim Yong-sam group  through the "SPB" is unthinkable apart from the crisis of the  "civilian government". What the puppets pursue in suppressing  the press is to bar it from digging up and opening to the public  their anti-national crimes and curb the anti-"government" action  of the people.    It is a symptom of the end of the "civilian government" to  try to maintain the treacherous rule by blindfolding the people  and stuffing their ears and mouths through the suppression of  the press.    The further the puppets intensify their anti-DPRK smear  campaign and suppression of the people and the press through the  "Security Planning Board", the fiercer the struggle of the  people grows against the "civilian" dictatorship.</p>

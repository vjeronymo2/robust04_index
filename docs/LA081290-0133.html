			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SHOW BOATS;  </P> <P> THEY ATTRACT GAWKERS AND DON'T FLOAT, BUT THEIR RESIDENTS ENJOY LIVING IN THEM  </P> <P> Mark Baskin was on the telephone with his father in Santa Cruz, describing his  swell new rental home in Encinitas.  </P> <P> "What do you mean you live on a boat?" his father asked. "You mean a boat  floating in the water?"  </P> <P> "No, Dad."  </P> <P> "So you mean you live on the beach?"  </P> <P> "Not exactly, Dad."  </P> <P> Last year, Baskin and his wife, Donna, moved into the SS Encinitas, one of two  identical boathouses that for more than 60 years have been dry-docked in the  middle of an otherwise ordinary suburban block near downtown Encinitas.  </P> <P> Built by an eccentric, out-of-work marine engineer in 1929, the pair of  nautical oddities have since become salty north San Diego County landmarks,  captured on postcards, paintings, sketches and countless snapshots.  </P> <P> Locals say the boathouses were never meant to sail, but were built on the site  a few blocks from the beach, side by side, as landlubber quarters replete with  two decks, a full living room, two bedrooms, 1 1/2 baths and an authentic  galley.  </P> <P> Even with their sterns moored in a concrete foundation, the boathouses have  nonetheless provided residents with all the trappings of life at sea -- down to  the awkwardly low ceilings and slight starboard list.  </P> <P> On stormy nights, or after a few bottles of good wine, the Baskins say they can  actually feel the boats begin a gentle rocking motion.  </P> <P> "On rainy nights, you feel like you're adrift on the high seas," Mark Baskin  said. "You can feel the boat moving just a tiny bit. You can even hear the wood  creaking in spots.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, in severe rainstorms, I have to run out and collect the furniture  from the outside deck. It makes me feel like I'm battening down the hatches or  something."  </P> <P> For the Baskins and three generations of previous residents, life inside the  Encinitas boathouses has often been like living in a giant fishbowl.  </P> <P> On any weekend, dozens of curious passers-by will stop, look and then look  again. Some will knock on the door and ask for a private tour. And those are  the polite ones. Others peer inside any of the 19 portholes that line the wood  and concrete hull.  </P> <P> There have been accidents, boathouse residents say -- minor fender-benders that  occur when the car of one rubbernecker slams into the back of another.  </P> <P> Once, years ago, a passing dentist tried to buy one of the boathouses for an  office -- because he believed his younger patients would no longer be afraid to  visit him.  </P> <P> The constant intrusions have taken their toll. The tenant living in the  adjacent SS Moonlight is so weary of the questions that he declined to be  interviewed.  </P> <P> But the Baskins take all the attention in stride.  </P> <P> "When we have barbecues up on the top deck or when I sunbathe on the bow, you  won't believe the reaction we get," Donna Baskin said. "Just about everyone  that passes who hasn't seen the boats before wants the full history.  </P> <P> "And then there's the people with the video cameras and zoom lenses. At first,  I was snappy about it and kind of irritable. But then I remembered -- that's  how we were the first time we saw the boathouses."  </P> <P> When he lived down the street from the boathouses in the 1970s, Mark Baskin  recalls "snooping around," taking a few curious peeks through the portholes  himself.  </P> <P> Then last year, he spotted the owner placing a "For Rent" sign outside. "I saw  my chance to finally walk around inside one of the boathouses," he said.  </P> <P> "I was really impressed with how spacious it was inside. I told the owner that  day that we wanted the place. I just had to run home and get my deposit."  </P> <P> For 43 years, Marie Baxley has lived across the street from the boathouses in  an old stucco home. Sometimes, she says, the gawkers and their incessant  questions drive her practically insane.  </P> <P> "If I had a nickel for every snapshot taken of those places, I'd be a rich  woman today," she said. "I can't get any gardening done without the questions  starting. 'Do I know who lives there?' 'What do they look like inside?' 'Are  they really boats that were moved here from the water?'  </P> <P> "Just once I'd like to tell someone that a high tide picked those boats up from  the ocean and brought them right here."  </P> <P> The boathouses are a jarring sight on the palm-studded suburban street, their  pointy bows jutting toward the street, their front lawns lined with heavy ropes  and wooden pilings to give them a truly nautical flair.  </P> <P> Just ask Mel Burstein. As the tourist from Miami maneuvered his big rental car  to the side of the street, his wife was ready with the camera.  </P> <P> "We did a double take, drove two blocks and decided to come back and take a  picture," Betty Burstein said.  </P> <P> "We don't have anything like this in Miami," her husband said. "Only in  California. I guess when the floods come, they'll be ready. Who lives there  anyway -- Noah?"  </P> <P> Tom Voss, another curious passer-by, said he was surprised that the boats have  survived in an era of strict city building codes. "They must have been put here  a long time before people cared about such things," he said.  </P> <P> When Miles M. Kellog built the boathouses just before the onset of the  Depression, there weren't many building codes to guide him -- nor other houses,  either.  </P> <P> Locals say Kellog built several houses in what is now the 700 block of 3rd  Street before he constructed the first boathouse out of wood scraps from a  recently demolished dance hall on nearby Moonlight Beach.  </P> <P> But the SS Encinitas looked awkward on the site. So he added a companion boat  -- the SS Moonlight -- right next door.  </P> <P> Since then, the boathouses have passed through the hands of several owners --  most of whom have rented them out to an assortment of tenants.  </P> <P> Some owners have taken good care of the structures. Others allowed them to  lapse into disrepair.  </P> <P> "My mother always said she wished those boathouses would just burn down,"  recalled Betty Jo Swaim, a longtime Encinitas resident. "She said they just  stuck out like sore thumbs. And that they always attracted the wrong kind."  </P> <P> Martha Engledow, who with her husband, Clint, has owned the structures for more  than 20 years, said the boathouses have been featured on postcards, in national  magazines -- even on the sketch boards of local artists.  </P> <P> "Nobody tells me they're tacky," said the 72-year-old Leucadia resident. "Over  the years, they've become a curiosity around Encinitas. He built them like real  boats with curved walls and real touches of workmanship.  </P> <P> "People around here are impressed when they say, 'You own the boathouses?'  They're a historic monument, I'd say."  </P> <P> By now, though, Donna and Mark Baskin can recite the drawbacks of living the  ocean life on dry land.  </P> <P> They have to remember to duck their heads while scaling the stairway, and some  furniture must be propped up on one side because of uneven floors caused by the  structure's pronounced list.  </P> <P> Still, it's all worth it for that one night when they can admire the nearby  city lights from the bow-front porch, as though they were relaxing on a cruise  ship with the engines off in perfectly calm seas.  </P> <P> "The place has lots of charm," said Donna Baskin, a restaurant manager.  "Sometimes, when I come home from work in a bad mood, all I have to do is take  one look at this place and I feel better. It's like, 'Hey, I actually live  there.' "  </P> <P> Images of life inside one of the boathouses can last a lifetime.  </P> <P> In the 1930s, Betty Jo Swaim once played with friends who lived in the SS  Encinitas, spilling hot chocolate all over their embroidered tablecloth as they  pretended to be lost at sea in a ferocious storm.  </P> <P> More than half a century later, she can't drive by the boathouses without  thinking of those days.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, I make a conscious effort to look at those old boathouses when I  drive by," she said. "They just remind me of how much fun I had when I was a  child.  </P> <P> "And while everything else is changing, they're the one thing around here  that's stayed the same."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Budapest, Jan 11 (CTK) -- The chairman of the  Office for Hungarians Abroad, Geza Entz, has rejected the  accusation that the January 8 meeting of ethnic Hungarian  representatives in southern Slovakia was initiated by Hungary's  foreign policy.    In an interview for today's Hungarian daily PESTI HIRLAP,  Entz said that the Slovak Government circles would point to  their neighbor as long as cooperation between Bratislava and  Budapest is not established in order to settle the position of  the 560,000-strong Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia.    In a declaration approved at the meeting, participants  demanded the expansion of the jurisdiction of local government  and a new local administrative arrangement in Slovakia.    Entz said that documents approved in Komarno, southern  Slovakia, over the weekend clearly prove that it is not  reasonable to accuse the mayors of the southern Slovak region  (at whose initiative the meeting was held) of being separatist  only because they rejected as unacceptable state administration  reform. At the meeting, ethnic Hungarians peacefully but  resolutely formulated their demands which aim at preservation of  national identity and their eventual recognition by the Slovak  Government circles as partners.    After the submission of the claims of an "extensive stratum  of society," said Entz, he believed there existed a hope of  resolving the standing of Hungarians in Slovakia legally.

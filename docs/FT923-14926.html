			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Wine: Only the best will do - . . . for a nation of collectors rather than drinkers I DESPAIR, I really do. There is that huge country across the Atlantic with its 200m consumers, not so very different from us Europeans, but how many are ever going to experience the true, and delightfully simple, pleasures of wine? Probably a handful at most unless there is a complete rotation of US mind-set on wine. Wine that sells in north America is either very cheap, very expensive, or regarded as a medicine. At the bottom end, a shrinking proportion of the mass market buys basic commercial blends, with their persuasive sugar levels, and swigs them for refreshment as an alternative to a cola. At the top end of the market, a much smaller, static number of consumers, probably 0.1 per cent at most, are interested - and I mean passionately interested - in nothing but the very, very best and will pay any price to secure it. So well-heeled Americans gobble up all the most sought-after wines, helping to drive up their price, even importing British merchants' allocations across the Atlantic. But most Americans, are uninterested in the bread and butter of the wine world, the exciting variety of good-value bottles that can be enjoyed every day. Okay, some will buy mid-range California wines in restaurants, but only because they resent paying restaurant mark-ups on the top wines they have in their cellars. They all agree which are the top wines because they all read The Wine Advocate newsletter and The Wine Spectator magazine which dispense, per wine, easily comprehensible scores out of 100; pocket calculators have replaced palates in the American wine trade. One New York restaurant, Zoe, even prints Spectator scores on its wine list, with special sections for the 'heavy hitters' (those scoring over 90). A dangerously high proportion of wine in America is filling cellars rather than glasses. Wine connoisseurship has enjoyed a period of unparalleled status in the US. A cellarful of 90-pointers has been seen as an essential accoutrement of success. The cellar will be specially constructed, its temperature and humidity carefully controlled, but its design is often predicated on its function as spectacle rather than store-cupboard. The bottles are for ogling rather than opening. Bottles are sometimes opened, en masse, at grand, well-publicised tasting marathons at which perhaps 100 wines, each individually capable of sustaining a memorable dinner, are compared, and expectorated. But the proportion of great wine that is served as it is meant to be, a bottle or two at a time to maximise pleasure around a table, seems absurdly low from the European side of the Atlantic. American for someone who takes an interest in wine is, significantly, not connoisseur or enthusiast but 'collector'. There are those, however, who think the only way wine will survive the activism of those labelled neo-Prohibitionists is by becoming even more elitist. For years now, all wine bottles, even the grandest, have had to carry labels warning pregnant women, and those in charge of machinery, against drink. Increasing controls and some crazy litigation have wrought striking changes in US attitudes. A French wine merchant dining alone in a Boston steakhouse tried to sample a rival's brand, available only by the bottle. He was flabbergasted to have his order refused by a waitress who told him that a bottle was too much for one person and that she risked being held legally responsible for his actions if he consumed it. If the French wine trade were not in such dire straits, with Japan's second coming to wine looking increasingly mirage-like, one feels the French might give up on the US market altogether. Ever since Prohibition, selling any alcohol in the US has been complicated, with different rules for each state, but the hurdles between producer and US consumer seem to double each year. Perhaps symptomatic of wine's place in American society is that wine's chief regulatory body is the fiercely literal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The BATF must have been as shocked as the wine trade, if in a very different way, by the extraordinary television broadcast in November on CBS's '60 Minutes'. Morley Safer, a sort of Wogan-Dimbleby hybrid, told 30m Americans of the research that suggests that one of the factors that keeps the French heart disease rate 40 per cent lower than in the US may be France's more robust consumption of red wine. Who could have predicted such a boon for the wine trade from this unexpected quarter? Little old ladies teetered into liquor stores the very next morning asking for a bottle of that stuff that wards off heart attacks. My practically teetotal but cholesterol-fixated Californian friend manfully starting washing down his lunch with premier cru burgundy. Gallo, the world's largest winery, has had to put all of its reds, even its much-maligned jugs of 'Hearty Burgundy', on allocation only. Red wine sales immediately increased by more than 40 per cent. But the US wine trade is trying desperately not to get too excited. Oat bran, sold a few years ago along much the same lines, proved more of a fling than a sustained love affair for the American public. It will not be in our lifetimes that Americans fall for the sort of relaxed life enhancement that regular consumption of good-value wine can offer.</p>

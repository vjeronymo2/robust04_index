			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (6): Serious threat of bomb-making - Civil and military links North Korea's controversial nuclear programme is the most recent demonstration that civil nuclear power is not as far divorced from military applications as its supporters like to pretend. And the fact that the US and South Korea are prepared to supply North Korea with water-cooled reactor technology worth Dollars 2bn to stop its existing graphite reactor programme shows just how seriously the threat of the transfer between civil and military nuclear reactors is being taken. The reason why is simple enough. For a would-be nuclear weapons state, the hardest part of making an atomic bomb is getting enough of the right sort of plutonium or uranium. The easiest place to get hold of the right sort of plutonium is from the right sort of nuclear reactor. For a relatively unsophisticated country the right kind of reactor uses natural uranium, which is reasonably easily available, surrounded by graphite. If the reactor is operated for several months, two important nuclear processes occur. The first is the splitting of uranium, which releases the energy to produce power, and the second is the conversion of the natural form of uranium which is not explosive into a form of plutonium which is. North Korea's nuclear reactors are of this graphite type and bear a strong similarity to those which were originally used in the US for plutonium production. Once the uranium in the reactor has been used for several months it is taken out and the bomb-making plutonium can be chemically separated. Whether the reactor is being used to make electricity or plutonium is partly a semantic distinction because the reactor is doing both. However, if the uranium is left in the reactor for more than a few months the explosive type of uranium is itself converted by the intense radiation into a much less explosive form. For efficient bomb material the optimum period in a reactor is about six months. More advanced western reactors use water instead of gas to cool them. Unfortunately, the water coolant slows down the reaction and so natural uranium, which contains only 1 per cent of the type which will split to release energy, has to be beefed up to about 4 per cent of the reactive type. This 'enrichment' is difficult and expensive, and is one reason why beginners, such as the UK in the 1950s with the Magnox reactors, tend to choose graphite reactors cooled by gas. Because the enriched fuel for water reactors is so much more expensive it has to be used for much longer in the reactor to make it cost-effective. Using the fuel in the reactor for two or three years means that it contains a lot of the unreactive form of plutonium and makes it much harder, although not impossible, to detonate. Water reactors also take longer to shut down, refuel, and restart, making them easier to monitor by arms inspectors. For these reasons the US negotiators have been trying to wean the North Koreans off their hard-to-monitor plutonium-producing graphite cores towards more controllable pressured water reactors. One problem for the US negotiators is that their offer may be seen as giving in to blackmail. Indeed, there is one school of thought which suggests that the North Koreans never intended to make a nuclear weapon, but wanted to squeeze civil power stations from the west. Even if there are no further similar incidents, the operation of civil nuclear reactors around the world does pose a military problem. Large amounts of plutonium are produced, even in water-cooled reactors. While much of this would be difficult to detonate, it is not impossible, and as it is highly toxic it also presents a significant chemical threat in the hands of terrorists or renegade states. That genie is already partly out of the bottle because hundreds of tonnes of plutonium have already been separated or 'reprocessed' from used reactor fuel. Some of it is explicitly for weapons and other lower-grade stocks for possible use in fast breeder reactors: a technology which has now been shelved. Protecting that plutonium in store is a hard enough task in the west, where standards of accounting for nuclear stocks have in the past been lax. Even last year, Mrs Hazel O'Leary, the US energy secretary, had to correct a figure for US plutonium stocks by 1 1/2 tonnes - enough for 150 nuclear weapons - because of accounting errors. A full register of fissile materials does not exist and not even individual countries know exactly how much plutonium and uranium they have or where it all is. The problem is even worse in Russia where there are concerns that fissile materials stores are not secure. Against that background, preventing the spread of potential bomb materials is difficult - and is being made more so by the reprocessing of further fuel from civil reactors, and the dismantling of nuclear weapons. The plutonium is not needed for civil purposes and even the proposed mixed-oxide fuels to burn the plutonium are only a temporary palliative which will generate more plutonium. In the view of some in the nuclear industry, developed countries must produce better and more open nuclear accountancy methods. This would reassure non-nuclear weapons states that stockpiles were under control, and the system could be passed on to developing countries to help them account for their civil nuclear programmes. The further reprocessing of fuel also looks questionable under these conditions, because it separates more plutonium which needs safe storage. 'What could be better than storing this plutonium in its original fuel rods, still mixed with the highly radioactive fission products which would kill anyone who tried to steal it?' said one former nuclear executive. Another engineer still in the nuclear industry said: 'I prefer to keep the waste as solids in the fuel pins, rather than separated out with some as highly radioactive liquids which are difficult to contain.' Such views about the control of fissile materials to keep the barriers between civil and military power are particularly important in the run-up to the conference on extending the nuclear non-proliferation treaty next year. So far, the objections of non-weapons states are that the weapons states have not done enough to disarm or control their fissile stockpiles. Their main anger has, however, been directed at the failure to agree a test ban treaty, so that weapons states can continue to develop more and more sophisticated bombs. Sooner or later though, the debate will switch to the links between civil and military applications, and the control of fissile materials stocks.</p>

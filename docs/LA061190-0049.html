			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: HAS DISNEY GOT A DEAL FOR DOPEY, GOOFY AND DUMBO!  </P> <P> If you're looking for a real Mickey Mouse security, all you have to do is look  at the new piece of paper that Walt Disney Co. wants you to buy.  </P> <P> The security is what's known on Wall Street as a LYON, for Liquid Yield Option  Note. It's probably more accurate to call it a Grossly Overpriced Overly Frugal  Yielding note, or GOOFY. Which is what you will be if you buy it without  understanding what you're buying.  </P> <P> The LYON, which is undoubtedly selling like Cokes in Disneyland on a hot day --  how many prospectuses open with a full-color picture of Mickey and friends? --  is a magical piece of paper. Magical for Disney, that is.  </P> <P> Disney is a guaranteed winner, thanks to the tax code, and the U.S. Treasury is  a guaranteed loser. The investors who buy the security? They may make out if  they can duck the daffy tax problems that LYON holders have. And if the dollar  drops compared to the French franc.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch has guaranteed to sell $1.5 billion in face value of Disney  LYONs. Because they sell at a steep discount from face, the LYONs would raise  about $600 million for Disney. Given the demand for this stuff, which is being  sold heavily to individual investors who have grown up ingesting Disney with  their mother's milk, the LYON may well roar up to $2.5 billion, which would  raise about $1 billion.  </P> <P> Why the difference between the LYONs' face value and the money they raise for  Disney? Because LYONs are like old-style U.S. savings bonds. Remember? You paid  $18.75 for a bond with a $25 face value, and you got your $25 when the bond  matured.  </P> <P> Assuming this deal, scheduled for later this month, goes off as planned, you  will pay $411.99 for a Disney LYON with a face value of $1,000 that matures in  15 years. The difference between that $411.99 and $1,000 is interest, at 6% a  year, compounded semiannually.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that the interest payments are deductible to corporations such as  Disney. Thus, if $1.5 billion of LYONs are sold and stay outstanding until  maturity, Disney will get about $880 million in tax deductions over 15 years.  If $2.5 billion in LYONs are sold, the deductions would be around $1.47  billion.  </P> <P> Now, we enter tax fantasyland. Even though Disney won't actually shell out cash  interest for years, it gets interest deductions beginning the day it sells the  paper. Deduct now, pay later. Pretty slick, isn't it? And perfectly legal.  </P> <P> But just as Disney gets tax deductions for interest it hasn't paid, LYON owners  get whacked for income tax for interest they haven't received. So the only  sensible way to buy this security -- if it's sensible to buy it -- is in an  individual retirement account or for the account of someone who pays no income  tax.  </P> <P> Obviously, no one, no matter how dopey, will lend Disney money for 15 years at  6%. Not when 15-year Treasury securities yield about 8.5% and top-rated 15-year  corporate bonds yield around 10%. So Disney is offering a sweetener -- which is  where the bet against the dollar comes in.  </P> <P> Disney is offering "contingent interest" based on the share price of Euro  Disney, a French company. You get either the contingent interest or 6%,  whichever is higher. If Euro Disney does well, so will you.  </P> <P> Just how well Euro Disney must do is another question. Euro Disney, whose  shares trade on the Paris Bourse, is building a Disney theme park in France.  Its shares, naturally, are quoted in French francs. Euro Disney has a  mind-blowing market value of $3 billion even though the park isn't even built  and is considered by many people to be one of the most overpriced securities on  Earth.  </P> <P> If you do the math, you see that for you to make 10% interest on a 15-year  LYON, already pricey Euro Disney shares have to be worth five times as much in  dollars in the year 2005 as they are now. Can that happen unless the dollar  falls sharply relative to the franc? Or, for that matter, even if it does? And  remember that 10% is no bonanza. You can get that by buying a boring old  high-grade corporate bond.  </P> <P> Note that Disney will pay you in cash, not in Euro Disney shares. As Bob  Willens, the resident tax genius at Shearson Lehman Hutton, points out, if  Disney LYONs were convertible into Euro Disney shares, it would limit the  interest that Disney could deduct. This way, all the interest is deductible.  "Some very smart tax people helped set this up," Willens says.  </P> <P> Just about everything here is stacked in favor of Disney and against anyone who  owns a LYON. One good thing is that if Euro Disney's price crumbles -- which  wouldn't exactly shock me -- you can get out of your LYON alive. Disney will  buy the LYON from you for $553.68 in June, 1995, or for $744.10 in June, 2000.  </P> <P> But the price of protection on the downside is a ceiling on how much you can  make on the upside. If the price of Euro Disney gets high enough to make Disney  uncomfortable, it can call the LYONs in for redemption and limit your profit.  If Euro Disney doesn't go up much or falls, Disney sits there with your cheap  loan.  </P> <P> Disney, of course, will win no matter what happens. Disney paid only $132  million for its 83 million Euro Disney shares, which now have a market value of  more than $1.5 billion. If Euro Disney heads for the moon, Disney can sell some  shares to raise cash to pay LYON interest and still be billions ahead.  </P> <P> This is a great, even a brilliant, deal for Disney, which gets tax breaks,  cheap money and a chance to cash in on its Euro Disney stock without selling  it. For the average person, though, this LYON could be the meanest thing that  Disney has done since killing off Bambi's mother.  </P></p>

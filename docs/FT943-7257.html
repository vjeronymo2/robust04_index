			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Wace jumps 57% - Advance to Pounds 11m achieved despite decline in US print activities Further cost reductions and improved productivity helped Wace, the restructured pre-press and specialist printing group, report a 57 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30. On turnover which slipped slightly to Pounds 164m (Pounds 165.5m), pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 11.1m. Earnings per share jumped from 4.1p to 10p as the tax charge fell to Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 2.47m). That reflected the utilisation of trading losses associated with the reorganisation of the property portfolio, resulting in a projected 15 per cent tax rate for the year. The interim dividend is increased by 50 per cent to 1.5p. The shares closed 16p higher yesterday at 270p. Mr Trevor Grice, chief executive, said the profits increase reflected the continued drive for productivity improvements together with the group's clear focus on cash generation. That had helped reduce net borrowing by Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 51.8m at the end of June compared with peak borrowings of Pounds 100m less than two years ago. Trading profits increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 11.4m) led by improved results from pre-press operations in the UK, the US and continental Europe. The pre-press operations in Europe as a whole produced considerably improved trading profits of Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 3.63m) on turnover down from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 42.9m. In the UK, despite intense pressure in the publications market, the corporate advertising market had started to show signs of improvement and the packaging market remained buoyant. The printing operations in the UK lifted profits to Pounds 5.69m (Pounds 4.49m) on turnover of Pounds 55.3m (Pounds 54.4m). The strongest performing businesses were the specialist print operations although both corporate print and screen printing were also ahead of last year. The group's US operations lifted trading profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 3.22m) on broadly similar turnover of Pounds 65.8m (Pounds 66.8m). US print turnover and profits, however, were slightly lower because of operational problems with two new presses in Michigan. COMMENT Wace's current management team continue to impress and the strategy pursued over the past 18 months of driving costs down, generating a strong cash flow and paying down debt appears to be working. Meanwhile, although gearing remains high, the balance sheet looks much healthier. The press problems in Michigan and Pounds 350,000 of Scottish commercial print restructuring costs will hold profits to about Pounds 23m this year, equivalent to 20.9p of earnings given the abnormally low tax rate. The shares are on a prospective multiple of 12.9 and could move higher as advertising volume improves.</p>

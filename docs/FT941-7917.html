			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Recovery to withstand tax rises say 'wise men': Increase in interest rates seen by Treasury advisers The UK economic recovery is strong enough to withstand the impact of tax rises this spring, the Treasury's panel of independent advisers said yesterday. In an unexpectedly optimistic assessment of the economy, four of the six 'wise men' backed the government's view that the Budget measures would not severely dent growth and forecast that the next move in interest rates would be upwards. The prediction on interest rates came as Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve Board, said the US central bank was leaning towards using higher interest rates to combat inflation and keep growth on track. The UK economists' report - the first to be presented to the chancellor this year - was surprising after last week's disappointing economic data. All but two of the economists said further monetary loosening was unnecessary, even after the higher taxes hit consumers in April. The panel, in its first assessment since November's Budget, said bigger incomes would neutralise the extra taxes while optimism about the economy would encourage people to dip in to their savings. Its generally positive view of the government's economic policies came as figures showed an upwards revision to fourth quarter growth figures. The Central Statistical Office said gross domestic product rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent on the previous quarter, up from an earlier estimate of 0.7 per cent. But an announcement yesterday from Unilever, the food and consumer products group, that it is to shed up to 1,000 jobs in the UK over the next three years served as a reminder that unemployment remains high. The panel predicts that the jobless total will stay above 2m over the next four years. In the Commons, Mr John Major described the recovery as 'steady' and said it showed signs of continuing. 'I think there is no doubt among any of our European partners about the strength of the economic recovery in this country,' he said. The consensus among the advisers, who drafted their individual reports before last week's poor economic indicators were known, is that the economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year, and by roughly the same in 1995. Only professors Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Wynne Godley of Cambridge University believe the UK should follow the US where cuts in interest rates had generated a solid recovery without rekindling inflation. All six expect inflation to be within the government's 1-4 per cent target range this year.

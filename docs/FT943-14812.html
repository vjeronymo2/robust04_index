			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UN condemns expulsion of Haiti mission The UN Security Council yesterday condemned the Haitian regime's expulsion of an international human rights mission, calling it a 'serious escalation' of the military-led government's defiance. In a statement approved at a brief open meeting after private talks, the council also condemned the authorities' move to avoid 'appropriate international scrutiny' while indiscriminate violence against civilians was increasing. The Haitian government's provocative behaviour threatened regional peace and security. The council would hold the regime individually and collectively responsible for the safety of 'the international presence' in Haiti. The action against the mission, sent by the UN and the Organisation of American States, would further reinforce the council's determination to bring about a rapid and definitive solution to the crisis. However, there was no immediate indication that the council was considering further concrete measures to enforce its will after it had imposed extensive economic sanctions. The council session took place after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, and Mr Christopher Thomas, acting head of the OAS, had bowed to Haitian demands that some 100 international staff of the human rights mission be evacuated. A UN spokesman said they would leave 'in the next day or so'. In Haiti, the government yesterday threatened to punish any of its citizens supporting military intervention aimed at toppling the military regime of Lt Gen Raoul Cedras.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Observer: Rhodesienne Cecil Rhodes may turn in his grave at this item of news. For the first time since they became eligible in 1976, there will be more women US Rhodes Scholars at Oxford next year (17) than men (15). Otherwise, the Ivy League was again the most successful, winning nine places, including two room-mates from Harvard. Rutgers got two, having been shut out for a Rhodes since 1953. Bill Clinton, class of 1970, saw his alma mater, Georgetown, win one, too. Appropriately for this most feminist of presidents, she is a woman.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: MMC to investigate Stagecoach shares swap The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday ordered the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to investigate the taking of a 20 per cent stake by Stagecoach Holdings, Britain's biggest bus operator, in Sheffield Mainline Partnership bus company. It said Mr Jonathan Evans, the corporate affairs minister, considered the acquisition raised competition concerns about the bus market in parts of South Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. Stagecoach agreed in July to swap shares with Sheffield Mainline Partnership, which was established last November through an employee buy-out from local authorities in South Yorkshire. The deal with Stagecoach, worth about Pounds 1m, involved the exchange of 20 per cent of Mainline's enlarged equity for 500,000 Stagecoach shares. At the time Stagecoach described it as a form of courtship: if the relationship worked out, Stagecoach would eventually seek full control. An industry analyst interpreted the DTI's action as a signal to Stagecoach that it wants it to halt its acquisitions of bus companies. It now controls 11.5 per cent of the UK bus market. However, Mr Derek Scott, Stagecoach's finance director, said he saw the MMC reference as concerned purely with Mainline's area of operations. He said the 20 per cent stake was intended to protect Mainline against other predators. 'It's an important development for the industry and we want to get the principle of what we are doing established. We hope the MMC will say we are acting in the public interest'. The MMC will report in February. This will be the fourth MMC inquiry into Stagecoach's activities since it was set up in 1980. The Office of Fair Trading has also carried out 18 other investigations into Stagecoach subsidiaries. Last week Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's industry spokesman, wrote to the DTI demanding an inquiry into Stagecoach's allegedly anti-competitive practices.</p>

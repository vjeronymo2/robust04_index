			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slavoljub Susic, Belgrade radio </F> military-political commentator, by Milorad Denda; place not  given -- live]    [Excerpt] [Denda] Let us now turn to our basic topic --  the decisions of the NATO summit in Brussels, especially those  decisions and announcements regarding the situation in Bosnia.  We have asked Slavoljub Susic to comment on these decisions.    However, before saying anything, let us cite the Voice of  America. VOA is claiming that some high-ranking U.S. officers  expressed reserve toward possible air raids, despite the U.S.  arsenal of accurately guided weapons and the probable lack of  Serbian fighter aircraft that could intercept the allied  bombers. The said officers, the radio says, assess that the  Bosnian Serbs could easily hide heavy artillery weapons in  woodlands or mountainous regions or transfer them to populated  areas that pilots would hesitate to attack. One general  compared this military action to that of searching for a needle  in a haystack. Colleague Susic, these considerations in  Washington are interesting, but one could say something about  the respectable forces of the Srpska army when talking about  antiaircraft defense.    [Susic] Well, yes. It sounds paradoxical, but it is a fact  that during the last several years, particularly during the last  year of President Bush's term of office and during the first  year of President Clinton's term, it has been the politicians  who have been more militant than the soldiers; it is the  soldiers who warn about all the possible consequences of hasty  decisions to set off into a military adventure, especially in  the Balkans. I would also point out that the Srpska army  possesses a respectable number of artillery-missile forces,  which are not to be underestimated. After all, this is an army  of a formed state community in which, whether one cares to admit  it or not, organs of civilian power and the army as an  institution are already functioning.    Apart from tactical-technical measures of antiaircraft  defense and protection that the Srpska army would undertake in  the event of an air raid, such as the scattered disposition of  units, the frequent transfer of forces, engineering security and  protection measures, the discipline of fire [discplina vatre],  and the like, the Srpska army possesses a number of respectable  forces for antiaircraft defense. First, what is involved are  massive antiaircraft artillery pieces, including the most modern  antiaircraft guns of the Bofors type, of Swedish production.  This weapon has a laser sight that enables a maximum precision  of hitting targets in the air. It has a great fire  concentration of several thousand rounds per minute. I would  also like to stress that numbers [masovnost] of these weapons  and the density of fire not only aim to down the enemy plane but  also hamper it in performing its task.    Second are the portable missile launchers of the Strela type  -- Strela 1, Strela 2M, and the latest type of Strela. These  launchers are held on a fighter's shoulder and can hit a target  of up to 3.5 km on arrival and departure. These weapons are a  special threat to fighter bombers, for whom the said altitude is  the most suitable in order to successfully hit targets.  Therefore, when attacking, planes would have to descend to this  altitude and then they would find themselves within the range of  these missiles.    Of course, the next significant missile system is the KUB,  which has a high maneuvering capability. It consists of three  launchers mounted on one vehicle. It is used to hit targets at  medium and high altitudes. These systems protect a territory  and a disposition of units over a large area of land.    Finally, one of the significant systems of antiaircraft  defense that the Srpska army possesses is the stationary missile  system (Volhov). These are the largest and most powerful  antiaircraft missiles that the Srpska army possesses. The  present model of this missile system has been considerably  modernized with a built-in special control system. This was  done several years ago in one of the factories that is still  operating in the Serbian Republic. It efficiently hits combat  aircraft at the altitude of as much as 30 km and flying at all  speeds that modern combat aircraft can reach.    What is characteristic about this missile system (Volhov) is  that apart from being able to hit aircraft at very low  altitudes, they can also hit targets on the ground, which would  be the weapons that [word indistinct] possesses.    Let me also point out that despite all the modern technology  for discovering targets, even throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina,  that NATO pilots certainly possess -- and they certainly possess  information acquired with the help of the AWACS system and  directly in the field, as well as with other electronic devices  -- they can hardly discover Serbian forces' targets for the  already mentioned reasons, something that the U.S. generals have  also warned about. Even when a target is found, one has to  attain a direct hit in order to destroy that target, something  that is hardly possible even under the ideal conditions of  training. After all, let us take a look at experiences from the  Gulf war, where a view of the terrain is considerably better and  camouflage less possible, and still efficiency attained was only  15 percent of direct hits with all launched missiles and  projectiles.

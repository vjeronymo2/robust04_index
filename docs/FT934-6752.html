			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Weak demand hits Ricoh sales Weak demand for office equipment in Japan and in its main overseas markets took sales at Ricoh, the maker of copiers and information equipment down 12 per cent to Y295.2bn (Dollars 2.76bn) from a previous Y336.1bn, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. However, an improved non-operating balance lifted its pre-tax profit by 38 per cent to Y6.19bn. Ricoh saw revenues from its copiers drop significantly in the export market, which offset a moderate rise in domestic sales. Information equipment was, however, shunned both in Japan and overseas, while sales of photographic equipment took a sharp downturn in overseas markets. Ricoh is strengthening its overseas procurement and production activities. However, it does not expect the market to recover significantly in the second term despite government efforts to lift domestic demand. The company is forecasting a 9 per cent drop in sales for the full year to Y592bn and a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y13bn.</p>

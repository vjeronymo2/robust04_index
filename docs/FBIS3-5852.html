			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government is having trouble drawing up its  foreign economic policies after the breakdown of the new  Japan-U.S. economic consultations. Giving up plans to reshuffle  the cabinet has weakened the Hosokawa administration's  leadership, and the concerned ministries and agencies are not  working vigorously enough. At the informal 9 March cabinet  meeting, it was decided that the government would back off from  its original decision to announce its policies in a single  package before the end of March; instead, part of these policies  would be compiled in late March, and the remainder, before the  Naples Summit (of leaders of the advanced countries) in July.  While the automobile industry is now preparing to issue  voluntary plans for the purchase of additional U.S.-made parts,  this is not likely to meet U.S. expectations of a large-scale  increase. Although the government wants these foreign economic  policies to be a stepping stone toward reconciliation with the  United States, the United States is not likely to be pacified by  the first batch of measures to be announced. There is now a  strong possibility that tension in bilateral relations may  continue for some time.    The government has basically decided on including the  following measures concerned with the priority negotiation areas  at the framework talks in the first batch of economic measures  to be announced by the end of this month: 1) the stationing of a  permanent Transport Ministry inspector in Detroit to facilitate  the issuance of certificates for American cars; and 2)  expediting procedures for approving new insurance products.    Furthermore, the package is also expected to include the  implementation of the government procurement action plan, the  formulation of a guideline on the Antimonopoly Law in relation  to public works projects bidding, and import-stimulation  measures in the fiscal 1994 budget.    However, the above measures have either been predicted  previously or have already been announced. Even the officials  in charge admit that they are "not impressive" (according to a  senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry official).  While the merit of the economic measures actually depends on  how far new policies can be drawn up, concrete measures  regarding deregulation in the flow of commodities, and  improvement of customs procedures have not been finalized,  although they are actually being discussed. Officials of the  Cabinet Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs, responsible for  compiling deregulation measures, lament that "the ministries are  all reluctant."    With regard to macroeconomic measures, even the agenda has  not been decided upon. The government is unable to take any  action on the extension of the income tax cut beyond 1994, an  issue in which the United States shows great interest, because  this has to wait for the ruling coalition parties' consultations  on tax reform to reach a conclusion. As to setting a voluntary  target for reducing the current accounts surplus, while some  cabinet members are in favor of this idea, Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa takes a negative position. There is evident  vacillation in the cabinet.    A factor contributing to this lukewarm attitude toward  compiling economic measures is the internal strife within the  administration, as evidenced by the abortion of the cabinet  reshuffle plan. While Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura is supposed to be responsible for compiling the foreign  economic measures, cynics in the concerned ministries and  agencies ask: "Does he really have the full confidence of the  prime minister?" The bureaucrats doubt if they can have the  full support of the ruling coalition parties if they come up  with deregulation measures, which businesses are expected to  oppose fiercely.</p>

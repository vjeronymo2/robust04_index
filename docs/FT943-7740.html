			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Archer share orders disclosed: Labour urges trade department to refer affair to Crown Prosecution Service Lord Archer gave a stockbroker detailed instructions for the purchase of two parcels of Anglia Television shares fewer than four working days before MAI announced a Pounds 292m takeover bid for the television company. The new details of the Anglia transactions, which have been the focus of a Department of Trade and Industry investigation into alleged insider trading, yesterday prompted the Labour party to call on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to refer the affair to the Crown Prosecution Service. Last week, the Financial Times disclosed that Lord Archer's personal orders to buy Anglia shares were the subject of the five-month DTI investigation. Mr Heseltine decided at the end of last month not to launch any prosecutions after the completion of the inquiry. However, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday said: 'One Tory politician should not sit in judgment on another Tory politician.' He urged Mr Heseltine to refer the case to the CPS for urgent investigation. The best-selling author and former Conservative party deputy chairman told the DTI's inspectors that he did not profit from inside information and never received a penny of the proceeds from the shares transaction. He has consistently refused to discuss these transactions, on the advice of his solicitor. However, interviews with officials and stockbrokers familiar with the case has enabled the FT to reconstruct the events leading to the DTI inquiry. The first order from Lord Archer to purchase Anglia shares was placed on January 13. He telephoned a broker at Charles Stanley, the leading private client stockbroker, and said he was interested in buying 25,000 Anglia shares, worth about Pounds 120,000 at the then market price. Lord Archer had not dealt through Charles Stanley before. However, the broker was acquainted with Lord Archer and was happy to deal for him. Daily stock market turnover in Anglia shares at the time was frequently 75,000 shares or less, so this was a sizeable order. The broker said he would see if he could buy that many shares. He succeeded and rang Lord Archer back. Though the broker had assumed that Lord Archer was buying the shares for himself, the novelist then said that he wanted the shares registered in the name of Mr Broosk Saib, an acquaintance of his. According to stockbrokers, it is unusual for one individual to place orders on behalf of another, unless that other person is a spouse or family member. However, the broker complied with Lord Archer's wishes, relying on Lord Archer's bona fides. An account at Charles Stanley was therefore opened for Mr Saib, with whom the firm has never had any personal contact. The following day, Friday January 14, Lord Archer rang the broker again and placed a second order to buy 25,000 shares, once again for the account of Mr Saib. However, the address supplied to the broker for all correspondence with Mr Saib was that of Lord Archer's London penthouse apartment at Alembic House, which overlooks the River Thames near Vauxhall Bridge. Lord Archer asked for both parcels of shares to be bought on 'new time dealing', since January 13 and January 14 were at the end of a stock exchange account period. This meant that the purchases counted as falling into the next account period. New time dealing confers the advantage that the client does not have to pay for the shares for an additional two weeks. However, the price quoted for new time dealing by market makers, the wholesalers from which brokers buy shares, is usually more expensive than the normal price. In the event, however, no money had to be handed over to pay for the Anglia shares, because on the following Tuesday, January 18, when MAI launched its bid, Lord Archer instructed the broker to sell them. The share price soared 180p on that day, netting a profit of Pounds 80,000 on the deal. Charles Stanley said yesterday it could not comment on the affairs of a particular client. However, after any sizeable takeover bid is announced, its senior directors scrutinise dealings by its clients. At such a meeting following the MAI bid for Anglia, the directors noticed that the client who had bought the 50,000 Anglia shares, Mr Saib, apparently had the same address as Lord Archer. They then recalled that Lord Archer's wife, Mary, is a director of Anglia. The firm's compliance officer was then instructed to bring these transactions to the attention of the stock exchange's insider trading group. Within days, the group had conducted its own preliminary investigation and passed the results to the DTI. Meanwhile, Charles Stanley sought advice from the exchange about what to do with the Pounds 80,000 profit. The firm was instructed to pay it to its client in the normal way. The firm therefore sent a cheque made out to Mr Saib to Lord Archer's London address. It has since been cashed through a UK bank.</p>

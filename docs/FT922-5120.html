			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE START of the new account did little to generate activity on the derivative markets, and both traded options and stock index futures on the whole experienced a quiet session, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the June contract on the FT-SE openned at 2,706 but was quickly sold by independent traders sending it the 2,700 level, where it traded in a tight range of about 15 points for most of the session. The weakness in the sterling and the gilts markets added to the lack of interest in the futures, as did the poor opening on Wall Street during the afternoon. However, a burst of activity shortly before the close as James Capel went on a buying spree, lifted June out of the doldrums, and it eventually closed at 2,709, around 7 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash which has dropped to 6 for this account. Volume at 4,021 was very poor. Turnover in traded options was also poor, with only 19,723 contracts dealt by the close. The FT-SE option traded a meagre 5,575 lots. Midland Bank, in which its bidder HSBC has increased its stake, was the most active stock option trading a total of 2,273 contracts. The June 420 calls were the busiest series. This was followed by Lasmo, in which 1,108 lots were traded.</p>

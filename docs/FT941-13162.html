			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / UK is odd man out in China diplomacy: Beijing eases conflicts with other security council members When Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen concluded a visit to Paris this week, he achieved more than simply restoring equilibrium to a troubled relationship. The Sino-French rapprochement means that China has now reduced the number of serious diplomatic conflicts with fellow members of the world's most exclusive club, the UN Security Council, to one - its dispute with Britain over Hong Kong. Nothing could have contrasted more sharply than the emollient words uttered in Paris at the conclusion of Mr Qian's visit and the continuing sour exchanges between Beijing and London. Indeed, troubled Sino-British relations appear to have taken a further turn for the worse with the row over the financing of the new Hong Kong airport flaring up in a way that does not augur well for amicable resolution. China's warning that it would refuse to honour after 1997 financing for the new HKDollars 160bn (Pounds 13.9bn) airport project threatens to strike at the heart of arrangements for a smooth transfer of power. No other capital works project is as important to Hong Kong's integration with the mainland, and the colony's future economic well-being. Britain's problems with China have also been cast in starker relief in recent days by the conspicuous improvement in fractious Sino-US relations after Washington's decision last September to end the 'downward spiral' in its dealings with the People's Republic. Since the Clinton administration resolved to 're-engage' China, a steady stream of senior American officials has passed through Beijing, culminating in the visit last week of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary. These visits have also been accompanied by tangible progress on bothersome issues, including trade disputes, smuggling and illegal immigration. The signing this month, after reasonably amicable negotiations, of a three-year textile quota agreement attested to an improved working relationship. Efforts to lay the groundwork for renewal by President Clinton of most favoured nation (MFN) trading status for China by obliging Beijing to address the human rights issue appear to be making progress; but US officials say that China is still some distance away from meeting Mr Clinton's criteria of 'overall, significant improvement' on human rights. In Paris this week, China appeared to make an important concession by agreeing to discuss for the first time specific US concerns about 235 political prisoners. That undertaking came at a meeting between Mr Qian and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. While Mr Christopher repeated a standard administration line after his session with Mr Qian that China had not met the criteria for continued preferential access to the US market, there is no doubt that odds on MFN renewal have shortened. 'This meeting has carried the process forward but we also believe there is considerable work to be done,' said Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state, former US ambassador to Beijing and chief architect of the Clinton administration's policy on China. A western official in Beijing said that while human rights issues were certain to continue to bedevil China's dealings with the west, there were tentative signs that Beijing may at last be recognising that it could not continue to stonewall western pressures. 'The Americans may have finally convinced the Chinese of the US domestic reality, and that they will have to do something tangible on human rights,' he said. 'The cynical release of a few prisoners on the eve of the MFN decision simply won't fly any more.' China's fence-mending with both the French and the Americans also coincides with the visit to Beijing this week of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister at the head of a mission which includes defence experts. China is seeking increased Russian assistance in the development of its defence industries. It is also anxious to further expand and regulate booming border trade. Total trade between Russia and China increased by 30 per cent last year compared with 1993. Eighty per cent of this trade is conducted through some 20 border crossings. For the Russians, no less than for the Americans and French, access to the booming China market is the engine driving diplomatic relations. France's decision to foreswear further arms sales to Taiwan as the price of better China relations - what France's President Francois Mitterrand described as a 'new orientation' - is recognition of China's growing economic clout. For London, mired in a seemingly intractable dispute over Hong Kong, the unhappy prospect is for continued sour exchanges with Beijing, accompanied by the risk of damage to UK commercial prospects. Emboldened by its success in forcing France to stop new arms sales to Taiwan, and assuming that it clears the MFN hurdle, Beijing is even less likely to yield ground over Hong Kong.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 30 handlers of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York who are subject to regulation under the cranberry marketing order and approximately 1,050 producers of cranberries in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of cranberry producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cranberry marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable cranberries handled from the beginning of such year. The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers of cranberries. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of cranberries. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budget and rate of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee conducted a mail vote and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing order expenses of $164,690 and an assessment rate of $0.03 per 100-pound barrel of cranberries. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budgeted expenses were $155,000, with an approved assessment rate of $0.03 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100-pound barrel of cranberries. This represents an increase of $9,690 in expenses recommended for this fiscal year, with the assessment rate remaining unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $122,580 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4,086,000 barrels of cranberries. The assessment income, plus $3,750 in interest income and a withdrawal of $38,360 from the Committee's authorized reserve fund will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $150,000. The reserve fund will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $70,110 for operating expenses, $40,500 for travel expenses, and $33,241 for administrative expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim final rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 44025, August 26, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began September 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment apply to all assessable cranberries handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action as a final rule without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 929  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cranberries, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 929 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 929_CRANBERRIES GROWN IN STATES OF MASSACHUSETTS, RHODE ISLAND, CONNECTICUT, NEW JERSEY, WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA, OREGON, WASHINGTON, AND LONG ISLAND IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR Part 929 which was published at 59 FR 44025 on August 26, 1994, is adopted as a final rule without change.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Eric M.

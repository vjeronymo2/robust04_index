			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Executive pay Even if some investment managers dislike the high profile stance on executive pay adopted by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey of PosTel, few would disagree that he has a point about long term rolling contracts. Since they make it expensive to fire top managers, they have been one of the main instruments by which failure was rewarded during the recession. Happily there has been a tendency for the duration of such contracts to shorten. Before the Cadbury Report, five years was common; afterwards a three-year rolling contract became the norm. Since PosTel's original intervention the period has tended to shrink further. Some might argue that the media-friendly Mr Ross Goobey is claiming credit for latching on to a trend that was already there. But they would be wrong to assume that discreet pressure from institutions is enough to root out abuse. A public stand, even if it seems inflexible, can help shift behaviour standards. And all Mr Ross Goobey is saying is that he will use his vote to back up his views. That is what shareholder democracy is about. Since rolling contracts were once a necessary part of any package required to attract top quality recruits, one fear is that other incentives, possibly more costly to shareholders, would be needed to replace them. Significantly, though, PosTel claims amendment of existing contracts has not usually involved compensation. In that case, there is every reason to press for the duration of such contracts to be reduced further.</p>

Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), was referring to options  facing Hosokawa in the wake of his failure Friday to push a  package of political reform bills through the House of  Councillors.    He told a news conference that both the ruling and  opposition  parties should join forces to realize political reforms "with  wide perspectives."    Hiraiwa said the worst choice would be to dissolve the Diet  and call a general election because the ensuing political vacuum  would damage the economy.    Prolonged political uncertainty will worsen the economic  situation further as reflected in the steep fall in the value of  the yen and stock prices, he said.    Hiraiwa called on Hosokawa to display leadership in  promoting  political reforms.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: Homage to Tchaikovsky - Ballet Nothing that I have seen thus far during the Bolshoy's season at the Albert Hall persuades me that ballet is anything like itself when served up to audiences on the vast platter of the present stage. Not that dancing cannot 'work' under these surroundings: the Japanese musicians and dancers of the Gagaku troupe, and Merce Cunningham's Prom appearance a few years ago, showed how engrossing and absolutely communicative dance can be in this arena. But neither of these troupes was proscenium-bound: Cunningham has ever propounded freedom of visual choice for his public; Gagaku is court ritual and meant to be seen in the round. Classical choreography, though, is an art in which the creator is centrally concerned with what his audience must see. Making ballet implies an editorial function, stressing incident or step so that the audience is given maximum access to the creator's intentions. (It is a serious problem in televising and filming ballet when directors seek to show what they think important, which runs counter to the logic of the dance itself. A series of hectic films of Balanchine ballets, made in Germany in the 1960s, are testimony to directorial arrogance, and excruciating as records of the choreography). The Bolshoy's Homage to Tchaikovsky programme, which I saw on Wednesday, comprises acts from the composer's three ballets. The stage conditions made them seem ceremonies rather than performances, from which one might pick out certain fascinating elements. I have already reported on the Nutcracker - with some regret, since the charm of Yury Grigorovich's staging evaporates into the hall. The Sleeping Beauty suite offered the last act divertissements preceded by the peasant waltz, and the effect was as if Petipa's (and Tchaikovsky's) essence had been massively diluted. The fairy-tale characters came disconsolately on like the first guests at a costume ball - funereal tempi adopted for the Bluebirds made this lovely duet seem exhausted - while Aurora and her Prince (Nadezhda Gracheva and Andrey Uvarov) looked as if they were plighting their troth on Salisbury Plain. My interest was held, though, by Uvarov; even under these circumstances, he is a remarkably fine dancer. Tall, possessed of a strong and elegant technique, he is a true premier danseur classique - rarest of beings - with that largeness and harmony of style that only Russian training can give. We have much to expect from him. As also from Nikolay Tsitskaridze, who soared through the pretty waltz that tells the story of Cinderella and her prince. Tsitskaridze's dance is fluent, with beautiful physical manners bringing lustre to the simplest academic step. It is clear from this season, whatever else may be unclear, that the Bolshoy has a new generation of gifted young men: Sergey Filin and Yury Klevtsov are also noteworthy talents. The second act of Swan Lake, which completed the evening, became a plotless and dam' near abstract ballet. It was handsome to look at. The Bolshoy women excite our admiration by the grace of their training, and the lines of swans were impeccable. Nina Semizorova was a cool and academically admirable Odette. The effect of so much white costuming and of a pallid back-cloth, of the faint shadows cast on the stage, was anaemic. I thought of other, grandly moving Bolshoy Swan Lakes - with Plisetskaya and Bessmertnova, with Semenyaka, and in a priceless film fragment with the legendary Semyonova (still coaching, and in London with the company), and I wanted to see the Bolshoy Ballet in Swan Lake rather than this dutiful visit to the dear departed's grave. The Bolshoy Ballet continues at the Royal Albert Hall until Feb 14. Programmes change daily.</p>

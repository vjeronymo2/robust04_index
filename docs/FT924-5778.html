			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Recruitment: How to compete with the competitors - The 'cult of winning' that tends to dominate top managements has costs as well as benefits WHEN it comes to rising to the top of a company,what is the Eleventh Commandment? The answer, if we're to believe the American psychologist Albert Bernstein, is: 'No one will tell you the first ten.' In saying as much, he doesn't mean you'll be starved of advice from bosses and workmates on how to win promotion to the heights. On the contrary, they'll be feeding it to you all the time. What he does mean is that the rules and tips which are so spelt out to you, will rarely if ever be the ones that really work. The reason is that the minority of your colleagues who know the effective kind, will be too devious to tell them to a potential rival. If readers see that claim as over-cynical, all the Jobs column can say is that Dr Bernstein's book* is the third to reach me in 12 months which has shed a less than usually flattering light on the abilities needed to mount the summits of big organisations. The other two were by Swedish professor of management Nils Brunsson and his US counterpart *Neanderthals at work, co- authored by Sydney Craft Rozen. John Wiley, Pounds 12.95. Jeffrey Pfeffer. Moreover, much the same picture emerged from the research study by Rob Irving, of the Whitehead Mann head-hunting consultancy, which I reported early in July. 'Once is accident, twice is happenstance, and three times enemy action,' runs the old army saying. Four times, however, may be getting nearer the truth. Albert Bernstein, for his part, maintains that the only way to learn the real commandments of organisational advancement is by quietly keeping your eyes on the behaviour of the people who do get ahead. But that is more easily said than done, he adds, because a good two thirds of us are hindered by our temperaments from absorbing the lessons such observations teach. And to show how, he divides the typical company workforce into three broad types of people. The worst of the trio for would-be top managers to take as models are the Rebels even though they are apt to prove indispensable to their company, especially when crises strike. The most common example nowadays is the computer-system wizard who instantly solves problems which reduce everyone else to despair. Besides being technically expert, the book says, rebels are often creatively intelligent at what they regard as their job. The snag is that they tend to see it as consisting solely of things they enjoy doing, which rarely include routine but necessary procedures such as paperwork. As a result, the rebel type hardly ever rise far up an established managerial hierarchy - which, given their typically still scantier patience with people problems, is no doubt just as well. No such flaws are found in the second type, the Believers, who are probably the most numerous of the three, Since they can be relied on to work hard as well as skilfully even at tasks they dislike, no organisation could survive without them. They are essential not only to the everyday working operations, but also to the running of social activities which foster the company spirit. Moreover, being fair-minded and straightforward in their dealings with other people, they tend to make the best managers of the sort extolled by conventional management theory, at least. Their weakness lies in being what the book describes as 'the original corporate innocents' who, come what may, stand firm in the faith that diligent discharge of their duties is sure to earn its due reward. Hence believers are prone to blame simple injustice rather than any lack of wit on their part when, as is usually the case, they are passed over for promotion to the commanding heights. The type mostly promoted in their stead are the Competitors, described as devotees of 'the cult of winning'. Unlike believers and rebels, they are quick to learn how the company system really works as opposed to the way the formal rules ordain, and then manipulate it to advance their own cause. Whether or not they are acting in the true corporate interest is at best a secondary consideration because the urge to win the game personally tends to blind them to any further purpose it might have. As the book says, they 'see their world as a conflict, with the strongest emerging as the most successful, and success as its own justification.' They have nonetheless at least as good a claim as either of the other types to indispensability. Their company would be unlikely to survive if it didn't have their political skill and ruthlessness to wring profitable deals out of the counterpart competitors heading suppliers and big customers, let alone to outsmart those running predatory rival concerns. The trouble is that they also have ill effects. One of several examples which are cited in the book is that their deviousness about their manipulations of company systems is apt to vitiate productive change. 'The only way to make meaningful change in a corporate culture is to be very specific about what that culture actually is and how it works. The problem is that the people who could write the explicit rules don't think it's in their best interest to do so.' Accordingly, since human societies have never yet found how to rid competitors of their Machiavellian habits, Bernstein thinks the only hope is for the other types to learn to match them at their own political game. That would enable more believers if not rebels to rise to the top, and moderate the typical present incumbents' harmful tendencies as well as widening their vision. True, learning competitors' tricks is far from easy, he says. Winning ploys vary with outfit. Even so, there are enough widespread ones to supply the missing 10 commandments. The first is: Watch the doings of successful colleagues, especially to discover the things superior management values, which should be given priority over those that go un-recognised, however useful. Of the rest, the next three are linked and fairly self-explanatory. Face down fear of failure. Ignore personal limitations - hard work usually compensates Whatever it is, do it now. A corollary is: Be prepared to sacrifice family life. One way to ease the strains of absence, the book says, is to be extra communicative when present. Then come two items of purely personal sacrifice. Abandon the need for praise. 'Competitors don't believe in praise and especially don't see the need to praise other competitors . . . . They might, however, find other ways to show their approval.' Abandon self-importance. 'You will have to accept teasing, defer to other people's opinions and, most of all, to listen when you feel like speaking.' Next comes: Avoid martyrdom, particularly by working harder to make up for incompetent bosses or colleagues. Ninth is: Ask for permission only when strictly necessary, and finally: Be decisive, which need not entail being prudently analytical beforehand. As one of the book's case-study characters observes: 'I've learned that it's not so much what you decide. It's what you do after you decide that's important. That's what makes it into the right or wrong decision.'</p>

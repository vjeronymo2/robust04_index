			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE ACQUIRE MAJORITY INTEREST IN PLAZA PROJECT  </P> <P> Japanese contracting giant Shimizu Corp. has acquired a majority interest in  the $171-million Great American Plaza office complex under construction in  downtown San Diego, Great American Bank announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The announcement capped a two-year search for financing by Great American, a  $16.4-billion savings and loan based in San Diego that will move its  headquarters to the site when construction is completed in 1991. Shimizu Land  Corp., the Japanese firm's American development subsidiary, will be general  partner of the project.  </P> <P> The entire Great American Plaza project will consist of a 34-story,  650,000-square-foot office tower and a 272-room Guest Quarter Suite Hotel. The  plaza will also include the Transportation Galleria, a fully enclosed station  for the San Diego Trolley, which will slice diagonally through the 3-acre site.  The project will also have 22,400 square feet of retail and restaurant space.  </P> <P> Shimizu and Great American will be partners in all components of the project  except the hotel, which will be owned and developed by Starboard Development  Corp. of San Diego, which helped put together the development package. Hotel  financing has yet to be secured.  </P> <P> The developers have also received a $156-million construction loan from  Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo, two of Japan's  largest banks.  </P> <P> Shimizu, which booked $10 billion in worldwide revenues last year, already has  an ownership interest in one other San Diego project, the $150-million Aventine  office-hotel-restaurant complex under construction in La Jolla. Shimizu also  has invested in commercial projects in Atlanta, Hawaii, Los Angeles, Phoenix  and Palm Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> "We started a worldwide search for a quality partner more than a year and a  half ago," said Marc W. Sandstrom, a Great American senior executive vice  president. "But nothing was finalized until last week."  </P> <P> Reports had circulated for weeks that Shimizu was to become an investor in the  project, which is across Kettner Boulevard from the Santa Fe train depot.  Sandstrom declined to specify how much cash Shimizu is contributing to the  development, but did say that, "as the general partner, they are making a  substantial commitment."  </P> <P> Brian T. Galligan, real estate development manager for Shimizu's Los  Angeles-based construction and development subsidiaries, said the company sees  "a bright future for the San Diego area and believes that there are many great  investment opportunities there."  </P> <P> Galligan said Shimizu's investment strategy differs slightly from that of other  Japanese companies that have shown a voracious appetite for existing "trophy"  properties.  </P> <P> "We have never just acquired an existing project," he said. "Most of our  investments are driven by construction opportunities. Instead of just buying a  trophy project, we're building them."  </P> <P> Sandstrom said Great American's objectives at the outset of the project were to  construct a fixture that would develop value for its shareholders and to avoid  committing a substantial amount of its own financial resources.  </P> <P> "We never had any intention of financing this project by ourselves," Sandstrom  said. "Great American's primary business is residential lending, not financing  office towers. We didn't want to have a major commitment.  </P> <P> Although financing had not been secured, ground breaking and excavation for the  underground garage began in May because the developers have promised the  Metropolitan Transit Development Board to have trolley tracks cross the site by  June, 1990.  </P> <P> The transit board, the public agency that operates the trolley system, is in  the midst of expanding its system by adding a "bayside loop" that will go  through the Great American Plaza and provide service to the new San Diego  Convention Center.  </P> <P> Sandstrom said Great American provided funds for the excavation, which was  completed about a month ago, under the condition that it be reimbursed when a  complete financing package was secured. No other construction work has been  started.  </P> <P> Architect is Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn of Chicago. General contractor is M. H.  Golden.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALLING ANGELS GET FLATTENED BY TWINS, 6-3  </P> <P> Post-Oakland depression hit the Angels hard Monday night. The high from  Sunday's exhilarating victory over the Athletics dissipated quickly, bottoming  out all over the field during a 6-3 loss to the Minnesota Twins at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> Apparently, two ninth-inning strikeouts of Jose Canseco and Dave Henderson can  carry a team only so far.  </P> <P> You want offense?  </P> <P> The Angels had 10 hits in 7 2/3 innings against Minnesota starter Allan  Anderson but could turn only two of them into runs.  </P> <P> You want pitching?  </P> <P> Angel starter Kirk McCaskill gave up hits to the first batters he faced, both  Twins eventually scoring. By the sixth inning, he had given up nine hits and  five runs, and by the seventh inning, he was finished.  </P> <P> You want defense?  </P> <P> Angel left fielder Chili Davis was at it again, committing one error that led  directly to one Minnesota run and reacting creatively to a couple of other  balls hit in his direction.  </P> <P> The loss left the Angels 2-5 since this home stand began, dropping them 1 1/2  games behind first-place Oakland in the American League West. The Athletics  were idle Monday, but, at least in spirit, they didn't appear to be the only  ones.  </P> <P> The possibility of an Angel letdown was addressed in Manager Doug Rader's  postgame interview session, but Rader did his best to deny it.  </P> <P> "I think we kept the weekend in perspective and there wasn't a letdown," Rader  claimed. "We were not flat.  </P> <P> "We were on defense a lot early and didn't get our offense going early. We  didn't have a lot of activity on the bases and that might indicate a letdown,  but there wasn't one."  </P> <P> The evidence, however, would suggest otherwise.  </P> <P> McCaskill (12-7) was in trouble from the outset, giving up a leadoff single to  Al Newman, who advanced to third on Dan Gladden's double.  </P> <P> Just the way you like to face Kirby Puckett for the first time of the night:  With no outs and two runners in scoring position.  </P> <P> Puckett drove in one run by grounding out to second base. Clean-up hitter Randy  Bush drove in the other with a single to left field, giving the Twins a 2-0  lead.  </P> <P> In the fourth inning, the Angel defense began to break down around McCaskill.  Bush opened the inning with a flare to left field, which should have dropped  for a single but wound up skipping under Davis' glove for an error, allowing  Bush to take second.  </P> <P> Two outs later, Brian Harper singled home Bush and Minnesota led, 3-1.  </P> <P> McCaskill worked a scoreless inning in the fifth, only to work his way into  difficulty in the sixth. With one out, Gary Gaetti singled and Jim Dwyer  walked, with Harper's sharp grounder to third base moving both runners into  scoring position.  </P> <P> And score they did, with John Moses blooping a hit down the left-field line and  into Davis territory again. Davis took awhile to collect the baseball and when  he did, he made amends, of sort -- throwing to second baseman Johnny Ray, who  slapped a tag on Moses to end the inning.  </P> <P> But by then it was a 5-1 game, and McCaskill was looking at an early departure.  He pitched to one more batter, Wally Backman, who opened the seventh inning  with a double into the left-field corner. On came Angel relief pitcher Greg  Minton, who yielded hits to the first two Twins he faced, with the first, a  single by Newman, scoring Backman with Minnesota's sixth run.  </P> <P> McCaskill was charged with six runs (five earned) on 10 hits in six-plus  innings, his earned-run average rising from 2.81 to 3.00.  </P> <P> "He had good stuff, but couldn't locate it well," Rader said. "Sometimes he  gets preoccupied with location.  </P> <P> "But that isn't a big indictment, because a couple of the hits he gave up were  so-so. But a hit is a hit. It was not a fortunate night for Kirk."  </P> <P> Nor for Minton, whose August struggles continue. In his previous six outings,  Minton had surrendered 10 earned runs and 12 hits in five innings -- including  three home runs in his last two innings. And Monday, Minton gave up five hits  in 2 2/3 innings, leaving in the ninth with two outs and two runners on base.  </P> <P> Rader blamed the reliever's tailspin on too much reliance on his specialty  pitch, the sinking fastball.  </P> <P> "Minton still needs to start throwing some other pitches," Rader said. "He  needs to start throwing a breaking ball -- and he will."  </P> <P> Anderson (14-9) failed to complete the eighth inning when he began to complain  of a twinge in his upper back. With two outs in the eighth, Minnesota Manager  Tom Kelly brought on reliever Juan Berenguer, who yielded the Angels' final  run.  </P> <P> Berenguer walked the first man he faced, Tony Armas, and gave up a single to  the next, Lance Parrish. Pinch-hitter Jack Howell followed with a bloop double  down the left-field line that scored Armas and might have scored Parrish had a  fan not reached over the field-box railing and touched the ball.  </P> <P> Fan interference was called, holding Parrish at third. Parrish was stranded  when Kent Anderson grounded to first for the third out.  </P> <P> Jeff Reardon retired the Angels in order in the ninth, earning his 22nd save.  </P> <P> "There was nothing glaringly wrong tonight," Rader kept insisting. "We just  gave up a few hits and got beat. No need to dissect any further."  </P> <P> For the Angels, there's only a need for new inspiration before 7:30 tonight.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Starting on the left side of the Angel infield Monday night were Kent Anderson  at shortstop and Bobby Rose at third base. Manager Doug Rader gave Rose, 23,  his first major league start, teaming him with rookie Anderson, the  injury-replacement for Dick Schofield. Why? Because Rader wanted to give his  regular third baseman, Jack Howell, a night away from the pennant race. Howell  is mired in a three-for-34 slump and was coming off a particularly rough  series, both in the field and at the plate, against Oakland. "I just wanted to  get Jackie away from it, like I've done with others from time to time," Rader  said. "He can get away to work with Deron (Johnson, Angel hitting coach) with  the batting cage without the pressure of playing today." Rose was recalled from  double-A Midland last week to fill the roster vacancy created when Schofield  was placed on the 21-day disabled list.  </P> <P> Designated hitters Brian Downing and Claudell Washington traded places Monday,  with Downing returning to the lineup in time to replace Washington, who was  sidelined after receiving a cortisone injection in his left shoulder Sunday.  Downing hadn't played since Aug. 4 because of a flare-up of his chronic  rib-cage condition. Washington was available only for pinch-run duty and  figures to be a few days away from returning to the Angel outfield. . . .  Reserve catcher Bill Schroeder was also relegated to the bench after receiving  a cortisone shot in his right elbow Sunday. Schroeder underwent elbow surgery  when he played for Milwaukee in 1986 and, according to Angel trainer Rick  Smith, has had periodic problems with inflammation in the elbow ever since.  With starter Lance Parrish playing with a tightly wrapped sore rib cage, rookie  John Orton, 23, was the only able-bodied catcher on the Angel roster.  </P> <P> Bert Blyleven, the 38-year-old who might never grow up, still gets a kick out  of watching things blow up. For Monday's prank, Blyleven strolled quietly past  a huddle of sportswriters in the Angel clubhouse and nonchalantly dropped a  firecracker on the floor. Off it went within feet of the writers, rattling a  few eardrums and causing Rader to open the door of his office and peer out at  the smoke. "Schoey, stop fooling around," he yelled at Schofield, the  mild-mannered shortstop who usually makes about as much noise as a rosin bag.  Blyleven and Rader both grinned knowingly and then went off to resume their  daily rounds.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rowan Dore, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Britain today told Sudan to "immediately reconsider"  its decision to expel the British ambassador.    The Foreign Office gave Sudan'a fundamentalist Islamic  government a deadline of Tuesday January 4 to think again.    As the already strained relations between the two countries  worsened, the Sudanese charges d'affaires in London, Abdul  Rahman Bakhit [name as received], was summoned to the Foreign  Office to explain the "totally unjustified expulsion."    He left after a 35-minute meeting with Sir Michael Burton,  the assistant under-secretary covering the Middle East, Near  East and North Africa.    Officials said he had been given a strong rebuke and was  told  that his explanation for the expulsion of envoy Peter Streams  was "wholly inadequate."    Mr. Bakhit had said one of the reasons for the expulsion was  Mr. Streams' persistent contacts with opposition leaders in the  southern rebel-held area of Sudan.    The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. George Carey, is currently  on a high-profile visit to Christians in southern Sudan.    Foreign Office officials said the visit had merely brought  to  a head a simmering situation between Britain and Sudan.    In a strongly worded statement after the meeting, the  Foreign  Office said Sir Michael had underlined Britain's "profound  dissatisfaction and regret" at the "unjustifiable" decision to  expel the ambassador.    Mr. Bakhit had told Sir Michael that Mr. Streams was seen as  an "obstruction to attempts to improve bilateral relationships."  His contact with opposition figures was also criticised.    Sir Michael dismissed these explanations as "wholly  inadequate" and asked Mr. Bakhit to convey this message to his  government together with the request to "immediately reconsider"  the expulsion if it valued its relationship with the UK.    The Foreign Office said Mr. Streams was a highly respected  ambassador who had reported back to it about human rights abuses  in Sudan. A spokesman said: "We consider our ambassadors have a  duty to report a wide range of political views."    He added: "We value our relationship with the Sudanese  government but we want to see progress in finding a just  solution to the current war in the south."    Asked if Britain was considering retaliation such as  expelling Sudan representatives in London, the spokesman said:  "It is clearly one of the options, but we do have to await the  response of the Sudanese government."    Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs  spokesman, warned against Britain adopting a "tit-for-tat  attitude" in the row with Sudan.    "If you want to get to grips with the real problem, which is  the application of Islamic fundamentalism to the rule of the  state, you don't help dialogue by breaking off relations," he  told Radio 4's "The World at One."</p>

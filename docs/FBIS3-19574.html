			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Bjorn Mansson: "Things Look Bad for the </F> Nonsocialist Parties"]    [Text] Things look bad for both the Center Party and the  National Coalition (Conservative) Party a little over a year  before the parliamentary election, notes Bjorn Mansson, who  discusses what they could do to try to avoid a Social Democratic  hegemony after the election, something that would be unfortunate  for democracy and the economy.    With only a little over a year left until the parliamentary  election in March 1995, the situation does not look bright for  the two big nonsocialist government parties.    The Coalition Party has borne government responsibility  since  1987 and thus shares the blame for both the economic crisis,  whose origins should be sought during the so-called  conservative-socialist government era, and the way in which it  was handled. Finance Minister Iiro Viinanen has become a  prominent symbol of the necessary, but unpopular austerity  policy.    The Center Party has only been in the government since 1991  and thus does not bear the same responsibility for the crisis,  but it is responsible for how it has been handled. Prime  Minister Esko Aho symbolizes what many see as a total failure in  economic policy, the worst consequence of which is half a  million people out of work.    Thus it was no wonder that neither party's candidate did  very  well in the presidential election. Ironically Raimo Ilaskivi,  who, like the leftists, sharply criticized the government's  economic policy, made a poorer showing than his party -- while  Paavo Vayrynen, who was less critical of the government,  received more votes than his party would get just now.    In a party poll in connection with one of the last  presidential polls, both parties had a support level of 17.5  percent -- compared with 15.2 for Ilaskivi and 19.5 for Vayrynen  in the election.    Together with the third nonsocialist party of any  consequence, the SFP [Swedish People's Party], the Center and  Coalition parties reach a level of about 40 percent. The rest of  the nonsocialist party field consists mainly of remnants.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP) had a rating of 32.5  percent in the same poll, almost as much as the Center and  National Coalition parties combined. In addition, electoral  mathematics favor a big party so that with this share of the  votes the Social Democrats would get as many seats in parliament  on their own as the Center and Coalition parties combined.    If the more than 10 percent the Left Alliance (Communist)  received is included, it brings the left wing up to almost 45  percent. If the SDP and the VL [Left Alliance] also form an  election alliance, while the nonsocialists run separately, they  could win at least half of the seats.    However an election alliance with the VL, including the  former Taistoites, could be risky for the SDP. But even without  this, the socialists and the Greens combined could easily win a  red-green parliamentary majority.    With the SDP as the backbone of the government, Lipponen as  prime minister, and Ahtisaari as president, the risk of  single-party hegemony is obvious. This is always dangerous with  reference to democracy's ability to function and when the SDP is  involved, there is also a risk to the national economy. The  socialist-conservative extravagance when Erkki Liikanen was  finance minister was a central cause of the crisis.    The Social Democrats would be in an excellent position with  regard to choosing nonsocialist government partners, there is  reportedly a conservative and an environmentally-oriented school  within the party already. The Coalition and Center parties would  be destined to vie for the SDP's favor.    What can the nonsocialist parties do to avoid this kind of  political situation?    If the SDP and the VL form an election alliance, the  nonsocialists may also be forced to give much more consideration  to taking a similar step than they have so far -- including an  alliance between the Center and National Coalition parties.    However, it would be almost impossible to push through a  cooperative agreement on the government formation, like the  "strongbox agreement" before the 1987 election -- and it would  not last anyway. And no matter how much they may be tempted to  seek revenge for the SDP's treachery in 1991 by forcing a  possibly scant red-green majority to rule alone in a similar  way, the nonsocialist parties should display a greater sense of  responsibility.    One of the nonsocialist parties' problems involves political  leadership: The Center Party appears to have an oversupply of  leaders competing with each other, while the question is whether  the Coalition Party has any at all.    There is already a rumor in the Center Party that Vayrynen  is  on the point of allying himself with Seppo Kaariainen, who could  then have a chance to defeat Aho for the post of party leader.  However, for good or ill such a shift would involve a return to  the agrarians. Therefore, the most likely thing is that the  party congress will give Aho a continued mandate, but that party  secretary Tikka may have to go.    Unless Vayrynen himself challenges Aho, which he does not  seem to have ruled out. However, that would turn the clock back  in a different way.    The presidential election results give the Center Party some  hope in a way: After all the three Center candidates did win a  good 28 percent of the votes. If we assume that up to half of  those who voted for Korhonen and Kuuskoski were Center people,  one out of four of those who voted for Vayrynen are not  currently Center Party supporters. In other words they represent  a potential.    In the National Coalition Party, party leader Pertti  Salolainen's weakness is being revealed with increasing  frequency. At the same time veteran, Ilaskivi did poorly  (Coalition voters obviously preferred Rehn in the presidential  election!) and former speaker Ilkka Suominen is leaving the  political arena. Who is left except Viinanen?    The Coalition Party's gambit of backing a young new minister  may have been smart with a view to young voters. The Center  Party will have its chance soon when Ministers Pura and Pokka  resign.    However, the nonsocialist parties cannot save themselves  simply through image-enhancing cosmetic moves. Political  substance is also required.    If economic developments take a serious turn that also has  an  impact on employment, and if the European Union (EU)  negotiations can be brought to a conclusion that satisfies the  entire country, much will have been won. But if not?    The government should not make any radical changes in its  economic policy for tactical purposes, especially as this policy  has finally begun to bear fruit. On the contrary, it should  continue to pursue the course it has embarked on, especially as  the balance of payments surplus has created more room for active  efforts.    The SDP's warnings about an "election budget" are extremely  hollow -- isn't it the SDP that has always demanded  "stimulation" of the domestic market?    Vayrynen's relative success and especially Elisabeth Rehn's  unequivocal one in the presidential election demonstrated  convincingly that the voters respect consistency and honesty  more than evasions and empty promises.</p>

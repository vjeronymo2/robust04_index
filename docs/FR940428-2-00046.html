Questar explains that these existing non-main-line, single-well connection facilities, comprising 7,916 feet of 3-inch and 4-inch pipeline, are used to gather volumes produced from the Antelope production area of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, for delivery into the Table Rock facilities of Colorado Interstate Gas Company. Questar further states that its JL No. 21 and Lateral 495 were installed under certifications issued to Questar's predecessor, Mountain Fuel Supply Company, in Docket No. CP74&hyph;133, as amended, on May 3, 1976 (55 FPC 2074) and on March 21, 1978 (2 FERC &para;61,255). Questar states that as of December 31, 1993, the total gross plant investment associated with the facilities is approximately $38,200. Questar now believes that the facilities now qualify as ``gathering'' in light of the Commission's ``modified primary function test.'' Questar states that no customer's service will be terminated as the result of granting the requested authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> May 10, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRESS ;  </P> <P> THE GULF CRISIS: FINDING FAULT  </P> <P> Editorial comment from around the world reveals some sharply differing  perspectives on the current confrontation in the Persian Gulf. The Saudi press  may be vitriolic in its condemnation of Saddam Hussein, for example, but a  major Palestinian weekly published in East Jerusalem puts the blame for the  crisis squarely on the United States. The Japanese press is proud that its  government acted more boldly than usual in declaring an Iraqi oil boycott, but  France's Le Monde reflects concern that Washington may be about to drag its  allies deeper into crisis than they want to go.  </P> <P>  "Many Japanese decisions to impose economic sanctions in the past were  delayed, because the Japanese government lacks autonomy or independence in its  diplomacy. As a result, Japan usually makes its decision after seeing what  Europe and America intend to do. However, it should be highly evaluated that  Japan has made the decision comparatively quickly this time . . .  </P> <P> "At a time like this, even if sacrifices must be made, we must abide by  international opinion with simple honesty. That is the path that Japan, which  until now been evaluated only for its economic power, should seek."  </P> <P>  -- Asahi Shimbun (Tokyo)  </P> <P> "Saddam got it wrong when his smash-and-grab raid on Iran dragged on for nearly  a decade. He got it wrong again when he discounted world reaction to his  invasion of Kuwait this month. But he hung on against an enemy three times  larger for eight years without defeat; he still holds Kuwait, from which his  enemies cannot evict him without ruining what they want to save, and there can  be no denying that he has the capacity to surprise us all. To say he is just  feeling vulnerable and lonely is to make the same kind of mistake as those who  claim all bullies are cowards. Saddam Hussein should not be underestimated or  written off -- a warning that the Iranians probably need rather less than  anyone else."  </P> <P>  -- The Guardian (London)  </P> <P> "Saddam is not crazy, for if he were, he would not have achieved the military  success he has done so far. He is a shrewd, cold-blooded megalomaniac,  carefully considering every move he makes. But that is not what concerns the  world. Even that can be dealt with. His ridiculous propaganda against the  kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country that clothed and fed his people, supported  them when they were under attack, poured millions of dollars daily to support  their causes, can be put down to his own desperation and treachery. How could a  man who shot 21 of his own Cabinet ministers have serious intentions in the  spread of Islam? What sort of leader who turns a blind eye to the raping,  looting and killing going on in a fellow Muslim country could gain the smallest  modicum of trust from other Muslims? All his rantings are a mere comedy; the  blackest comedy of the century. . . .  </P> <P> "Ultimately, he is a fool, squirming and frothing hysteria in a trench of his  own making. All he can do now is spread dissension, threaten havoc and look for  his own survival, politically and personally. 'The Father-Leader' is nothing  more than a fool and a common thug; a man with a common mortal destiny he will  one day share with his victims."  </P> <P>  -- Arab News (English-language daily in Saudi Arabia)  </P> <P> "In the history of crime, personal or political, seldom appears a man who is  ashamed of his evil deed. Saddam has demonstrated through his successive moves  since Aug. 1 that he is proud rather than repentant of his crime of savagery. .  . .  </P> <P> Saddam ordered his troops to invade Kuwait. A supposed brother was happily  killing a true brother who had resolutely stood by the side of Iraq when it was  facing a formidable enemy. Saddam cut the hand that fed him for a decade. Then  he planned to invade Saudi Arabia. This is the height of Saddam's ingratitude,  as during the Gulf War, the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments and people helped his  regime even at the cost of their own comfort.  </P> <P> "This man must be stopped, because all his power and might is due only to the  sacrifices of Saudi, Kuwaiti and other Gulf Arab people. . . .  </P> <P> "It is imperative to push Iraq back from Kuwait, restore that country to the  rightful rules as demanded by its people, and above all, punish Saddam Hussein  -- the killer of Arabs -- even if it means his removal from power. That last  thing is also in the interests of the Iraqi people who have been mercilessly  suppressed by the police state established by Saddam.  </P> <P>  -- Saudi Gazette  </P> <P> (English-language Saudi daily)  </P> <P> "The issue has changed from an Iraqi-Kuwaiti confrontation into an  Arab-American one. . . .  </P> <P> We were hoping that the Arabs would be divided into three fronts, namely the  two disputants and a third front, led by Egypt to mediate. We were, however,  disappointed after the summit conference as the Egyptian state put its full  weight behind one of the two parties, thus deepening the division and rendering  impossible an Arab settlement that would remove the justification of a foreign  interference.  </P> <P> A principle and an observation has to be asserted here. The principle is that  the difference among the Arab ranks must cease immediately, or be graded down  to a secondary importance once the fighting is turned into an Arab-American  one. "We are not interested now in how the conflict has been transformed into  its current picture! Who started the problem? Why did he start it? Was he right  in triggering it? Was it possible to avoid the crisis or prevent its  exacerbation? Such questions are meaningless now and are of interest only to  historians. It is an interest of the Arab and Islamic peoples now that armies  of all the arrogant are flocking and coming together to hit an Arab-Islamic  country. . . .  </P> <P> "Our people cannot forgive those who invited these foreign forces to our  homeland. We cannot forgive those who are enabling aliens and enemies to break  our necks. . . .  </P> <P> "This talk is applicable to any country and any ruler. What then may be the  case when the country desecrated by the foreign forces is the territory of the  two holy shrines of Islam? How may disgrace and concession go as far as  bringing enemies to protect the territory of Islam and its sacred places?"  </P> <P>  -- Al Shaab  </P> <P> (Publication of Egypt's opposition Socialist Labor Party)  </P> <P> "France and its two big Occidental allies (Britain and the United States) are  not quite on the same wave length regarding the crisis in the gulf. . . .  </P> <P> "France's political audience, the old and numerous friendships she maintains in  the Arab world, and on the whole, the respect that she has in all the  continents obliges her a certain cautiousness for which America has little  concern.  </P> <P> "Very quickly, France sensed the danger that she was running, giving the  impression of joining an old, colonial-smelling crusade on Arab ground. And she  fears to be involved against her will in an American military adventure. This  explains her concern to clearly disassociate herself from an attitude probably  seen as too warlike. . . .  </P> <P> "The French position runs a long term risk. It gives Saddam Hussein reasons to  hope that the 'Occidental front' will crack a little more each day."  </P> <P>  -- Le Monde (Paris)  </P> <P> "Evidently, the U.S. and Jordan cannot be said to have started seeing things in  the same light.  </P> <P> "The U.S. Administration, Congress and public, had whipped up a feverish  campaign against Iraq that would have been difficult to calm under any  circumstances or outside influence. The campaign would have been further  aggravated by the accusations that continue to fly between Washington and  Baghdad over the past two days.  </P> <P> "Doubtless, it was painful and difficult. The question now is, if pessimism  prevails, what will be next."  </P> <P>  -- Jordan Times (Amman)  </P> <P> "The drums of war are already being beaten in the Middle East, as developments  in the gulf accelerate unpredictably. Unless a miracle occurs, the region  appears headed for a total explosion.  </P> <P> "This state of affairs is the direct responsibility of the United States, which  is leading the international buildup of military forces and the imposition of  sanctions in an unprecedented attack on Iraq . . .  </P> <P> "We do not believe that U.S. moves against Iraq are based on Iraq's occupation  of Kuwait or its alleged threat to Saudi Arabia. . . . The motive for the  expected U.S. attack on Iraq is . . . Iraq's frank opposition to the United  State's treatment of the Palestinians and violation of Arab interests. . . .  </P> <P> "Is a Middle East Vietnam necessary to convince those who want to recolonize  the region of the dangers they are dragging themselves and the world into?"  </P> <P>  -- Al Fajr (Palestinian weekly published in East Jerusalem)  </P> <P> "Iraq has a key place in the Arab and Islamic world, and its past generations'  achievements are recorded in golden words. Let its present leadership not  negate all that. Let the future generations of the Arabs, of Iraq itself, not  curse it for acting so irrationally and arrogantly. Mr. Saddam Hussein must  retrace his steps to restore honor and credibility to the Iraqi people. It's a  question of human dignity and survival."  </P> <P>  -- Khaleej Times (Dubai)  </P></p>

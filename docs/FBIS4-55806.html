			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 22 May (TANJUG) -- The UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] command in former Bosnia-Herzegovina has  officially informed the republic of Srpska army's main  headquarters that the Muslim side did not sign an annex to the  agreement on the cease-fire and cessation of hostilities within  the 3-km zone around Gorazde which was supposed to come into  effect at 1800 this evening. This was reported by the  information service of the republic of Srpska army's main  headquarters late this evening.    According to a public statement received by TANJUG, the  information service points out that the annex to the agreement  was signed by the republic of Srpska army and UNPROFOR  representatives but that it cannot be implemented because the  Muslim side rejected it. "By refusing to sign the agreement  mentioned above, the Muslims have assumed all responsibility and  once again confirmed their military option for resolving the  crisis on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina," the  statement issued by the information service of the main  headquarters of the republic of Srpska army said in conclusion.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is warning that its patience and  calmness should not be misinterpreted as weakness. ECOMOG is  reminding the factions that Article 8 of the Cotonou Accord  allows ECOMOG the right of self-defense but it does not wish to  be compelled to implement this section of the accord.    According to a release issued last night, ECOMOG noted that  the practice whereby all the factions abduct ECOMOG soldiers at  will must stop. The release noted that while ECOMOG's neutral  position in this crisis is unquestionable and so far as ECOMOG  will not [words indistinct] helplessly while its men and  material are being maltreated and vandalized, ECOMOG says its  patience should not be misinterpreted as a weakness.    The release continued that about two weeks ago, nine ECOMOG  soldiers belonging to the Ugandan contingent were abducted by  the LPC [Liberian Peace Council] for no reason whatsoever and  kept in captivity for about three days. Also, another soldier  was kidnapped by the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]  early this year and is yet to be released. Similarly, five  ECOMOG soldiers are still being held by ULIMO fighters.    ECOMOG wishes to reassure the people of Liberia and the  international community that ECOMOG is religiously committed to  the principle and spirit of the Cotonou Accord. ECOMOG says  this commitment is evidenced by the way ECOMOG troops have  continued to remain calm in the face of extremely reckless  provocations.    Meanwhile, the West African peacekeeping force has described  as baseless and false allegations being made by the warring  factions in the Liberian crisis against ECOMOG. ECOMOG says  these allegations are only intended to discredit ECOMOG and its  invaluable role and responsibility as a neutral peacekeeping  force.    In a statement issued last night, ECOMOG said while these  allegations would not have required any rebuttal, it is  necessary to stop [words indistinct]. In the statement, ECOMOG  said in March this year, ECOMOG, in collaboration with UNOMIL  [UN Observer Mission in Liberia], initiated a cease-fire  negotiation between the NPFL and LPC but to their disappointment  both sides proved not to be honest and serious about achieving  peace. On two occasions, ECOMOG and UN joint reconnaissance  missions to ascertain the disposition of the opposing forces  were frustrated by the NPFL. On its part, the LPC has refused  to cease hostilities so that ECOMOG can deploy its troops.  ECOMOG says it is preposterous, therefore, for the NPFL and LPC  to turn around after all these efforts to cast aspersions as to  ECOMOG's neutrality.    On the ULIMO issue, ECOMOG noted that in March, April, and  May this year, series of reconciliatory meetings were held, all  initiated by ECOMOG at the ECOMOG headquarters with UNOMIL  officials in attendance to resolve the rift between Alhaji  Koromah and Roosevelt Johnson to enable the peace process move  forward. The cease-fire agreements reached at these meetings  were not respected by either party. Still in an attempt to  curtail the mayhem in Tubmanburg, Bong mines, and Bo, ECOMOG  deployed troops to these areas as a confidence-building measure  and to deter the fighters of the two factions from further  carnage. The release said in spite of all these, the fighting  persisted, thereby endangering the lives of ECOMOG officers and  men as well as material deployed to these areas.    The release concluded that since ECOMOG is a neutral  multinational force whose mandate is to ensure that peace  returns to Liberia, it did all that was humanly possible short  of combat action to stop the carnage without success.</p>

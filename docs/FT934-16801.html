			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Economic virtue brings Mexico little reward: Low growth may put market reforms at risk MEXICO'S reward for eight years of text-book market economic policies is proving scant. Modest growth of 2.4 per cent last year gave way to a 1.4 per cent expansion in the first half of this year, while growth in the second quarter amounted to just 0.3 per cent, with agriculture and manufacturing contracting by 3.7 per cent and 1.1 per cent. For Mexico's ruling party, which faces a presidential election in August, the low growth threatens to erode support for the pro-market economic reforms of the past decade. All year, businesses, unions and farmers have been clamouring for more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Some of these demands were met on Sunday when President Carlos Salinas announced measures agreed in the annual pact between government, unions and the private sector. These included a cut in corporate and employment taxes, and a more than 15 per cent increase in the minimum wage by next year. That would see the government with a balanced budget next year, down from an expected surplus this year of about 1.1 per cent of GDP. Despite such fiscal prudence, the economy remains vulnerable, particularly if the North American Free Trade Agreement is not approved as scheduled by January 1. Were Nafta rejected, the government might have to push interest rates even higher than the 8 per cent real rate already seen to protect the exchange rate. A greater problem might be the uncertainty of another postponement of the treaty. Investment, the main engine of economic growth over the past two years, has slowed sharply this year, partly in response to high interest rates, but also as nervous businessmen await the Nafta outcome. Meanwhile, Mexico's private sector is undergoing a radical transformation to compete under free trade and unregulated domestic markets. Most businesses have cut production in unprofitable lines, fired workers, and closed factories. In the short term, such actions have contributed to the slowdown. Mr Sebastian Edwards, the chief economist for Latin America at the World Bank, says: 'It takes a lot of time for reforms to work. The big question is whether there is enough patience in a democracy, or semi-democracy, to wait long enough for the results.' Mr Edwards emphasises that many of Mexico's important economic reforms, such as widespread privatisation, deregulation, and the opening to international capital markets, only occurred after President Salinas came to power in 1989. The reform of Mexico's ejido (quasi-communal) farm system was not finalised until the end of last year, and with regularisation of land titles going slowly, will not have any positive impact for some time. Mexico's labour laws still encourage rigid work practices, and the country has, according to Mr Edwards, the most distorted system of severance payments in all Latin America. This has made the job of restructuring Mexican companies more onerous than it could have been. For the moment a reform of the labour laws is out of the question. As the new social pact reflected, the ruling party is nervous about upsetting the unions in the run-up to the presidential election. And any attempt to weaken unions before the US congressional vote on Nafta would almost certainly create a furore in the US. However, Mr Salinas yesterday announced a radical reform of Mexico's agricultural sector, replacing price supports with direct cash grants to farmers. Later this year, he is expected to propose a new liberal foreign investment law and legislation allowing more private investment in railways and airports. A government official says the increased emphasis on micro-economic reform accompanied by a gentle relaxation of fiscal policy will lead to economic growth of around 3.5 per cent next year. If such growth is not obtained, then the 'Mexican model' may start to lose its lustre.</p>

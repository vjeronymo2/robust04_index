			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Wednesday [6 April] he has no intention of giving  up the premiership, reiterating his denial of reported remarks  by him that he wants to quit, officials close to the premier's  Japan New Party (JNP) said.    The officials said the premier told a JNP legislator over  breakfast, "I neither said such a thing nor have I developed  such an idea. I am dismayed." He was referring to reported  remarks by two legislators that he said Tuesday he wants to  resign.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, however, told a  news conference, "Given the circumstances, the premier should  not make remarks indicating he might step down."    Takemura denied the incident will affect the Diet budget  debate, currently stalled by a dispute between the ruling  coalition and the opposition camp over Hosokawa's allegedly  dubious personal finances. The chief cabinet secretary spoke of  the need for the government to redouble efforts to achieve a  breakthrough in the stalled Diet business next week.    Hosokawa told reporters early Wednesday that he has not said  anything about resigning over dinner Tuesday evening at a  Japanese-style restaurant in Tokyo with two legislators of the  House of Councillors.    One of the two legislators, Yasushi Shimomura of the Niin  Club, a small political party, quoted Hosokawa as telling him  and his colleague Kiyoshi Nishikawa, "I want to resign as I am  exhausted." Nishikawa confirmed what Shimomura said but added  he took the premier's remark as a joke.    In the stalled Diet budget proceedings, the opposition has  pressed the premier to account for his 1982 acceptance of 100  million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Trucking Network, a  conglomerate at the center of a scandal involving gangsters,  politicians and money.    Hosokawa described the 100 million yen as a loan but  legislators of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  said they suspect it is an unreported political donation.    The opposition camp has also demanded summoning Hosokawa's  former Financial Secretary Masatoshi Miyama to testify in the  Diet on allegations that Hosokawa distributed the money in 1982  to Kumamoto Prefectural Assembly legislators during his campaign  to secure the governorship of the prefecture. Hosokawa has  rejected the demand to have Miyama testify.    Meanwhile, the premier's coalition partners scrambled to  defend him Wednesday morning.    Kozo Watanabe, a Shinseito leader, told reporters, "Whether  it is a lawmaker or cabinet minister, it can happen that a  person develops a desire to resign when the person is going  through difficult times."    "I think his remarks were carelessly uttered," Watanabe  said.  Shinseito is a key member of the seven-party ruling coalition.    Watanabe also told reporters, "I believe the prime minister  has not renounced his determination to continue to live up to  his prime ministerial duties."    The reported resignation remarks "were a mere happening  whose  repercussions will fade away in a day," Watanabe said.    Watanabe said he contacted Hosokawa by telephone Tuesday  night to ask him about his reported resignation remark.  Watanabe quoted Hosokawa as telling him, "It puzzles me why it  has caused such a stir. I do not have any desire to do so."    Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  told  reporters, "The prime minister denied that he made such remarks.  We really have to take his denial at face value. He has  demonstrated his desire to exercise his power."    Murayama also denied that the reported remark will affect  the  political situation.    Another senior SDP official, however, said of the premier's  reported remarks, "Without question, the premier has lost his  nerve." The SDP is the largest coalition party.    A senior official of new party Sakigake, also a coalition  partner, said, "Whether the premier made that statement or not,  he will not be able to revive his fortunes. The political  situation has become fluid."</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MORE JAPANESE WOMEN REJECT HOUSEWIFE ROLE : 'JOB WITH 3 FREE MEALS AND SIESTA'  </P> <P> A job with three free meals a day and time for a siesta. That's how one old  Japanese saying describes the woman's role in marriage.  </P> <P> Many Japanese women these days are rejecting that arrangement and getting  divorces, although they often find it hard to earn a living on their own in  Japan's heavily male-dominated society.  </P> <P> Women have initiated 70% of the 155,000 divorces filed annually over the last  10 years. There were none at all until the end of World War II, before which  only men were entitled to dissolve a marriage.  </P> <P> "Japan's divorce rate is still very low compared to Western nations," said  Yoriko Madoka, a divorce counselor in Tokyo. "But it doesn't mean there are  more happy families here. They just can't afford it financially."  </P> <P> Madoka, a former journalist, said she started her business 12 years ago after  seeing the cheerfulness of divorced women in Scandinavia.  </P> <P> Divorce in Japan was traditionally seen as a disgrace for women, whose most  important task in society was serving their family. Two divorced women who were  interviewed for this article, for example, asked that their last names not be  used.  </P> <P> There are also financial consequences for divorced women. Most divorced women  here receive little or no alimony.  </P> <P> "It is amazing how people's attitudes have changed over the last 10 years,"  Madoka said. "But the gloomy image of divorce here will not disappear  completely until women can get jobs to overcome financial difficulties after a  divorce."  </P> <P> "I really enjoy my life. It's like going back to my youth," said Sachiko, 42,  who persuaded her husband to give her a divorce two years ago, one year after  she left him and their two grown daughters in the western city of Osaka.  </P> <P> She said that, like some other Japanese women, she put up with a violent,  alcoholic husband for more than 20 years until her children could fend for  themselves.  </P> <P> After initially living with a friend and helping her run a coffee shop, Sachiko  now works for a Tokyo company preparing tea and coffee for its employees. She  has found a new partner and plans to marry soon.  </P> <P> However, not many women are as lucky as Sachiko.  </P> <P> Most companies will not employ women over 30, and statistics show that women  who do find full-time work earn only 70% of their male counterparts' pay. That  figure drops to 50% when part-timers are included.  </P> <P> "This is why many women prefer to stay with their spouses even after all  affection has gone," Madoka said.  </P> <P> She recounts the case of one woman who had lived with her husband for decades  but had hardly seen him in years. Her husband developed a relationship with  another woman and only came home late at night to sleep.  </P> <P> The woman once cooked lunch for her husband when he was sick and later found  the empty dishes with money in a corridor at home. "I don't need your sympathy.  I bought your service," he shouted from behind the door.  </P> <P> Harumi, 38, has become a successful Tokyo business consultant after divorce  left her with a 3-year-old son and just $12,500 10 years ago.  </P> <P> "I usually don't feel discrimination," Harumi said. "But people are very  jealous because I don't fit the image of a divorced woman struggling to  survive. Even my colleagues tell dirty jokes about me when they're drunk."  </P> <P> While the annual number of Japanese divorces has fluctuated over the last  decade between 150,000 and a peak of 179,150 in 1983, divorces among people  over 50 have doubled in that time and now make up 6% of the total.  </P> <P> "It is common these days for women to demand a divorce from their retired  husbands," said Toshihiko Hara, a sociologist at Tokai University. "They can't  cope with their husbands sitting around at home the whole day."  </P> <P> "That's the tragic generation," said Madoka. "They made a large sacrifice for  Japan's economic miracle (after World War II), with men at the firm and women  at home. Now, men are retiring to find they have also sacrificed their family."  </P></p>

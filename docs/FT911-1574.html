			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: The limits of intelligence Sir, I am always surprised when intelligent people like Richard Dawkins give evidence ('An evolving certainty that God cannot exist', April 27) that they do not accept the fact that human intelligence, however formidable, is finite. Using the type of analytical intelligence he does he will never be able to understand that, when one refers to a belief or non-belief in God, one is trying to conceptualise the infinite, which of course is impossible. To suggest, as he does, that if physics cannot prove the existence of God, there can be no God, demonstrates the awesome dangers this world would be in if we were to entrust our future to intellectuals who are unable to understand the limitations of their intelligence. The Chinese, more wisely, ascribe all understandable human concepts and the like as being yin or yang, which demonstrates the duality of nature. The unity, or one, is God and beyond the reach of our intelligence, only in reach of our belief. I know this won't do for Richard Dawkins' intelligence, but that must be his limitation.
